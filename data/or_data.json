        "meta_abstract": "Substantial resources are being devoted to identify candidate genes for complex mental and behavioral disorders by including environmental exposures, following the report of an interaction between the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and stressful life events that increases the risk of major depression. This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis of the interaction between the serotonin transporter gene and stressful life events on depression, utilizing both published data and individual-level original data. A search of PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases through March 2009 yielded 26 studies, of which 14 met the criteria for the meta-analysis. The selection criteria included studies that provided published data on the association between the 5-HTTLPR genotype (SS, SL, or LL), the number of stressful life events (0, 1, 2, ≥3), and a categorical measure of depression defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), or used a cut point to define depression from standardized rating scales. To maximize the ability to use a common framework for variable definition, original data were also requested from all studies published before 2008 that met the inclusion criteria. Of the 14 studies in the meta-analysis, 10 were included in a second sex-specific meta-analysis of original individual-level data. Logistic regression was employed to estimate the effects of the number of short alleles at 5-HTTLPR, the number of stressful life events, and their interaction on depression. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each study, with weighted averages obtained using random-effects meta-analysis for both sex-combined and sex-specific analyses. Among the 14,250 participants, 1,769 were classified as having depression, while 12,481 were not. The meta-analysis of published data revealed that the number of stressful life events significantly associated with depression (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.25-1.57). However, no association was found between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and depression in any individual study or in the weighted average (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.98-1.13), nor was there an interaction effect between genotype and stressful life events on depression (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.94-1.10). Comparable results were noted in the sex-specific meta-analysis of individual-level data. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides no evidence that the serotonin transporter genotype, either alone or in interaction with stressful life events, is associated with an elevated risk of depression in men, women, or both sexes combined.",

The goal of the study was to determine the association between chest compression-only CPR and survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods—Studies published until August 2010 were systematically searched and identified in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. For the primary meta-analysis, only clinical trials were included that prospectively randomized dispatcher instructions to chest compression-only versus standard bystander CPR in out-of-hospital adult cardiac arrest patients; for the secondary meta-analysis, observational cohort studies were included that distinguished between standard CPR and chest compression-only CPR. All studies were required to contain survival data. Data on study characteristics, methods, and outcomes (return of spontaneous circulation, survival to discharge, 30-day survival, and favorable neurologic outcome) were extracted. A fixed-effects model was used for both meta-analyses for lack of heterogeneity among the studies (I² 0%). Findings—All three published randomized clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analyses show that dispatcher-assisted chest compression-only bystander CPR for adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was associated with a 22% improved chance of survival (risk ratio [RR] 1.22 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.01 – 1.47]; I², 0%) compared to standard CPR. The absolute increase in survival was 2.4%; the number needed to treat was 41. The secondary meta-analysis included seven observational studies of bystander CPR (not dispatcher-assisted) and showed no difference between the two CPR techniques (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.83 – 1.11]; I², 0%).",

This study aimed to assess the effect of episodic physical and sexual activity on such events using data from case-crossover studies. Data sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE (through February 2, 2011) and Web of Science (through October 6, 2010). The study selection focused on case-crossover studies examining the association between episodic physical or sexual activity and outcomes like myocardial infarction (MI) or sudden cardiac death (SCD). Two reviewers extracted descriptive and quantitative information from each study, calculating summary relative risks (RRs) using random-effects meta-analysis and absolute event rates based on U.S. data on MI and SCD incidence. The Fisher P value synthesis method was employed to test if habitual physical activity levels modify the triggering effect, while meta-regression quantified the interaction between habitual levels of physical activity and the triggering effect. The analysis identified 10 studies on episodic physical activity, 3 on sexual activity, and 1 covering both exposures. Results showed that episodic physical activity significantly increased the risk of MI (RR=3.45; 95% CI, 2.33-5.13) and SCD (RR=4.98; 95% CI, 1.47-16.91). Sexual activity also increased the risk of MI (RR=2.70; 95% CI, 1.48-4.91). However, the absolute risk increase associated with an additional hour of physical or sexual activity per week was estimated at 2 to 3 per 10,000 person-years for MI and 1 per 10,000 person-years for SCD, indicating that the effect is transient due to the infrequent nature of these activities. Habitual activity levels significantly influenced the association between episodic physical activity and both MI (P<.001) and SCD (P<.001), as well as between sexual activity and MI (P=.04), with individuals having lower habitual activity levels showing a higher RR for triggering effects. Specifically, for each additional instance of habitual physical activity per week, the RR for MI decreased by approximately 45%, and for SCD, it decreased by 30%. In conclusion, acute cardiac events are significantly associated with episodic physical and sexual activity, but this association is diminished among individuals with high levels of habitual physical activity.",

It finds that both types of activity significantly increase the risk of these events, particularly in individuals with lower habitual physical activity levels. However, the overall risk associated with additional episodes of these activities is relatively low, indicating that the increased risk is transient. The study concludes that higher levels of habitual physical activity can mitigate the triggering effects of episodic activities on acute cardiac events."

However, a systematic and quantitative assessment of published studies has been lacking. This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis of all prospective cohort studies to determine the association between TV viewing and the risk of type 2 diabetes, fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Relevant studies were identified through searches of the MEDLINE database from 1970 to March 2011 and the EMBASE database from 1974 to March 2011, along with a review of reference lists from retrieved articles. Included were cohort studies that reported relative risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of interest. Data extraction was conducted independently by each author, and summary estimates of association were obtained using a random-effects model. The analysis included 8 studies: 4 reported results on type 2 diabetes (involving 175,938 individuals with 6,428 incident cases during 1.1 million person-years of follow-up), 4 reported on fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular disease (34,253 individuals with 1,052 incident cases), and 3 reported on all-cause mortality (26,509 individuals with 1,879 deaths during 202,353 person-years of follow-up). The pooled relative risks per 2 hours of TV viewing per day were 1.20 (95% CI, 1.14-1.27) for type 2 diabetes, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.06-1.23) for fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular disease, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.07-1.18) for all-cause mortality. The associations between TV viewing time and the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease were linear, while the risk of all-cause mortality increased with TV viewing durations exceeding 3 hours per day. Estimated absolute risk differences per every 2 hours of TV viewing per day were 176 cases of type 2 diabetes per 100,000 individuals per year, 38 cases of fatal cardiovascular disease per 100,000 individuals per year, and 104 deaths from all-cause mortality per 100,000 individuals per year. In conclusion, prolonged TV viewing is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality.",

        "meta_abstract": "Several studies have suggested a link between depression and an increased risk of stroke, although results have been inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between depression and the risk of developing stroke in adults by examining prospective studies. Data sources included a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO databases up to May 2011, supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies from key articles and relevant reviews. The study selection focused on prospective cohort studies that reported risk estimates for stroke morbidity or mortality based on baseline or updated depression status, assessed through self-reported scales or clinician diagnoses. Two independent reviewers extracted data on depression status at baseline, stroke risk estimates, study quality, and methods for assessing depression and stroke. Hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled using fixed-effect or random-effects models as appropriate, and associations were tested across various subgroups based on participant and study characteristics. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and the Begg test. The search identified 28 prospective cohort studies involving 317,540 participants, which reported a total of 8,478 stroke cases (both morbidity and mortality) over follow-up periods ranging from 2 to 29 years. The pooled adjusted HRs indicated a significant association, with a HR of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.29–1.63; P-for-heterogeneity <0.001; random-effects model) for total stroke, 1.55 (95% CI, 1.25–1.93; P-for-heterogeneity = 0.31; fixed-effects model) for fatal stroke (from 8 studies), and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.11–1.40; P-for-heterogeneity = 0.34; fixed-effects model) for ischemic stroke (from 6 studies). The estimated absolute risk differences associated with depression were 106 cases for total stroke, 53 cases for ischemic stroke, and 22 cases for fatal stroke per 100,000 individuals per year. Notably, the increased risk of total stroke related to depression was consistent across most subgroups. In conclusion, depression is associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke morbidity and mortality.",

Overall, the study concludes that depression is linked to a higher likelihood of experiencing strokes."

        "meta_abstract": "Maternal and neonatal mortality rates remain high in many low- and middle-income countries, prompting various community-based interventions aimed at improving birth outcomes, which have shown heterogeneous effects on survival. This study assessed the effects of women's groups practicing participatory learning and action compared to usual care on birth outcomes in low-resource settings. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials conducted in Bangladesh, India, Malawi, and Nepal were undertaken to evaluate the impact of these women's groups on maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, and stillbirths, while also reviewing the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and its potential effects at scale in Countdown countries. Seven trials involving 119,428 births met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses indicated that exposure to women's groups was associated with a 37% reduction in maternal mortality (odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.32–0.94), a 23% reduction in neonatal mortality (0.77, 95% CI 0.65–0.90), and a 9% non-significant reduction in stillbirths (0.91, 95% CI 0.79–1.03), with high heterogeneity noted for maternal (I²=58.8%, p=0.024) and neonatal results (I²=64.7%, p=0.009). Meta-regression analyses found that the proportion of pregnant women in groups was linearly associated with reductions in both maternal (p=0.026) and neonatal mortality (p=0.011). A subgroup analysis of the four studies where at least 30% of pregnant women participated showed a 55% reduction in maternal mortality (0.45, 95% CI 0.17–0.73) and a 33% reduction in neonatal mortality (0.67, 95% CI 0.59–0.74). The intervention was deemed cost-effective by WHO standards, with the potential to save an estimated 283,000 newborns and 41,100 mothers annually if implemented in rural areas of 74 Countdown countries. In conclusion, with the participation of at least a third of pregnant women and adequate population coverage, women's groups practicing participatory learning and action represent a cost-effective strategy to enhance maternal and neonatal survival in low-resource settings. Funding for the study was provided by Wellcome Trust, Ammalife, and the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for Birmingham and the Black Country programme.",

        "meta_abstract": "The relationship between red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategies and healthcare-associated infections remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether RBC transfusion thresholds affect the risk of infection and whether this risk is independent of leukocyte reduction. A systematic search was conducted in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry through January 22, 2014. The review focused on randomized clinical trials comparing restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategies. A total of twenty randomized trials involving 8,598 patients met the eligibility criteria, with 17 trials (n = 7,456 patients) providing sufficient data for meta-analyses. Pooled risk ratios were calculated using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models, and absolute risks of infection were estimated through the profile likelihood random-effects method. The primary outcomes included the incidence of healthcare-associated infections such as pneumonia, mediastinitis, wound infections, and sepsis. The pooled risk of all serious infections was found to be 10.6% (95% CI, 5.6%-15.9%) in the restrictive group and 12.7% (95% CI, 7.0%-18.7%) in the liberal group. The risk ratio (RR) for the association between transfusion strategies and the risk of serious infections was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.82-1.04), indicating little heterogeneity (I² = 6.3%; τ² = .0041). Additionally, the RR for serious infections was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96; I² = 0%, τ² < .0001). The number needed to treat (NNT) with restrictive strategies to prevent serious infection was 48 (95% CI, 36-71). Notably, the risk of infection remained lower with restrictive strategies, even with leukocyte reduction (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-0.99]). For trials with a restrictive hemoglobin threshold of <7.0 g/dL, the RR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72-1.02). Stratification by patient type showed that the RR for serious infection was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53-0.97) in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.28-0.95) in patients presenting with sepsis. There were no significant differences in the incidence of infection by RBC threshold for patients with cardiac disease, the critically ill, those with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or for infants with low birth weight. In conclusion, among hospitalized patients, a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy compared with a liberal transfusion strategy was not associated with a reduced risk of healthcare-associated infection overall, although it was associated with a reduced risk of serious infection. Implementing restrictive strategies may have the potential to lower the incidence of serious healthcare-associated infections.",

        "meta_abstract": "Background—Thirty-five percent of pancreatic cancer patients have unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) at diagnosis. Several studies have evaluated systemic chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX for patients with LAPC. We report a patient-level meta-analysis of LAPC patients treated with FOLFIRINOX as first-line treatment. Methods—A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline (ovidSP), Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed Publisher, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. Studies evaluating FOLFIRINOX as first-line treatment for LAPC were included. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and grade 3 or 4 adverse events. We collected patient-level data from all studies that reported survival outcomes. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival outcomes. Grade 3 or 4 adverse event rates and the percentage of subsequent (chemo)radiation or resection in eligible studies were pooled in a random effects model. Findings—Thirteen eligible studies representing 689 patients were included, of whom 355 had LAPC. Eleven studies, representing 315 LAPC patients, reported survival outcomes and were eligible for patient-level meta-analysis. The median OS ranged from 10.0 to 32.7 months across studies, with a patient-level median OS of 24.2 months [95% CI: 21.6 - 26.8 months]. The median PFS ranged from 3.0 to 20.4 months across studies, with a patient-level median PFS of 15.0 months [95% CI: 13.8 – 16.2 months]. In 10 studies representing 490 patients, 296 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported (i.e., 60.4 events per 100 patients). No deaths were attributed to FOLFIRINOX toxicity. Subsequent treatments included (chemo)radiation (63.5%) and surgical resection (25.9%). Interpretation—Patients with LAPC treated with FOLFIRINOX had a median OS of 24.2 months that is far superior to previously reported OS with gemcitabine. Future research should evaluate these promising results in a randomized controlled trial and determine which patients might benefit from (chemo)radiation or a resection after FOLFIRINOX.",

        "meta_abstract": "The relationship between red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategies and healthcare-associated infections remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether RBC transfusion thresholds affect the risk of infection and whether this risk is independent of leukocyte reduction. A systematic search was conducted in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry through January 22, 2014. The review focused on randomized clinical trials comparing restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategies. A total of twenty randomized trials involving 8,598 patients met the eligibility criteria, with 17 trials (n = 7,456 patients) providing sufficient data for meta-analyses. Pooled risk ratios were calculated using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models, and absolute risks of infection were estimated through the profile likelihood random-effects method. The primary outcomes included the incidence of healthcare-associated infections such as pneumonia, mediastinitis, wound infections, and sepsis. The pooled risk of all serious infections was found to be 10.6% (95% CI, 5.6%-15.9%) in the restrictive group and 12.7% (95% CI, 7.0%-18.7%) in the liberal group. The risk ratio (RR) for the association between transfusion strategies and the risk of serious infections was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.82-1.04), indicating little heterogeneity (I² = 6.3%; τ² = .0041). Additionally, the RR for serious infections was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96; I² = 0%, τ² < .0001). The number needed to treat (NNT) with restrictive strategies to prevent serious infection was 48 (95% CI, 36-71). Notably, the risk of infection remained lower with restrictive strategies, even with leukocyte reduction (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-0.99]). For trials with a restrictive hemoglobin threshold of <7.0 g/dL, the RR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72-1.02). Stratification by patient type showed that the RR for serious infection was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53-0.97) in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.28-0.95) in patients presenting with sepsis. There were no significant differences in the incidence of infection by RBC threshold for patients with cardiac disease, the critically ill, those with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or for infants with low birth weight. In conclusion, among hospitalized patients, a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy compared with a liberal transfusion strategy was not associated with a reduced risk of healthcare-associated infection overall, although it was associated with a reduced risk of serious infection. Implementing restrictive strategies may have the potential to lower the incidence of serious healthcare-associated infections. Sleep apnea, both obstructive and central, is linked to adverse cardiovascular risk factors and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, whether delivered continuously (CPAP) or through adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV), provides symptomatic relief, but its associations with cardiovascular outcomes and mortality remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the relationship between PAP therapy and cardiovascular events or death in patients with sleep apnea. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from inception to March 2017, targeting randomized clinical trials that reported major adverse cardiovascular events or deaths. Two authors independently extracted data using standardized forms. Summary relative risks (RRs), risk differences (RDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. The primary outcomes included a composite of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) events, stroke, or vascular death (major adverse cardiovascular events); cause-specific vascular events; and overall mortality. The analysis included data from 10 trials (9 using CPAP; 1 using ASV) involving 7,266 patients with sleep apnea (mean age 60.9 years; 80.5% men; mean body mass index 30.0). Among the recorded events, there were 356 major adverse cardiovascular events and 613 deaths. The results showed no significant association between PAP therapy and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.13; P = .19; RD, −0.01; 95% CI, −0.03 to 0.01; P = .23), cardiovascular death (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.50; P = .30; RD, −0.00; 95% CI, −0.02 to 0.02; P = .87), or all-cause death (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.29; P = .08; RD, 0.00; 95% CI, −0.01 to 0.01; P = .51). Similar findings were observed for ACS, stroke, and heart failure. There were no differences in outcomes between CPAP and ASV (all P values for homogeneity > .24), and meta-regressions found no associations of PAP with outcomes based on apnea severity, follow-up duration, or adherence to PAP (all P values > .13). The use of PAP therapy, compared to no treatment or sham, was not associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular outcomes or mortality in patients with sleep apnea. While PAP has other benefits for managing sleep apnea, these findings do not support its use for the prevention of cardiovascular events or death.",

It found that while a restrictive strategy did not significantly reduce the overall risk of infection, it was associated with a lower risk of serious infections. Additionally, the analysis indicated that the risk of infection remained lower with restrictive strategies even when leukocyte reduction was applied. The study also explored the relationship between positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy for sleep apnea and cardiovascular outcomes, concluding that PAP therapy was not associated with a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events or mortality. Overall, the findings suggest that while restrictive transfusion strategies may help lower serious infection rates, PAP therapy does not prevent cardiovascular events or death in patients with sleep apnea."

        "meta_abstract": "Summary: Background: Inclusion health focuses on individuals suffering from extreme health issues due to poverty, marginalization, and multimorbidity. This review examines morbidity and mortality data for four overlapping populations experiencing significant social exclusion: homeless individuals, those with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned persons. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between January 1, 2005, and October 1, 2015. We included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, interventional studies, and observational studies that reported morbidity and mortality outcomes, published in English, from high-income countries, and involving populations with histories of homelessness, imprisonment, sex work, or substance use disorders (excluding cannabis and alcohol). Perinatal studies and those focused on specific health conditions from intensive care units were excluded. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data. Primary outcomes included morbidity measures (prevalence or incidence) and mortality (standardized mortality ratios [SMRs] and mortality rates), with summary estimates calculated using a random effects model. Findings: Our search identified 7,946 articles, of which 337 studies were included in the analysis. All-cause standardized mortality ratios were significantly elevated in 91 of 92 extracted data points, with SMRs of 11.86 (95% CI 10.42–13.30; I²=94.1%) for women and 7.88 (95% CI 7.03–8.74; I²=99.1%) for men. The highest SMR estimates for disease categories with multiple data points were for deaths due to injury, poisoning, and other external causes, with men at 7.89 (95% CI 6.40–9.37; I²=98.1%) and women at 18.72 (95% CI 13.73–23.71; I²=91.5%). Disease prevalence was notably high in several categories: infections (e.g., 90% for hepatitis C, 67% for hepatitis B, and 51% for latent tuberculosis), mental health (e.g., 4% for schizophrenia), cardiovascular conditions (e.g., 13% for coronary heart disease), and respiratory conditions (e.g., 26% for asthma). Interpretation: This study highlights that marginalized groups, including homeless individuals, those with substance use disorders, sex workers, and prisoners, face severe health inequalities across various conditions, with a more pronounced impact on women. The high variability in study findings suggests a need for improved data collection among these populations. Addressing the extreme health inequities identified requires comprehensive cross-sectoral policy and service interventions to better health outcomes for these marginalized individuals. Funding: The study was funded by the Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research, NHS England, NHS Research Scotland Scottish Senior Clinical Fellowship, Medical Research Council, Chief Scientist Office, and the Central and North West London NHS Trust.",

        "meta_abstract": "IMPORTANCE The increased social and economic burdens for osteoporosis-related fractures worldwide make the prevention of such injuries a major public health goal. Previous studies have reached mixed conclusions regarding the association between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and fracture incidence in older adults. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements are associated with a lower fracture incidence in community-dwelling older adults. DATA SOURCES The PubMed, Cochrane library, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to December 24, 2016, using the keywords calcium, vitamin D, and fracture to identify systematic reviews or meta-analyses. The primary randomized clinical trials included in systematic reviews or meta-analyses were identified, and an additional search for recently published randomized trials was performed from July 16, 2012, to July 16, 2017. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials comparing calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements with a placebo or no treatment for fracture incidence in community-dwelling adults older than 50 years. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers performed the data extraction and assessed study quality. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate risk ratios (RRs), absolute risk differences (ARDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hip fracture was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were nonvertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, and total fracture. RESULTS A total of 33 randomized trials involving 51,145 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant association of calcium or vitamin D with risk of hip fracture compared with placebo or no treatment (calcium: RR, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.97 to 2.42]; ARD, 0.01 [95% CI, 0.00 to 0.01]; vitamin D: RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.47]; ARD, 0.00 [95% CI, −0.00 to 0.01]). There was no significant association of combined calcium and vitamin D with hip fracture compared with placebo or no treatment (RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.39]; ARD, 0.00 [95% CI, −0.00 to 0.00]). No significant associations were found between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and the incidence of nonvertebral, vertebral, or total fractures. Subgroup analyses showed that these results were generally consistent regardless of the calcium or vitamin D dose, sex, fracture history, dietary calcium intake, and baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, the use of supplements that included calcium, vitamin D, or both compared with placebo or no treatment was not associated with a lower risk of fractures among community-dwelling older adults. These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements in community-dwelling older people.",

Our aim was to evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assess the effects of using wearable biosensors (e.g., activity trackers) for remote patient monitoring on clinical outcomes. We expanded upon prior reviews by assessing effectiveness across indications and presenting quantitative summary data. We searched for articles from January 2000 to October 2016 in PubMed, reviewed 4,348 titles, selected 777 for abstract review, and 64 for full text review. A total of 27 RCTs from 13 different countries focused on a range of clinical outcomes and were retained for final analysis; of these, we identified 16 high-quality studies. We estimated a difference-in-differences random effects meta-analysis on select outcomes. We weighted the studies by sample size and used 95% confidence intervals (CI) around point estimates. Difference-in-difference point estimation revealed no statistically significant impact of remote patient monitoring on any of six reported clinical outcomes, including body mass index (−0.73; 95% CI: −1.84, 0.38), weight (−1.29; −3.06, 0.48), waist circumference (−2.41; −5.16, 0.34), body fat percentage (0.11; −1.56, 1.34), systolic blood pressure (−2.62; −5.31, 0.06), and diastolic blood pressure (−0.99; −2.73, 0.74). Studies were highly heterogeneous in their design, device type, and outcomes. Interventions based on health behavior models and personalized coaching were most successful. We found substantial gaps in the evidence base that should be considered before implementation of remote patient monitoring in the clinical setting.",

Despite the growing interest in this technology, the studies reviewed showed high variability in design and outcomes, and the evidence base is limited. Interventions that incorporated health behavior models and personalized coaching were noted to be more successful. The findings suggest caution in implementing remote patient monitoring in clinical settings due to the identified gaps in evidence."

        "meta_abstract": "While smartphone usage is ubiquitous and the app market for mental health is growing rapidly, the evidence of standalone apps for treating mental health symptoms remains unclear. This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of standalone smartphone apps for mental health. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in February 2018 on randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of standalone apps for mental health in adults with heightened symptom severity, compared to a control group. A random-effects model was employed, and when insufficient comparisons were available, data was presented in a narrative synthesis. Outcomes included assessments of mental health disorder symptom severity specifically targeted by the app. In total, 5,945 records were identified, and 165 full-text articles were screened for inclusion by two independent researchers. Nineteen trials with 3,681 participants were included in the analysis: depression (k = 6), anxiety (k = 4), substance use (k = 5), self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (k = 4), PTSD (k = 2), and sleep problems (k = 2). Effects on depression (Hedges’ g = 0.33, 95% CI 0.10–0.57, P = 0.005, NNT = 5.43, I² = 59%) and on smoking behavior (g = 0.39, 95% CI 0.21–0.57, NNT = 4.59, P ≤ 0.001, I² = 0%) were significant. No significant pooled effects were found for anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-injury, or alcohol use (g = −0.14 to 0.18). Effect sizes for single trials ranged from g = −0.05 to 0.14 for PTSD and g = 0.72 to 0.84 for insomnia. Although some trials showed the potential of apps targeting mental health symptoms, using smartphone apps as standalone psychological interventions cannot be recommended based on the current level of evidence.",

        "meta_abstract": "Standard inactivated influenza vaccines are poorly immunogenic in immunologically naive healthy young children, who are particularly vulnerable to complications from influenza, creating an unmet need for better influenza vaccines. Oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted influenza vaccines are promising candidates, but clinical trials have yielded inconsistent results. In this meta-analysis, we examined randomized controlled trials with efficacy data (3 trials, n = 15,310) and immunogenicity data (17 trials, n = 9,062). Compared with non-adjuvanted counterparts, adjuvanted influenza vaccines provide significantly better protection, with a weighted estimate for the risk ratio of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza at 0.26, and are significantly more immunogenic, with weighted estimates for seroprotection rate ratios ranging from 4.6 to 7.9, in healthy immunologically naive young children. However, in immunologically non-naive children, adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines provide similar protection and immunogenicity. These results indicate that oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant improves the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines in healthy young children receiving their first seasonal influenza vaccination.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical outcomes between patients receiving radial artery versus saphenous vein grafts for coronary artery bypass grafting after long-term follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This patient-level pooled analysis compared radial artery versus saphenous vein grafts in adult patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from five countries (Australia, Italy, Serbia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom), with enrollment from 1997 to 2009 and follow-up completed in 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to undergo either radial artery (n = 534) or saphenous vein (n = 502) grafts for coronary artery bypass grafting. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization, while the secondary outcome was a composite of death or myocardial infarction. RESULTS: A total of 1,036 patients were randomized (mean age, 66.6 years in the radial artery group vs 67.1 years in the saphenous vein group; 376 [70.4%] men in the radial artery group vs 351 [69.9%] in the saphenous vein group); 942 (90.9%) of the originally randomized patients completed 10 years of follow-up (510 in the radial artery group). At a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 10 (10-11) years, the use of the radial artery, compared with the saphenous vein, in coronary artery bypass grafting was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization (220 vs 237 total events; 41 vs 47 events per 1,000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.61-0.88]; P < .001) and of the composite of death or myocardial infarction (188 vs 193 total events; 35 vs 38 events per 1,000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.63-0.94]; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this individual participant data meta-analysis with a median follow-up of 10 years, among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, the use of the radial artery compared with the saphenous vein was associated with a lower risk of a composite of cardiovascular outcomes.",

        "meta_abstract": "IMPORTANCE The evidence for palliative care exists predominantly for patients with cancer. The effect of palliative care on important end-of-life outcomes in patients with noncancer illness is unclear. OBJECTIVE To measure the association between palliative care and acute health care use, quality of life (QOL), and symptom burden in adults with chronic noncancer illnesses. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and PubMed from inception to April 18, 2020. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of palliative care interventions in adults with chronic noncancer illness. Studies involving at least 50% of patients with cancer were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently screened, selected, and extracted data from studies. Narrative synthesis was conducted for all trials. All outcomes were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Acute health care use (hospitalizations and emergency department use), disease-generic and disease-specific quality of life (QOL), and symptoms, with estimates of QOL translated to units of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative Care scale (range, 0 [worst] to 184 [best]; minimal clinically important difference, 9 points) and symptoms translated to units of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale global distress score (range, 0 [best] to 90 [worst]; minimal clinically important difference, 5.7 points). RESULTS Twenty-eight trials provided data on 13,664 patients (mean age, 74 years; 46% were women). Ten trials were of heart failure (n = 4068 patients), 11 of mixed disease (n = 8119), 4 of dementia (n = 1036), and 3 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 441). Palliative care, compared with usual care, was statistically significantly associated with less emergency department use (9 trials [n = 2712]; 20% vs 24%; odds ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68-1.00]; I² = 3%), less hospitalization (14 trials [n = 3706]; 38% vs 42%; odds ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65-0.99]; I² = 41%), and modestly lower symptom burden (11 trials [n = 2598]; pooled standardized mean difference (SMD), −0.12; [95% CI, −0.20 to −0.03]; I² = 0%; Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale score mean difference, −1.6 [95% CI, −2.6 to −0.4]). Palliative care was not significantly associated with disease-generic QOL (6 trials [n = 1334]; SMD, 0.18 [95% CI, −0.24 to 0.61]; I² = 87%; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative Care score mean difference, 4.7 [95% CI, −6.3 to 15.9]) or disease-specific measures of QOL (11 trials [n = 2204]; SMD, 0.07 [95% CI, −0.09 to 0.23]; I² = 68%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of patients with primarily noncancer illness, palliative care, compared with usual care, was statistically significantly associated with less acute health care use and modestly lower symptom burden, but there was no significant difference in quality of life. Analyses for some outcomes were based predominantly on studies of patients with heart failure, which may limit generalizability to other chronic illnesses.",

It found that palliative care was associated with reduced emergency department visits and hospitalizations, as well as a modest decrease in symptom burden. However, there was no significant improvement in quality of life compared to usual care. The findings were primarily based on studies involving patients with heart failure, which may limit their applicability to other chronic conditions."

Despite this, limited evidence exists to substantiate claims that digital alerting can improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to appraise the evidence on the clinical outcomes of digital alerting systems in remote monitoring through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic literature search, with no language restrictions, was performed to identify studies evaluating healthcare outcomes of digital sensor alerting systems used in remote monitoring across all (medical and surgical) cohorts. The primary outcome was hospitalization; secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, emergency department, and outpatient visits. Standard, pooled hazard ratio and proportion of means meta-analyses were performed. A total of 33 studies met the eligibility criteria; of which, 23 allowed for a meta-analysis. A 9.6% mean decrease in hospitalization favoring digital alerting systems from a pooled random effects analysis was noted. However, pooled weighted mean differences and hazard ratios did not reproduce this finding. Digital alerting reduced hospital LOS by a mean difference of 1.043 days. A 3% mean decrease in all-cause mortality from digital alerting systems was noted. There was no benefit of digital alerting with respect to emergency department or outpatient visits. Digital alerts can considerably reduce hospitalization and length of stay for certain cohorts in remote monitoring. Further research is required to confirm these findings and trial different alerting protocols to understand optimal alerting to guide future widespread implementation.",

        "meta_abstract": "Meta-analyses have shown that digital mental health apps can be efficacious in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, real-world usage of apps is typically not sustained over time, and no studies systematically examine which features increase sustained engagement with apps or the relationship between engagement features and clinical efficacy. We conducted a systematic search of the literature to identify empirical studies that (1) investigate standalone apps for depression and/or anxiety in symptomatic participants and (2) report at least one measure of engagement. Features intended to increase engagement were categorized using the persuasive system design (PSD) framework and principles of behavioral economics. Twenty-five studies with 4,159 participants were included in the analysis. PSD features were commonly used, whereas behavioral economics techniques were not. Smartphone apps were efficacious in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in randomized controlled trials, with overall small-to-medium effects (g = 0.2888, SE = 0.0999, z(15) = 2.89, p = 0.0119, Q(df = 14) = 41.93, p < 0.0001, I² = 66.6%), and apps that employed a greater number of engagement features compared to the control condition had larger effect sizes (β = 0.0450, SE = 0.0164, t(15) = 2.7344, p = 0.0161). We observed an unexpected negative association between PSD features and engagement, as measured by completion rate (β = −0.0293, SE = 0.0121, t(17) = 2.4142, p = 0.0281). Overall, PSD features show promise for augmenting app efficacy, though engagement, as reflected in study completion, may not be the primary factor driving this association. The results suggest that expanding the use of PSD features in mental health apps may increase clinical benefits and that other techniques, such as those informed by behavioral economics, are employed infrequently.",

The study identifies features that may enhance sustained engagement, categorizing them using the persuasive system design (PSD) framework and behavioral economics principles. It finds that while PSD features are commonly used and can improve clinical outcomes, they may not necessarily lead to higher engagement rates, suggesting that other engagement techniques are underutilized. Overall, the findings indicate that increasing the use of PSD features in mental health apps could enhance their clinical effectiveness."

        "meta_abstract": "Background The number of individuals with vision impairment worldwide is increasing because of an ageing population. We aimed to systematically identify studies describing the association between vision impairment and mortality, and to assess the association between vision impairment and all-cause mortality. Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, and Global Health database on Feb 1, 2020, for studies published in English between database inception and Feb 1, 2020. We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that measured the association between vision impairment and all-cause mortality in people aged 40 years or older who were followed up for 1 year or more. In a protocol amendment, we also included randomized controlled trials that met the same criteria as for cohort studies, in which the association between visual impairment and mortality was independent of the study intervention. Studies that did not report age-adjusted mortality data, or that focused only on populations with specific health conditions were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We graded the overall certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. We did a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled maximally adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality for individuals with a visual acuity of <6/12 versus those with ≥6/12; <6/18 versus those with ≥6/18; <6/60 versus those with ≥6/18; and <6/60 versus those with ≥6/60. Findings Our searches identified 3845 articles, of which 28 studies, representing 30 cohorts (446088 participants) from 12 countries, were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 17 studies, representing 18 cohorts (47998 participants). There was variability in the methods used to assess and report vision impairment. Pooled HRs for all-cause mortality were 1·29 (95% CI 1·20–1·39) for visual acuity <6/12 versus ≥6/12, with low heterogeneity between studies (n=15; τ²=0·01, I²=31·46%); 1·43 (1·22–1·68) for visual acuity <6/18 versus ≥6/18, with low heterogeneity between studies (n=2; τ²=0·0, I²=0·0%); 1·89 (1·45–2·47) for visual acuity <6/60 versus ≥6/18 (n=1); and 1·02 (0·79–1·32) for visual acuity <6/60 versus ≥6/60 (n=2; τ²=0·02, I²=25·04%). Three studies received an assessment of low risk of bias across all six domains, and six studies had a high risk of bias in one or more domains. Effect sizes were greater for studies that used best-corrected visual acuity compared with those that used presenting visual acuity as the vision assessment method (p=0·0055), but the effect sizes did not vary in terms of risk of bias, study design, or participant-level factors (ie, age). We judged the evidence to be of moderate certainty. Interpretation The hazard for all-cause mortality was higher in people with vision impairment compared with those that had normal vision or mild vision impairment, and the magnitude of this effect increased with more severe vision impairment. These findings have implications for promoting healthy longevity and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

        "meta_abstract": "Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health-care systems and potentially on pregnancy outcomes, but no systematic synthesis of evidence of this effect has been undertaken. We aimed to assess the collective evidence on the effects on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of the pandemic. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effects of the pandemic on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, from Jan 1, 2020, to Jan 8, 2021, for case-control studies, cohort studies, and brief reports comparing maternal and perinatal mortality, maternal morbidity, pregnancy complications, and intrapartum and neonatal outcomes before and during the pandemic. We excluded studies of solely SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant individuals, case reports, studies without comparison groups, narrative or systematic literature reviews, preprints, and studies reporting on overlapping populations. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed for outcomes when more than one study presented relevant data. Random-effects estimates of the pooled odds ratio (OR) of each outcome were generated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020211753). Findings The search identified 3592 citations, of which 40 studies were included. We identified significant increases in stillbirth (pooled OR 1·28 [95% CI 1·07–1·54]; I²=63%; 12 studies, 168,295 pregnancies during and 198,993 before the pandemic) and maternal death (1·37 [1·22–1·53]; I²=0%, two studies [both from low-income and middle-income countries], 1,237,018 and 2,224,859 pregnancies) during versus before the pandemic. Preterm births before 37 weeks’ gestation were not significantly changed overall (0·94 [0·87–1·02]; I²=75%; 15 studies, 170,640 and 656,423 pregnancies) but were decreased in high-income countries (0·91 [0·84–0·99]; I²=63%; 12 studies, 159,987 and 635,118 pregnancies), where spontaneous preterm birth was also decreased (0·81 [0·67–0·97]; two studies, 4204 and 6818 pregnancies). Mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were higher, indicating poorer mental health during versus before the pandemic (pooled mean difference 0·42 [95% CI 0·02–0·81]; three studies, 2330 and 6517 pregnancies). Surgically managed ectopic pregnancies were increased during the pandemic (OR 5·81 [2·16–15·6]; I²=26%; three studies, 37 and 272 pregnancies). No overall significant effects were identified for other outcomes included in the quantitative analysis: maternal gestational diabetes; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; preterm birth before 34 weeks’, 32 weeks’, or 28 weeks’ gestation; iatrogenic preterm birth; labour induction; modes of delivery (spontaneous vaginal delivery, caesarean section, or instrumental delivery); postpartum hemorrhage; neonatal death; low birthweight (<2500 g); neonatal intensive care unit admission; or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 min. Interpretation Global maternal and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in maternal deaths, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression. Some outcomes show considerable disparity between high-resource and low-resource settings. There is an urgent need to prioritize safe, accessible, and equitable maternity care within the strategic response to this pandemic and in future health crises.",

It found significant increases in stillbirths and maternal deaths during the pandemic, along with a rise in surgically managed ectopic pregnancies and poorer mental health among mothers. While some outcomes, such as preterm births, showed no overall significant change, disparities were noted between high-income and low-income countries. The findings highlight the need for improved maternity care and support during the pandemic and future health crises."

        "meta_abstract": "IMPORTANCE Oxygen supplementation is a cornerstone treatment in pediatric critical care. Accumulating evidence suggests that overzealous use of oxygen, leading to hyperoxia, is associated with worse outcomes compared to patients with normoxia. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the association of arterial hyperoxia with clinical outcomes in critically ill children among studies using varied definitions of hyperoxia. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to February 1, 2021, was conducted. STUDY SELECTION Clinical trials or observational studies of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit that examined hyperoxia, by any definition, and described at least one outcome of interest were included. No language restrictions were applied. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for study quality assessment were used. The review process was performed independently by two reviewers, and data were pooled with a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, converted to mortality at the longest follow-up due to insufficient studies reporting the initial primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, ventilator-related outcomes, extracorporeal organ support, and functional performance. RESULTS In this systematic review, 16 studies (27,555 patients) were included. All, except one randomized clinical pilot trial, were observational cohort studies. Study populations included post–cardiac arrest (n = 6), traumatic brain injury (n = 1), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 2), and general critical care (n = 7). Definitions and assessment of hyperoxia differed among included studies, with partial pressure of arterial oxygen most frequently used to define hyperoxia, mainly by categorical cutoff. In total, 11 studies (23,204 patients) were pooled for meta-analysis. Hyperoxia, by any definition, showed an odds ratio of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.00-2.51; after Hartung-Knapp adjustment, 95% CI, 1.05-2.38) for mortality with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I² = 92%). This association was also found in less heterogeneous subsets. A signal of harm was observed at higher thresholds of arterial oxygen levels when grouped by definition of hyperoxia. Secondary outcomes were inadequate for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that, despite methodologic limitations of the studies, hyperoxia is associated with mortality in critically ill children. This finding highlights the need for further prospective observational studies and underscores the importance of addressing the clinical implications of hyperoxia in critically ill children.",

        "meta_abstract": "IMPORTANCE Adverse events (AEs) after placebo treatment are common in randomized clinical drug trials. Systematic evidence regarding these nocebo responses in vaccine trials is important for COVID-19 vaccination worldwide, especially because concern about AEs is reported to be a reason for vaccination hesitancy. OBJECTIVE To compare the frequencies of AEs reported in the placebo groups of COVID-19 vaccine trials with those reported in the vaccine groups. DATA SOURCES For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the Medline (PubMed) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases were searched systematically using medical subheading terms and free-text keywords for trials of COVID-19 vaccines published up to July 14, 2021. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines that investigated adults aged 16 years or older were selected if they assessed solicited AEs within 7 days of injection, included an inert placebo arm, and provided AE reports for both the vaccine and placebo groups separately. Full texts were reviewed for eligibility by 2 independent reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline and using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Meta-analyses were based on random-effects models. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the proportions of placebo recipients reporting overall, systemic, and local (injection-site) AEs as well as logarithmic odds ratios (ORs) to evaluate group differences. Outcomes were tested for significance using z tests with 95% CIs. RESULTS Twelve articles with AE reports for 45,380 participants (22,578 placebo recipients and 22,802 vaccine recipients) were analyzed. After the first dose, 35.2% (95% CI, 26.7%-43.7%) of placebo recipients experienced systemic AEs, with headache (19.3%; 95% CI, 13.6%-25.1%) and fatigue (16.7%; 95% CI, 9.8%-23.6%) being most common. After the second dose, 31.8% (95% CI, 28.7%-35.0%) of placebo recipients reported systemic AEs. The ratio between placebo and vaccine arms showed that nocebo responses accounted for 76.0% of systemic AEs after the first COVID-19 vaccine dose and for 51.8% after the second dose. Significantly more vaccine recipients reported AEs, but the group difference for systemic AEs was small after the first dose (OR, −0.47; 95% CI, −0.54 to −0.40; P < .001; standardized mean difference, −0.26; 95% CI, −0.30 to −0.22) and large after the second dose (OR, −1.36; 95% CI, −1.86 to −0.86; P < .001; standardized mean difference, −0.75; 95% CI, −1.03 to −0.47). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis, significantly more AEs were reported in vaccine groups compared with placebo groups, but the rates of reported AEs in the placebo arms were still substantial. Public vaccination programs should consider these high rates of AEs in placebo arms.",

It found that CCT programs were associated with significant improvements in several cognitive domains, including abstraction, attention, memory, motor skills, and information processing, as well as daily functioning. However, no significant improvements were observed in sensory, perceptual, verbal, and language skills. The study highlights the potential of CCT as a beneficial intervention for enhancing cognitive function in this population, while emphasizing the need for further research to optimize training programs and facilitate their implementation in clinical settings."

        "meta_abstract": "Health promotion interventions offer great potential in advocating a healthy lifestyle and the prevention of diseases. Some barriers to communicating health promotion to people of certain cultural groups might be overcome via the internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMI for health promotion interventions among culturally diverse populations. We systematically searched on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EbscoHost/MEDLINE, Ovid/Embase, EbscoHost/PsychINFO, and Web of Science databases in October 2020. Out of 9438 records, 13 randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating culturally adapted health promotion IMI addressing healthy eating, physical activity, alcohol consumption, sexual health behavior, and smoking cessation included. From the included studies 10,747 participants were eligible. Culturally adapted IMI proved to be non-superior over active control conditions in short (g =0.10, [95% CI −0.19 to 0.40]) and long-term (g=0.20, [95% CI −0.11 to 0.51]) in promoting health behavior. However, culturally adapted IMI for physical activity (k = 3, N =296) compared to active controls yielded a beneficial effect in long-term (g =0.48, [95% CI 0.25 to 0.71]). Adapting health promotion IMI to the cultural context of different cultural populations seems not yet to be recommendable given the substantial adaption efforts necessary and the mostly non-significant findings. However, these findings need to be seen as preliminary given the limited number of included trials with varying methodological rigor and the partly substantial between-trial heterogeneity pointing in the direction of potentially useful culturally adapted IMI which now need to be disentangled from the less promising approaches.",

        "summerize_abstract": "The meta-analysis compares the risk of neurologic adverse events (NAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to that of chemotherapy and placebo in randomized clinical trials. It finds that the overall risk of NAEs is lower with ICIs compared to chemotherapy, but higher when compared to placebo. Specific adverse events such as peripheral neuropathy and dysgeusia are less common with ICIs, while headaches are more frequent. Overall, the findings suggest that while ICIs may reduce certain neurologic risks compared to chemotherapy, they may increase the risk of NAEs compared to placebo."

        "meta_abstract": "Background Estimates of the effectiveness of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions that provide high levels of service on childhood diarrhoea are scarce. We aimed to provide up-to-date estimates on the burden of disease attributable to WASH and on the effects of different types of WASH interventions on childhood diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated previous reviews following their search strategy by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and BIOSIS Citation Index for studies of basic WASH interventions and of WASH interventions providing a high level of service, published between Jan 1, 2016, and May 25, 2021. We included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials conducted at household or community level that matched exposure categories of the so-called service ladder approach of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for WASH. Two reviewers independently extracted study-level data and assessed risk of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and certainty of evidence using a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We analysed extracted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs using random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42016043164. Findings 21 290 records were identified from the search, of which 124 studies were included, providing 83 water (62 616 children), 20 sanitation (40 799 children), and 41 hygiene (98 416 children) comparisons. Compared with untreated water from an unimproved source, risk of diarrhoea was reduced by up to 50% with water treated at point of use (POU): filtration (n=23 studies; RR 0·50 [95% CI 0·41–0·60]), solar treatment (n=13; 0·63 [0·50–0·80]), and chlorination (n=25; 0·66 [0·56–0·77]). Compared with an unimproved source, provision of an improved drinking water supply on premises with higher water quality reduced diarrhoea risk by 52% (n=2; 0·48 [0·26–0·87]). Overall, sanitation interventions reduced diarrhoea risk by 24% (0·76 [0·61–0·94]). Compared with unimproved sanitation, providing sewer connection reduced diarrhoea risk by 47% (n=5; 0·53 [0·30–0·93]). Promotion of handwashing with soap reduced diarrhoea risk by 30% (0·70 [0·64–0·76]). Interpretation WASH interventions reduced risk of diarrhoea in children in LMICs. Interventions supplying either water filtered at POU, higher water quality from an improved source on premises, or basic sanitation services with sewer connection were associated with increased reductions. Our results support higher service levels called for under SDG 6. Notably, no studies evaluated interventions that delivered access to safely managed WASH services, the level of service to which universal coverage by 2030 is committed under the SDG.

The findings indicate that while interventions such as animal therapy and technological solutions like videoconferencing show significant effects in long-term care settings, the overall quality of evidence is low, and the results should be interpreted cautiously due to high variability among studies. The analysis calls for future research to better understand the factors contributing to loneliness reduction in long-term care environments."

It finds no significant difference in all-cause mortality and death-censored graft failure between the two modalities. However, PD is associated with a lower risk of overall graft failure and delayed graft function. The study suggests that PD may be a preferred option for patients transitioning to kidney transplant, highlighting the need for further research on shared decision-making among healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers."

It found that these programs significantly decreased both the perpetration and experience of sexual violence compared to control conditions. Programs delivered in school settings and targeting older adolescents were particularly effective. However, the analysis highlighted concerns regarding the quality and risk of bias in several studies, indicating a need for further high-quality research in this area, as adolescent sexual violence prevention remains underexplored compared to other public health issues."

It finds that placebo significantly contributes to pain reduction in these trials, with higher placebo responses observed in studies with low risk of bias. Despite the strong media attention and dissemination associated with the trials, these factors did not correlate with clinical outcomes. The findings suggest that positive expectations influenced by media may shape placebo responses, potentially impacting clinical trial results, regulatory decisions, and patient access to cannabinoid treatments for pain relief."

        "meta_abstract": "Despite research into the development of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I), research into the outcomes of dCBT-I on insomnia and the associated clinical conditions of depression and anxiety have been limited. The PubMed, PsycINFO (Ovid), Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on adult patients with insomnia also having reported measures of depressive or anxiety symptoms. In total, 2504 articles were identified after duplicate removal, and 22 RCTs were included in the final meta-analysis. At the post-treatment assessment, the dCBT-I group had a small to moderate effect in alleviating depressive (standardized mean difference (SMD) = −0.42; 95% CI: −0.56, −0.28; p < 0.001; k =21) and anxiety symptoms (SMD=−0.29; 95% CI: −0.40, −0.19; p<0.001; k=18), but had a large effect on sleep outcome measures (SMD=−0.76; 95% CI: −0.95, −0.57; p<0.001; k=22). When considering treatment adherence, the treatment effects of those in the high adherent groups identified a more robust outcome, showing greater effect sizes than those in the low adherent groups for depression, anxiety, and sleep outcomes. Furthermore, additional subgroup analysis on studies that have used the fully automated dCBT-I treatment without the support of human therapists reported significant treatment effects for depression, anxiety, and sleep outcomes. The results demonstrated that digital intervention for insomnia yielded significant effects on alleviating depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as insomnia symptoms. Specifically, the study demonstrated significant effects on the above symptoms when considering treatment adherence and implementing fully automated dCBT-I.",

Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of digital interventions for managing insomnia and its related symptoms."

        "meta_abstract": "Chatbots (also known as conversational agents and virtual assistants) offer the potential to deliver healthcare in an efficient, appealing and personalised manner. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of chatbot interventions designed to improve physical activity, diet and sleep. Electronic databases were searched for randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, and pre-post trials that evaluated chatbot interventions targeting physical activity, diet and/or sleep, published before 1 September 2022. Outcomes were total physical activity, steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep quality and sleep duration. Standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated to compare intervention effects. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess chatbot type, intervention type, duration, output and use of artificial intelligence. Risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tool. Nineteen trials were included. Sample sizes ranged between 25–958, and mean participant age ranged between 9–71 years. Most interventions (n = 15, 79%) targeted physical activity, and most trials had a low-quality rating (n = 14, 74%). Meta-analysis results showed significant effects (all p < 0.05) of chatbots for increasing total physical activity (SMD = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.16, 0.40]), daily steps (SMD=0.28 [95% CI=0.17, 0.39]), MVPA (SMD=0.53 [95% CI=0.24, 0.83]), fruit and vegetable consumption (SMD=0.59 [95% CI=0.25, 0.93]), sleep duration (SMD=0.44 [95% CI=0.32, 0.55]) and sleep quality (SMD=0.50 [95% CI=0.09, 0.90]). Subgroup analyses showed that text-based, and artificial intelligence chatbots were more efficacious than speech/voice chatbots for fruit and vegetable consumption, and multicomponent interventions were more efficacious than chatbot-only interventions for sleep duration and sleep quality (all p <0.05). Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that chatbot interventions are efficacious for increasing physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep duration and sleep quality. Chatbot interventions were efficacious across a range of populations and age groups, with both short- and longer-term interventions, and chatbot only and multicomponent interventions being efficacious.",

It found that chatbots significantly increased total physical activity, daily steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep duration, and sleep quality across various populations and age groups. The analysis indicated that text-based and AI chatbots were more effective than voice chatbots for dietary improvements, and that multicomponent interventions were more effective than chatbot-only interventions for enhancing sleep outcomes. Overall, the findings support the efficacy of chatbot interventions in promoting healthier behaviors."

It found that adopting a vegetarian diet is associated with significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and body weight, while the effect on systolic blood pressure was not significant. The study highlights the potential benefits of vegetarian diets for improving health outcomes in this population, suggesting that further high-quality research is needed to explore these effects more comprehensively."

        "meta_abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death and is associated with multiple medical and psychological comorbidities. Therefore, future strategies to improve COPD management and outcomes are needed for the betterment of patient care. Wearable technology interventions offer considerable promise in improving outcomes, but prior reviews fall short of assessing their role in the COPD population. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched ovid MEDLINE, ovid-EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and IEEE databases from inception to April 2023 to identify studies investigating wearable technology interventions in an adult COPD population with prespecified outcomes of interest including physical activity promotion, increasing exercise capacity, exacerbation detection, and quality-of-life. We identified 7396 studies, of which 37 were included in our review. Meta-analysis showed wearable technology interventions significantly increased: the mean daily step count (mean difference (MD) 850 (494–1205) steps/day) and the six-minute walk distance (MD 5.81m (1.02–10.61m). However, the impact was short-lived. Furthermore, wearable technology coupled with another facet (such as health coaching or pulmonary rehabilitation) had a greater impact that wearable technology alone. Wearable technology had little impact on quality-of-life measures and had mixed results for exacerbation avoidance and prediction. It is clear that wearable technology interventions may have the potential to form a core part of future COPD management plans, but further work is required to translate this into meaningful clinical benefit.",

Despite identifying a number of studies, the findings revealed mixed results and a small effect size, particularly influenced by publication bias. The analysis suggested that while there may be some association between general screen use and ASD, this was not strongly supported by the literature. Additionally, a negative effect was noted regarding social media use and ASD. Overall, the study concluded that the current evidence does not sufficiently support a clear link between screen time and ASD, highlighting the need for further research in this area."

        "meta_abstract": "Background Severe anaemia is associated with high in-hospital mortality among young children. In malaria-endemic areas, surviving children also have an increased risk of mortality or readmission after hospital discharge. We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of monthly post discharge malaria chemoprevention in children recovering from severe anaemia. Methods This analysis was conducted according to PRISMA-IPD guidelines. We searched multiple databases on Aug 28, 2023, without date or language restrictions, for randomised controlled trials comparing monthly post-discharge malaria chemoprevention with placebo or standard of care among children (aged <15 years) admitted with severe anaemia in malaria-endemic Africa. Trials using daily or weekly malaria prophylaxis were not eligible. The investigators from all eligible trials shared pseudonymised datasets, which were standardised and merged for analysis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during the intervention period. Analyses were performed in the modified intention-to treat population, including all randomly assigned participants who contributed to the endpoint. Fixed-effects two-stage meta-analysis of risk ratios (RRs) was used to generate pooled effect estimates for mortality. Recurrent time-to-event data (readmissions or clinic visits) were analysed using one-stage mixed-effects Prentice-Williams-Peterson total-time models to obtain hazard ratios (HRs). This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022308791. Findings Our search identified 91 articles, of which 78 were excluded by title and abstract, and a further ten did not meet eligibility criteria. Three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, including 3663 children with severe anaemia, were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis; 3507 (95·7%) contributed to the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Participants received monthly sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine until the end of the malaria transmission season (mean 3·1 courses per child [range 1–6]; n=1085; The Gambia), monthly artemether–lumefantrine given at the end of weeks 4 and 8 post discharge (n=1373; Malawi), or monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine given at the end of weeks 2, 6, and 10 post discharge (n=1049; Uganda and Kenya). During the intervention period, post-discharge malaria chemoprevention was associated with a 77% reduction in mortality (RR 0·23 [95% CI 0·08–0·70], p=0·0094, I²=0%) and a 55% reduction in all-cause readmissions (HR 0·45 [95% CI 0·36–0·56], p<0·0001) compared with placebo. The protective effect was restricted to the intervention period and was not sustained after the direct pharmacodynamic effect of the drugs had waned. The small number of trials limited our ability to assess heterogeneity, its sources, and publication bias. Interpretation In malaria-endemic Africa, post-discharge malaria chemoprevention reduces mortality and readmissions in recently discharged children recovering from severe anaemia. Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention could be a valuable strategy for the management of this group at high risk. Future research should focus on methods of delivery, options to prolong the protection duration, other hospitalised groups at high risk, and interventions targeting non-malarial causes of post-discharge morbidity.",

Despite their growing usage, there is a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of their impact on mental health and well-being. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to fill this gap by synthesizing evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based CAs in improving mental health and factors influencing their effectiveness and user experience. Twelve databases were searched for experimental studies of AI-based CAs’ effects on mental illnesses and psychological well-being published before May 26, 2023. Out of 7834 records, 35 eligible studies were identified for systematic review, out of which 15 randomized controlled trials were included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that AI-based CAs significantly reduce symptoms of depression (Hedge’sg 0.64 [95% CI 0.17–1.12]) and distress (Hedge’s g 0.7 [95% CI 0.18–1.22]). These effects were more pronounced in CAs that are multimodal, generative AI-based, integrated with mobile/instant messaging apps, and targeting clinical/subclinical and elderly populations. However, CA-based interventions showed no significant improvement in overall psychological well-being (Hedge’sg 0.32 [95% CI–0.13 to 0.78]). User experience with AI-based CAs was largely shaped by the quality of human-AI therapeutic relationships, content engagement, and effective communication. These findings underscore the potential of AI-based CAs in addressing mental health issues. Future research should investigate the underlying mechanisms of their effectiveness, assess long term effects across various mental health outcomes, and evaluate the safe integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care.",

This meta-analysis evaluated the benefits of computerized cognitive training (CCT) on memory functions in individuals with MCI or dementia. The study was registered prospectively with PROSPERO under CRD42022363715 and received no funding. The search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO on Sept 19, 2022, and Google Scholar on May 9, 2023, to identify randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of CCT on memory outcomes in individuals with MCI or dementia. Mean differences and standard deviations of neuropsychological assessment scores were extracted to derive standardized mean differences. Our search identified 10,678 studies, of which 35 studies were included. Among 1489 participants with MCI, CCT showed improvements in verbal memory (SMD (95%CI)=0.55 (0.35–0.74)), visual memory (0.36 (0.12–0.60)), and working memory (0.37 (0.10–0.64)). Supervised CCT showed improvements in verbal memory (0.72 (0.45–0.98)), visual memory (0.51 (0.22–0.79)), and working memory (0.33 (0.01–0.66)). Unsupervised CCT showed improvement in verbal memory (0.21 (0.04–0.38)) only. Among 371 participants with dementia, CCT showed improvement in verbal memory (0.64 (0.02–1.27)) only. Inconsistency due to heterogeneity (as indicated by I2 values) is observed, which reduces our confidence in MCI outcomes to a moderate level and dementia outcomes to a low level. The results suggest that CCT is efficacious on various memory domains in individuals with MCI. Although the supervised approach showed greater effects, the unsupervised approach can improve verbal memory while allowing users to receive CCT at home without engaging as many healthcare resources.",

It found that CCT can improve various memory domains, particularly in individuals with MCI, with supervised training showing greater benefits than unsupervised training. While unsupervised CCT also demonstrated some improvement in verbal memory, it allows for home use with fewer healthcare resources. However, the results are tempered by inconsistencies and heterogeneity in the data, leading to moderate confidence in MCI outcomes and low confidence in dementia outcomes."

        "meta_abstract": "Background Quantifying contributions of environmental faecal contamination to child diarrhoea and growth faltering can illuminate causal mechanisms behind modest health benefits in recent water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) trials. We aimed to assess associations between environmental detection of enteropathogens and human or animal microbial source tracking markers (MSTM) and subsequent child health outcomes. Methods In this individual participant data meta-analysis we searched we searched PubMed, Embase, CAB Direct Global Health, Agricultural and Environmental Science Database, Web of Science, and Scopus for WASH intervention studies with a prospective design and concurrent control that measured enteropathogens or MSTM in environmental samples, or both, and subsequently measured enteric infections, diarrhoea, or height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) in children younger than 5 years. We excluded studies that only measured faecal indicator bacteria. The initial search was done on Jan 19, 2021, and updated on March 22, 2023. One reviewer (AM) screened abstracts, and two independent reviewers (AM and RT) examined the full texts of short-listed articles. All included studies include at least one author that also contributed as an author to the present Article. Our primary outcomes were the 7-day prevalence of caregiver-reported diarrhoea and HAZ in children. For specific enteropathogens in the environment, primary outcomes also included subsequent child infection with the same pathogen ascertained by stool testing. We estimated associations using covariate-adjusted regressions and pooled estimates across studies. Findings Data from nine published reports from five interventions studies, which included 8603 children (4302 girls and 4301 boys), were included in the meta-analysis. Environmental pathogen detection was associated with increased infection prevalence with the same pathogen and lower HAZ (ΔHAZ –0·09 [95% CI –0·17 to –0·01]) but not diarrhoea (prevalence ratio 1·22 [95% CI 0·95 to 1·58]), except during wet seasons. Detection of MSTM was not associated with diarrhoea (no pooled estimate) or HAZ (ΔHAZ –0·01 [–0·13 to 0·11] for human markers and ΔHAZ –0·02 [–0·24 to 0·21] for animal markers). Soil, children’s hands, and stored drinking water were major transmission pathways. Interpretation Our findings support a causal chain from pathogens in the environment to infection to growth faltering, indicating that the lack of WASH intervention effects on child growth might stem from insufficient reductions in environmental pathogen prevalence. Studies measuring enteropathogens in the environment should subsequently measure the same pathogens in stool to further examine theories of change between WASH, faecal contamination, and health. Given that environmental pathogen detection was predictive of infection, programmes targeting specific pathogens (eg, vaccinations and elimination efforts) can environmentally monitor the pathogens of interest for population-level surveillance instead of collecting individual biospecimens.

The study emphasizes the importance of monitoring specific pathogens for better population-level surveillance and intervention strategies."

Even though the performance of these algorithms is promising in theory, there is limited evidence on the impact of AI assistance on human diagnostic decisions. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to study the effect of AI assistance on the accuracy of skin cancer diagnosis. We searched PubMed, Embase,IEEXplore,Scopusandconferenceproceedingsforarticlesfrom1/1/2017to11/8/2022.We includedstudiescomparingtheperformanceofcliniciansdiagnosingatleastoneskincancerwithand without deep learning-based AI assistance. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic accuracy with versus without AI assistance were computed using a bivariate random effects model. We identified 2983 studies, of which ten were eligible for meta-analysis. For clinicians without AI assistance, pooled sensitivity was 74.8% (95% CI 68.6–80.1) and specificity was 81.5% (95% CI 73.9–87.3). For AI-assisted clinicians, the overall sensitivity was 81.1% (95% CI 74.4–86.5) and specificity was 86.1% (95% CI 79.2–90.9). AI benefitted medical professionals of all experience levels in subgroupanalyses,withthelargestimprovementamongnon-dermatologists.Nopublication bias was detected, and sensitivity analysis revealed that the findings were robust. AI in the hands of clinicians has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy in skin cancer diagnosis. Given that most studies were conducted in experimental settings, we encourage future studies to further investigate these potential benefits in real-life settings",

Weretheseassociations to reflectcausal relationships, lowering PM2.5 levels to 5.8 μg/m3 could reduce the age-standardized rate of urological cancer by 1.5 ~ 27/100,000 across the 15 countries with the highest PM2.5 level from the top 30 countries with the highest urological cancer burden. Implementing global health policies that can improve air quality could potentially reduce the risk of urologic cancer and alleviate its burden.",

It finds that exergaming, particularly virtual-reality-based exergaming, significantly improves various cognitive functions in people with MCI, while video-based exergaming also benefits those with dementia. The analysis highlights that longer training durations lead to greater cognitive improvements. Overall, the study suggests that exergaming can positively impact cognitive functions in both populations, with a particular emphasis on the effectiveness of VR-based interventions for individuals with MCI."
