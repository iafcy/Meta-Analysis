Although a plethora of risk factors has been identified, a large proportion of cases of RVT is unexplained. Uremic coagulopathy and dialysis modality may predispose to RVT. We investigated the impact of the pretransplant dialysis modality on the risk of RVT in adult renal transplant recipients.\n## METHODS\nRenal transplant recipients (age 18 years or more) who were enrolled in the national registry between 1990 and 1996 (N = 84,513) were evaluated for RVT occurring within 30 days of transplantation. Each case was matched with two controls from the same transplant center and with the year of transplantation. The association between RVT and 18 factors was studied with multivariate conditional logistic regression.\n## RESULTS\nForty-nine percent of all cases of RVT (365 out of 743) occurred in repeat transplant recipients with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 5.72 compared with first transplants (P < 0.001). There were a significantly higher odds of RVT in peritoneal dialysis (PD)-compared with hemodialysis (HD)-treated patients (OR = 1.87, P = 0.001). Change in dialysis modality was an independent predictor of RVT: switching from HD to PD (OR = 3.59, P < 0.001) and from PD to HD (OR = 1.62, P = 0.047). Compared with primary transplant recipients on HD (OR = 1.00), the highest odds of RVT were in repeat transplant recipients treated with PD (OR = 12.95, P < 0.001) and HD (OR = 4.50, P < 0.001). Other independent predictors of RVT were preemptive transplantation, relatively young and old donor age, diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus as causes of end-stage renal disease, recipient gender, and lower panel reactive antibody levels (PRAs).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe strongest risk factors for RVT were retransplantation and prior PD treatment.

Peritoneal dialysis as pretransplantation dialysis modality was reported to influence favorably the recovery of renal function immediately after kidney transplantation. It has been hypothesized that fluid status was the factor explaining this better outcome. This hypothesis was tested in this study by multivariate analysis, also including other factors related to DGF and ARF.\n## METHODS\nThe records of peritoneal dialysis (PD; n=40) and hemodialysis (HD; n=79) patients receiving a first cadaveric kidney transplantation at the University Hospital Gent were analyzed.\n## RESULTS\nDGF and ARF were observed in 33 (27 HD and 6 PD, P=0.03) and 14 (14 HD and 0 PD, P=0.01) patients, respectively. The number of days needed to reach a serum creatinine 50% below that before transplantation (T1/2(SCr)), was correlated with cold ischemia time (CIT) (P<0.001) and body weight gain (BWG) (P<0.01) and was inversely correlated with urinary output in the first 24 hr (P<0.001), fluid load (P<0.001), and central venous pressure (P<0.001). A multivariate model with CIT (P<0.001), PD as pretransplantation dialysis mode (P=0.01), urinary output in the first 24 hr (P=0.001), BWG (P=0.05), and fluid load (P=0.01) resulted in an R2 of 0.32 (P<0.001). Using Cox regression analysis, the relative risk for a prolonged T1/2(SCr) increased with 4%/hr CIT (P=0.01) and with 1%/kg BWG (P=0.02). Fluid load decreased the relative risk with 5%/liter (P<0.001) and PD as pretransplantation modality favorably modified the relative risk by a factor of 1.6 (P=0.01).\n## CONCLUSION\nPD as pretransplantation dialysis modality can reduce the incidence and the severity of delayed recovery of renal function after renal transplantation.

Therefore, we studied the effects of pre-transplant dialysis modality on outcomes in a large United States cohort.\n## METHODS\nWe compared rates of transplantation between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients from the years 1995 to 1998 in the United States (N = 252,402) and outcomes after transplantation (N = 22,776), using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n## RESULTS\nIn a Cox proportional hazards analysis that was adjusted for multiple patient characteristics, kidney transplantation was 1.39 (95% CI = 1.35 to 1.43) times more likely in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients (P < 0.0001). Over the entire follow-up period, the adjusted risk for death-censored graft failure was 1.15 (1.04 to 1.26) times higher in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis (P < 0.05), but mortality and overall graft failure rates were not different. Pre-transplant dialysis modality did not affect outcomes for patients who survived with a functioning kidney for at least 3 months. However, in adjusted Cox analyses restricted to the first 3 months, peritoneal dialysis was associated with a 1.23 (1.09 to 1.39) times higher risk for early graft failure (P < 0.001) and a 1.33 (1.16 to 1.53) times higher risk for death-censored graft failure (P < 0.001). Peritoneal dialysis patients, however, were seen to have a lower incidence of delayed graft function. In a smaller sample of patients with data on causes of early graft failure, graft thrombosis was more commonly listed as a cause of graft failure among peritoneal dialysis patients, 41% (64/156), compared to hemodialysis patients, 30% (106/349), P < 0.05.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nKidney transplantation is more frequent in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis patients, and transplantation in peritoneal dialysis patients is more frequently associated with early, but not late, graft failure. Delayed graft function was less common in peritoneal dialysis patients but this potential benefit appears to be offset by other factors which are associated with early graft loss.

From 1997 to 2000, after exclusion of pediatric patients, multiple transplantations, and living donors, 6420 were patients registered on the waiting list, and 3464 were transplanted.\n## RESULTS\nUsing a Cox proportional hazard analysis, we found a shorter waiting time for PD patients (RR 0.71, P < 0.0001), which became equivalent to hemodialysis (HD) patients when taking into account the transplant center as a variable (RR 1.0, P= 0.95). Concerning graft survival, only preemptive transplantation had a significant impact, being associated to a decreased risk of graft failure (RR 0.46, P= 0.005). Conclusion.

It has been reported that pretransplantation peritoneal dialysis was correlated with a better recovery of graft function than hemodialysis in adult kidney recipients. However, the effect of pretransplantation dialysis mode (PDM) seemed to be unclear on the early outcome of KT in pediatric recipients. In this study, the potential impact of PDM on early graft function was evaluated in 174 pediatric patients who underwent KT by using cadaveric donors. The primary outcome parameter was the time to reach a serum creatinine (SCr) level 50% of the pretransplantation value [T(1/2(SCr))], while DGF was defined as a T(1/2(SCr)) >3 days after KT (n = 40). By stratifying kidney recipients for normal function graft or DGF, this latter group showed a significantly higher body weight (BW) on the day of KT (P = 0.014), body surface area (BSA) (P = 0.005), warm ischemia time (WIT) (P = 0.022), early SCr on the day 1 after KT (P < 0.001), and T(1/2(SCr)) (P < 0.001), whereas lower urine volume (UV) collected in the first 24 h after KT (P < 0.001) and fluid load (P < 0.001) occurred. Univariate exponential correlation that was carried out between T(1/2(SCr)) and all the other variables had shown a better value than the linear correlation for BW (R(2) = 0.28 vs. R(2) = 0.04), BSA (R(2) = 0.29 vs. R(2) = 0.03), and SCr (R(2) = 0.51 vs. R(2) = 0.28). In a multivariate regression analysis performed by entering T(1/2(SCr)) as dependent variable and following a forward stepwise method, cold ischemia time (CIT) (P = 0.027) but not PDM (P = 0.195) reached significance.

A total of 137 (6.8%) patients developed PTDM; 7% in the hemodialysis group and 6.5% in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) group (p\u2003=\u20030.85). In the multivariate analysis, age (p\u2003<\u20030.001), body mass index (BMI) (p\u2003<\u20030.001), use of tacrolimus (p\u2003=\u20030.002), and rejection episodes (p\u2003<\u20030.001) were identified as independent risk factors for development of PTDM. Patients in the PD group were younger (p\u2003=\u20030.004), had lower BMI (p\u2003=\u20030.07), and were less likely to have a history of hepatitis C (p\u2003=\u20030.007) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (p\u2003=\u20030.07). Adjustment for these variables did not modify the results. The results of this study suggest that pre-transplant dialysis modality does not have an impact on the subsequent development of PTDM in RTRs.",

The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the factors influencing PTDM development. Under particular consideration were the elements, existing before the transplantation, especially the modality of dialysis treatment significance, i.e. haemodialysis (HD) versus peritoneal dialysis (PD).\n## METHODS\nThree hundred and seventy-seven consecutive outpatients who underwent renal transplantation (RTx) in our institution between January 2003 and December 2005 were analysed. PTDM was diagnosed according to the current American Diabetic Association/World Health Organization criteria. Statistical inference was conducted by means of univariate methods (one factor versus PTDM) and multivariate methods in frames of generalized linear model.\n## RESULTS\nIn the study group, 72 patients (23.4%) developed PTDM after RTx (55 HD and 17 PD patients). PTDM incidence at 3, 6 and 12 months was 15.9%, 22.1% and 23.4%, respectively. The mean interval from transplantation to the onset of PTDM was 3.08 \u00b1 2.73 months. In univariate analysis, the factors associated with the elevated risk of PTDM appearance were older recipient age, positive family history of diabetes, hypertensive nephropathy as end-stage renal disease cause, higher body mass index at transplantation, treatment by PD, and the graft from an older donor. In multivariate verification, statistical significance remained: older recipient age (P < 0.001), positive family history of diabetes (P = 0.002), and treatment by PD (P = 0.007).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTreatment by PD appears to be a possible novel factor, not yet reported, which may increase the risk of PTDM development.",

One hundred thirty-three pairs of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients were transplanted at our center between 1994 and 2016. Those who received kidneys from the same donor were included in the study. HD patients were significantly older (44 vs 48 years), but the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar (3.12 vs 3.46) in both groups.

The Kaplan-Meier curves of the patients and graft survival did not differ significantly. Delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection (AR) occurred significantly more often in the HD recipients.

The secondary outcomes were events during kidney transplantation and post-transplant de novo diseases adjusted by propensity score in log-binomial model.\n## RESULTS\nThere were 1812 patients included in our cohort, among which 1209 (66.7%) and 603 (33.3%) recipients received pretransplant HD and PD, respectively. Recipients with chronic HD were generally older and male, had higher risks of developing post-transplant de novo ischaemic heart disease, tuberculosis and hepatitis C after adjustment. Pretransplant HD contributed to higher graft failure in the multivariate analysis (HR 1.38, p<0.05) after adjustment for the recipient age, sex, duration of dialysis and pretransplant diseases. There was no significant between-group difference in overall survival.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPretransplant HD contributed to higher risks of death-censored allograft failure after kidney transplantation when compared with PD.",

Although a plethora of risk factors has been identified, a large proportion of cases of RVT is unexplained. Uremic coagulopathy and dialysis modality may predispose to RVT.

Each case was matched with two controls from the same transplant center and with the year of transplantation. The association between RVT and 18 factors was studied with multivariate conditional logistic regression.\n## RESULTS\nForty-nine percent of all cases of RVT (365 out of 743) occurred in repeat transplant recipients with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 5.72 compared with first transplants (P < 0.001). There were a significantly higher odds of RVT in peritoneal dialysis (PD)-compared with hemodialysis (HD)-treated patients (OR = 1.87, P = 0.001). Change in dialysis modality was an independent predictor of RVT: switching from HD to PD (OR = 3.59, P < 0.001) and from PD to HD (OR = 1.62, P = 0.047).

Other independent predictors of RVT were preemptive transplantation, relatively young and old donor age, diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus as causes of end-stage renal disease, recipient gender, and lower panel reactive antibody levels (PRAs).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe strongest risk factors for RVT were retransplantation and prior PD treatment.

Peritoneal dialysis as pretransplantation dialysis modality was reported to influence favorably the recovery of renal function immediately after kidney transplantation. It has been hypothesized that fluid status was the factor explaining this better outcome. This hypothesis was tested in this study by multivariate analysis, also including other factors related to DGF and ARF.\n## METHODS\nThe records of peritoneal dialysis (PD; n=40) and hemodialysis (HD; n=79) patients receiving a first cadaveric kidney transplantation at the University Hospital Gent were analyzed.\n## RESULTS\nDGF and ARF were observed in 33 (27 HD and 6 PD, P=0.03) and 14 (14 HD and 0 PD, P=0.01) patients, respectively. The number of days needed to reach a serum creatinine 50% below that before transplantation (T1/2(SCr)), was correlated with cold ischemia time (CIT) (P<0.001) and body weight gain (BWG) (P<0.01) and was inversely correlated with urinary output in the first 24 hr (P<0.001), fluid load (P<0.001), and central venous pressure (P<0.001). A multivariate model with CIT (P<0.001), PD as pretransplantation dialysis mode (P=0.01), urinary output in the first 24 hr (P=0.001), BWG (P=0.05), and fluid load (P=0.01) resulted in an R2 of 0.32 (P<0.001). Using Cox regression analysis, the relative risk for a prolonged T1/2(SCr) increased with 4%/hr CIT (P=0.01) and with 1%/kg BWG (P=0.02). Fluid load decreased the relative risk with 5%/liter (P<0.001) and PD as pretransplantation modality favorably modified the relative risk by a factor of 1.6 (P=0.01).\n## CONCLUSION\nPD as pretransplantation dialysis modality can reduce the incidence and the severity of delayed recovery of renal function after renal transplantation.

Therefore, we studied the effects of pre-transplant dialysis modality on outcomes in a large United States cohort.\n## METHODS\nWe compared rates of transplantation between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients from the years 1995 to 1998 in the United States (N = 252,402) and outcomes after transplantation (N = 22,776), using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n## RESULTS\nIn a Cox proportional hazards analysis that was adjusted for multiple patient characteristics, kidney transplantation was 1.39 (95% CI = 1.35 to 1.43) times more likely in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients (P < 0.0001). Over the entire follow-up period, the adjusted risk for death-censored graft failure was 1.15 (1.04 to 1.26) times higher in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis (P < 0.05), but mortality and overall graft failure rates were not different. Pre-transplant dialysis modality did not affect outcomes for patients who survived with a functioning kidney for at least 3 months. However, in adjusted Cox analyses restricted to the first 3 months, peritoneal dialysis was associated with a 1.23 (1.09 to 1.39) times higher risk for early graft failure (P < 0.001) and a 1.33 (1.16 to 1.53) times higher risk for death-censored graft failure (P < 0.001). Peritoneal dialysis patients, however, were seen to have a lower incidence of delayed graft function. In a smaller sample of patients with data on causes of early graft failure, graft thrombosis was more commonly listed as a cause of graft failure among peritoneal dialysis patients, 41% (64/156), compared to hemodialysis patients, 30% (106/349), P < 0.05.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nKidney transplantation is more frequent in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis patients, and transplantation in peritoneal dialysis patients is more frequently associated with early, but not late, graft failure. Delayed graft function was less common in peritoneal dialysis patients but this potential benefit appears to be offset by other factors which are associated with early graft loss.

It has been reported that pretransplantation peritoneal dialysis was correlated with a better recovery of graft function than hemodialysis in adult kidney recipients. However, the effect of pretransplantation dialysis mode (PDM) seemed to be unclear on the early outcome of KT in pediatric recipients. In this study, the potential impact of PDM on early graft function was evaluated in 174 pediatric patients who underwent KT by using cadaveric donors. The primary outcome parameter was the time to reach a serum creatinine (SCr) level 50% of the pretransplantation value [T(1/2(SCr))], while DGF was defined as a T(1/2(SCr)) >3 days after KT (n = 40). By stratifying kidney recipients for normal function graft or DGF, this latter group showed a significantly higher body weight (BW) on the day of KT (P = 0.014), body surface area (BSA) (P = 0.005), warm ischemia time (WIT) (P = 0.022), early SCr on the day 1 after KT (P < 0.001), and T(1/2(SCr)) (P < 0.001), whereas lower urine volume (UV) collected in the first 24 h after KT (P < 0.001) and fluid load (P < 0.001) occurred. Univariate exponential correlation that was carried out between T(1/2(SCr)) and all the other variables had shown a better value than the linear correlation for BW (R(2) = 0.28 vs. R(2) = 0.04), BSA (R(2) = 0.29 vs. R(2) = 0.03), and SCr (R(2) = 0.51 vs. R(2) = 0.28). In a multivariate regression analysis performed by entering T(1/2(SCr)) as dependent variable and following a forward stepwise method, cold ischemia time (CIT) (P = 0.027) but not PDM (P = 0.195) reached significance.

When predominant RRT modality was analyzed (modality used for > 50% of the ESRD time), PD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; P < 0.05) had a protective effect for graft survival compared with HD. Better recipient survival also was associated with PD (HR, 0.96; P < 0.05).

Therefore, we evaluated the influence of dialysis modality.\n## METHODS\nWe compared various clinical and laboratory parameters of 70 peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 180 hemodialysis (HD) patients (n=250), including 91 females and an overall age 36.7\u00b19.7 years who underwent transplantation between 2000 and 2008 to evaluate factors affecting delayed graft function (DGF) and of transplant graft failure.\n## RESULTS\nOverall graft survival was 82% at 3 and 75% at 5 years. Among HD patients, 16% displayed DGF, versus 12% of PD patients. Multivariate analysis showed that factors affecting DGF were: mode of dialysis (relative risk [RR]=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-1.43; P<.01); parathyroid hormone (RR=0.32, 95% CI: 0.30-0.34, P<.05), C-reative protein (RR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.97-1.09; P<.05), hemoglobin levels (RR=.75, 95% CI: 0.72-0.79; P<.05). At 3 and 5 years follow-up, PD patients' showed fewer graft failures than HD patients (14% vs 20%; P<.05 and 17% vs 28%; P<.05).\n## CONCLUSION\nEarly graft function rates were better for PD than for HD patients. Inflammation and anemia should be carefully investigated and corrected to achieve better graft function.",

Standard multivariable Cox regression examined the association of individually assigned pre-transplant dialysis modality with post-transplant patient and graft survival. To decrease confounding-by-indication through unmeasured factors, we applied the instrumental variable method that used the case-mix adjusted centre percentage of peritoneal dialysis (PD) as predictor variable.\n## RESULTS\nStandard analyses adjusted for age, sex, primary renal disease, donor type, duration of dialysis, year of transplantation and country suggested that PD before transplantation was associated with better patient [hazard ratio, HR (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.76-0.91)] and graft survival (HR (95% CI) 0.90 (0.84-0.96)) when compared with haemodialysis (HD).

Mortality or graft failure and delayed graft function risks were estimated by Cox regression (hazard ratio) and logistic regression (odds ratio), respectively.\n## RESULTS\nRecipients treated with peritoneal dialysis pretransplantation had lower (21.9/1000 patient-years [95% confidence interval: 18.1-26.5]) crude all-cause mortality rate than those recipients treated with hemodialysis (32.8/1000 patient-years [30.8-35.0]). Pretransplant peritoneal dialysis use was associated with 43% lower adjusted all-cause and 66% lower cardiovascular death. Furthermore, pretransplant peritoneal dialysis use was associated with 17% and 36% lower unadjusted death-censored graft failure and delayed graft function risk, respectively.

One hundred thirty-three pairs of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients were transplanted at our center between 1994 and 2016. Those who received kidneys from the same donor were included in the study. HD patients were significantly older (44 vs 48 years), but the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar (3.12 vs 3.46) in both groups.

The Kaplan-Meier curves of the patients and graft survival did not differ significantly. Delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection (AR) occurred significantly more often in the HD recipients. Graft vessel thrombosis resulting in graft loss occurred in 9 PD (6.7%) and 4 HD (3%) patients (P > .05).

Prior to transplant, 64 patients received hemodialysis (HD) and nineteen patients received peritoneal dialysis (PD). Physical and mental quality of life results from eight basic scales and the physical and mental component summaries (PCS and MCS) were measured using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) survey.\n## RESULTS\nPeri- and postoperative complications, as well as patient and graft survival were similar between the two groups. Both groups showed an improvement of HRQoL in all SF-36 domains after transplantation. Compared with patients who received HD before transplantation, PD patients showed significantly better results in four of the eight SF-36 domains: physical functioning (mean difference HD - PD: -\u200912.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9, P\u2009=\u2009<\u20090.01), bodily pain (-\u200914.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3, P\u00a0<\u20090.01), general health (-\u20096.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8, P\u00a0=\u20090.04), vitality (-\u20096.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6, P\u2009=\u20090.04), and PCS (-\u20095.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5, P\u00a0<\u20090.01) after SPKT. In the overall study population, graft loss was associated with significant worsening of the HRQoL in all physical components (each P\u2009<\u20090.01).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this analysis show that pre-transplant dialysis modality has no influence on the outcome and survival rate after SPKT.

A Cox multivariable model was used to investigate the association of PKT and pretransplant dialysis time with the hazard of graft failure defined as death, return to dialysis, or retransplant, whichever occurred first.\n## RESULTS\nPatients (n = 1911) were included, of which 380 (19.8%) received a PKT. Median time of follow-up was 7.0 y. PKT was associated with a 55% reduction of the hazard of graft failure at any time after KT compared with patients transplanted after dialysis (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.62), after adjustment for recipient sex and age, primary kidney disease, donor age and type (living or deceased donor), number of HLA mismatches, cold ischemia time, and year of transplantation. A reduction of the hazard of graft failure was found in PKT whatever the compared duration of dialysis, even when <6 mo and whatever the dialysis modality. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn France, PKT among pediatric patients is associated with a better graft survival when compared with KT after dialysis, even when <6 mo.

Each case was matched with two controls from the same transplant center and with the year of transplantation. The association between RVT and 18 factors was studied with multivariate conditional logistic regression.\n## RESULTS\nForty-nine percent of all cases of RVT (365 out of 743) occurred in repeat transplant recipients with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 5.72 compared with first transplants (P < 0.001). There were a significantly higher odds of RVT in peritoneal dialysis (PD)-compared with hemodialysis (HD)-treated patients (OR = 1.87, P = 0.001).

Peritoneal dialysis as pretransplantation dialysis modality was reported to influence favorably the recovery of renal function immediately after kidney transplantation. It has been hypothesized that fluid status was the factor explaining this better outcome. This hypothesis was tested in this study by multivariate analysis, also including other factors related to DGF and ARF.\n## METHODS\nThe records of peritoneal dialysis (PD; n=40) and hemodialysis (HD; n=79) patients receiving a first cadaveric kidney transplantation at the University Hospital Gent were analyzed.\n## RESULTS\nDGF and ARF were observed in 33 (27 HD and 6 PD, P=0.03) and 14 (14 HD and 0 PD, P=0.01) patients, respectively. The number of days needed to reach a serum creatinine 50% below that before transplantation (T1/2(SCr)), was correlated with cold ischemia time (CIT) (P<0.001) and body weight gain (BWG) (P<0.01) and was inversely correlated with urinary output in the first 24 hr (P<0.001), fluid load (P<0.001), and central venous pressure (P<0.001).

Using Cox regression analysis, the relative risk for a prolonged T1/2(SCr) increased with 4%/hr CIT (P=0.01) and with 1%/kg BWG (P=0.02).

Therefore, we studied the effects of pre-transplant dialysis modality on outcomes in a large United States cohort.\n## METHODS\nWe compared rates of transplantation between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients from the years 1995 to 1998 in the United States (N = 252,402) and outcomes after transplantation (N = 22,776), using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n## RESULTS\nIn a Cox proportional hazards analysis that was adjusted for multiple patient characteristics, kidney transplantation was 1.39 (95% CI = 1.35 to 1.43) times more likely in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients (P < 0.0001). Over the entire follow-up period, the adjusted risk for death-censored graft failure was 1.15 (1.04 to 1.26) times higher in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis (P < 0.05), but mortality and overall graft failure rates were not different. Pre-transplant dialysis modality did not affect outcomes for patients who survived with a functioning kidney for at least 3 months. However, in adjusted Cox analyses restricted to the first 3 months, peritoneal dialysis was associated with a 1.23 (1.09 to 1.39) times higher risk for early graft failure (P < 0.001) and a 1.33 (1.16 to 1.53) times higher risk for death-censored graft failure (P < 0.001). Peritoneal dialysis patients, however, were seen to have a lower incidence of delayed graft function. In a smaller sample of patients with data on causes of early graft failure, graft thrombosis was more commonly listed as a cause of graft failure among peritoneal dialysis patients, 41% (64/156), compared to hemodialysis patients, 30% (106/349), P < 0.05.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nKidney transplantation is more frequent in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis patients, and transplantation in peritoneal dialysis patients is more frequently associated with early, but not late, graft failure. Delayed graft function was less common in peritoneal dialysis patients but this potential benefit appears to be offset by other factors which are associated with early graft loss.

From 1997 to 2000, after exclusion of pediatric patients, multiple transplantations, and living donors, 6420 were patients registered on the waiting list, and 3464 were transplanted.\n## RESULTS\nUsing a Cox proportional hazard analysis, we found a shorter waiting time for PD patients (RR 0.71, P < 0.0001), which became equivalent to hemodialysis (HD) patients when taking into account the transplant center as a variable (RR 1.0, P= 0.95). Concerning graft survival, only preemptive transplantation had a significant impact, being associated to a decreased risk of graft failure (RR 0.46, P= 0.005). Conclusion.

It has been reported that pretransplantation peritoneal dialysis was correlated with a better recovery of graft function than hemodialysis in adult kidney recipients. However, the effect of pretransplantation dialysis mode (PDM) seemed to be unclear on the early outcome of KT in pediatric recipients. In this study, the potential impact of PDM on early graft function was evaluated in 174 pediatric patients who underwent KT by using cadaveric donors. The primary outcome parameter was the time to reach a serum creatinine (SCr) level 50% of the pretransplantation value [T(1/2(SCr))], while DGF was defined as a T(1/2(SCr)) >3 days after KT (n = 40). By stratifying kidney recipients for normal function graft or DGF, this latter group showed a significantly higher body weight (BW) on the day of KT (P = 0.014), body surface area (BSA) (P = 0.005), warm ischemia time (WIT) (P = 0.022), early SCr on the day 1 after KT (P < 0.001), and T(1/2(SCr)) (P < 0.001), whereas lower urine volume (UV) collected in the first 24 h after KT (P < 0.001) and fluid load (P < 0.001) occurred. Univariate exponential correlation that was carried out between T(1/2(SCr)) and all the other variables had shown a better value than the linear correlation for BW (R(2) = 0.28 vs. R(2) = 0.04), BSA (R(2) = 0.29 vs. R(2) = 0.03), and SCr (R(2) = 0.51 vs. R(2) = 0.28). In a multivariate regression analysis performed by entering T(1/2(SCr)) as dependent variable and following a forward stepwise method, cold ischemia time (CIT) (P = 0.027) but not PDM (P = 0.195) reached significance. In a Cox regression analysis carried out with T(1/2(SCr)) as dependent variable, neither CIT nor PDM gained significance.

Pretransplantation and predominant RRT modality during the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) period and number and specific combinations of RRT modalities were evaluated.\n## RESULTS\nCompared with hemodialysis (HD), a Cox model showed that peritoneal dialysis (PD) immediately before transplantation predicts a 3% lower risk for graft failure (P < 0.05) and 6% lower risk for recipient death (P < 0.001). When predominant RRT modality was analyzed (modality used for > 50% of the ESRD time), PD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; P < 0.05) had a protective effect for graft survival compared with HD. Better recipient survival also was associated with PD (HR, 0.96; P < 0.05). Increased number of RRT modalities during the ESRD course was associated with increased risk for graft failure (HR, 1.04 per additional modality used; P < 0.005) and recipient death (HR, 1.11 per additional modality used; P < 0.001). Any combination or any single modality (except for PD + HD for graft survival and PD + HD and PD + HD + transplantation for recipient survival) had protective effects on graft and recipient survival compared with HD.\n## CONCLUSION\nOur results suggest that compared with PD, HD as an RRT modality immediately before transplantation or as a predominant RRT modality during the ESRD course, used alone or in combination with other RRT modalities, is associated with increased risks for graft failure and recipient death.

These results can be influenced by the pretransplant dialysis modality. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the pretransplantation dialysis modality influences patient and allograft survival beyond 10 years and examine the potential risk factors associated with the outcomes.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted an observational, retrospective, single-center clinical study that included 236 patients [118 undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 118 undergoing hemodialysis (HD)] who proceeded to transplantation during the period December 1990-2002. Donor and recipient data were collected from our hospital's clinical registries. The follow-up period extended to the patient's death, the loss of the allograft, or loss to follow-up. The end date of the study was set at March 2012.\n## RESULTS\nIn the multivariate analysis, the long-term patient survival rate was higher for the PD group than for the HD group [HR = 2.62 (1.01-6.8); p = 0.04]; however, the allograft survival rate was not significantly different between the two groups [HR = 0.68 (0.41-1.10); p = 0.12].\n## CONCLUSION\nPretransplantation dialysis modality is associated with long-term patient survival, with outcomes favoring peritoneal dialysis over hemodialysis.

In this study we retrospectively analyzed the impact of dialysis modality on posttransplant follow-up.\n## METHODS\nTo minimize donor bias, a paired kidney analysis was applied. One hundred thirty-three pairs of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients were transplanted at our center between 1994 and 2016. Those who received kidneys from the same donor were included in the study. HD patients were significantly older (44 vs 48 years), but the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar (3.12 vs 3.46) in both groups. The groups did not differ significantly with respect to immunosuppressive protocols and number of mismatches (2.96 vs 2.95).\n## RESULTS\nOne-year patient (98% vs 96%) and graft (90% vs 93%) survival was similar in the PD and HD patient groups. The Kaplan-Meier curves of the patients and graft survival did not differ significantly. Delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection (AR) occurred significantly more often in the HD recipients. Graft vessel thrombosis resulting in graft loss occurred in 9 PD (6.7%) and 4 HD (3%) patients (P > .05). Serum creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease guidelines) showed no difference at 1 month, 1 year, and at final visit. On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with graft loss were graft vessel thrombosis, DGF, and graft function 1 month after transplantation. On univariate analysis, age, coronary heart disease, and graft loss were associated with death. Among these factors, only coronary heart disease (model 1) and graft loss were significant predictors of death on multivariate analysis.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe long-term outcome for renal transplantation is similar in patients with PD and HD.

Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the HR of the dialysis modality on graft failure and all-cause mortality. The primary outcomes were long-term post-transplant death-censored allograft failure and all-cause mortality started after 90 days of kidney transplantation until the end of follow-up. The secondary outcomes were events during kidney transplantation and post-transplant de novo diseases adjusted by propensity score in log-binomial model.\n## RESULTS\nThere were 1812 patients included in our cohort, among which 1209 (66.7%) and 603 (33.3%) recipients received pretransplant HD and PD, respectively. Recipients with chronic HD were generally older and male, had higher risks of developing post-transplant de novo ischaemic heart disease, tuberculosis and hepatitis C after adjustment.

Median age at transplantation was 68 years (interquartile range\u00a0= 66-69 years). The 1-year and 5-year overall patient and graft survivals (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 95.1 (93.5-96.7) and 79.0 (75.1-82.9), and 92.9 (91.1-94.7) and 75.4 (71.3-79.5), respectively. Factors associated with higher risks of all-cause death included prevalent coronary artery disease (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]\u00a0= 1.47 [1.03-2.11]), cerebrovascular disease (1.99 [1.26-3.16]), increasing graft ischemic time (1.06 per hour [1.03-1.09]), donor age (1.02 per year [1.01-1.03]), delayed graft function (1.64 [1.13-2.39]), and peritoneal dialysis pretransplantation (1.71 [1.17-2.51]).\n## CONCLUSION\nPrevalent vascular disease and peritoneal dialysis as a pretransplantation dialysis modality are risk factors associated with poorer outcomes in transplant recipients aged\u00a0\u226565 years.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of preemptive kidney transplantation (PKT) and of pretransplant dialysis duration on graft survival among French pediatric kidney transplant recipients.\n## METHODS\nWe analyzed all first pediatric kidney-only transplantations performed in France between 1993 and 2012. A Cox multivariable model was used to investigate the association of PKT and pretransplant dialysis time with the hazard of graft failure defined as death, return to dialysis, or retransplant, whichever occurred first.\n## RESULTS\nPatients (n = 1911) were included, of which 380 (19.8%) received a PKT. Median time of follow-up was 7.0 y. PKT was associated with a 55% reduction of the hazard of graft failure at any time after KT compared with patients transplanted after dialysis (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.62), after adjustment for recipient sex and age, primary kidney disease, donor age and type (living or deceased donor), number of HLA mismatches, cold ischemia time, and year of transplantation. A reduction of the hazard of graft failure was found in PKT whatever the compared duration of dialysis, even when <6 mo and whatever the dialysis modality. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn France, PKT among pediatric patients is associated with a better graft survival when compared with KT after dialysis, even when <6 mo.

Although a plethora of risk factors has been identified, a large proportion of cases of RVT is unexplained. Uremic coagulopathy and dialysis modality may predispose to RVT. We investigated the impact of the pretransplant dialysis modality on the risk of RVT in adult renal transplant recipients.\n## METHODS\nRenal transplant recipients (age 18 years or more) who were enrolled in the national registry between 1990 and 1996 (N = 84,513) were evaluated for RVT occurring within 30 days of transplantation. Each case was matched with two controls from the same transplant center and with the year of transplantation. The association between RVT and 18 factors was studied with multivariate conditional logistic regression.\n## RESULTS\nForty-nine percent of all cases of RVT (365 out of 743) occurred in repeat transplant recipients with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 5.72 compared with first transplants (P < 0.001). There were a significantly higher odds of RVT in peritoneal dialysis (PD)-compared with hemodialysis (HD)-treated patients (OR = 1.87, P = 0.001).

This hypothesis was tested in this study by multivariate analysis, also including other factors related to DGF and ARF.\n## METHODS\nThe records of peritoneal dialysis (PD; n=40) and hemodialysis (HD; n=79) patients receiving a first cadaveric kidney transplantation at the University Hospital Gent were analyzed.\n## RESULTS\nDGF and ARF were observed in 33 (27 HD and 6 PD, P=0.03) and 14 (14 HD and 0 PD, P=0.01) patients, respectively. The number of days needed to reach a serum creatinine 50% below that before transplantation (T1/2(SCr)), was correlated with cold ischemia time (CIT) (P<0.001) and body weight gain (BWG) (P<0.01) and was inversely correlated with urinary output in the first 24 hr (P<0.001), fluid load (P<0.001), and central venous pressure (P<0.001).

Therefore, we studied the effects of pre-transplant dialysis modality on outcomes in a large United States cohort.\n## METHODS\nWe compared rates of transplantation between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients from the years 1995 to 1998 in the United States (N = 252,402) and outcomes after transplantation (N = 22,776), using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n## RESULTS\nIn a Cox proportional hazards analysis that was adjusted for multiple patient characteristics, kidney transplantation was 1.39 (95% CI = 1.35 to 1.43) times more likely in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients (P < 0.0001). Over the entire follow-up period, the adjusted risk for death-censored graft failure was 1.15 (1.04 to 1.26) times higher in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis (P < 0.05), but mortality and overall graft failure rates were not different. Pre-transplant dialysis modality did not affect outcomes for patients who survived with a functioning kidney for at least 3 months. However, in adjusted Cox analyses restricted to the first 3 months, peritoneal dialysis was associated with a 1.23 (1.09 to 1.39) times higher risk for early graft failure (P < 0.001) and a 1.33 (1.16 to 1.53) times higher risk for death-censored graft failure (P < 0.001). Peritoneal dialysis patients, however, were seen to have a lower incidence of delayed graft function. In a smaller sample of patients with data on causes of early graft failure, graft thrombosis was more commonly listed as a cause of graft failure among peritoneal dialysis patients, 41% (64/156), compared to hemodialysis patients, 30% (106/349), P < 0.05.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nKidney transplantation is more frequent in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis patients, and transplantation in peritoneal dialysis patients is more frequently associated with early, but not late, graft failure. Delayed graft function was less common in peritoneal dialysis patients but this potential benefit appears to be offset by other factors which are associated with early graft loss.

In this study, the potential impact of PDM on early graft function was evaluated in 174 pediatric patients who underwent KT by using cadaveric donors. The primary outcome parameter was the time to reach a serum creatinine (SCr) level 50% of the pretransplantation value [T(1/2(SCr))], while DGF was defined as a T(1/2(SCr)) >3 days after KT (n = 40).

Any combination or any single modality (except for PD + HD for graft survival and PD + HD and PD + HD + transplantation for recipient survival) had protective effects on graft and recipient survival compared with HD.\n## CONCLUSION\nOur results suggest that compared with PD, HD as an RRT modality immediately before transplantation or as a predominant RRT modality during the ESRD course, used alone or in combination with other RRT modalities, is associated with increased risks for graft failure and recipient death. Increased number of RRT modalities used during the ESRD course is associated with worsening of graft and recipient survival.",

PTDM was diagnosed according to the current American Diabetic Association/World Health Organization criteria. Statistical inference was conducted by means of univariate methods (one factor versus PTDM) and multivariate methods in frames of generalized linear model.\n## RESULTS\nIn the study group, 72 patients (23.4%) developed PTDM after RTx (55 HD and 17 PD patients). PTDM incidence at 3, 6 and 12 months was 15.9%, 22.1% and 23.4%, respectively. The mean interval from transplantation to the onset of PTDM was 3.08 \u00b1 2.73 months. In univariate analysis, the factors associated with the elevated risk of PTDM appearance were older recipient age, positive family history of diabetes, hypertensive nephropathy as end-stage renal disease cause, higher body mass index at transplantation, treatment by PD, and the graft from an older donor. In multivariate verification, statistical significance remained: older recipient age (P < 0.001), positive family history of diabetes (P = 0.002), and treatment by PD (P = 0.007).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTreatment by PD appears to be a possible novel factor, not yet reported, which may increase the risk of PTDM development.",

In this study we retrospectively analyzed the impact of dialysis modality on posttransplant follow-up.\n## METHODS\nTo minimize donor bias, a paired kidney analysis was applied. One hundred thirty-three pairs of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients were transplanted at our center between 1994 and 2016. Those who received kidneys from the same donor were included in the study. HD patients were significantly older (44 vs 48 years), but the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar (3.12 vs 3.46) in both groups. The groups did not differ significantly with respect to immunosuppressive protocols and number of mismatches (2.96 vs 2.95).\n## RESULTS\nOne-year patient (98% vs 96%) and graft (90% vs 93%) survival was similar in the PD and HD patient groups. The Kaplan-Meier curves of the patients and graft survival did not differ significantly. Delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection (AR) occurred significantly more often in the HD recipients. Graft vessel thrombosis resulting in graft loss occurred in 9 PD (6.7%) and 4 HD (3%) patients (P > .05). Serum creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease guidelines) showed no difference at 1 month, 1 year, and at final visit. On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with graft loss were graft vessel thrombosis, DGF, and graft function 1 month after transplantation. On univariate analysis, age, coronary heart disease, and graft loss were associated with death. Among these factors, only coronary heart disease (model 1) and graft loss were significant predictors of death on multivariate analysis.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe long-term outcome for renal transplantation is similar in patients with PD and HD. These groups differ in some aspects, however, such as susceptibility to vascular thrombosis in PD patients, and to DGF and AR in HD patients.",

The objective of this study was to clarify the associations between the pretransplant dialysis modality, namely haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD), and the development of post-transplant de novo diseases, allograft failure and all-cause mortality for kidney-transplant recipients.\n## DESIGN\nRetrospective nationwide cohort study.\n## SETTING\nData retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database.\n## PARTICIPANTS\nThe National Health Insurance database was explored for patients who received kidney transplantation in Taiwan during 1998-2011 and underwent dialysis >90 days before transplantation.\n## OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe pretransplant characteristics, complications during kidney transplantation and post-transplant outcomes were statistically analysed and compared between the HD and PD groups. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the HR of the dialysis modality on graft failure and all-cause mortality. The primary outcomes were long-term post-transplant death-censored allograft failure and all-cause mortality started after 90 days of kidney transplantation until the end of follow-up. The secondary outcomes were events during kidney transplantation and post-transplant de novo diseases adjusted by propensity score in log-binomial model.\n## RESULTS\nThere were 1812 patients included in our cohort, among which 1209 (66.7%) and 603 (33.3%) recipients received pretransplant HD and PD, respectively. Recipients with chronic HD were generally older and male, had higher risks of developing post-transplant de novo ischaemic heart disease, tuberculosis and hepatitis C after adjustment. Pretransplant HD contributed to higher graft failure in the multivariate analysis (HR 1.38, p<0.05) after adjustment for the recipient age, sex, duration of dialysis and pretransplant diseases.

Method: About 582 participants aged between 65 and 80 years were enrolled from primary care centers. They completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a survey with sociodemographic characteristics and the PHQ-9. Results: The PHQ-9 revealed an acceptable internal consistency (\u03c9 = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.75-0.80] and \u03b1 = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.75-0.81]); confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a good fit for both 1- and 2-factor solutions. The chi-square difference test (\u03c72 = 0.61, gl = 1, p = 0.43) and correlation between the somatic and the cognitive-effective latent factors were very high (r = 0.97, p < 0.001), indicating that the 1 factor model was more parsimonious. Utilizing the CIDI as the gold standard, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88 (SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.84-0.90). The optimal cut-off score of \u2265 6 yielded good sensitivity and specificity for detecting MDD (0.95 and 0.76, respectively). However, considering the clinical utility index, the cut-off score of \u22659 proved to be a more effective marker for discarding cases of MDD. Conclusion: The PHQ-9 has adequate psychometric properties for elderly primary care users. In clinical settings, it showed its greatest utility in ruling out the presence of an MDD, however, its clinical value for identifying possible cases of MDD is limited. In cases above the cut-off point, it is recommended to perform a more thorough evaluation.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition among the general population, and its prevalence is even higher among patients hospitalized due to medical illnesses. It has been estimated that one out of four patients hospitalized for medical illness has a comorbid major depressive episode (MDE) The presence of depression in a patient hospitalized due to a medical illness worsens the medical prognosis, increases symptom burden, complicates self-care and treatment-adherence, extends the hospitalization stay, and inflates the costs of care and mortality. Taking into account that patients with depression can be effectively treated with medication and psychotherapy, early diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce this burden . Despite this, almost 50% of patients who suffer comorbid depression when hospitalized for medical conditions do not have the condition detected by clinicians. This is explained, at least in part, by the lack of quick and sensitive diagnostic tools, especially for use in specific languages and cultures. Structured clinical interviews such as the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)  or the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) are the gold standard for diagnosing depression. However, the use of these instruments require administration by trained mental health professionals, are time-consuming and difficult to systematically apply in routine clinical practice. This highlights the need for reliable, valid, and easily applicable self-assessment screening tools to detect depression in patients hospitalized due to a non-psychiatric medical illness. Several self-screening tools are available for screening, tracking and documenting depressive symptoms with minimal clinician time, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). To our knowledge, no studies have compared, at the same time and with the same sample, the psychometric properties of these three self-rated questionaries' with a semi-structured clinical interview in patients hospitalized for non-psychiatric medical illness. To cover this gap, we designed the present study. Our aims are to: (1) compare the operating characteristics of PHQ-9, BDI-II and HADS according to an independent criterion standard for MDE in patients hospitalized due to non-psychiatric medical illness; (2) determine the optimum cut-off scores of these self-rating scales for discriminating between patients with and without MDE in this specific group of patients. The results of this study will provide general practitioners with highly valuable information to choose an assessment tool for depression in this subgroup of patients.",

However, MDD is frequently underdiagnosed and consequently only some patients receive the appropriate treatment. The present study aims to determine the utility of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to identify MDD in a subset of PC patients participating in the large PsicAP study.\n## METHODS\nA total of 178 patients completed the full PHQ test, including the depression module (PHQ-9). Also, a Spanish version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was implemented by clinical psychologists that were blinded to the PHQ-9 results. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 as a screening tool as compared to the SCID-I as a reference standard.\n## RESULTS\nThe psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 for a cut-off value of 10 points were as follows: sensitivity, 0.95; specificity, 0.67. Using a cut-off of 12 points, the values were: sensitivity, 0.84; specificity, 0.78. Finally, using the diagnostic algorithm for depression (DSM-IV criteria), the sensitivity was 0.88 and the specificity 0.80.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAs a screening instrument, the PHQ-9 performed better with a cut-off value of 12 versus the standard cut-off of 10.

Method: About 582 participants aged between 65 and 80 years were enrolled from primary care centers. They completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a survey with sociodemographic characteristics and the PHQ-9. Results: The PHQ-9 revealed an acceptable internal consistency (\u03c9 = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.75-0.80] and \u03b1 = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.75-0.81]); confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a good fit for both 1- and 2-factor solutions. The chi-square difference test (\u03c72 = 0.61, gl = 1, p = 0.43) and correlation between the somatic and the cognitive-effective latent factors were very high (r = 0.97, p < 0.001), indicating that the 1 factor model was more parsimonious. Utilizing the CIDI as the gold standard, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88 (SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.84-0.90). The optimal cut-off score of \u2265 6 yielded good sensitivity and specificity for detecting MDD (0.95 and 0.76, respectively). However, considering the clinical utility index, the cut-off score of \u22659 proved to be a more effective marker for discarding cases of MDD. Conclusion: The PHQ-9 has adequate psychometric properties for elderly primary care users. In clinical settings, it showed its greatest utility in ruling out the presence of an MDD, however, its clinical value for identifying possible cases of MDD is limited. In cases above the cut-off point, it is recommended to perform a more thorough evaluation.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition among the general population, and its prevalence is even higher among patients hospitalized due to medical illnesses. It has been estimated that one out of four patients hospitalized for medical illness has a comorbid major depressive episode (MDE) The presence of depression in a patient hospitalized due to a medical illness worsens the medical prognosis, increases symptom burden, complicates self-care and treatment-adherence, extends the hospitalization stay, and inflates the costs of care and mortality. Taking into account that patients with depression can be effectively treated with medication and psychotherapy, early diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce this burden . Despite this, almost 50% of patients who suffer comorbid depression when hospitalized for medical conditions do not have the condition detected by clinicians. This is explained, at least in part, by the lack of quick and sensitive diagnostic tools, especially for use in specific languages and cultures. Structured clinical interviews such as the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)  or the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) are the gold standard for diagnosing depression. However, the use of these instruments require administration by trained mental health professionals, are time-consuming and difficult to systematically apply in routine clinical practice. This highlights the need for reliable, valid, and easily applicable self-assessment screening tools to detect depression in patients hospitalized due to a non-psychiatric medical illness. Several self-screening tools are available for screening, tracking and documenting depressive symptoms with minimal clinician time, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). To our knowledge, no studies have compared, at the same time and with the same sample, the psychometric properties of these three self-rated questionaries' with a semi-structured clinical interview in patients hospitalized for non-psychiatric medical illness. To cover this gap, we designed the present study. Our aims are to: (1) compare the operating characteristics of PHQ-9, BDI-II and HADS according to an independent criterion standard for MDE in patients hospitalized due to non-psychiatric medical illness; (2) determine the optimum cut-off scores of these self-rating scales for discriminating between patients with and without MDE in this specific group of patients. The results of this study will provide general practitioners with highly valuable information to choose an assessment tool for depression in this subgroup of patients.",

Also, a Spanish version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was implemented by clinical psychologists that were blinded to the PHQ-9 results. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 as a screening tool as compared to the SCID-I as a reference standard.\n## RESULTS\nThe psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 for a cut-off value of 10 points were as follows: sensitivity, 0.95; specificity, 0.67. Using a cut-off of 12 points, the values were: sensitivity, 0.84; specificity, 0.78. Finally, using the diagnostic algorithm for depression (DSM-IV criteria), the sensitivity was 0.88 and the specificity 0.80.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAs a screening instrument, the PHQ-9 performed better with a cut-off value of 12 versus the standard cut-off of 10.

Method: About 582 participants aged between 65 and 80 years were enrolled from primary care centers. They completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a survey with sociodemographic characteristics and the PHQ-9. Results: The PHQ-9 revealed an acceptable internal consistency (\u03c9 = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.75-0.80] and \u03b1 = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.75-0.81]); confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a good fit for both 1- and 2-factor solutions. The chi-square difference test (\u03c72 = 0.61, gl = 1, p = 0.43) and correlation between the somatic and the cognitive-effective latent factors were very high (r = 0.97, p < 0.001), indicating that the 1 factor model was more parsimonious. Utilizing the CIDI as the gold standard, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88 (SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.84-0.90). The optimal cut-off score of \u2265 6 yielded good sensitivity and specificity for detecting MDD (0.95 and 0.76, respectively). However, considering the clinical utility index, the cut-off score of \u22659 proved to be a more effective marker for discarding cases of MDD. Conclusion: The PHQ-9 has adequate psychometric properties for elderly primary care users. In clinical settings, it showed its greatest utility in ruling out the presence of an MDD, however, its clinical value for identifying possible cases of MDD is limited. In cases above the cut-off point, it is recommended to perform a more thorough evaluation.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition among the general population, and its prevalence is even higher among patients hospitalized due to medical illnesses. It has been estimated that one out of four patients hospitalized for medical illness has a comorbid major depressive episode (MDE) The presence of depression in a patient hospitalized due to a medical illness worsens the medical prognosis, increases symptom burden, complicates self-care and treatment-adherence, extends the hospitalization stay, and inflates the costs of care and mortality. Taking into account that patients with depression can be effectively treated with medication and psychotherapy, early diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce this burden . Despite this, almost 50% of patients who suffer comorbid depression when hospitalized for medical conditions do not have the condition detected by clinicians. This is explained, at least in part, by the lack of quick and sensitive diagnostic tools, especially for use in specific languages and cultures. Structured clinical interviews such as the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)  or the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) are the gold standard for diagnosing depression. However, the use of these instruments require administration by trained mental health professionals, are time-consuming and difficult to systematically apply in routine clinical practice. This highlights the need for reliable, valid, and easily applicable self-assessment screening tools to detect depression in patients hospitalized due to a non-psychiatric medical illness. Several self-screening tools are available for screening, tracking and documenting depressive symptoms with minimal clinician time, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). To our knowledge, no studies have compared, at the same time and with the same sample, the psychometric properties of these three self-rated questionaries' with a semi-structured clinical interview in patients hospitalized for non-psychiatric medical illness. To cover this gap, we designed the present study. Our aims are to: (1) compare the operating characteristics of PHQ-9, BDI-II and HADS according to an independent criterion standard for MDE in patients hospitalized due to non-psychiatric medical illness; (2) determine the optimum cut-off scores of these self-rating scales for discriminating between patients with and without MDE in this specific group of patients. The results of this study will provide general practitioners with highly valuable information to choose an assessment tool for depression in this subgroup of patients.",

Also, a Spanish version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was implemented by clinical psychologists that were blinded to the PHQ-9 results. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 as a screening tool as compared to the SCID-I as a reference standard.\n## RESULTS\nThe psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 for a cut-off value of 10 points were as follows: sensitivity, 0.95; specificity, 0.67. Using a cut-off of 12 points, the values were: sensitivity, 0.84; specificity, 0.78.

However, only 50% of cases are detected in PHC. The most widely used screening instrument for major depression is the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), including the two-, eight- and nine-item versions. Surprisingly, there is neither enough evidence about the validity of PHQ in PHC patients in Spain nor indications about how to interpret the total scores. This study aimed to gather validity evidence to support the use of the three PHQ versions to screen for major depression in PHC in Spain. Additionally, the present study provided information for helping professionals to choose the best PHQ version according to the context.\n## METHODS\nThe sample was composed of 2579 participants from 22 Spanish PHC centers participating in the EIRA-3 study. The reliability and validity of the three PHQ versions for Spanish PHC patients were assessed based on responses to the questionnaire.\n## RESULTS\nThe PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 showed high internal consistency. The results obtained confirm the theoretically expected relationship between PHQ results and anxiety, social support and health-related QoL. A single-factor solution was confirmed. Regarding to the level of agreement with the CIDI interview (used as the criterion), our results indicate that the PHQ has a good discrimination power. The optimal cut-off values were: \u2a7e2 for PHQ-2, \u2a7e7 for PHQ-8 and \u2a7e8 for PHQ-9.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPHQ is a good and valuable tool for detecting major depression in PHC patients in Spain.",

Previous studies suggest that combining physical exercise with cognitive stimulation may be more successful in this respect. Exergaming is a promising intervention in which physical exercise is combined with cognitively challenging tasks in a single session. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in older adults with dementia.\n## METHODS\nA three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared exergame training, aerobic training and an active control intervention consisting of relaxation and flexibility exercises. Individuals with dementia were randomized and individually trained three times a week during 12\u2009weeks. Cognitive functioning was measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention period and at 24-week follow-up by neuropsychological assessment. The domains of executive function, episodic memory, working memory and psychomotor speed were evaluated. Test scores were converted into standardized z-scores that were averaged per domain. Between-group differences were analysed with analysis of covariance.\n## RESULTS\nData from 115 people with dementia (mean (SD) age\u2009=\u200979.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) MMSE score\u2009=\u200922.9 (3.4)) were analysed.

Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training. Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters - dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances.

Participants were assessed for their cognitive function (global cognition, executive function and verbal memory) and IADL at pre- and postintervention. Changes in prefrontal cortex activation during the global cognition test were also captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to identify the potential mediating pathway of the intervention.\n## RESULTS\nBoth groups showed improved executive function and verbal memory (immediate recall). However, only the VR group showed significant improvements in global cognition (P<0.001), verbal memory (delayed recall, P=0.002), and IADL (P<0.001) after the intervention. The group \u00d7 time interaction effects further demonstrated that IADL were more significantly improved with VR training than with CPC training (P=0.006). The hemodynamic data revealed decreased activation in prefrontal areas after training (P=0.0015), indicative of increased neural efficiency, in the VR-trained subjects.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nVR-based physical and cognitive training improves cognitive function, IADL and neural efficiency in older adults with MCI.\n## CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT\nVR training could be implemented for older adults with MCI.",

The mind-body exercise, Tai Chi (TC), improves cognition and dual-task ability. Exergaming is low-cost, safe, highly scalable, and feasible. Whether the effects of exergaming-based TC is beneficial than traditional TC has not been investigated yet.\n## OBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this study was to investigate effects of exergaming-based TC on cognitive function and dual-task walking among older adults with MCI.\n## METHODS\nFifty patients with MCI were randomly assigned to an exergaming-based TC (EXER-TC) group, a traditional TC (TC) group, or a control group. The EXER-TC and TC groups received 36 training sessions (three, 50-min sessions per week) during a 12-week period. The control group received no intervention and were instructed to maintain their usual daily physical activities. The outcome variables measured included those related to cognitive function, dual-task cost (DTC), and gait performance.\n## RESULTS\nThe EXER-TC and TC groups performed better than the control group on the Chinese version of the Stroop Color and Word Test, the Trail Making Test Parts A and B, the one-back test, gait speed, and DTC of gait speed in cognitive dual-task conditions after training. However, there were no significant differences between the EXER-TC and TC groups. Compared with the control group, only the EXER-TC group experienced beneficial effects for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.\n## CONCLUSION\nEXER-TC was comparable to traditional TC for enhancement of dual-task gait performance and executive function. These results suggested that the EXER-TC approach has potential therapeutic use in older adults with MCI.",

Ten patients (aged 73.3 \u00b1 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 \u00b1 3.4) were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or control (CTR) group.

There were statistically significant positive effects on PwD's secondary outcomes at T2 on cognition [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): r\u00a0=\u00a02.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 3.96, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007; and Trail Making Test part A (TMT-A): r\u00a0=\u00a0-28.98, 95% CI:\u00a0-54.89,\u00a0-3.08, P\u00a0=\u00a0.029], social functioning (Behavior Observation Scale for Intramural Psychogeriatrics subscale 1 (GIP): r\u00a0=\u00a0-1.86, 95% CI:\u00a0-3.56,\u00a0-0.17, P\u00a0=\u00a0.031), and positive post-test effects in ICs on distress caused by the PwD's neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q total distress: r\u00a0=\u00a0-3.30, 95% CI:\u00a0-6.57,\u00a0-0.03, P\u00a0=\u00a0.048) and on sense of competence (SSCQ: r\u00a0=\u00a02.78, 95% CI: 0.85, 4.71, P\u00a0=\u00a0.005).\n## CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nExergaming appeared not effective on the primary outcomes. Despite the study being underpowered, we found positive effects on secondary outcomes for PwD and ICs, and no negative effects.

Previous studies suggest that combining physical exercise with cognitive stimulation may be more successful in this respect. Exergaming is a promising intervention in which physical exercise is combined with cognitively challenging tasks in a single session. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in older adults with dementia.\n## METHODS\nA three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared exergame training, aerobic training and an active control intervention consisting of relaxation and flexibility exercises. Individuals with dementia were randomized and individually trained three times a week during 12\u2009weeks. Cognitive functioning was measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention period and at 24-week follow-up by neuropsychological assessment. The domains of executive function, episodic memory, working memory and psychomotor speed were evaluated. Test scores were converted into standardized z-scores that were averaged per domain. Between-group differences were analysed with analysis of covariance.\n## RESULTS\nData from 115 people with dementia (mean (SD) age\u2009=\u200979.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) MMSE score\u2009=\u200922.9 (3.4)) were analysed.

Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training. Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters - dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances. Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function.",

Computing technology such as virtual reality (VR) may have the potential to assist rehabilitation in shaping brain health. However, little is known about the potential of VR-based physical and cognitive training designed as an intervention for cognition and brain activation in elderly patients with MCI. Moreover, whether a VR program designed around functional tasks can improve their instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) requires further investigation.\n## AIM\nThis study investigated the effects of 12 weeks of VR-based physical and cognitive training on cognitive function, brain activation and IADL and compared the VR intervention with combined physical and cognitive training.\n## DESIGN\nA single-blinded randomized controlled trial.\n## SETTING\nCommunities and day care centers in Taipei, Taiwan.\n## POPULATION\nOlder adults with mild cognitive impairment.\n## METHODS\nThirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomized into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Participants were assessed for their cognitive function (global cognition, executive function and verbal memory) and IADL at pre- and postintervention. Changes in prefrontal cortex activation during the global cognition test were also captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to identify the potential mediating pathway of the intervention.\n## RESULTS\nBoth groups showed improved executive function and verbal memory (immediate recall). However, only the VR group showed significant improvements in global cognition (P<0.001), verbal memory (delayed recall, P=0.002), and IADL (P<0.001) after the intervention. The group \u00d7 time interaction effects further demonstrated that IADL were more significantly improved with VR training than with CPC training (P=0.006). The hemodynamic data revealed decreased activation in prefrontal areas after training (P=0.0015), indicative of increased neural efficiency, in the VR-trained subjects.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nVR-based physical and cognitive training improves cognitive function, IADL and neural efficiency in older adults with MCI.\n## CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT\nVR training could be implemented for older adults with MCI.",

The EXER-TC and TC groups received 36 training sessions (three, 50-min sessions per week) during a 12-week period. The control group received no intervention and were instructed to maintain their usual daily physical activities. The outcome variables measured included those related to cognitive function, dual-task cost (DTC), and gait performance.\n## RESULTS\nThe EXER-TC and TC groups performed better than the control group on the Chinese version of the Stroop Color and Word Test, the Trail Making Test Parts A and B, the one-back test, gait speed, and DTC of gait speed in cognitive dual-task conditions after training. However, there were no significant differences between the EXER-TC and TC groups.

                "key_reference_abstract": "Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a broad term for people at a stage between normal age-related cognitive decline and dementia, where cognitive problems are present but do not impair activities of daily living. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation program on cognitive functions in MCI. Materials and Methods: Sixty-one older adults (25 men, 36 women) with MCI were randomized to the intervention group (n = 30; 70.12 \u00b1 2.57 years) or control (n = 31; 70.30 \u00b1 2.73 years) group. The intervention group received a VR (computer-generated interactive environments) intervention in addition to a conventional cognitive rehabilitation (CR) intervention, whereas the control group received only the CR intervention. Cognitive functions were assessed in both groups before and after the 12-week interventions by using the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed significantly greater improvements in orientation, visual-spatial perception, visuomotor organization, thinking operation, and attention/concentration functions in the VR group than in the control group (P < 0.001 for all). Conclusion: Our results showed that 12 weeks of VR-based rehabilitation enhanced cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. Using VR applications in CR is recommended to improve cognitive functions of older adults with MCI.",

Previous studies suggest that combining physical exercise with cognitive stimulation may be more successful in this respect. Exergaming is a promising intervention in which physical exercise is combined with cognitively challenging tasks in a single session. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in older adults with dementia.\n## METHODS\nA three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared exergame training, aerobic training and an active control intervention consisting of relaxation and flexibility exercises. Individuals with dementia were randomized and individually trained three times a week during 12\u2009weeks. Cognitive functioning was measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention period and at 24-week follow-up by neuropsychological assessment. The domains of executive function, episodic memory, working memory and psychomotor speed were evaluated. Test scores were converted into standardized z-scores that were averaged per domain. Between-group differences were analysed with analysis of covariance.\n## RESULTS\nData from 115 people with dementia (mean (SD) age\u2009=\u200979.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) MMSE score\u2009=\u200922.9 (3.4)) were analysed. There was a significant improvement in psychomotor speed in the aerobic and exergame groups compared to the active control group (mean difference domain score (95% CI) aerobic versus control 0.370 (0.103-0.637), p\u2009=\u20090.007; exergame versus control 0.326 (0.081-0.571), p\u2009=\u20090.009). The effect size was moderate (partial \u03b7\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTo our knowledge, this is the first RCT evaluating the effects of exergame training and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in people with dementia. We found that both exergame training and aerobic training improve psychomotor speed, compared to an active control group. This finding may be clinically relevant as psychomotor speed is an important predictor for functional decline. No effects were found on executive function, episodic memory and working memory.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nNetherlands Trial Register, NTR5581 . Registered on 7 October 2015.",

Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training. Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters - dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances.

In a randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 68 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The MCI diagnosis was based on medical evaluations through a clinical interview conducted by a dementia specialist. Cognitive assessments were performed by neuropsychologists according to standardized methods, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and frontal cognitive function: trail making test (TMT) A & B, and symbol digit substitute test (SDST). Resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured in eyes open and eyes closed conditions for 5 minutes each, with a 19-channel wireless EEG device. The VR intervention program (3 times/week, 100 min each session) comprised four types of VR game-based content to improve the attention, memory and processing speed. Analysis of the subjects for group-time interactions revealed that the intervention group exhibited a significantly improved executive function and brain function at the resting state. Additionally, gait speed and mobility were also significantly improved between and after the follow-up. The VR-based training program improved cognitive and physical function in patients with MCI relative to controls. Encouraging patients to perform VR and game-based training may be beneficial to prevent cognitive decline.",

This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation program on cognitive functions in MCI. Materials and Methods: Sixty-one older adults (25 men, 36 women) with MCI were randomized to the intervention group (n = 30; 70.12 \u00b1 2.57 years) or control (n = 31; 70.30 \u00b1 2.73 years) group. The intervention group received a VR (computer-generated interactive environments) intervention in addition to a conventional cognitive rehabilitation (CR) intervention, whereas the control group received only the CR intervention. Cognitive functions were assessed in both groups before and after the 12-week interventions by using the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed significantly greater improvements in orientation, visual-spatial perception, visuomotor organization, thinking operation, and attention/concentration functions in the VR group than in the control group (P < 0.001 for all).

We hypothesized that the dispatcher instructions to bystanders to provide chest compression alone would result in improved survival as compared with instructions to provide chest compression plus rescue breathing.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted a multicenter, randomized trial of dispatcher instructions to bystanders for performing CPR. The patients were persons 18 years of age or older with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for whom dispatchers initiated CPR instruction to bystanders. Patients were randomly assigned to receive chest compression alone or chest compression plus rescue breathing. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included a favorable neurologic outcome at discharge.\n## RESULTS\nOf the 1941 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 981 were randomly assigned to receive chest compression alone and 960 to receive chest compression plus rescue breathing. We observed no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients who survived to hospital discharge (12.5% with chest compression alone and 11.0% with chest compression plus rescue breathing, P=0.31) or in the proportion who survived with a favorable neurologic outcome in the two sites that assessed this secondary outcome (14.4% and 11.5%, respectively; P=0.13). Prespecified subgroup analyses showed a trend toward a higher proportion of patients surviving to hospital discharge with chest compression alone as compared with chest compression plus rescue breathing for patients with a cardiac cause of arrest (15.5% vs. 12.3%, P=0.09) and for those with shockable rhythms (31.9% vs. 25.7%, P=0.09).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDispatcher instruction consisting of chest compression alone did not increase the survival rate overall, although there was a trend toward better outcomes in key clinical subgroups.

Long term survival, defined as being awake 14 days after CPR, was 16% (13-19%) in patients with correct bystander CPR; 10% (7-14%) and 2% (0-9%), respectively when only ECC or only MMV was performed; 7% (6-8%) when no bystander was involved; 4% (0-8%) when bystander CPR was performed incorrectly. Bystander CPR might have a beneficial effect on survival by maintaining the heart in ventricular fibrillation by ECC. A negative effect of badly performed bystander CPR was not observed compared to cases which had not received bystander CPR.",

In a prospective study, all bystander witnessed circulatory arrests resuscitated by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, were recorded consecutively. Univariate differences in survival were calculated for various witnesses, the performance of basic CPR, the quality of CPR, the performers of CPR and the delays. A logistic regression model for survival was developed from all potential predictors of these first two links. From the 922 included patients, 93 survived to hospital discharge. In 21% of the cases, the witness did not immediately call 112, but first called others, resulting in a longer delay and a lower survival. Family members were frequent witnesses of the arrest (44%), but seldom started basic CPR (11%). Survival, when basic CPR performers were untrained and had no previous experience, was similar to that when no basic CPR was performed (6%). Not performing basic CPR, delay in basic CPR, the interval between basic CPR and EMS arrival, and being both untrained and inexperienced in basic CPR were independent predictors for survival. Basic CPR performed by persons trained a long time ago did not appear to have a negative influence on outcome, nor did basic CPR limited to chest compressions alone. The mere reporting that basic CPR has been performed does not describe adequately the actual value of basic CPR. The interval from collapse to initiation of basic CPR, and the training and experience of the performer must be taken into account.

Our hypothesis was that both cardiac-only bystander resuscitation and conventional bystander CPR would improve outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of < or = 15 minutes' duration, whereas the addition of rescue breathing would improve outcomes for cardiac arrests lasting > 15 minutes.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nWe carried out a prospective, population-based, observational study involving consecutive patients with emergency responder resuscitation attempts from May 1, 1998, through April 30, 2003. The primary outcome measure was 1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between type of CPR and outcomes. Among the 4902 witnessed cardiac arrests, 783 received conventional CPR, and 544 received cardiac-only resuscitation. Excluding very-long-duration cardiac arrests (> 15 minutes), the cardiac-only resuscitation yielded a higher rate of 1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome than no bystander CPR (4.3% versus 2.5%; odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.95), and conventional CPR showed similar effectiveness (4.1%; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.60). For the very-long-duration arrests, neurologically favorable 1-year survival was greater in the conventional CPR group, but there were few survivors regardless of the type of bystander CPR (0.3% [2 of 624], 0% [0 of 92], and 2.2% [3 of 139] in the no bystander CPR, cardiac-only CPR, and conventional CPR groups, respectively; P<0.05).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBystander-initiated cardiac-only resuscitation and conventional CPR are similarly effective for most adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.

The patients were persons 18 years of age or older with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for whom dispatchers initiated CPR instruction to bystanders. Patients were randomly assigned to receive chest compression alone or chest compression plus rescue breathing. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.

We observed no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients who survived to hospital discharge (12.5% with chest compression alone and 11.0% with chest compression plus rescue breathing, P=0.31) or in the proportion who survived with a favorable neurologic outcome in the two sites that assessed this secondary outcome (14.4% and 11.5%, respectively; P=0.13).

The rate of 30-day survival was similar in the two groups: 8.7% (54 of 620 patients) in the group receiving compression-only CPR and 7.0% (46 of 656 patients) in the group receiving standard CPR (absolute difference for compression-only vs. standard CPR, 1.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.2 to 4.6; P=0.29).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis prospective, randomized study showed no significant difference with respect to survival at 30 days between instructions given by an emergency medical dispatcher, before the arrival of EMS personnel, for compression-only CPR and instructions for standard CPR in patients with suspected, witnessed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

In a prospective study, all bystander witnessed circulatory arrests resuscitated by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, were recorded consecutively. Univariate differences in survival were calculated for various witnesses, the performance of basic CPR, the quality of CPR, the performers of CPR and the delays. A logistic regression model for survival was developed from all potential predictors of these first two links. From the 922 included patients, 93 survived to hospital discharge. In 21% of the cases, the witness did not immediately call 112, but first called others, resulting in a longer delay and a lower survival. Family members were frequent witnesses of the arrest (44%), but seldom started basic CPR (11%). Survival, when basic CPR performers were untrained and had no previous experience, was similar to that when no basic CPR was performed (6%). Not performing basic CPR, delay in basic CPR, the interval between basic CPR and EMS arrival, and being both untrained and inexperienced in basic CPR were independent predictors for survival. Basic CPR performed by persons trained a long time ago did not appear to have a negative influence on outcome, nor did basic CPR limited to chest compressions alone. The mere reporting that basic CPR has been performed does not describe adequately the actual value of basic CPR. The interval from collapse to initiation of basic CPR, and the training and experience of the performer must be taken into account.

Our hypothesis was that both cardiac-only bystander resuscitation and conventional bystander CPR would improve outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of < or = 15 minutes' duration, whereas the addition of rescue breathing would improve outcomes for cardiac arrests lasting > 15 minutes.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nWe carried out a prospective, population-based, observational study involving consecutive patients with emergency responder resuscitation attempts from May 1, 1998, through April 30, 2003. The primary outcome measure was 1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between type of CPR and outcomes. Among the 4902 witnessed cardiac arrests, 783 received conventional CPR, and 544 received cardiac-only resuscitation. Excluding very-long-duration cardiac arrests (> 15 minutes), the cardiac-only resuscitation yielded a higher rate of 1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome than no bystander CPR (4.3% versus 2.5%; odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.95), and conventional CPR showed similar effectiveness (4.1%; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.60). For the very-long-duration arrests, neurologically favorable 1-year survival was greater in the conventional CPR group, but there were few survivors regardless of the type of bystander CPR (0.3% [2 of 624], 0% [0 of 92], and 2.2% [3 of 139] in the no bystander CPR, cardiac-only CPR, and conventional CPR groups, respectively; P<0.05).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBystander-initiated cardiac-only resuscitation and conventional CPR are similarly effective for most adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.

We observed no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients who survived to hospital discharge (12.5% with chest compression alone and 11.0% with chest compression plus rescue breathing, P=0.31) or in the proportion who survived with a favorable neurologic outcome in the two sites that assessed this secondary outcome (14.4% and 11.5%, respectively; P=0.13).

The results support a strategy for CPR performed by laypersons that emphasizes chest compression and minimizes the role of rescue breathing.

That study, however, was not powered to assess a possible difference in survival. The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to evaluate the possible superiority of compression-only CPR over standard CPR with respect to survival.\n## METHODS\nPatients with suspected, witnessed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomly assigned to undergo either compression-only CPR or standard CPR.

In a prospective study, all bystander witnessed circulatory arrests resuscitated by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, were recorded consecutively. Univariate differences in survival were calculated for various witnesses, the performance of basic CPR, the quality of CPR, the performers of CPR and the delays. A logistic regression model for survival was developed from all potential predictors of these first two links. From the 922 included patients, 93 survived to hospital discharge. In 21% of the cases, the witness did not immediately call 112, but first called others, resulting in a longer delay and a lower survival. Family members were frequent witnesses of the arrest (44%), but seldom started basic CPR (11%). Survival, when basic CPR performers were untrained and had no previous experience, was similar to that when no basic CPR was performed (6%). Not performing basic CPR, delay in basic CPR, the interval between basic CPR and EMS arrival, and being both untrained and inexperienced in basic CPR were independent predictors for survival. Basic CPR performed by persons trained a long time ago did not appear to have a negative influence on outcome, nor did basic CPR limited to chest compressions alone. The mere reporting that basic CPR has been performed does not describe adequately the actual value of basic CPR. The interval from collapse to initiation of basic CPR, and the training and experience of the performer must be taken into account.

Our hypothesis was that both cardiac-only bystander resuscitation and conventional bystander CPR would improve outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of < or = 15 minutes' duration, whereas the addition of rescue breathing would improve outcomes for cardiac arrests lasting > 15 minutes.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nWe carried out a prospective, population-based, observational study involving consecutive patients with emergency responder resuscitation attempts from May 1, 1998, through April 30, 2003. The primary outcome measure was 1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between type of CPR and outcomes. Among the 4902 witnessed cardiac arrests, 783 received conventional CPR, and 544 received cardiac-only resuscitation. Excluding very-long-duration cardiac arrests (> 15 minutes), the cardiac-only resuscitation yielded a higher rate of 1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome than no bystander CPR (4.3% versus 2.5%; odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.95), and conventional CPR showed similar effectiveness (4.1%; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.60). For the very-long-duration arrests, neurologically favorable 1-year survival was greater in the conventional CPR group, but there were few survivors regardless of the type of bystander CPR (0.3% [2 of 624], 0% [0 of 92], and 2.2% [3 of 139] in the no bystander CPR, cardiac-only CPR, and conventional CPR groups, respectively; P<0.05).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBystander-initiated cardiac-only resuscitation and conventional CPR are similarly effective for most adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.

We compared the observed frequency of heavy exertion (6 or more metabolic equivalents) with the expected values using two types of self-matched analyses based on a new case-crossover study design.

The estimated relative risk of myocardial infarction in the hour after heavy physical exertion, as compared with less strenuous physical exertion or none, was 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 7.7), Among people who usually exercised less than one, one to two, three to four, or five or more times per week, the respective relative risks were 107 (95 percent confidence interval, 67 to 171), 19.4 (9.9 to 38.1), 8.6 (3.6 to 20.5), and 2.4 (1.5 to 3.7). Thus, increasing levels of habitual physical activity were associated with progressively lower relative risks. The induction time from heavy exertion to the onset of myocardial infarction was less than one hour, and symptoms usually began during the activity.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nHeavy physical exertion can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction, particularly in people who are habitually sedentary. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which heavy physical exertion triggers the onset of myocardial infarction and the manner in which regular exertion protects against it would facilitate the design of new preventive approaches.",

Previous studies have suggested a higher risk of cardiac events in association with exertion.\n## METHODS\nConsecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were identified by recording all admissions to our hospital in Berlin and by monitoring a general population of 330,000 residents in Augsburg, Germany. Information on the circumstances of each infarction was obtained by means of standardized interviews. The data analysis included a comparison of patients with matched controls and a case-crossover comparison (one in which each patient serves as his or her own control) of the patient's usual frequency of exertion with the last episode of exertion before the onset of myocardial infarction.\n## RESULTS\nFrom January 1989 through December 1991, 1194 patients (74 percent of whom were men; mean age [+/- SD], 61 +/- 9 years) completed the interview 13 +/- 6 days after infarction. We found that 7.1 percent of the case patients had engaged in physical exertion (> or = 6 metabolic equivalents) at the onset of infarction, as compared with 3.9 percent of the controls at the onset of the control event. For the patients as compared with the matched controls, the adjusted relative risk of having engaged in strenuous physical activity at the onset of infarction or the control event was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.6). The case-crossover comparison yielded a similar relative risk of 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.1) for having engaged in strenuous physical activity within one hour before myocardial infarction. Patients whose frequency of regular exercise was less than four and four or more times per week had relative risks of 6.9 and 1.3, respectively (P < 0.01).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA period of strenuous physical activity is associated with a temporary increase in the risk of having a myocardial infarction, particularly among patients who exercise infrequently. These findings should aid in the identification of the triggering mechanisms for myocardial infarction and improve prevention of this common and serious disorder.",

Data were gathered on potential triggers of MI occurring immediately prior to the event and during the previous year. Results are presented for the 858 patients who were sexually active in the year prior to the MI, with attention to the 273 patients who had coronary artery disease prior to their index MI, and the effect of regular exertion on risk.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nThe relative risk of nonfatal MI following sexual activity.\n## RESULTS\nOf the 858 patients, 79(9%) reported sexual activity in the 24 hours preceding MI, and 27(3%) reported sexual activity in the 2 hours preceding onset of symptoms of MI. The relative risk of MI occurring in the 2 hours after sexual activity was 2.5(95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.7). The relative risk of triggering onset of MI among patients with a history of prior angina (2.1 [95% CI, 0.8-5.8]) or prior MI (2.9 [95% CI, 1.3-6.5]) was not greater than that observed in those without prior cardiac disease. Sexual activity was a likely contributor to the onset of MI in only 0.9% of cases and regular exertion was associated with decreasing risk.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSexual activity can trigger the onset of MI. However, the relative risk is low, and since the absolute hourly risk of MI is extremely low, the absolute risk increase caused by sexual activity also is extremely low (1 chance in a million for a healthy individual). Moreover, the relative risk is not increased in patients with a prior history of cardiac disease and regular exercise appears to prevent triggering. These findings should be useful for counseling patients and decreasing the fear of sexual activity that often prevents complete rehabilitation from cardiovascular disease.",

This study aimed to address the main daily triggers of typical chest pain as a marker of acute coronary syndrome onset and assessed the sex-related differences regarding these triggers among Iranians.\n## BASIC METHODS\nA case-crossover study was conducted on 198 consecutive patients with a first event of acute myocardial infarction admitted to the coronary care unit of Shafa hospital in Kerman. Patients were interviewed about the baseline characteristics as well as potential triggers of chest pain experienced over the day before the diagnosed onset of disease. The start of diagnostic chest pain was used as a marker of disease onset. The hazard period was defined as 12-h period of onset of chest pain.\n## MAIN RESULTS\nAmong probable triggers, only unsuspected sudden bad news and sexual activity had significant relationships with chest pain appearance during the hazard period. Among patients with the experience of bad news, the risk of chest pain occurrence during the hazard period was 6.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-31.8]. Also, among those who were exposed to sexual activity, this risk was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-10.4). Risk of chest pain following bad news was specific to men with a risk of 9.9 (95% CI 1.1-87.6) and risk of event following sexual activity was specific to women with a risk of 13.3 (95% CI 1.4-120.9).\n## CONCLUSION\nUnsuspected sudden bad news can be an important trigger for acute cardiac events in men, whereas sexual activity can act as a strong trigger for these events among women. Counseling in high-risk groups should be focused on men with considerable sudden emotional stressors in their lives and also on women during the ages of active sexual function.",

The relative risk of dying during or within one hour after terminating physical activity of at least 6 metabolic equivalents was 3.0 in comparison to time without activity.

To address these questions, we collected data from patients with confirmed myocardial infarction on their activities one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction and during control periods.\n## METHODS\nInterviews with 1228 patients conducted an average of four days after myocardial infarction provided data on their usual annual frequency of physical activity and the time, type, and intensity of physical exertion in the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. We compared the observed frequency of heavy exertion (6 or more metabolic equivalents) with the expected values using two types of self-matched analyses based on a new case-crossover study design. The low frequency of heavy exertion during the control periods was validated by data from a population-based control group of 218 subjects.\n## RESULTS\nOf the patients, 4.4 percent reported heavy exertion within one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction. The estimated relative risk of myocardial infarction in the hour after heavy physical exertion, as compared with less strenuous physical exertion or none, was 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 7.7), Among people who usually exercised less than one, one to two, three to four, or five or more times per week, the respective relative risks were 107 (95 percent confidence interval, 67 to 171), 19.4 (9.9 to 38.1), 8.6 (3.6 to 20.5), and 2.4 (1.5 to 3.7). Thus, increasing levels of habitual physical activity were associated with progressively lower relative risks. The induction time from heavy exertion to the onset of myocardial infarction was less than one hour, and symptoms usually began during the activity.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nHeavy physical exertion can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction, particularly in people who are habitually sedentary. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which heavy physical exertion triggers the onset of myocardial infarction and the manner in which regular exertion protects against it would facilitate the design of new preventive approaches.",

Previous studies have suggested a higher risk of cardiac events in association with exertion.\n## METHODS\nConsecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were identified by recording all admissions to our hospital in Berlin and by monitoring a general population of 330,000 residents in Augsburg, Germany. Information on the circumstances of each infarction was obtained by means of standardized interviews. The data analysis included a comparison of patients with matched controls and a case-crossover comparison (one in which each patient serves as his or her own control) of the patient's usual frequency of exertion with the last episode of exertion before the onset of myocardial infarction.\n## RESULTS\nFrom January 1989 through December 1991, 1194 patients (74 percent of whom were men; mean age [+/- SD], 61 +/- 9 years) completed the interview 13 +/- 6 days after infarction. We found that 7.1 percent of the case patients had engaged in physical exertion (> or = 6 metabolic equivalents) at the onset of infarction, as compared with 3.9 percent of the controls at the onset of the control event. For the patients as compared with the matched controls, the adjusted relative risk of having engaged in strenuous physical activity at the onset of infarction or the control event was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.6). The case-crossover comparison yielded a similar relative risk of 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.1) for having engaged in strenuous physical activity within one hour before myocardial infarction. Patients whose frequency of regular exercise was less than four and four or more times per week had relative risks of 6.9 and 1.3, respectively (P < 0.01).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA period of strenuous physical activity is associated with a temporary increase in the risk of having a myocardial infarction, particularly among patients who exercise infrequently.

We evaluated whether the risk of having an AMI triggered by physical exertion exhibits an exposure-response relationship, and whether it varies by ambient temperature or by taking place indoors or outdoors.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nWe conducted a case-crossover study within the Myocardial Infarction Registry in Augsburg, Germany in 1999-2003. One thousand three hundred and one patients reported levels of activity and time spent outdoors on the day of AMI and three preceding days in an interview. The case-crossover analyses showed an association of physical exertion with AMI symptom onset within 2 h, which was strong for strenuous exertion (METs >or= 6) [relative risk (RR) 5.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-9.0), and still significant for moderate exertion (METs = 5) (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1) compared to very light or no exertion. Strenuous exertion outside was associated with a four-fold larger RR of AMI symptom onset than exertion performed indoors, which was not explained by temperature.\n## CONCLUSION\nThis study confirms previous results and shows a graded exposure-response relationship between physical exertion intensity and triggering of AMI onset.

Habitual moderate to vigorous exertion modified this transient risk (P = .005 for interaction) and the risk was no longer significantly elevated among those who exercised 2 or more hours per week. In the cohort analyses, an increasing amount of moderate to vigorous exercise was associated with a lower long-term risk of sudden cardiac death in age-adjusted and multivariable models that excluded biological intermediates (P = .006 for trend).

The relative risk of MI occurring in the 2 hours after sexual activity was 2.5(95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.7). The relative risk of triggering onset of MI among patients with a history of prior angina (2.1 [95% CI, 0.8-5.8]) or prior MI (2.9 [95% CI, 1.3-6.5]) was not greater than that observed in those without prior cardiac disease.

This study aimed to address the main daily triggers of typical chest pain as a marker of acute coronary syndrome onset and assessed the sex-related differences regarding these triggers among Iranians.\n## BASIC METHODS\nA case-crossover study was conducted on 198 consecutive patients with a first event of acute myocardial infarction admitted to the coronary care unit of Shafa hospital in Kerman. Patients were interviewed about the baseline characteristics as well as potential triggers of chest pain experienced over the day before the diagnosed onset of disease. The start of diagnostic chest pain was used as a marker of disease onset. The hazard period was defined as 12-h period of onset of chest pain.\n## MAIN RESULTS\nAmong probable triggers, only unsuspected sudden bad news and sexual activity had significant relationships with chest pain appearance during the hazard period. Among patients with the experience of bad news, the risk of chest pain occurrence during the hazard period was 6.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-31.8]. Also, among those who were exposed to sexual activity, this risk was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-10.4). Risk of chest pain following bad news was specific to men with a risk of 9.9 (95% CI 1.1-87.6) and risk of event following sexual activity was specific to women with a risk of 13.3 (95% CI 1.4-120.9).\n## CONCLUSION\nUnsuspected sudden bad news can be an important trigger for acute cardiac events in men, whereas sexual activity can act as a strong trigger for these events among women. Counseling in high-risk groups should be focused on men with considerable sudden emotional stressors in their lives and also on women during the ages of active sexual function.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nDespite anecdotal evidence suggesting that heavy physical exertion can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction, there have been no controlled studies of the risk of myocardial infarction during and after heavy exertion, the length of time between heavy exertion and the onset of symptoms (induction time), and whether the risk can be modified by regular physical exertion. To address these questions, we collected data from patients with confirmed myocardial infarction on their activities one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction and during control periods.\n## METHODS\nInterviews with 1228 patients conducted an average of four days after myocardial infarction provided data on their usual annual frequency of physical activity and the time, type, and intensity of physical exertion in the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. We compared the observed frequency of heavy exertion (6 or more metabolic equivalents) with the expected values using two types of self-matched analyses based on a new case-crossover study design. The low frequency of heavy exertion during the control periods was validated by data from a population-based control group of 218 subjects.\n## RESULTS\nOf the patients, 4.4 percent reported heavy exertion within one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction. The estimated relative risk of myocardial infarction in the hour after heavy physical exertion, as compared with less strenuous physical exertion or none, was 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 7.7), Among people who usually exercised less than one, one to two, three to four, or five or more times per week, the respective relative risks were 107 (95 percent confidence interval, 67 to 171), 19.4 (9.9 to 38.1), 8.6 (3.6 to 20.5), and 2.4 (1.5 to 3.7). Thus, increasing levels of habitual physical activity were associated with progressively lower relative risks. The induction time from heavy exertion to the onset of myocardial infarction was less than one hour, and symptoms usually began during the activity.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nHeavy physical exertion can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction, particularly in people who are habitually sedentary. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which heavy physical exertion triggers the onset of myocardial infarction and the manner in which regular exertion protects against it would facilitate the design of new preventive approaches.",

Previous studies have suggested a higher risk of cardiac events in association with exertion.\n## METHODS\nConsecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were identified by recording all admissions to our hospital in Berlin and by monitoring a general population of 330,000 residents in Augsburg, Germany. Information on the circumstances of each infarction was obtained by means of standardized interviews. The data analysis included a comparison of patients with matched controls and a case-crossover comparison (one in which each patient serves as his or her own control) of the patient's usual frequency of exertion with the last episode of exertion before the onset of myocardial infarction.\n## RESULTS\nFrom January 1989 through December 1991, 1194 patients (74 percent of whom were men; mean age [+/- SD], 61 +/- 9 years) completed the interview 13 +/- 6 days after infarction. We found that 7.1 percent of the case patients had engaged in physical exertion (> or = 6 metabolic equivalents) at the onset of infarction, as compared with 3.9 percent of the controls at the onset of the control event. For the patients as compared with the matched controls, the adjusted relative risk of having engaged in strenuous physical activity at the onset of infarction or the control event was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.6). The case-crossover comparison yielded a similar relative risk of 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.1) for having engaged in strenuous physical activity within one hour before myocardial infarction. Patients whose frequency of regular exercise was less than four and four or more times per week had relative risks of 6.9 and 1.3, respectively (P < 0.01).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA period of strenuous physical activity is associated with a temporary increase in the risk of having a myocardial infarction, particularly among patients who exercise infrequently.

Data were gathered on potential triggers of MI occurring immediately prior to the event and during the previous year. Results are presented for the 858 patients who were sexually active in the year prior to the MI, with attention to the 273 patients who had coronary artery disease prior to their index MI, and the effect of regular exertion on risk.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nThe relative risk of nonfatal MI following sexual activity.\n## RESULTS\nOf the 858 patients, 79(9%) reported sexual activity in the 24 hours preceding MI, and 27(3%) reported sexual activity in the 2 hours preceding onset of symptoms of MI. The relative risk of MI occurring in the 2 hours after sexual activity was 2.5(95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.7). The relative risk of triggering onset of MI among patients with a history of prior angina (2.1 [95% CI, 0.8-5.8]) or prior MI (2.9 [95% CI, 1.3-6.5]) was not greater than that observed in those without prior cardiac disease. Sexual activity was a likely contributor to the onset of MI in only 0.9% of cases and regular exertion was associated with decreasing risk.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSexual activity can trigger the onset of MI. However, the relative risk is low, and since the absolute hourly risk of MI is extremely low, the absolute risk increase caused by sexual activity also is extremely low (1 chance in a million for a healthy individual). Moreover, the relative risk is not increased in patients with a prior history of cardiac disease and regular exercise appears to prevent triggering. These findings should be useful for counseling patients and decreasing the fear of sexual activity that often prevents complete rehabilitation from cardiovascular disease.",

This study aimed to address the main daily triggers of typical chest pain as a marker of acute coronary syndrome onset and assessed the sex-related differences regarding these triggers among Iranians.\n## BASIC METHODS\nA case-crossover study was conducted on 198 consecutive patients with a first event of acute myocardial infarction admitted to the coronary care unit of Shafa hospital in Kerman. Patients were interviewed about the baseline characteristics as well as potential triggers of chest pain experienced over the day before the diagnosed onset of disease. The start of diagnostic chest pain was used as a marker of disease onset. The hazard period was defined as 12-h period of onset of chest pain.\n## MAIN RESULTS\nAmong probable triggers, only unsuspected sudden bad news and sexual activity had significant relationships with chest pain appearance during the hazard period. Among patients with the experience of bad news, the risk of chest pain occurrence during the hazard period was 6.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-31.8]. Also, among those who were exposed to sexual activity, this risk was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-10.4). Risk of chest pain following bad news was specific to men with a risk of 9.9 (95% CI 1.1-87.6) and risk of event following sexual activity was specific to women with a risk of 13.3 (95% CI 1.4-120.9).\n## CONCLUSION\nUnsuspected sudden bad news can be an important trigger for acute cardiac events in men, whereas sexual activity can act as a strong trigger for these events among women. Counseling in high-risk groups should be focused on men with considerable sudden emotional stressors in their lives and also on women during the ages of active sexual function.",

In an out of hospital cardiac death study in Slovenia, case crossover design was used to investigate physical activity as a potential trigger of sudden cardiac death in connection with certain life style, biological and social risk factors.\nResults: In the study, 206 sudden cardiac deaths were selected: 166 men and 40 women with median age at death 57.8 and 59.0 years, respectively. The relative risk of dying during or within one hour after terminating physical activity of at least 6 metabolic equivalents was 3.0 in comparison to time without activity. The relative risk of people who performed 1.5 hours or more physical activity per week was 2.55 (95 % confidence limits: 1.69\u20133.84), opposed to 49.90 (confidence limits: 18.73\u2013132.96) for persons who performed less activity. According to the observed characteristics the risk of dying for inactive sudden cardiac victims was 17.13 to 25.89 (95 % confidence limits: 11.28\u201344.60) times higher in comparison to physically active persons. Persons who drank more than 4 international units of alcohol per day, positive family history, ischaemic heart disease and a heart rate of more than 90 beats/minute had the highest risk.\nConclusion: The results confirmed that the risk of dying due to sudden cardiac death during physical activity depends on the degree of physical activity regularly performed and the existing risk factors.

However, the effect of a calcium supplement of 1000 mg per day on the axial bone density of postmenopausal women with higher calcium intakes is not known.\n## METHODS\nWe studied 122 normal women at least three years after they had reached menopause who had a mean dietary calcium intake of 750 mg per day. The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

Calcium use was of significant benefit in the lumbar spine (P = 0.04), and in Ward's triangle the rate of loss was reduced by 67 percent (P = 0.04). Calcium supplementation had a similar effect whether dietary calcium intake was above or below the mean value for the group. Serum parathyroid hormone concentrations tended to be lower in the calcium group, as were urinary hydroxyproline excretion and serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation significantly slowed axial and appendicular bone loss in normal post-menopausal women.",

We conclude that long-term administration of calcium supplements to elderly women partially reverses age-related increases in serum PTH level and bone resorption and decreases bone loss.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L.

Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover.

There was no significant difference in tablet compliance.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium intake.

To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

There was no significant difference in tablet compliance.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium intake.

However, poor adherence to therapy is a common clinical problem. To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

There was no significant difference in tablet compliance.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups.

To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

Reluctance to take a placebo and the desire to know tablet allocation were reasons given for not taking part in the blinded, placebo-controlled design. There was no significant difference in tablet compliance. Open trial participants were more likely to remain in the trial for one year (difference 13.9%, 95% confidence interval 3.1-24.6%), mainly reflecting the high retention of the open trial no tablet group compared to the open trial tablet group (difference 23.6%, 95% confidence interval 11.9-35.2%). The odds ratio for reporting an adverse event in the open trial compared to the blinded, placebo-controlled design was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.28-1.49), and for reporting a fracture was 0.81 (0.36-1.85).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe conclude that using an open trial design may enhance participant recruitment and retention and thus improve generalizability and statistical power, but withdrawal rates may differ between the study allocations and may threaten the internal validity of the trial.",

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium intake.

To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups.

To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

There was no significant difference in tablet compliance.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium intake.

However, poor adherence to therapy is a common clinical problem. To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

There was no significant difference in tablet compliance.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium intake.

However, poor adherence to therapy is a common clinical problem. To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups.

However, poor adherence to therapy is a common clinical problem. To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

There was no significant difference in tablet compliance. Open trial participants were more likely to remain in the trial for one year (difference 13.9%, 95% confidence interval 3.1-24.6%), mainly reflecting the high retention of the open trial no tablet group compared to the open trial tablet group (difference 23.6%, 95% confidence interval 11.9-35.2%). The odds ratio for reporting an adverse event in the open trial compared to the blinded, placebo-controlled design was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.28-1.49), and for reporting a fracture was 0.81 (0.36-1.85).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe conclude that using an open trial design may enhance participant recruitment and retention and thus improve generalizability and statistical power, but withdrawal rates may differ between the study allocations and may threaten the internal validity of the trial.",

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium intake.

However, poor adherence to therapy is a common clinical problem. To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

There was no significant difference in tablet compliance. Open trial participants were more likely to remain in the trial for one year (difference 13.9%, 95% confidence interval 3.1-24.6%), mainly reflecting the high retention of the open trial no tablet group compared to the open trial tablet group (difference 23.6%, 95% confidence interval 11.9-35.2%). The odds ratio for reporting an adverse event in the open trial compared to the blinded, placebo-controlled design was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.28-1.49), and for reporting a fracture was 0.81 (0.36-1.85).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe conclude that using an open trial design may enhance participant recruitment and retention and thus improve generalizability and statistical power, but withdrawal rates may differ between the study allocations and may threaten the internal validity of the trial.",

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium intake.

However, poor adherence to therapy is a common clinical problem. To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Secondary outcomes included the percentage of patients with normal calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid\u00a0hormone (iPTH) blood levels. Safety measures included incidence of hypercalcemia and hypervitaminosis D.\n## MEASUREMENTS\nBlood calcium and phosphate were measured weekly; iPTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D), and bone turnover markers, trimonthly; fetuin A and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) serum levels and aortic calcification scores were determined at weeks 0 and\u00a039.\n## RESULTS\nThe primary end point significantly increased in the treatment group compared with the placebo group (61.5% vs 7.4%; P<0.001), as well as 1,25(OH)2D levels (22.5 [IQR, 15-26] vs 11 [IQR, 10-15]pg/mL; P<0.001) and the proportion of patients achieving the target calcium level (76.9% vs 48.2%; P=0.03).

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Bone density was measured at three WHI centers.\n## RESULTS\nHip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group (P<0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

There was no significant difference in tablet compliance.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium intake.

To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Bone density was measured at three WHI centers.\n## RESULTS\nHip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group (P<0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.",

There was no significant difference in tablet compliance.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.\n## METHODS\nIn a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6-12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.",

Serum and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSerum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.\n## RESULTS\nBefore study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium intake.

However, poor adherence to therapy is a common clinical problem. To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.",

Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nFour study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance exercise effects on physical functioning.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and mobility.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00986466.",

The results demonstrated that daily 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for fracture prevention.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this trial was to assess the effects of daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000\u00a0IU (100\u00a0\u03bcg), 2000\u00a0IU (50\u00a0\u03bcg) or placebo for 1\u00a0year on biochemical markers of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for prevention of fractures and other outcomes.\n## METHODS\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305 community-dwelling people aged 65\u00a0years or older in Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D], parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase), cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.\n## RESULTS\nMean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18) nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/L after 12\u00a0months in those allocated 4000\u00a0IU, 2000\u00a0IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90\u00a0nmol/L). Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels of 4000 versus 2000\u00a0IU was similar in all subgroups except for body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in overweight and obese participants compared with normal-weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on measures of physical function.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAfter accounting for average 70% compliance in long-term trials, doses of 4000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 daily may be required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with lowest disease risk in observational studies.",

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.",

Research examining mobile phone\u2012based mHealth programs for people with psychosis has shown that these approaches are feasible, acceptable, and clinically promising. However, most mHealth initiatives involving people with schizophrenia have spanned periods ranging from a few days to several weeks and have typically involved participants who were clinically stable.\n## OBJECTIVE\nOur aim was to evaluate the viability of extended mHealth interventions for people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders following hospital discharge. Specifically, we set out to examine the following: (1) Can individuals be engaged with a mobile phone intervention program during this high-risk period?, (2) Are age, gender, racial background, or hospitalization history associated with their engagement or persistence in using a mobile phone intervention over time?, and (3) Does engagement differ by characteristics of the mHealth intervention itself (ie, pre-programmed vs on-demand functions)?\n## METHODS\nWe examined mHealth intervention use and demographic and clinical predictors of engagement in 342 individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who were given the FOCUS mobile phone intervention as part of a technology-assisted relapse prevention program during the 6-month high-risk period following hospitalization.\n## RESULTS\nOn average, participants engaged with FOCUS for 82% of the weeks they had the mobile phone. People who used FOCUS more often continued using it over longer periods: 44% used the intervention over 5-6 months, on average 4.3 days a week. Gender, race, age, and number of past psychiatric hospitalizations were associated with engagement. Females used FOCUS on average 0.4 more days a week than males. White participants engaged on average 0.7 days more a week than African-Americans and responded to prompts on 0.7 days more a week than Hispanic participants. Younger participants (age 18-29) had 0.4 fewer days of on-demand use a week than individuals who were 30-45 years old and 0.5 fewer days a week than older participants (age 46-60). Participants with fewer past hospitalizations (1-6) engaged on average 0.2 more days a week than those with seven or more. mHealth program functions were associated with engagement. Participants responded to prompts more often than they self-initiated on-demand tools, but both FOCUS functions were used regularly. Both types of intervention use declined over time (on-demand use had a steeper decline). Although mHealth use declined, the majority of individuals used both on-demand and system-prompted functions regularly throughout their participation. Therefore, neither function is extraneous.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe findings demonstrated that individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders can actively engage with a clinically supported mobile phone intervention for up to 6 months following hospital discharge. mHealth may be useful in reaching a clinical population that is typically difficult to engage during high-risk periods.",

The goal of our analysis is to characterize users' app use behavior and experiences, and is rooted in theoretical conceptualizations of engagement as both usage and user experience. In the first aim, we employ cluster analysis to identify subgroups of participants that share similarities in terms of the frequency of their usage of particular apps, and then employ other engagement measures to compare the clusters. We identified four clusters with different app usage patterns: Low Usage, High Usage, Daily Feats Users, and Day to Day users. Each cluster was distinguished by its overall frequency of app use, or the main app that participants used. In the second aim, we developed a computer-assisted text analysis and visualization method - message highlighting - to facilitate comparison of the clusters. Last, we performed a qualitative analysis using participant messages to better understand the mechanisms of change and usability of salient apps from the cluster analysis. Our novel approach, integrating text and visual analytics with more traditional qualitative analysis techniques, can be used to generate insights concerning the behavior and experience of users in digital health contexts, for subsequent personalization and to identify areas for improvement of intervention technologies.",

The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified Depressive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation.\n## RESULTS\nAfter completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in the control group. In clinical measures, both TT group and control group showed reduced Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores compared to control group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 scores.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur preliminary findings provide promising evidence that scenario-based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and efficacious cognitive therapy. Long-term research is needed to determine the impact and effectiveness of this new treatment format.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nA World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression.\n## METHODS\nIn the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations.\n## RESULTS\nThe average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.",

Recently, studies have demonstrated that smartphone-based interventions combining CBT with gamified approach-avoidance bias modification training (AAMT) can foster patient engagement and reduce symptoms of several mental health problems.\n## OBJECTIVE\nBased on these findings, we developed a gamified smartphone-based intervention, mentalis Phoenix (MT-Phoenix), and hypothesized the program would both engage patients and produce preliminary evidence for the reduction of depressive symptoms.\n## METHODS\nTo test this hypothesis, we evaluated MT-Phoenix in a randomized controlled pilot trial including 77 individuals with elevated depression scores (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores \u22655). Participants were either instructed to train for 14 days with MT-Phoenix or assigned to a waitlist control condition. Engagement with the intervention was measured by assessing usage data. The primary outcome was reduction in depressive symptom severity at postassessment.\n## RESULTS\nData from this pilot trial shows that participants in the intervention group used the smartphone-based intervention for 46% of all days (6.4/14) and reported a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms than did participants in the control condition (F\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA gamified smartphone-based intervention combining CBT with AAMT may foster patient engagement and effectively target depressive symptoms.

This may be because of the inherent challenges of conducting traditional clinical trials in a rapidly evolving technology landscape.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study sought to validate the effectiveness of Pacifica, a popular commercially available app for the self-management of mild-to-moderate stress, anxiety, and depression.\n## METHODS\nA total of 500 adults with mild-to-moderate anxiety or depression were recruited from in-app onboarding to participate in a randomized waitlist controlled trial of Pacifica. We conducted an all-virtual study, recruiting, screening, and randomizing participants through a Web-based participant portal. Study participants used the app for 1 month, with no level of use required, closely mimicking real-world app usage. Participants in the waitlist group were given access to the app after 1 month. Measurements included self-reported symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. We performed an intent-to-treat analysis to examine the interactive effects of time and condition.\n## RESULTS\nWe found significant interactions between time and group. Participants in the active condition demonstrated significantly greater decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress and increases in self-efficacy. Although we did not find a relationship between overall engagement with the app and symptom improvement, participants who completed relatively more thought record exercises sustained improvements in their symptoms through the 2-month follow-up to a greater degree than those who completed fewer.

US Hispanic/Latino individuals are particularly underrepresented in mental health care and are historically a very difficult population to recruit into clinical trials; however, they have increasing access to mobile technology, with over 75% owning a smartphone. This technology has the potential to overcome known barriers to accessing and utilizing traditional assessment and treatment approaches.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to compare recruitment and engagement in a fully remote trial of individuals with depression who either self-identify as Hispanic/Latino or not. A secondary aim was to assess treatment outcomes in these individuals using three different self-guided mobile apps: iPST (based on evidence-based therapeutic principles from problem-solving therapy, PST), Project Evolution (EVO; a cognitive training app based on cognitive neuroscience principles), and health tips (a health information app that served as an information control).\n## METHODS\nWe recruited Spanish and English speaking participants through social media platforms, internet-based advertisements, and traditional fliers in select locations in each state across the United States. Assessment and self-guided treatment was conducted on each participant's smartphone or tablet. We enrolled 389 Hispanic/Latino and 637 non-Hispanic/Latino adults with mild to moderate depression as determined by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score\u22655 or related functional impairment. Participants were first asked about their preferences among the three apps and then randomized to their top two choices. Outcomes were depressive symptom severity (measured using PHQ-9) and functional impairment (assessed with Sheehan Disability Scale), collected over 3 months. Engagement in the study was assessed based on the number of times participants completed active surveys.\n## RESULTS\nWe screened 4502 participants and enrolled 1040 participants from throughout the United States over 6 months, yielding a sample of 348 active users. Long-term engagement surfaced as a key issue among Hispanic/Latino participants, who dropped from the study 2 weeks earlier than their non-Hispanic/Latino counterparts (P<.02). No significant differences were observed for treatment outcomes between those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or not. Although depressive symptoms improved (beta=-2.66, P=.006) over the treatment course, outcomes did not vary by treatment app.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFully remote mobile-based studies can attract a diverse participant pool including people from traditionally underserved communities in mental health care and research (here, Hispanic/Latino individuals). However, keeping participants engaged in this type of \"low-touch\" research study remains challenging. Hispanic/Latino populations may be less willing to use mobile apps for assessing and managing depression. Future research endeavors should use a user-centered design to determine the role of mobile apps in the assessment and treatment of depression for this population, app features they would be interested in using, and strategies for long-term engagement.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT01808976; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01808976 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/70xI3ILkz).",

The purpose of the current study was to pilot an evaluation of the usage and efficacy of apps for depression based upon behavioral or cognitive intervention skills, compared to a wait-list control. Thirty adults with depression were randomized to the use of either a behavioral app (Boost Me) or a cognitive app (Thought Challenger) or to a wait-list control. Boost Me and Thought Challenger participants received 6 weeks of the respective intervention along with weekly coaching sessions, with a 4-week follow-up period; wait-list control participants received no interventions for 10 weeks. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine depression over time and across treatment groups; t tests compared app usage across groups. Depression scores changed significantly over time (p < .001), with group differences occurring between Thought Challenger and wait-list control participants (p = .03). Boost Me was used significantly more than was Thought Challenger (p = .02); however, there was no evidence to suggest correlations between usage and changes in depression (ps > .05). The present study provides initial support that intervention strategies for depression delivered via apps with human support can impact symptoms and may promote continued use over 6 weeks. This pilot also demonstrates the feasibility of future research regarding the delivery of behavioral and cognitive intervention strategies via apps.

Most of these treatments have been delivered on desktop computers. However, the use of smartphones is becoming ubiquitous and could extend the reach of ICBT into users' everyday life. Only a few studies have empirically examined the efficacy of ICBT delivered through a smartphone app and there is no published study on mobile app delivered ICBT for SAD. This three-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is the first to compare the efficacy of guided ICBT for smartphones (app) and conventional computers (PC) with a wait list control group (WL).\n## METHOD\nA total of 150 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for SAD were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Primary endpoints were self-report measures and diagnostic status of SAD.\n## RESULTS\nAfter 12 weeks of treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcome on the composite of all SAD measures (PC vs. WL: d = 0.74; App vs. WL: d = 0.89) and promising diagnostic response rates (NNTPC = 3.33; NNTApp = 6.00) compared to the WL. No significant between-groups effects were found between the two active conditions on the composite score (Cohen's d = 0.07). Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Program use was more evenly spread throughout the day in the mobile condition, indicating an integration of the program into daily routines.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nICBT can be delivered effectively using smartphones.

Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms.\n## METHODS\nA total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 36 subjects used MOSS for \u22652 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9\u226511) at baseline and adherence \u22658 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=-.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9\u226511, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1% and 59.1% accuracy, respectively.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nProxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states.",

Participants completed 6 lessons, weekly homework assignments, and received weekly email contact from a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist until completion of lesson 2. After lesson 2 email contact was only provided in response to participant request, or in response to a deterioration in psychological distress scores. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Of the 35 participants recruited, 68.6% completed 6 lessons and 65.7% completed the 3-months follow up.

The MBI consisted of 28-sessions, varying in length from 9-18 minutes consisting of education on mindfulness and guided meditation practice. Changes in the pre/post GAD-7 scores were significant (p= 0.01), with a trend toward improvement in symptoms with more use of the app, but the changes were statistically insignificant (p= 0.20).

We report on several domains of implementation: acceptance, appropriateness, engagement, and work processes assessed in two samples of clinicians and patients designed to develop and test the feasibility of a Spanish language Cognitive Behavioral VoiceThreadVR app for Dominican primary care patients with depression. Results indicated that feasibility of our eMH intervention was compromised by appropriateness of the target audience and the eligibility criteria used, including language, age, access to phones, and access to the internet. Both participants and clinical providers had varying degrees of engagement in the MHapp. Clinical providers had a desire for increased knowledge and capacity building, but also unspoken expectations and misaligned incentives. For participants, there were logistical and emotional barriers to use, some of which could not be fully determined in this study due to a lack of feasibility in terms of a low retention rate.

All participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. Attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. Participants completed weekly Internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. The between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. On measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre\u2013post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant.

Research examining mobile phone\u2012based mHealth programs for people with psychosis has shown that these approaches are feasible, acceptable, and clinically promising. However, most mHealth initiatives involving people with schizophrenia have spanned periods ranging from a few days to several weeks and have typically involved participants who were clinically stable.\n## OBJECTIVE\nOur aim was to evaluate the viability of extended mHealth interventions for people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders following hospital discharge. Specifically, we set out to examine the following: (1) Can individuals be engaged with a mobile phone intervention program during this high-risk period?, (2) Are age, gender, racial background, or hospitalization history associated with their engagement or persistence in using a mobile phone intervention over time?, and (3) Does engagement differ by characteristics of the mHealth intervention itself (ie, pre-programmed vs on-demand functions)?\n## METHODS\nWe examined mHealth intervention use and demographic and clinical predictors of engagement in 342 individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who were given the FOCUS mobile phone intervention as part of a technology-assisted relapse prevention program during the 6-month high-risk period following hospitalization.\n## RESULTS\nOn average, participants engaged with FOCUS for 82% of the weeks they had the mobile phone. People who used FOCUS more often continued using it over longer periods: 44% used the intervention over 5-6 months, on average 4.3 days a week. Gender, race, age, and number of past psychiatric hospitalizations were associated with engagement. Females used FOCUS on average 0.4 more days a week than males. White participants engaged on average 0.7 days more a week than African-Americans and responded to prompts on 0.7 days more a week than Hispanic participants. Younger participants (age 18-29) had 0.4 fewer days of on-demand use a week than individuals who were 30-45 years old and 0.5 fewer days a week than older participants (age 46-60). Participants with fewer past hospitalizations (1-6) engaged on average 0.2 more days a week than those with seven or more. mHealth program functions were associated with engagement. Participants responded to prompts more often than they self-initiated on-demand tools, but both FOCUS functions were used regularly. Both types of intervention use declined over time (on-demand use had a steeper decline). Although mHealth use declined, the majority of individuals used both on-demand and system-prompted functions regularly throughout their participation. Therefore, neither function is extraneous.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe findings demonstrated that individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders can actively engage with a clinically supported mobile phone intervention for up to 6 months following hospital discharge. mHealth may be useful in reaching a clinical population that is typically difficult to engage during high-risk periods.",

In this study, we present a novel mixed-methods approach to analysis of the complex and rich data that digital interventions collect. We perform secondary analysis of IntelliCare, an intervention in which participants are able to try 14 different mental health apps over the course of eight weeks. The goal of our analysis is to characterize users' app use behavior and experiences, and is rooted in theoretical conceptualizations of engagement as both usage and user experience. In the first aim, we employ cluster analysis to identify subgroups of participants that share similarities in terms of the frequency of their usage of particular apps, and then employ other engagement measures to compare the clusters. We identified four clusters with different app usage patterns: Low Usage, High Usage, Daily Feats Users, and Day to Day users. Each cluster was distinguished by its overall frequency of app use, or the main app that participants used. In the second aim, we developed a computer-assisted text analysis and visualization method - message highlighting - to facilitate comparison of the clusters. Last, we performed a qualitative analysis using participant messages to better understand the mechanisms of change and usability of salient apps from the cluster analysis. Our novel approach, integrating text and visual analytics with more traditional qualitative analysis techniques, can be used to generate insights concerning the behavior and experience of users in digital health contexts, for subsequent personalization and to identify areas for improvement of intervention technologies.",

The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified Depressive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation.\n## RESULTS\nAfter completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in the control group. In clinical measures, both TT group and control group showed reduced Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores compared to control group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 scores.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur preliminary findings provide promising evidence that scenario-based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and efficacious cognitive therapy.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression.\n## METHODS\nIn the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations.\n## RESULTS\nThe average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.",

We conducted an all-virtual study, recruiting, screening, and randomizing participants through a Web-based participant portal. Study participants used the app for 1 month, with no level of use required, closely mimicking real-world app usage. Participants in the waitlist group were given access to the app after 1 month. Measurements included self-reported symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. We performed an intent-to-treat analysis to examine the interactive effects of time and condition.\n## RESULTS\nWe found significant interactions between time and group. Participants in the active condition demonstrated significantly greater decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress and increases in self-efficacy. Although we did not find a relationship between overall engagement with the app and symptom improvement, participants who completed relatively more thought record exercises sustained improvements in their symptoms through the 2-month follow-up to a greater degree than those who completed fewer.

Participants showed significant reductions in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) across all treatment arms (P s<.001). Coached treatment led to larger GAD-7 reductions than those observed for self-guided treatment (P=.03), but the effects for the PHQ-9 did not reach significance (P=.06). Significant interaction was observed between receiving recommendations and time for the PHQ-9 (P=.04), but there were no significant effects for GAD-7 (P=.58).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIntelliCare produced strong engagement with apps across all treatment arms. Coaching was associated with stronger anxiety outcomes, and receipt of recommendations enhanced depression outcomes.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02801877; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02801877.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nMost people with mental health disorders fail to receive timely access to adequate care. US Hispanic/Latino individuals are particularly underrepresented in mental health care and are historically a very difficult population to recruit into clinical trials; however, they have increasing access to mobile technology, with over 75% owning a smartphone. This technology has the potential to overcome known barriers to accessing and utilizing traditional assessment and treatment approaches.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to compare recruitment and engagement in a fully remote trial of individuals with depression who either self-identify as Hispanic/Latino or not. A secondary aim was to assess treatment outcomes in these individuals using three different self-guided mobile apps: iPST (based on evidence-based therapeutic principles from problem-solving therapy, PST), Project Evolution (EVO; a cognitive training app based on cognitive neuroscience principles), and health tips (a health information app that served as an information control).\n## METHODS\nWe recruited Spanish and English speaking participants through social media platforms, internet-based advertisements, and traditional fliers in select locations in each state across the United States. Assessment and self-guided treatment was conducted on each participant's smartphone or tablet. We enrolled 389 Hispanic/Latino and 637 non-Hispanic/Latino adults with mild to moderate depression as determined by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score\u22655 or related functional impairment. Participants were first asked about their preferences among the three apps and then randomized to their top two choices. Outcomes were depressive symptom severity (measured using PHQ-9) and functional impairment (assessed with Sheehan Disability Scale), collected over 3 months. Engagement in the study was assessed based on the number of times participants completed active surveys.\n## RESULTS\nWe screened 4502 participants and enrolled 1040 participants from throughout the United States over 6 months, yielding a sample of 348 active users. Long-term engagement surfaced as a key issue among Hispanic/Latino participants, who dropped from the study 2 weeks earlier than their non-Hispanic/Latino counterparts (P<.02). No significant differences were observed for treatment outcomes between those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or not. Although depressive symptoms improved (beta=-2.66, P=.006) over the treatment course, outcomes did not vary by treatment app.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFully remote mobile-based studies can attract a diverse participant pool including people from traditionally underserved communities in mental health care and research (here, Hispanic/Latino individuals). However, keeping participants engaged in this type of \"low-touch\" research study remains challenging. Hispanic/Latino populations may be less willing to use mobile apps for assessing and managing depression. Future research endeavors should use a user-centered design to determine the role of mobile apps in the assessment and treatment of depression for this population, app features they would be interested in using, and strategies for long-term engagement.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT01808976; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01808976 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/70xI3ILkz).",

This randomized controlled trial evaluated an intervention called SuperBetter (SB), which is accessed via smartphone and/or the SB Web site.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nOnline, we recruited 283 adult iPhone(\u00ae) (Apple, Cupertino, CA) users with significant depression symptoms according to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D). They were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) a version of SB using cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychotherapy strategies to target depression (CBT-PPT SB); (b) a general SB version focused on self-esteem and acceptance (General SB); or (c) a waiting list control group (WL). The two SB groups were instructed to use SB for 10 minutes daily for 1 month. All participants completed psychological distress and well-being measures online every 2 weeks through follow-up. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using hierarchical linear modeling.\n## RESULTS\nAs hypothesized, SB participants achieved greater reductions in CES-D scores than WL participants by posttest (Cohen's d=0.67) and by follow-up (d=1.05). Contrary to prediction, CBT-PPT SB did not perform better than General SB; both versions of SB were more effective than the WL control. Differences between SB versions favored General SB but were not statistically significant.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese large effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously in light of high attrition rates and the motivated, self-selected sample.

Smartphone apps stand as a possible means to overcome such barriers. However, there is limited evidence to understand the use and efficacy of these apps. The purpose of the current study was to pilot an evaluation of the usage and efficacy of apps for depression based upon behavioral or cognitive intervention skills, compared to a wait-list control. Thirty adults with depression were randomized to the use of either a behavioral app (Boost Me) or a cognitive app (Thought Challenger) or to a wait-list control. Boost Me and Thought Challenger participants received 6 weeks of the respective intervention along with weekly coaching sessions, with a 4-week follow-up period; wait-list control participants received no interventions for 10 weeks. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine depression over time and across treatment groups; t tests compared app usage across groups. Depression scores changed significantly over time (p < .001), with group differences occurring between Thought Challenger and wait-list control participants (p = .03). Boost Me was used significantly more than was Thought Challenger (p = .02); however, there was no evidence to suggest correlations between usage and changes in depression (ps > .05). The present study provides initial support that intervention strategies for depression delivered via apps with human support can impact symptoms and may promote continued use over 6 weeks. This pilot also demonstrates the feasibility of future research regarding the delivery of behavioral and cognitive intervention strategies via apps.

Most of these treatments have been delivered on desktop computers. However, the use of smartphones is becoming ubiquitous and could extend the reach of ICBT into users' everyday life. Only a few studies have empirically examined the efficacy of ICBT delivered through a smartphone app and there is no published study on mobile app delivered ICBT for SAD. This three-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is the first to compare the efficacy of guided ICBT for smartphones (app) and conventional computers (PC) with a wait list control group (WL).\n## METHOD\nA total of 150 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for SAD were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Primary endpoints were self-report measures and diagnostic status of SAD.\n## RESULTS\nAfter 12 weeks of treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcome on the composite of all SAD measures (PC vs. WL: d = 0.74; App vs. WL: d = 0.89) and promising diagnostic response rates (NNTPC = 3.33; NNTApp = 6.00) compared to the WL. No significant between-groups effects were found between the two active conditions on the composite score (Cohen's d = 0.07). Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Program use was more evenly spread throughout the day in the mobile condition, indicating an integration of the program into daily routines.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nICBT can be delivered effectively using smartphones.

Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms.\n## METHODS\nA total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 36 subjects used MOSS for \u22652 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9\u226511) at baseline and adherence \u22658 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=-.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9\u226511, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1% and 59.1% accuracy, respectively.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nProxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states.",

We report on several domains of implementation: acceptance, appropriateness, engagement, and work processes assessed in two samples of clinicians and patients designed to develop and test the feasibility of a Spanish language Cognitive Behavioral VoiceThreadVR app for Dominican primary care patients with depression. Results indicated that feasibility of our eMH intervention was compromised by appropriateness of the target audience and the eligibility criteria used, including language, age, access to phones, and access to the internet. Both participants and clinical providers had varying degrees of engagement in the MHapp. Clinical providers had a desire for increased knowledge and capacity building, but also unspoken expectations and misaligned incentives. For participants, there were logistical and emotional barriers to use, some of which could not be fully determined in this study due to a lack of feasibility in terms of a low retention rate.

We conducted the first randomized controlled trial of attention bias modification training delivered via smartphones, comparing this training to control training in a double-blind design, also including a waitlist condition. All participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. Attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. Participants completed weekly Internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. The between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. On measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre\u2013post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant. Both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable. Improvements in the two training conditions beyond those of waitlist could be attributable to any factors common to them, but not to the contingency training specific to active attention bias modification training.",

Durvalumab is an anti-programmed death ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. The phase III open-label CAURAL trial (NCT02454933) investigated osimertinib plus durvalumab versus osimertinib monotherapy in\u00a0patients with EGFR-TKI sensitizing and EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression after EGFR-TKI therapy.\n## METHODS\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally administered osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with or\u00a0without durvalumab (10 mg/kg administered intravenously every 2 weeks) until progression. Treatment could continue beyond progression, providing clinical benefit continued (judged by the investigator). The amended primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib plus durvalumab; efficacy was an exploratory objective.\n## RESULTS\nCAURAL recruitment was terminated early because of increased incidence of interstitial lung disease-like events in the osimertinib plus durvalumab arm from the separate phase Ib TATTON trial (NCT02143466). At termination of CAURAL recruitment, 15 patients had been randomly assigned to treatment with osimertinib and 14 to treatment with osimertinib plus durvalumab. The most common AEs were diarrhea (53% [grade \u22653 in 6% of patients])\u00a0in the osimertinib arm and rash (67% [grade \u22653 in 0 patients]) in the combination arm. One patient who had been randomized to the combination arm reported grade 2 interstitial lung disease while receiving osimertinib monotherapy (after discontinuing durvalumab therapy after one dose). The objective response rates were 80% in the osimertinib arm and 64% in the combination arm.\n## CONCLUSION\nLimited patient numbers preclude formal safety and efficacy comparisons between the two treatment arms. The combination of programmed cell death 1/programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors and EGFR-TKIs as therapy for NSCLC is not well understood, but it requires a careful approach if considered in the future.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThere are few effective treatment options for patients with recurrent or metastatic head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab showed antitumour activity and manageable toxicity in early-phase trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care therapy for the treatment of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.\n## METHODS\nWe did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study at 97 medical centres in 20 countries. Patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma that progressed during or after platinum-containing treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease (or both), or whose disease recurred or progressed within 3-6 months of previous multimodal therapy containing platinum for locally advanced disease, were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks intravenously or investigator's choice of standard doses of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab intravenously (standard-of-care group). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in the as-treated population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02252042, and is no longer enrolling patients.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Dec 24, 2014, and May 13, 2016, 247 patients were randomly allocated to pembrolizumab and 248 were randomly allocated to standard of care. As of May 15, 2017, 181 (73%) of 247 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 207 (83%) of 248 patients in the standard-of-care group had died. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 8\u00b74 months (95% CI 6\u00b74-9\u00b74) with pembrolizumab and 6\u00b79 months (5\u00b79-8\u00b70) with standard of care (hazard ratio 0\u00b780, 0\u00b765-0\u00b798; nominal p=0\u00b70161). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab than with standard of care had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events (33 [13%] of 246 vs 85 [36%] of 234). The most common treatment-related adverse event was hypothyroidism with pembrolizumab (in 33 [13%] patients) and fatigue with standard of care (in 43 [18%]). Treatment-related death occurred in four patients treated with pembrolizumab (unspecified cause, large intestine perforation, malignant neoplasm progression, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and two patients treated with standard of care (malignant neoplasm progression and pneumonia).\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe clinically meaningful prolongation of overall survival and favourable safety profile of pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma support the further evaluation of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapy in earlier stages of disease.\n## FUNDING\nMerck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nMicrosatellite-stable metastatic colorectal cancer is typically unresponsive to immunotherapy. This phase 3 study was designed to assess atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in metastatic colorectal cancer. Here, we report the comparison of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib or atezolizumab monotherapy versus regorafenib in the third-line setting.\n## METHODS\nIMblaze 370 is a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial, done at 73 academic medical centres and community oncology practices in 11 countries. Patients aged at least 18 years with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and disease progression on or intolerance to at least two previous systemic chemotherapy regimens were enrolled. We used permuted-block randomisation (block size four) to assign patients (2:1:1) via an interactive voice and web response system to atezolizumab (840 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) plus cobimetinib (60 mg orally once daily for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle), atezolizumab monotherapy (1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks), or regorafenib (160 mg orally once daily for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle). Stratification factors were extended RAS status (wild-type vs mutant) and time since diagnosis of first metastasis (<18 months vs \u226518 months). Recruitment of patients with high microsatellite instability was capped at 5%. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the population of patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. IMblaze370 is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788279.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween July 27, 2016, and Jan 19, 2017, 363 patients were enrolled (183 patients in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 90 in the regorafenib group). At data cutoff (March 9, 2018), median follow-up was 7\u00b73 months (IQR 3\u00b77-13\u00b76). Median overall survival was 8\u00b787 months (95% CI 7\u00b700-10\u00b761) with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, 7\u00b710 months (6\u00b705-10\u00b705) with atezolizumab, and 8\u00b751 months (6\u00b741-10\u00b771) with regorafenib; the hazard ratio was 1\u00b700 (95% CI 0\u00b773-1\u00b738; p=0\u00b799) for the combination versus regorafenib and 1\u00b719 (0\u00b783-1\u00b771; p=0\u00b734) for atezolizumab versus regorafenib. Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 109 (61%) of 179 patients in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 28 (31%) of 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 46 (58%) of 80 in the regorafenib group. The most common all-cause grade 3-4 adverse events in the combination group were diarrhoea (20 [11%] of 179), anaemia (ten [6%]), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (12 [7%]), and fatigue (eight [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 71 (40%) of 179 patients in the combination group, 15 (17%) of 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 18 (23%) of 80 in the regorafenib group. Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the combination group (sepsis) and one in the regorafenib group (intestinal perforation).\n## INTERPRETATION\nIMblaze370 did not meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib or atezolizumab versus regorafenib. The safety of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib was consistent with those of the individual drugs. These results underscore the challenge of expanding the benefit of immunotherapy to patients whose tumours have lower baseline levels of immune inflammation, such as those with microsatellite-stable metastatic colorectal cancer.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd/Genentech Inc.",

Here, we present the findings of an unplanned, ad-hoc interim analysis at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n## METHODS\nKEYNOTE-183 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 97 medical centres across 11 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and USA). Patients aged at least 18 years with multiple myeloma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, previously treated with at least two lines of therapy (excluding pomalidomide) and refractory to the last line were randomly assigned 1:1 to the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group via an interactive voice response or integrated web response system. Patients received oral pomalidomide 4 mg daily on days 1-21 and oral low-dose dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in 28-day cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks.

Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned patients and safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02576977, and it is closed for accrual.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 18, 2016, and June 7, 2017, 249 patients were randomly assigned to either the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=125) or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=124). On July 3, 2017, the FDA established that risks associated with the triple combination outweighed benefits and halted the study. Median follow-up was 8\u00b71 months (IQR 4\u00b75-10\u00b79). Median progression-free survival was 5\u00b76 months (95% CI 3\u00b77-7\u00b75) in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 8\u00b74 months (5\u00b79-not reached) in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group; progression-free survival estimates at 6 months were 48% (95% CI 37-58) versus 60% (49-69) at 6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b753; 95% CI 1\u00b705-2\u00b722; p=0\u00b798).

Randomisation was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (\u226550% vs 1-49%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0\u00b70122, p=0\u00b70120, and p=0\u00b70124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the previous findings were significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894.\n## FINDINGS\nFrom Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57-69]) with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 patients (64%) had a TPS of 20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12\u00b78 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (\u226550% hazard ratio 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b785, p=0\u00b70003; \u226520% 0\u00b777, 0\u00b764-0\u00b792, p=0\u00b70020, and \u22651% 0\u00b781, 0\u00b771-0\u00b793, p=0\u00b70018). The median surival values by TPS population were 20\u00b70 months (95% CI 15\u00b74-24\u00b79) for pembrolizumab versus 12\u00b72 months (10\u00b74-14\u00b72) for chemotherapy, 17\u00b77 months (15\u00b73-22\u00b71) versus 13\u00b70 months (11\u00b76-15\u00b73), and 16\u00b77 months (13\u00b79-19\u00b77) versus 12\u00b71 months (11\u00b73-13\u00b73), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18%) of 636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41%) of 615 in the chemotherapy group and led to death in 13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients, respectively.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab monotherapy can be extended as first-line therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or ALK alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS.\n## FUNDING\nMerck Sharp & Dohme.",

Here, we report results of IMmotion151, a phase 3 trial comparing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib in first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n## METHODS\nIn this multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, patients with a component of clear cell or sarcomatoid histology and who were previously untreated, were recruited from 152 academic medical centres and community oncology practices in 21 countries, mainly in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region, and were randomly assigned 1:1 to either atezolizumab 1200 mg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks or sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off. A permuted-block randomisation (block size of 4) was applied to obtain a balanced assignment to each treatment group with respect to the stratification factors. Study investigators and participants were not masked to treatment allocation. Patients, investigators, independent radiology committee members, and the sponsor were masked to PD-L1 expression status. Co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the PD-L1 positive population and overall survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02420821.\n## FINDINGS\nOf 915 patients enrolled between May 20, 2015, and Oct 12, 2016, 454 were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 461 to the sunitinib group. 362 (40%) of 915 patients had PD-L1 positive disease. Median follow-up was 15 months at the primary progression-free survival analysis and 24 months at the overall survival interim analysis. In the PD-L1 positive population, the median progression-free survival was 11\u00b72 months in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group versus 7\u00b77 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b774 [95% CI 0\u00b757-0\u00b796]; p=0\u00b70217). In the ITT population, median overall survival had an HR of 0\u00b793 (0\u00b776-1\u00b714) and the results did not cross the significance boundary at the interim analysis. 182 (40%) of 451 patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 240 (54%) of 446 patients in the sunitinib group had treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events: 24 (5%) in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 37 (8%) in the sunitinib group had treatment-related all-grade adverse events, which led to treatment-regimen discontinuation.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab plus bevacizumab prolonged progression-free survival versus sunitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and showed a favourable safety profile. Longer-term follow-up is necessary to establish whether a survival benefit will emerge. These study results support atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as a first-line treatment option for selected patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech Inc.",

Whether pembrolizumab plus axitinib would result in better outcomes than sunitinib in such patients was unclear.\n## METHODS\nIn an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 861 patients with previously untreated advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks plus axitinib (5 mg) orally twice daily (432 patients) or sunitinib (50 mg) orally once daily for the first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle (429 patients). The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The key secondary end point was the objective response rate. All reported results are from the protocol-specified first interim analysis.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 12.8 months, the estimated percentage of patients who were alive at 12 months was 89.9% in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 78.3% in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 0.74; P<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 15.1 months in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 11.1 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.84; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 59.3% (95% CI, 54.5 to 63.9) in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 35.7% (95% CI, 31.1 to 40.4) in the sunitinib group (P<0.001). The benefit of pembrolizumab plus axitinib was observed across the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups (i.e., favorable, intermediate, and poor risk) and regardless of programmed death ligand 1 expression. Grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 75.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and in 70.6% in the sunitinib group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival, as well as a higher objective response rate, than treatment with sunitinib.

The addition of a third drug to the combination is likely to improve treatment efficacy. KEYNOTE-185 assessed the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone with and without pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Here, we present the results of an unplanned interim analysis done to assess the benefit-risk of the combination at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n## METHODS\nKEYNOTE-185 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 95 medical centres across 15 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, UK, and USA). Transplantation-ineligible patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who were treatment naive were enrolled, and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone using an interactive voice or integrated web response system. Patients received oral lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1-21 and oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which was investigator-assessed because of early trial termination. Efficacy was analysed in all randomly assigned patients and safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579863, and it is closed for accrual.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 7, 2016, and June 9, 2017, 301 patients were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=151) or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=150). On July 3, 2017, the FDA decided to halt the study because of the imbalance in the proportion of death between groups. At database cutoff (June 2, 2017), with a median follow-up of 6\u00b76 months (IQR 3\u00b74-9\u00b76), 149 patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 145 in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had received their assigned study drug. Median progression-free survival was not reached in either group; progression-free survival estimates at 6-months were 82\u00b70% (95% CI 73\u00b72-88\u00b71) versus 85\u00b70% (76\u00b78-90\u00b75; hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b722; 95% CI 0\u00b767-2\u00b722; p=0\u00b775). Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (54%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 57 (39%) patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; the most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (nine [6%]) and pyrexia (seven [5%]) in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and pneumonia (eight [6%]) and sepsis (two [1%]) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. Six (4%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, myocarditis, large intestine perforation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism) and two (1%) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and respiratory failure).\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe results from this unplanned, FDA-requested, interim analysis showed that the benefit-risk profile of pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone is unfavourable for patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple myeloma.

The randomised, phase III JAVELIN Gastric 300 trial compared avelumab versus physician's choice of chemotherapy as third-line therapy in patients with advanced GC/GEJC.\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic GC/GEJC were recruited at 147 sites globally. All patients were randomised to receive either avelumab 10\u2009mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2\u2009weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 80\u2009mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 or irinotecan 150\u2009mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, each of a 4-week treatment cycle); patients ineligible for chemotherapy received best supportive care. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 371 patients were randomised. The trial did not meet its primary end point of improving OS {median, 4.6 versus 5.0\u2009months; hazard ratio (HR)=1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.4]; P\u2009=\u20090.81} or the secondary end points of PFS [median, 1.4 versus 2.7\u2009months; HR=1.73 (95% CI 1.4-2.2); P\u2009>\u20090.99] or ORR (2.2% versus 4.3%) in the avelumab versus chemotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 90 patients (48.9%) and 131 patients (74.0%) in the avelumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Grade \u22653 TRAEs occurred in 17 patients (9.2%) in the avelumab arm and in 56 patients (31.6%) in the chemotherapy arm.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTreatment of patients with GC/GEJC with single-agent avelumab in the third-line setting did not result in an improvement in OS or PFS compared with chemotherapy.

In this study, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety after extended follow-up to inform the long-term clinical benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus sunitinib in this setting.\n## METHODS\nIn the phase 3, randomised, controlled CheckMate 214 trial, patients aged 18 years and older with previously untreated, advanced, or metastatic histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma with a clear-cell component were recruited from 175 hospitals and cancer centres in 28 countries. Patients were categorised by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk status into favourable-risk, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk subgroups and randomly assigned (1:1) to open-label nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) every 2 weeks; or sunitinib (50 mg orally) once daily for 4 weeks (6-week cycle). Randomisation was done through an interactive voice response system, with a block size of four and stratified by risk status and geographical region. The co-primary endpoints for the trial were overall survival, progression-free survival per independent radiology review committee (IRRC), and objective responses per IRRC in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival per IRRC, and objective responses per IRRC in the intention-to-treat population, and adverse events in all treated patients. In this Article, we report overall survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, investigator-assessed objective response, characterisation of response, and safety after extended follow-up. Efficacy outcomes were assessed in all randomly assigned patients; safety was assessed in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02231749, and is ongoing but now closed to recruitment.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Oct 16, 2014, and Feb 23, 2016, of 1390 patients screened, 1096 (79%) eligible patients were randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab or sunitinib (550 vs 546 in the intention-to-treat population; 425 vs 422 intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, and 125 vs 124 favourable-risk patients). With extended follow-up (median follow-up 32\u00b74 months [IQR 13\u00b74-36\u00b73]), in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, results for the three co-primary efficacy endpoints showed that nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to be superior to sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI 35\u00b76-not estimable] vs 26\u00b76 months [22\u00b71-33\u00b74]; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b766 [95% CI 0\u00b754-0\u00b780], p<0\u00b70001), progression-free survival (median 8\u00b72 months [95% CI 6\u00b79-10\u00b70] vs 8\u00b73 months [7\u00b70-8\u00b78]; HR 0\u00b777 [95% CI 0\u00b765-0\u00b790], p=0\u00b70014), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (178 [42%] of 425 vs 124 [29%] of 422; p=0\u00b70001). Similarly, in intention-to-treat patients, nivolumab and ipilimumab showed improved efficacy compared with sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI not estimable] vs 37\u00b79 months [32\u00b72-not estimable]; HR 0\u00b771 [95% CI 0\u00b759-0\u00b786], p=0\u00b70003), progression-free survival (median 9\u00b77 months [95% CI 8\u00b71-11\u00b71] vs 9\u00b77 months [8\u00b73-11\u00b71]; HR 0\u00b785 [95% CI 0\u00b773-0\u00b798], p=0\u00b7027), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (227 [41%] of 550 vs 186 [34%] of 546 p=0\u00b7015). In all treated patients, the most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events in the nivolumab and ipilimumab group were increased lipase (57 [10%] of 547), increased amylase (31 [6%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (28 [5%]), whereas in the sunitinib group they were hypertension (90 [17%] of 535), fatigue (51 [10%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (49 [9%]). Eight deaths in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and four deaths in the sunitinib group were reported as treatment-related.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe results suggest that the superior efficacy of nivolumab plus ipilimumab over sunitinib was maintained in intermediate-risk or poor-risk and intention-to-treat patients with extended follow-up, and show the long-term benefits of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma across all risk categories.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb and ONO Pharmaceutical.",

More recently, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was shown to significantly prolong overall survival among patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nIn this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 559 patients with untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles; all the patients also received carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]-paclitaxel for the first 4 cycles. Primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival was 15.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 14.8) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001). The overall survival benefit was consistent regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. The median progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebo-combination group. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was more frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination group (13.3% vs. 6.4%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) versus chemotherapy in this patient population.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted this multicentre, open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial (IMvigor211) at 217 academic medical centres and community oncology practices mainly in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients (aged \u226518 years) with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice and web response system with a permuted block design (block size of four), to receive atezolizumab 1200 mg or chemotherapy (physician's choice: vinflunine 320 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 13, 2015, and Feb 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 931 patients from 198 sites to receive atezolizumab (n=467) or chemotherapy (n=464). In the IC2/3 population (n=234), overall survival did not differ significantly between patients in the atezolizumab group and those in the chemotherapy group (median 11\u00b71 months [95% CI 8\u00b76-15\u00b75; n=116] vs 10\u00b76 months [8\u00b74-12\u00b72; n=118]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b787, 95% CI 0\u00b763-1\u00b721; p=0\u00b741), thus precluding further formal statistical analysis. Confirmed objective response rates were similar between treatment groups in the IC2/3 population: 26 (23%) of 113 evaluable patients had an objective response in the atezolizumab group compared with 25 (22%) of 116 patients in the chemotherapy group. Duration of response was numerically longer in the atezolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (median 15\u00b79 months [95% CI 10\u00b74 to not estimable] vs 8\u00b73 months [5\u00b76-13\u00b72]; HR 0\u00b757, 95% CI 0\u00b726-1\u00b726). In the intention-to-treat population, patients receiving atezolizumab had fewer grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events than did those receiving chemotherapy (91 [20%] of 459 vs 189 [43%] of 443 patients), and fewer adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (34 [7%] vs 78 [18%] patients).\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab was not associated with significantly longer overall survival than chemotherapy in patients with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma overexpressing PD-L1 (IC2/3). However, the safety profile for atezolizumab was favourable compared with chemotherapy, Exploratory analysis of the intention-to-treat population showed well-tolerated, durable responses in line with previous phase 2 data for atezolizumab in this setting.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche, Genentech.",

This phase II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab monotherapy versus best supportive care (BSC) among patients with advanced/metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who achieved at least stable disease with first-line chemotherapy.Experimental Design: Eligible patients were randomized to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, then 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks for up to 3 years, or BSC, which could include continuation of fluoropyrimidine until progression or toxicity. The primary endpoint was immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS); secondary endpoints included PFS by modified World Health Organization criteria and overall survival (OS).Results: Of 143 patients screened, 57 were randomized to each arm. irPFS with ipilimumab versus BSC was not improved [2.92 months, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.61-5.16 vs. 4.90 months, 95% CI, 3.45-6.54, HR = 1.44; 80% CI, 1.09-1.91; P = 0.097], resulting in study cessation.

Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 23% of ipilimumab-treated patients, in whom diarrhea (9%) and fatigue (5%) were most frequent, and in 9% of active BSC-treated patients.Conclusions: Although ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg was manageable, it did not improve irPFS versus BSC. However, comparable median OS of approximately 1 year and a favorable safety profile support the investigation of ipilimumab in combination with other therapies for advanced gastric cancer.

The coprimary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival, which were assessed among all patients and among patients who had a tumor PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) combined positive score (the percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumor and infiltrating immune cells relative to the total number of tumor cells) of 10% or more.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival in the total population was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0 to 11.8) in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.1 to 8.3) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.91; P=0.002). The median overall survival among patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 10% or more was 8.0 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 12.3) in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 7.4) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.88; P=0.005). There was no significant between-group difference in the duration of progression-free survival in the total population (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.19; P=0.42) or among patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 10% or more (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.28; P=0.24). Fewer treatment-related adverse events of any grade were reported in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (60.9% vs. 90.2%); there were also fewer events of grade 3, 4, or 5 severity reported in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (15.0% vs. 49.4%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer overall survival (by approximately 3 months) and with a lower rate of treatment-related adverse events than chemotherapy as second-line therapy for platinum-refractory advanced urothelial carcinoma.

In an open-label phase 3 trial, we compared first-line nivolumab with chemotherapy in patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nWe randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC and a PD-L1 tumor-expression level of 1% or more to receive nivolumab (administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight once every 2 weeks) or platinum-based chemotherapy (administered once every 3 weeks for up to six cycles). Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to receive nivolumab at the time of disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by means of blinded independent central review, among patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more.\n## RESULTS\nAmong the 423 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, the median progression-free survival was 4.2 months with nivolumab versus 5.9 months with chemotherapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.45; P=0.25), and the median overall survival was 14.4 months versus 13.2 months (hazard ratio for death, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.30). A total of 128 of 212 patients (60%) in the chemotherapy group received nivolumab as subsequent therapy.

Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18% of the patients who received nivolumab and in 51% of those who received chemotherapy.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nNivolumab was not associated with significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy among patients with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more. Overall survival was similar between groups. Nivolumab had a favorable safety profile, as compared with chemotherapy, with no new or unexpected safety signals.

This randomized, double-blind, phase III study investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line ipilimumab or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced squamous NSCLC. Patients and Methods Patients with stage IV or recurrent chemotherapy-na\u00efve squamous NSCLC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin plus blinded ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks on a phased induction schedule comprising six chemotherapy cycles, with ipilimumab or placebo from cycles 3 to 6 and then, after induction treatment, ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy. Results Of 956 randomly assigned patients, 749 received at least one dose of blinded study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 388; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 361). Median OS was 13.4 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 12.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.07; P = .25). Median progression-free survival was 5.6 months for both groups (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01). Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), any-grade serious TRAEs, and TRAEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (51%, 33%, and 28%, respectively) than with chemotherapy plus placebo (35%, 10%, and 7%, respectively). Seven treatment-related deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, and one occurred with chemotherapy plus placebo. Conclusion The addition of ipilimumab to first-line chemotherapy did not prolong OS compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. The safety profile of chemotherapy plus ipilimumab was consistent with that observed in previous lung and melanoma studies.

In the DETERMINE study, we investigated the effects of the cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody tremelimumab in patients with previously treated advanced malignant mesothelioma.\n## METHODS\nDETERMINE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial done at 105 study centres across 19 countries in patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who had progressed after one or two previous systemic treatments for advanced disease. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease as defined in the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST version 1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) in blocks of three, stratified by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer status (low risk vs high risk), line of therapy (second line vs third line), and anatomic site (pleural vs peritoneal), by use of an interactive voice or web system, to receive intravenous tremelimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 7 doses and every 12 weeks thereafter until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01843374.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween May 17, 2013, and Dec 4, 2014, 571 patients were randomly assigned to receive tremelimumab (n=382) or placebo (n=189), of whom 569 patients received treatment (two patients in the tremelimumab group were excluded from the safety population because they did not receive treatment). At the data cutoff date (Jan 24, 2016), 307 (80%) of 382 patients had died in the tremelimumab group and 154 (81%) of 189 patients had died in the placebo group. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population did not differ between the treatment groups: 7\u00b77 months (95% CI 6\u00b78-8\u00b79) in the tremelimumab group and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b79-8\u00b77) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b792 [95% CI 0\u00b776-1\u00b712], p=0\u00b741). Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 246 (65%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 91 (48%) of 189 patients in the placebo group; the most common were dyspnoea (34 [9%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs 27 [14%] patients in the placebo group), diarrhoea (58 [15%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (26 [7%] vs none). The most common serious adverse events were diarrhoea (69 [18%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs one [<1%] patient in the placebo group), dyspnoea (29 [8%] vs 24 [13%]), and colitis (24 [6%] vs none). Treatment-emergent events leading to death occurred in 36 (9%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 12 (6%) of 189 in the placebo group; those leading to the death of more than one patient were mesothelioma (three [1%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs two [1%] in the placebo group), dyspnoea (three [1%] vs two [1%]); respiratory failure (one [<1%] vs three [2%]), myocardial infarction (three [1%] vs none), lung infection (three [1%] patients vs none), cardiac failure (one [<1%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (two [<1%] vs none). Treatment-related adverse events leading to death occurred in five (1%) patients in the tremelimumab group and none in the placebo group. The causes of death were lung infection in one patient, intestinal perforation and small intestinal obstruction in one patient; colitis in two patients, and neuritis and skin ulcer in one patient.\n## INTERPRETATION\nTremelimumab did not significantly prolong overall survival compared with placebo in patients with previously treated malignant mesothelioma. The safety profile of tremelimumab was consistent with the known safety profile of CTLA-4 inhibitors. Investigations into whether immunotherapy combination regimens can provide greater efficacy than monotherapies in malignant mesothelioma are ongoing.\n## FUNDING\nAstraZeneca.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nAtezolizumab is a humanised antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1 and programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 and B7-1 interactions, reinvigorating anticancer immunity. We assessed its efficacy and safety versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.\n## METHODS\nWe did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (OAK) in 194 academic or community oncology centres in 31 countries. We enrolled patients who had squamous or non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, were 18 years or older, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had received one to two previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (one or more platinum based combination therapies) for stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease and those who had received previous treatments with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, or therapies targeting the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenously receive either atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween March 11, 2014, and April 29, 2015, 1225 patients were recruited. In the primary population, 425 patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab and 425 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer with atezolizumab in the ITT and PD-L1-expression populations. In the ITT population, overall survival was improved with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel (median overall survival was 13\u00b78 months [95% CI 11\u00b78-15\u00b77] vs 9\u00b76 months [8\u00b76-11\u00b72]; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b773 [95% CI 0\u00b762-0\u00b787], p=0\u00b70003). Overall survival in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population was improved with atezolizumab (n=241) compared with docetaxel (n=222; median overall survival was 15\u00b77 months [95% CI 12\u00b76-18\u00b70] with atezolizumab vs 10\u00b73 months [8\u00b78-12\u00b70] with docetaxel; HR 0\u00b774 [95% CI 0\u00b758-0\u00b793]; p=0\u00b70102). Patients in the PD-L1 low or undetectable subgroup (TC0 and IC0) also had improved survival with atezolizumab (median overall survival 12\u00b76 months vs 8\u00b79 months; HR 0\u00b775 [95% CI 0\u00b759-0\u00b796]). Overall survival improvement was similar in patients with squamous (HR 0\u00b773 [95% CI 0\u00b754-0\u00b798]; n=112 in the atezolizumab group and n=110 in the docetaxel group) or non-squamous (0\u00b773 [0\u00b760-0\u00b789]; n=313 and n=315) histology. Fewer patients had treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events with atezolizumab (90 [15%] of 609 patients) versus docetaxel (247 [43%] of 578 patients). One treatment-related death from a respiratory tract infection was reported in the docetaxel group.\n## INTERPRETATION\nTo our knowledge, OAK is the first randomised phase 3 study to report results of a PD-L1-targeted therapy, with atezolizumab treatment resulting in a clinically relevant improvement of overall survival versus docetaxel in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression or histology, with a favourable safety profile.\n## FUNDING\nF.

The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer, including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-infiltrating immune cells, or both. We assessed efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1 expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population.\n## METHODS\nIn this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating immune cell status, histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block size of four) using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3\u226550%, TC2\u22655% and <50%, TC1\u22651% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3\u226510%, IC2\u22655% and <10%, IC1\u22651% and <5%, and IC0<1%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at 173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993.\n## FINDINGS\nPatients were enrolled between Aug 5, 2013, and March 31, 2014. 144 patients were randomly allocated to the atezolizumab group, and 143 to the docetaxel group. 142 patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and 135 received docetaxel. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 12\u00b76 months (95% CI 9\u00b77-16\u00b74) for atezolizumab versus 9\u00b77 months (8\u00b76-12\u00b70) for docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b773 [95% CI 0\u00b753-0\u00b799]; p=0\u00b704). Increasing improvement in overall survival was associated with increasing PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3 HR 0\u00b749 [0\u00b722-1\u00b707; p=0\u00b7068], TC2/3 or IC2/3 HR 0\u00b754 [0\u00b733-0\u00b789; p=0\u00b7014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0\u00b759 [0\u00b740-0\u00b785; p=0\u00b7005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1\u00b704 [0\u00b762-1\u00b775; p=0\u00b7871]). In our exploratory analysis, patients with pre-existing immunity, defined by high T-effector-interferon-\u03b3-associated gene expression, had improved overall survival with atezolizumab. 11 (8%) patients in the atezolizumab group discontinued because of adverse events versus 30 (22%) patients in the docetaxel group. 16 (11%) patients in the atezolizumab group versus 52 (39%) patients in the docetaxel group had treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events, and one (<1%) patient in the atezolizumab group versus three (2%) patients in the docetaxel group died from a treatment-related adverse event.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab significantly improved survival compared with docetaxel in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is predictive for atezolizumab benefit. Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile distinct from chemotherapy.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech Inc.",

Nivolumab, an anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, was assessed as treatment for this condition.\n## METHODS\nIn this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial, we assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 361 patients with recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck whose disease had progressed within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or standard, single-agent systemic therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab). The primary end point was overall survival. Additional end points included progression-free survival, rate of objective response, safety, and patient-reported quality of life.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 9.1) in the nivolumab group versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) in the group that received standard therapy. Overall survival was significantly longer with nivolumab than with standard therapy (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 97.73% CI, 0.51 to 0.96; P=0.01), and the estimates of the 1-year survival rate were approximately 19 percentage points higher with nivolumab than with standard therapy (36.0% vs. 16.6%). The median progression-free survival was 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.1) with nivolumab versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.1) with standard therapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.13; P=0.32). The rate of progression-free survival at 6 months was 19.7% with nivolumab versus 9.9% with standard therapy. The response rate was 13.3% in the nivolumab group versus 5.8% in the standard-therapy group. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 13.1% of the patients in the nivolumab group versus 35.1% of those in the standard-therapy group. Physical, role, and social functioning was stable in the nivolumab group, whereas it was meaningfully worse in the standard-therapy group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with platinum-refractory, recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, treatment with nivolumab resulted in longer overall survival than treatment with standard, single-agent therapy.

We assessed the efficacy of pembrolizumab for patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.\n## METHODS\nWe did this randomised, open-label, phase 2/3 study at 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries. Patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumour cells were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six per stratum with an interactive voice-response system to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival both in the total population and in patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells. We used a threshold for significance of p<0.00825 (one-sided) for the analysis of overall survival and a threshold of p<0.001 for progression-free survival. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01905657.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we enrolled 1034 patients: 345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 346 allocated to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 allocated to docetaxel. By Sept 30, 2015, 521 patients had died. In the total population, median overall survival was 10.4 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 12.7 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 8.5 months with docetaxel.

Median progression-free survival was 3.9 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 4.0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 4.0 months with docetaxel, with no significant difference for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0.88, 0.74-1.05; p=0.07) or for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94; p=0.004). Among patients with at least 50% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1, overall survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 14.9 months vs 8.2 months; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38-0.77; p=0.0002) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (17.3 months vs 8.2 months; 0.50, 0.36-0.70; p<0.0001).

The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and has a non-overlapping toxicity profile with chemotherapy. We assessed whether the addition of pembrolizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy improves efficacy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nIn this randomised, open-label, phase 2 cohort of a multicohort study (KEYNOTE-021), patients were enrolled at 26 medical centres in the USA and Taiwan. Patients with chemotherapy-naive, stage IIIB or IV, non-squamous NSCLC without targetable EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four stratified by PD-L1 tumour proportion score (<1% vs \u22651%) using an interactive voice-response system to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg plus carboplatin area under curve 5 mg/mL per min and pemetrexed 500 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Nov 25, 2014, and Jan 25, 2016, 123 patients were enrolled; 60 were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 63 to the chemotherapy alone group. 33 (55%; 95% CI 42-68) of 60 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group achieved an objective response compared with 18 (29%; 18-41) of 63 patients in the chemotherapy alone group (estimated treatment difference 26% [95% CI 9-42%]; p=0\u00b70016). The incidence of grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events was similar between groups (23 [39%] of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 16 [26%] of 62 in the chemotherapy alone group). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were anaemia (seven [12%] of 59) and decreased neutrophil count (three [5%]); an additional six events each occurred in two (3%) for acute kidney injury, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, neutropenia, and sepsis, and thrombocytopenia. In the chemotherapy alone group, the most common grade 3 or worse events were anaemia (nine [15%] of 62) and decreased neutrophil count, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia (two [3%] each). One (2%) of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group experienced treatment-related death because of sepsis compared with two (3%) of 62 patients in the chemotherapy group: one because of sepsis and one because of pancytopenia.\n## INTERPRETATION\nCombination of pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed could be an effective and tolerable first-line treatment option for patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

Crossover from the chemotherapy group to the pembrolizumab group was permitted in the event of disease progression. The primary end point, progression-free survival, was assessed by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic review. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response rate, and safety.\n## RESULTS\nMedian progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P<0.001). The estimated rate of overall survival at 6 months was 80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; P=0.005). The response rate was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (44.8% vs. 27.8%), the median duration of response was longer (not reached [range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months] vs. 6.3 months [range, 2.1+ to 12.6+]), and treatment-related adverse events of any grade were less frequent (occurring in 73.4% vs. 90.0% of patients), as were grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events (26.6% vs. 53.3%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall survival and with fewer adverse events than was platinum-based chemotherapy.

This randomized, double-blind phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab or placebo plus etoposide and platinum in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one to receive chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for a total of four doses each in a phased induction schedule (chemotherapy in cycles one to four; ipilimumab or placebo beginning in cycle three up to cycle six), followed by ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks. Primary end point was overall survival (OS) among patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy. Results Of 1,132 patients randomly assigned, 954 received at least one dose of study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 478; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 476). Median OS was 11.0 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 10.9 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09; P = .3775). Median progression-free survival was 4.6 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 4.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97). Rates and severity of treatment-related adverse events were similar between arms, except for diarrhea, rash, and colitis, which were more frequent with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Rate of treatment-related discontinuation was higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (18% v 2% with chemotherapy plus placebo). Five treatment-related deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and two with chemotherapy plus placebo. Conclusion Addition of ipilimumab to chemotherapy did not prolong OS versus chemotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. No new or unexpected adverse events were observed with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Several ongoing studies are evaluating ipilimumab in combination with programmed death-1 inhibitors in SCLC.",

We aimed to assess ipilimumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected stage III melanoma at high risk of recurrence.\n## METHODS\nWe did a double-blind, phase 3 trial in patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma (excluding lymph node metastasis \u22641 mm or in-transit metastasis) with adequate resection of lymph nodes (ie, the primary cutaneous melanoma must have been completely excised with adequate surgical margins) who had not received previous systemic therapy for melanoma from 91 hospitals located in 19 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally by an interactive voice response system, to receive intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab or placebo every 3 weeks for four doses, then every 3 months for up to 3 years. Using a minimisation technique, randomisation was stratified by disease stage and geographical region. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival, assessed by an independent review committee, and analysed by intention to treat. Enrollment is complete but the study is ongoing for follow-up for analysis of secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2007-001974-10, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00636168.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween July 10, 2008, and Aug 1, 2011, 951 patients were randomly assigned to ipilimumab (n=475) or placebo (n=476), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. At a median follow-up of 2\u00b774 years (IQR 2\u00b728-3\u00b722), there were 528 recurrence-free survival events (234 in the ipilimumab group vs 294 in the placebo group). Median recurrence-free survival was 26\u00b71 months (95% CI 19\u00b73-39\u00b73) in the ipilimumab group versus 17\u00b71 months (95% CI 13\u00b74-21\u00b76) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b775; 95% CI 0\u00b764-0\u00b790; p=0\u00b70013); 3-year recurrence-free survival was 46\u00b75% (95% CI 41\u00b75-51\u00b73) in the ipilimumab group versus 34\u00b78% (30\u00b71-39\u00b75) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group were gastrointestinal (75 [16%] vs four [<1%] in the placebo group), hepatic (50 [11%] vs one [<1%]), and endocrine (40 [8%] vs none). Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 245 (52%) of 471 patients who started ipilimumab (182 [39%] during the initial treatment period of four doses). Five patients (1%) died due to drug-related adverse events. Five (1%) participants died because of drug-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group; three patients died because of colitis (two with gastrointestinal perforation), one patient because of myocarditis, and one patient because of multiorgan failure with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAdjuvant ipilimumab significantly improved recurrence-free survival for patients with completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma. The adverse event profile was consistent with that observed in advanced melanoma, but at higher incidences in particular for endocrinopathies. The risk-benefit ratio of adjuvant ipilimumab at this dose and schedule requires additional assessment based on distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival endpoints to define its definitive value.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb.",

Median overall survival was 11\u00b72 months (95% CI 9\u00b75-12\u00b77) with ipilimumab and 10\u00b70 months (8\u00b73-11\u00b70) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b785, 0\u00b772-1\u00b700; p=0\u00b7053). However, the assessment of the proportional hazards assumption showed that it was violated (p=0\u00b70031). A piecewise hazard model showed that the HR changed over time: the HR for 0-5 months was 1\u00b746 (95% CI 1\u00b710-1\u00b795), for 5-12 months was 0\u00b765 (0\u00b750-0\u00b785), and beyond 12 months was 0\u00b760 (0\u00b743-0\u00b786). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were immune-related, occurring in 101 (26%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 11 (3%) of patients in the placebo group. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events included diarrhoea (64 [16%] of 393 patients in the ipilimumab group vs seven [2%] of 396 in the placebo group), fatigue (40 [11%] vs 35 [9%]), anaemia (40 [10%] vs 43 [11%]), and colitis (18 [5%] vs 0). Four (1%) deaths occurred because of toxic effects of the study drug, all in the ipilimumab group.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAlthough there was no significant difference between the ipilimumab group and the placebo group in terms of overall survival in the primary analysis, there were signs of activity with the drug that warrant further investigation.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb.",

We conducted a phase 3 study of ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma.\n## METHODS\nWe randomly assigned 502 patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma, in a 1:1 ratio, to ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter) plus placebo, given at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, followed by dacarbazine alone every 3 weeks through week 22. Patients with stable disease or an objective response and no dose-limiting toxic effects received ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks thereafter as maintenance therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.\n## RESULTS\nOverall survival was significantly longer in the group receiving ipilimumab plus dacarbazine than in the group receiving dacarbazine plus placebo (11.2 months vs. 9.1 months, with higher survival rates in the ipilimumab-dacarbazine group at 1 year (47.3% vs. 36.3%), 2 years (28.5% vs. 17.9%), and 3 years (20.8% vs. 12.2%) (hazard ratio for death, 0.72; P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 56.3% of patients treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine, as compared with 27.5% treated with dacarbazine and placebo (P<0.001).

In this phase 3 study, ipilimumab--which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 to potentiate an antitumor T-cell response--administered with or without a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine was compared with gp100 alone in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma.\n## METHODS\nA total of 676 HLA-A*0201-positive patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed while they were receiving therapy for metastatic disease, were randomly assigned, in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive ipilimumab plus gp100 (403 patients), ipilimumab alone (137), or gp100 alone (136). Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, was administered with or without gp100 every 3 weeks for up to four treatments (induction). Eligible patients could receive reinduction therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 10.0 months among patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as compared with 6.4 months among patients receiving gp100 alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.68; P<0.001). The median overall survival with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio for death in the comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003). No difference in overall survival was detected between the ipilimumab groups (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100, 1.04; P=0.76). Grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 to 15% of patients treated with ipilimumab and in 3% treated with gp100 alone. There were 14 deaths related to the study drugs (2.1%), and 7 were associated with immune-related adverse events.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIpilimumab, with or without a gp100 peptide vaccine, as compared with gp100 alone, improved overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. Adverse events can be severe, long-lasting, or both, but most are reversible with appropriate treatment. (Funded by Medarex and Bristol-Myers Squibb; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00094653.)",

Durvalumab is an anti-programmed death ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. The phase III open-label CAURAL trial (NCT02454933) investigated osimertinib plus durvalumab versus osimertinib monotherapy in\u00a0patients with EGFR-TKI sensitizing and EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression after EGFR-TKI therapy.\n## METHODS\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally administered osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with or\u00a0without durvalumab (10 mg/kg administered intravenously every 2 weeks) until progression. Treatment could continue beyond progression, providing clinical benefit continued (judged by the investigator). The amended primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib plus durvalumab; efficacy was an exploratory objective.\n## RESULTS\nCAURAL recruitment was terminated early because of increased incidence of interstitial lung disease-like events in the osimertinib plus durvalumab arm from the separate phase Ib TATTON trial (NCT02143466). At termination of CAURAL recruitment, 15 patients had been randomly assigned to treatment with osimertinib and 14 to treatment with osimertinib plus durvalumab. The most common AEs were diarrhea (53% [grade \u22653 in 6% of patients])\u00a0in the osimertinib arm and rash (67% [grade \u22653 in 0 patients]) in the combination arm. One patient who had been randomized to the combination arm reported grade 2 interstitial lung disease while receiving osimertinib monotherapy (after discontinuing durvalumab therapy after one dose). The objective response rates were 80% in the osimertinib arm and 64% in the combination arm.\n## CONCLUSION\nLimited patient numbers preclude formal safety and efficacy comparisons between the two treatment arms. The combination of programmed cell death 1/programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors and EGFR-TKIs as therapy for NSCLC is not well understood, but it requires a careful approach if considered in the future.",

Pembrolizumab showed antitumour activity and manageable toxicity in early-phase trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care therapy for the treatment of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.\n## METHODS\nWe did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study at 97 medical centres in 20 countries. Patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma that progressed during or after platinum-containing treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease (or both), or whose disease recurred or progressed within 3-6 months of previous multimodal therapy containing platinum for locally advanced disease, were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks intravenously or investigator's choice of standard doses of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab intravenously (standard-of-care group). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in the as-treated population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02252042, and is no longer enrolling patients.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Dec 24, 2014, and May 13, 2016, 247 patients were randomly allocated to pembrolizumab and 248 were randomly allocated to standard of care. As of May 15, 2017, 181 (73%) of 247 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 207 (83%) of 248 patients in the standard-of-care group had died. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 8\u00b74 months (95% CI 6\u00b74-9\u00b74) with pembrolizumab and 6\u00b79 months (5\u00b79-8\u00b70) with standard of care (hazard ratio 0\u00b780, 0\u00b765-0\u00b798; nominal p=0\u00b70161). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab than with standard of care had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events (33 [13%] of 246 vs 85 [36%] of 234). The most common treatment-related adverse event was hypothyroidism with pembrolizumab (in 33 [13%] patients) and fatigue with standard of care (in 43 [18%]).

Patients aged at least 18 years with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and disease progression on or intolerance to at least two previous systemic chemotherapy regimens were enrolled. We used permuted-block randomisation (block size four) to assign patients (2:1:1) via an interactive voice and web response system to atezolizumab (840 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) plus cobimetinib (60 mg orally once daily for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle), atezolizumab monotherapy (1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks), or regorafenib (160 mg orally once daily for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle). Stratification factors were extended RAS status (wild-type vs mutant) and time since diagnosis of first metastasis (<18 months vs \u226518 months). Recruitment of patients with high microsatellite instability was capped at 5%. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the population of patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. IMblaze370 is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788279.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween July 27, 2016, and Jan 19, 2017, 363 patients were enrolled (183 patients in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 90 in the regorafenib group). At data cutoff (March 9, 2018), median follow-up was 7\u00b73 months (IQR 3\u00b77-13\u00b76). Median overall survival was 8\u00b787 months (95% CI 7\u00b700-10\u00b761) with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, 7\u00b710 months (6\u00b705-10\u00b705) with atezolizumab, and 8\u00b751 months (6\u00b741-10\u00b771) with regorafenib; the hazard ratio was 1\u00b700 (95% CI 0\u00b773-1\u00b738; p=0\u00b799) for the combination versus regorafenib and 1\u00b719 (0\u00b783-1\u00b771; p=0\u00b734) for atezolizumab versus regorafenib. Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 109 (61%) of 179 patients in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 28 (31%) of 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 46 (58%) of 80 in the regorafenib group. The most common all-cause grade 3-4 adverse events in the combination group were diarrhoea (20 [11%] of 179), anaemia (ten [6%]), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (12 [7%]), and fatigue (eight [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 71 (40%) of 179 patients in the combination group, 15 (17%) of 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 18 (23%) of 80 in the regorafenib group. Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the combination group (sepsis) and one in the regorafenib group (intestinal perforation).\n## INTERPRETATION\nIMblaze370 did not meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib or atezolizumab versus regorafenib. The safety of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib was consistent with those of the individual drugs. These results underscore the challenge of expanding the benefit of immunotherapy to patients whose tumours have lower baseline levels of immune inflammation, such as those with microsatellite-stable metastatic colorectal cancer.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd/Genentech Inc.",

KEYNOTE-183 assessed efficacy and safety of pomalidomide and dexamethasone with or without pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Here, we present the findings of an unplanned, ad-hoc interim analysis at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n## METHODS\nKEYNOTE-183 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 97 medical centres across 11 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and USA). Patients aged at least 18 years with multiple myeloma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, previously treated with at least two lines of therapy (excluding pomalidomide) and refractory to the last line were randomly assigned 1:1 to the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group via an interactive voice response or integrated web response system. Patients received oral pomalidomide 4 mg daily on days 1-21 and oral low-dose dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in 28-day cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The dual primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival. Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned patients and safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02576977, and it is closed for accrual.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 18, 2016, and June 7, 2017, 249 patients were randomly assigned to either the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=125) or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=124). On July 3, 2017, the FDA established that risks associated with the triple combination outweighed benefits and halted the study. Median follow-up was 8\u00b71 months (IQR 4\u00b75-10\u00b79). Median progression-free survival was 5\u00b76 months (95% CI 3\u00b77-7\u00b75) in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 8\u00b74 months (5\u00b79-not reached) in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group; progression-free survival estimates at 6 months were 48% (95% CI 37-58) versus 60% (49-69) at 6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b753; 95% CI 1\u00b705-2\u00b722; p=0\u00b798). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI 12\u00b79-not reached) versus 15\u00b72 months (12\u00b77-not reached; HR 1\u00b761; 95% CI 0\u00b791-2\u00b785; p=0\u00b795); overall survival estimates at 6 months were 82% (95% CI 74-88) versus 90% (82-95). Serious adverse events occurred in 75 (63%) of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 56 (46%) of 121 patients in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group. Four (3%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (one each of unknown cause, neutropenic sepsis, myocarditis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome); myocarditis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were considered related to pembrolizumab. No treatment-related deaths were reported in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe results from this unplanned, FDA-requested, interim analysis showed that the benefit-risk profile of pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone is unfavourable for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\n## FUNDING\nMerck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co (Kenilworth, NJ, USA).",

We investigated overall survival after treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater.\n## METHODS\nThis randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 213 medical centres in 32 countries. Eligible patients were adults (\u226518 years) with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without a sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, life expectancy 3 months or longer, and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. Randomisation was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (\u226550% vs 1-49%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0\u00b70122, p=0\u00b70120, and p=0\u00b70124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the previous findings were significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894.\n## FINDINGS\nFrom Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57-69]) with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 patients (64%) had a TPS of 20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12\u00b78 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (\u226550% hazard ratio 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b785, p=0\u00b70003; \u226520% 0\u00b777, 0\u00b764-0\u00b792, p=0\u00b70020, and \u22651% 0\u00b781, 0\u00b771-0\u00b793, p=0\u00b70018).

Here, we report results of IMmotion151, a phase 3 trial comparing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib in first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n## METHODS\nIn this multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, patients with a component of clear cell or sarcomatoid histology and who were previously untreated, were recruited from 152 academic medical centres and community oncology practices in 21 countries, mainly in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region, and were randomly assigned 1:1 to either atezolizumab 1200 mg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks or sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off. A permuted-block randomisation (block size of 4) was applied to obtain a balanced assignment to each treatment group with respect to the stratification factors. Study investigators and participants were not masked to treatment allocation. Patients, investigators, independent radiology committee members, and the sponsor were masked to PD-L1 expression status. Co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the PD-L1 positive population and overall survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02420821.\n## FINDINGS\nOf 915 patients enrolled between May 20, 2015, and Oct 12, 2016, 454 were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 461 to the sunitinib group. 362 (40%) of 915 patients had PD-L1 positive disease. Median follow-up was 15 months at the primary progression-free survival analysis and 24 months at the overall survival interim analysis. In the PD-L1 positive population, the median progression-free survival was 11\u00b72 months in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group versus 7\u00b77 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b774 [95% CI 0\u00b757-0\u00b796]; p=0\u00b70217). In the ITT population, median overall survival had an HR of 0\u00b793 (0\u00b776-1\u00b714) and the results did not cross the significance boundary at the interim analysis. 182 (40%) of 451 patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 240 (54%) of 446 patients in the sunitinib group had treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events: 24 (5%) in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 37 (8%) in the sunitinib group had treatment-related all-grade adverse events, which led to treatment-regimen discontinuation.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab plus bevacizumab prolonged progression-free survival versus sunitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and showed a favourable safety profile.

Whether pembrolizumab plus axitinib would result in better outcomes than sunitinib in such patients was unclear.\n## METHODS\nIn an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 861 patients with previously untreated advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks plus axitinib (5 mg) orally twice daily (432 patients) or sunitinib (50 mg) orally once daily for the first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle (429 patients). The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The key secondary end point was the objective response rate. All reported results are from the protocol-specified first interim analysis.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 12.8 months, the estimated percentage of patients who were alive at 12 months was 89.9% in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 78.3% in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 0.74; P<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 15.1 months in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 11.1 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.84; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 59.3% (95% CI, 54.5 to 63.9) in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 35.7% (95% CI, 31.1 to 40.4) in the sunitinib group (P<0.001). The benefit of pembrolizumab plus axitinib was observed across the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups (i.e., favorable, intermediate, and poor risk) and regardless of programmed death ligand 1 expression. Grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 75.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and in 70.6% in the sunitinib group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival, as well as a higher objective response rate, than treatment with sunitinib.

                "key_reference_abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nLenalidomide and dexamethasone has been a standard of care in transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The addition of a third drug to the combination is likely to improve treatment efficacy. KEYNOTE-185 assessed the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone with and without pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Here, we present the results of an unplanned interim analysis done to assess the benefit-risk of the combination at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n## METHODS\nKEYNOTE-185 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 95 medical centres across 15 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, UK, and USA). Transplantation-ineligible patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who were treatment naive were enrolled, and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone using an interactive voice or integrated web response system. Patients received oral lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1-21 and oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which was investigator-assessed because of early trial termination. Efficacy was analysed in all randomly assigned patients and safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579863, and it is closed for accrual.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 7, 2016, and June 9, 2017, 301 patients were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=151) or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=150). On July 3, 2017, the FDA decided to halt the study because of the imbalance in the proportion of death between groups. At database cutoff (June 2, 2017), with a median follow-up of 6\u00b76 months (IQR 3\u00b74-9\u00b76), 149 patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 145 in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had received their assigned study drug. Median progression-free survival was not reached in either group; progression-free survival estimates at 6-months were 82\u00b70% (95% CI 73\u00b72-88\u00b71) versus 85\u00b70% (76\u00b78-90\u00b75; hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b722; 95% CI 0\u00b767-2\u00b722; p=0\u00b775). Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (54%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 57 (39%) patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; the most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (nine [6%]) and pyrexia (seven [5%]) in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and pneumonia (eight [6%]) and sepsis (two [1%]) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. Six (4%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, myocarditis, large intestine perforation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism) and two (1%) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and respiratory failure).\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe results from this unplanned, FDA-requested, interim analysis showed that the benefit-risk profile of pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone is unfavourable for patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple myeloma. Long-term safety and survival follow-up is ongoing.\n## FUNDING\nMerck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co, Inc (Kenilworth, NJ, USA).",

Among patients with a tumor proportion score for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) of 50% or greater, pembrolizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of choice. The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly higher rates of response and longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone in a phase 2 trial.\n## METHODS\nIn this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) 616 patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations who had received no previous treatment for metastatic disease to receive pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug plus either 200 mg of pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab or placebo for up to a total of 35 cycles plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy. Crossover to pembrolizumab monotherapy was permitted among the patients in the placebo-combination group who had verified disease progression. The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded, independent central radiologic review.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 10.5 months, the estimated rate of overall survival at 12 months was 69.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) in the pembrolizumab-combination group versus 49.4% (95% CI, 42.1 to 56.2) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P<0.001). Improvement in overall survival was seen across all PD-L1 categories that were evaluated. Median progression-free survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.5) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 67.2% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 65.8% of those in the placebo-combination group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy of pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive carboplatin and etoposide with either atezolizumab or placebo for four 21-day cycles (induction phase), followed by a maintenance phase during which they received either atezolizumab or placebo (according to the previous random assignment) until they had unacceptable toxic effects, disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or no additional clinical benefit. The two primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 201 patients were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab group, and 202 patients to the placebo group.

In this study, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety after extended follow-up to inform the long-term clinical benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus sunitinib in this setting.\n## METHODS\nIn the phase 3, randomised, controlled CheckMate 214 trial, patients aged 18 years and older with previously untreated, advanced, or metastatic histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma with a clear-cell component were recruited from 175 hospitals and cancer centres in 28 countries. Patients were categorised by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk status into favourable-risk, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk subgroups and randomly assigned (1:1) to open-label nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) every 2 weeks; or sunitinib (50 mg orally) once daily for 4 weeks (6-week cycle). Randomisation was done through an interactive voice response system, with a block size of four and stratified by risk status and geographical region. The co-primary endpoints for the trial were overall survival, progression-free survival per independent radiology review committee (IRRC), and objective responses per IRRC in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival per IRRC, and objective responses per IRRC in the intention-to-treat population, and adverse events in all treated patients. In this Article, we report overall survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, investigator-assessed objective response, characterisation of response, and safety after extended follow-up. Efficacy outcomes were assessed in all randomly assigned patients; safety was assessed in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02231749, and is ongoing but now closed to recruitment.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Oct 16, 2014, and Feb 23, 2016, of 1390 patients screened, 1096 (79%) eligible patients were randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab or sunitinib (550 vs 546 in the intention-to-treat population; 425 vs 422 intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, and 125 vs 124 favourable-risk patients). With extended follow-up (median follow-up 32\u00b74 months [IQR 13\u00b74-36\u00b73]), in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, results for the three co-primary efficacy endpoints showed that nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to be superior to sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI 35\u00b76-not estimable] vs 26\u00b76 months [22\u00b71-33\u00b74]; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b766 [95% CI 0\u00b754-0\u00b780], p<0\u00b70001), progression-free survival (median 8\u00b72 months [95% CI 6\u00b79-10\u00b70] vs 8\u00b73 months [7\u00b70-8\u00b78]; HR 0\u00b777 [95% CI 0\u00b765-0\u00b790], p=0\u00b70014), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (178 [42%] of 425 vs 124 [29%] of 422; p=0\u00b70001). Similarly, in intention-to-treat patients, nivolumab and ipilimumab showed improved efficacy compared with sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI not estimable] vs 37\u00b79 months [32\u00b72-not estimable]; HR 0\u00b771 [95% CI 0\u00b759-0\u00b786], p=0\u00b70003), progression-free survival (median 9\u00b77 months [95% CI 8\u00b71-11\u00b71] vs 9\u00b77 months [8\u00b73-11\u00b71]; HR 0\u00b785 [95% CI 0\u00b773-0\u00b798], p=0\u00b7027), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (227 [41%] of 550 vs 186 [34%] of 546 p=0\u00b7015). In all treated patients, the most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events in the nivolumab and ipilimumab group were increased lipase (57 [10%] of 547), increased amylase (31 [6%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (28 [5%]), whereas in the sunitinib group they were hypertension (90 [17%] of 535), fatigue (51 [10%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (49 [9%]). Eight deaths in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and four deaths in the sunitinib group were reported as treatment-related.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe results suggest that the superior efficacy of nivolumab plus ipilimumab over sunitinib was maintained in intermediate-risk or poor-risk and intention-to-treat patients with extended follow-up, and show the long-term benefits of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma across all risk categories.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb and ONO Pharmaceutical.",

More recently, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was shown to significantly prolong overall survival among patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nIn this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 559 patients with untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles; all the patients also received carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]-paclitaxel for the first 4 cycles. Primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival was 15.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 14.8) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001). The overall survival benefit was consistent regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. The median progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebo-combination group. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was more frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination group (13.3% vs. 6.4%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) versus chemotherapy in this patient population.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted this multicentre, open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial (IMvigor211) at 217 academic medical centres and community oncology practices mainly in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients (aged \u226518 years) with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice and web response system with a permuted block design (block size of four), to receive atezolizumab 1200 mg or chemotherapy (physician's choice: vinflunine 320 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 13, 2015, and Feb 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 931 patients from 198 sites to receive atezolizumab (n=467) or chemotherapy (n=464). In the IC2/3 population (n=234), overall survival did not differ significantly between patients in the atezolizumab group and those in the chemotherapy group (median 11\u00b71 months [95% CI 8\u00b76-15\u00b75; n=116] vs 10\u00b76 months [8\u00b74-12\u00b72; n=118]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b787, 95% CI 0\u00b763-1\u00b721; p=0\u00b741), thus precluding further formal statistical analysis. Confirmed objective response rates were similar between treatment groups in the IC2/3 population: 26 (23%) of 113 evaluable patients had an objective response in the atezolizumab group compared with 25 (22%) of 116 patients in the chemotherapy group. Duration of response was numerically longer in the atezolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (median 15\u00b79 months [95% CI 10\u00b74 to not estimable] vs 8\u00b73 months [5\u00b76-13\u00b72]; HR 0\u00b757, 95% CI 0\u00b726-1\u00b726). In the intention-to-treat population, patients receiving atezolizumab had fewer grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events than did those receiving chemotherapy (91 [20%] of 459 vs 189 [43%] of 443 patients), and fewer adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (34 [7%] vs 78 [18%] patients).\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab was not associated with significantly longer overall survival than chemotherapy in patients with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma overexpressing PD-L1 (IC2/3). However, the safety profile for atezolizumab was favourable compared with chemotherapy, Exploratory analysis of the intention-to-treat population showed well-tolerated, durable responses in line with previous phase 2 data for atezolizumab in this setting.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche, Genentech.",

We compared pembrolizumab with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer that progressed on first-line chemotherapy with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine.\n## METHODS\nThis randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done at 148 medical centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients were randomised (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or standard-dose paclitaxel. Primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) of 1 or higher. Safety was assessed in all patients, irrespective of CPS. The significance threshold for overall survival was p=0\u00b70135 (one-sided). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02370498.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween June 4, 2015, and July 26, 2016, 592 patients were enrolled. Of the 395 patients who had a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher, 196 patients were assigned to receive pembrolizumab and 199 patients were assigned to receive paclitaxel. As of Oct 26, 2017, 326 patients in the population with CPS of 1 or higher had died (151 [77%] of 196 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 175 [88%] of 199 patients in the paclitaxel group). Median overall survival was 9\u00b71 months (95% CI 6\u00b72-10\u00b77) with pembrolizumab and 8\u00b73 months (7\u00b76-9\u00b70) with paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b782, 95% CI 0\u00b766-1\u00b703; one-sided p=0\u00b70421). Median progression-free survival was 1\u00b75 months (95% CI 1\u00b74-2\u00b70) with pembrolizumab and 4\u00b71 months (3\u00b71-4\u00b72) with paclitaxel (HR 1\u00b727, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b757). In the total population, grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 42 (14%) of the 294 patients treated with pembrolizumab and 96 (35%) of the 276 patients treated with paclitaxel.\n## INTERPRETATION\nPembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival compared with paclitaxel as second-line therapy for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher. Pembrolizumab had a better safety profile than paclitaxel. Additional trials of pembrolizumab in gastric and gastro-oesophageal cancer are ongoing.\n## FUNDING\nMerck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co.",

Here we report the results for the second primary end point of overall survival.\n## METHODS\nWe randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive durvalumab intravenously, at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight, or matching placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. Randomization occurred 1 to 42 days after the patients had received chemoradiotherapy and was stratified according to age, sex, and smoking history. The primary end points were progression-free survival (as assessed by blinded independent central review) and overall survival. Secondary end points included the time to death or distant metastasis, the time to second progression, and safety.\n## RESULTS\nOf the 713 patients who underwent randomization, 709 received the assigned intervention (473 patients received durvalumab and 236 received placebo). As of March 22, 2018, the median follow-up was 25.2 months. The 24-month overall survival rate was 66.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.7 to 70.4) in the durvalumab group, as compared with 55.6% (95% CI, 48.9 to 61.8) in the placebo group (two-sided P=0.005). Durvalumab significantly prolonged overall survival, as compared with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.68; 99.73% CI, 0.47 to 0.997; P=0.0025). Updated analyses regarding progression-free survival were similar to those previously reported, with a median duration of 17.2 months in the durvalumab group and 5.6 months in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.63). The median time to death or distant metastasis was 28.3 months in the durvalumab group and 16.2 months in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.68). A total of 30.5% of the patients in the durvalumab group and 26.1% of those in the placebo group had grade 3 or 4 adverse events of any cause; 15.4% and 9.8% of the patients, respectively, discontinued the trial regimen because of adverse events.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDurvalumab therapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than placebo.

This phase II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab monotherapy versus best supportive care (BSC) among patients with advanced/metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who achieved at least stable disease with first-line chemotherapy.Experimental Design: Eligible patients were randomized to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, then 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks for up to 3 years, or BSC, which could include continuation of fluoropyrimidine until progression or toxicity. The primary endpoint was immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS); secondary endpoints included PFS by modified World Health Organization criteria and overall survival (OS).Results: Of 143 patients screened, 57 were randomized to each arm. irPFS with ipilimumab versus BSC was not improved [2.92 months, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.61-5.16 vs. 4.90 months, 95% CI, 3.45-6.54, HR = 1.44; 80% CI, 1.09-1.91; P = 0.097], resulting in study cessation. At study closeout, which occurred 8 months after the interim analysis, the median OS durations were 12.7 months (95% CI, 10.5-18.9) and 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.3-not estimable), respectively. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 23% of ipilimumab-treated patients, in whom diarrhea (9%) and fatigue (5%) were most frequent, and in 9% of active BSC-treated patients.Conclusions: Although ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg was manageable, it did not improve irPFS versus BSC. However, comparable median OS of approximately 1 year and a favorable safety profile support the investigation of ipilimumab in combination with other therapies for advanced gastric cancer.

This randomized, double-blind, phase III study investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line ipilimumab or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced squamous NSCLC. Patients and Methods Patients with stage IV or recurrent chemotherapy-na\u00efve squamous NSCLC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin plus blinded ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks on a phased induction schedule comprising six chemotherapy cycles, with ipilimumab or placebo from cycles 3 to 6 and then, after induction treatment, ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy. Results Of 956 randomly assigned patients, 749 received at least one dose of blinded study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 388; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 361). Median OS was 13.4 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 12.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.07; P = .25). Median progression-free survival was 5.6 months for both groups (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01). Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), any-grade serious TRAEs, and TRAEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (51%, 33%, and 28%, respectively) than with chemotherapy plus placebo (35%, 10%, and 7%, respectively). Seven treatment-related deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, and one occurred with chemotherapy plus placebo. Conclusion The addition of ipilimumab to first-line chemotherapy did not prolong OS compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. The safety profile of chemotherapy plus ipilimumab was consistent with that observed in previous lung and melanoma studies.

In the DETERMINE study, we investigated the effects of the cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody tremelimumab in patients with previously treated advanced malignant mesothelioma.\n## METHODS\nDETERMINE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial done at 105 study centres across 19 countries in patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who had progressed after one or two previous systemic treatments for advanced disease. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease as defined in the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST version 1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) in blocks of three, stratified by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer status (low risk vs high risk), line of therapy (second line vs third line), and anatomic site (pleural vs peritoneal), by use of an interactive voice or web system, to receive intravenous tremelimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 7 doses and every 12 weeks thereafter until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01843374.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween May 17, 2013, and Dec 4, 2014, 571 patients were randomly assigned to receive tremelimumab (n=382) or placebo (n=189), of whom 569 patients received treatment (two patients in the tremelimumab group were excluded from the safety population because they did not receive treatment). At the data cutoff date (Jan 24, 2016), 307 (80%) of 382 patients had died in the tremelimumab group and 154 (81%) of 189 patients had died in the placebo group. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population did not differ between the treatment groups: 7\u00b77 months (95% CI 6\u00b78-8\u00b79) in the tremelimumab group and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b79-8\u00b77) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b792 [95% CI 0\u00b776-1\u00b712], p=0\u00b741). Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 246 (65%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 91 (48%) of 189 patients in the placebo group; the most common were dyspnoea (34 [9%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs 27 [14%] patients in the placebo group), diarrhoea (58 [15%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (26 [7%] vs none). The most common serious adverse events were diarrhoea (69 [18%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs one [<1%] patient in the placebo group), dyspnoea (29 [8%] vs 24 [13%]), and colitis (24 [6%] vs none). Treatment-emergent events leading to death occurred in 36 (9%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 12 (6%) of 189 in the placebo group; those leading to the death of more than one patient were mesothelioma (three [1%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs two [1%] in the placebo group), dyspnoea (three [1%] vs two [1%]); respiratory failure (one [<1%] vs three [2%]), myocardial infarction (three [1%] vs none), lung infection (three [1%] patients vs none), cardiac failure (one [<1%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (two [<1%] vs none). Treatment-related adverse events leading to death occurred in five (1%) patients in the tremelimumab group and none in the placebo group. The causes of death were lung infection in one patient, intestinal perforation and small intestinal obstruction in one patient; colitis in two patients, and neuritis and skin ulcer in one patient.\n## INTERPRETATION\nTremelimumab did not significantly prolong overall survival compared with placebo in patients with previously treated malignant mesothelioma. The safety profile of tremelimumab was consistent with the known safety profile of CTLA-4 inhibitors. Investigations into whether immunotherapy combination regimens can provide greater efficacy than monotherapies in malignant mesothelioma are ongoing.\n## FUNDING\nAstraZeneca.",

We assessed its efficacy and safety versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.\n## METHODS\nWe did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (OAK) in 194 academic or community oncology centres in 31 countries. We enrolled patients who had squamous or non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, were 18 years or older, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had received one to two previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (one or more platinum based combination therapies) for stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease and those who had received previous treatments with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, or therapies targeting the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenously receive either atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween March 11, 2014, and April 29, 2015, 1225 patients were recruited. In the primary population, 425 patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab and 425 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer with atezolizumab in the ITT and PD-L1-expression populations. In the ITT population, overall survival was improved with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel (median overall survival was 13\u00b78 months [95% CI 11\u00b78-15\u00b77] vs 9\u00b76 months [8\u00b76-11\u00b72]; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b773 [95% CI 0\u00b762-0\u00b787], p=0\u00b70003). Overall survival in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population was improved with atezolizumab (n=241) compared with docetaxel (n=222; median overall survival was 15\u00b77 months [95% CI 12\u00b76-18\u00b70] with atezolizumab vs 10\u00b73 months [8\u00b78-12\u00b70] with docetaxel; HR 0\u00b774 [95% CI 0\u00b758-0\u00b793]; p=0\u00b70102). Patients in the PD-L1 low or undetectable subgroup (TC0 and IC0) also had improved survival with atezolizumab (median overall survival 12\u00b76 months vs 8\u00b79 months; HR 0\u00b775 [95% CI 0\u00b759-0\u00b796]). Overall survival improvement was similar in patients with squamous (HR 0\u00b773 [95% CI 0\u00b754-0\u00b798]; n=112 in the atezolizumab group and n=110 in the docetaxel group) or non-squamous (0\u00b773 [0\u00b760-0\u00b789]; n=313 and n=315) histology. Fewer patients had treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events with atezolizumab (90 [15%] of 609 patients) versus docetaxel (247 [43%] of 578 patients). One treatment-related death from a respiratory tract infection was reported in the docetaxel group.\n## INTERPRETATION\nTo our knowledge, OAK is the first randomised phase 3 study to report results of a PD-L1-targeted therapy, with atezolizumab treatment resulting in a clinically relevant improvement of overall survival versus docetaxel in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression or histology, with a favourable safety profile.\n## FUNDING\nF.

The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer, including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-infiltrating immune cells, or both. We assessed efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1 expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population.\n## METHODS\nIn this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating immune cell status, histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block size of four) using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3\u226550%, TC2\u22655% and <50%, TC1\u22651% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3\u226510%, IC2\u22655% and <10%, IC1\u22651% and <5%, and IC0<1%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at 173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993.\n## FINDINGS\nPatients were enrolled between Aug 5, 2013, and March 31, 2014. 144 patients were randomly allocated to the atezolizumab group, and 143 to the docetaxel group. 142 patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and 135 received docetaxel. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 12\u00b76 months (95% CI 9\u00b77-16\u00b74) for atezolizumab versus 9\u00b77 months (8\u00b76-12\u00b70) for docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b773 [95% CI 0\u00b753-0\u00b799]; p=0\u00b704). Increasing improvement in overall survival was associated with increasing PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3 HR 0\u00b749 [0\u00b722-1\u00b707; p=0\u00b7068], TC2/3 or IC2/3 HR 0\u00b754 [0\u00b733-0\u00b789; p=0\u00b7014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0\u00b759 [0\u00b740-0\u00b785; p=0\u00b7005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1\u00b704 [0\u00b762-1\u00b775; p=0\u00b7871]). In our exploratory analysis, patients with pre-existing immunity, defined by high T-effector-interferon-\u03b3-associated gene expression, had improved overall survival with atezolizumab. 11 (8%) patients in the atezolizumab group discontinued because of adverse events versus 30 (22%) patients in the docetaxel group. 16 (11%) patients in the atezolizumab group versus 52 (39%) patients in the docetaxel group had treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events, and one (<1%) patient in the atezolizumab group versus three (2%) patients in the docetaxel group died from a treatment-related adverse event.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab significantly improved survival compared with docetaxel in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is predictive for atezolizumab benefit. Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile distinct from chemotherapy.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech Inc.",

The primary end point was overall survival. Additional end points included progression-free survival, rate of objective response, safety, and patient-reported quality of life.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 9.1) in the nivolumab group versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) in the group that received standard therapy.

The median progression-free survival was 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.1) with nivolumab versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.1) with standard therapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.13; P=0.32). The rate of progression-free survival at 6 months was 19.7% with nivolumab versus 9.9% with standard therapy. The response rate was 13.3% in the nivolumab group versus 5.8% in the standard-therapy group. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 13.1% of the patients in the nivolumab group versus 35.1% of those in the standard-therapy group. Physical, role, and social functioning was stable in the nivolumab group, whereas it was meaningfully worse in the standard-therapy group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with platinum-refractory, recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, treatment with nivolumab resulted in longer overall survival than treatment with standard, single-agent therapy.

We assessed the efficacy of pembrolizumab for patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.\n## METHODS\nWe did this randomised, open-label, phase 2/3 study at 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries. Patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumour cells were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six per stratum with an interactive voice-response system to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival both in the total population and in patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells. We used a threshold for significance of p<0.00825 (one-sided) for the analysis of overall survival and a threshold of p<0.001 for progression-free survival. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01905657.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we enrolled 1034 patients: 345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 346 allocated to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 allocated to docetaxel. By Sept 30, 2015, 521 patients had died. In the total population, median overall survival was 10.4 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 12.7 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 8.5 months with docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.88; p=0.0008) and for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0.61, 0.49-0.75; p<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 3.9 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 4.0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 4.0 months with docetaxel, with no significant difference for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0.88, 0.74-1.05; p=0.07) or for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94; p=0.004). Among patients with at least 50% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1, overall survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 14.9 months vs 8.2 months; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38-0.77; p=0.0002) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (17.3 months vs 8.2 months; 0.50, 0.36-0.70; p<0.0001). Likewise, for this patient population, progression-free survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 5.0 months vs 4.1 months; HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.78; p=0.0001) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (5.2 months vs 4.1 months; 0.59, 0.45-0.78; p<0.0001). Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were less common with pembrolizumab than with docetaxel (43 [13%] of 339 patients given 2 mg/kg, 55 [16%] of 343 given 10 mg/kg, and 109 [35%] of 309 given docetaxel).\n## INTERPRETATION\nPembrolizumab prolongs overall survival and has a favourable benefit-to-risk profile in patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. These data establish pembrolizumab as a new treatment option for this population and validate the use of PD-L1 selection.\n## FUNDING\nMerck & Co.",

The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and has a non-overlapping toxicity profile with chemotherapy. We assessed whether the addition of pembrolizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy improves efficacy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nIn this randomised, open-label, phase 2 cohort of a multicohort study (KEYNOTE-021), patients were enrolled at 26 medical centres in the USA and Taiwan. Patients with chemotherapy-naive, stage IIIB or IV, non-squamous NSCLC without targetable EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four stratified by PD-L1 tumour proportion score (<1% vs \u22651%) using an interactive voice-response system to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg plus carboplatin area under curve 5 mg/mL per min and pemetrexed 500 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Nov 25, 2014, and Jan 25, 2016, 123 patients were enrolled; 60 were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 63 to the chemotherapy alone group. 33 (55%; 95% CI 42-68) of 60 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group achieved an objective response compared with 18 (29%; 18-41) of 63 patients in the chemotherapy alone group (estimated treatment difference 26% [95% CI 9-42%]; p=0\u00b70016). The incidence of grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events was similar between groups (23 [39%] of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 16 [26%] of 62 in the chemotherapy alone group). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were anaemia (seven [12%] of 59) and decreased neutrophil count (three [5%]); an additional six events each occurred in two (3%) for acute kidney injury, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, neutropenia, and sepsis, and thrombocytopenia. In the chemotherapy alone group, the most common grade 3 or worse events were anaemia (nine [15%] of 62) and decreased neutrophil count, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia (two [3%] each). One (2%) of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group experienced treatment-related death because of sepsis compared with two (3%) of 62 patients in the chemotherapy group: one because of sepsis and one because of pancytopenia.\n## INTERPRETATION\nCombination of pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed could be an effective and tolerable first-line treatment option for patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. This finding is being further explored in an ongoing international, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study.\n## FUNDING\nMerck & Co.",

Crossover from the chemotherapy group to the pembrolizumab group was permitted in the event of disease progression. The primary end point, progression-free survival, was assessed by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic review. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response rate, and safety.\n## RESULTS\nMedian progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P<0.001).

This randomized, double-blind phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab or placebo plus etoposide and platinum in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one to receive chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for a total of four doses each in a phased induction schedule (chemotherapy in cycles one to four; ipilimumab or placebo beginning in cycle three up to cycle six), followed by ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks. Primary end point was overall survival (OS) among patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy. Results Of 1,132 patients randomly assigned, 954 received at least one dose of study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 478; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 476). Median OS was 11.0 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 10.9 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09; P = .3775). Median progression-free survival was 4.6 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 4.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97). Rates and severity of treatment-related adverse events were similar between arms, except for diarrhea, rash, and colitis, which were more frequent with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Rate of treatment-related discontinuation was higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (18% v 2% with chemotherapy plus placebo). Five treatment-related deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and two with chemotherapy plus placebo. Conclusion Addition of ipilimumab to chemotherapy did not prolong OS versus chemotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. No new or unexpected adverse events were observed with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Several ongoing studies are evaluating ipilimumab in combination with programmed death-1 inhibitors in SCLC.",

We aimed to assess ipilimumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected stage III melanoma at high risk of recurrence.\n## METHODS\nWe did a double-blind, phase 3 trial in patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma (excluding lymph node metastasis \u22641 mm or in-transit metastasis) with adequate resection of lymph nodes (ie, the primary cutaneous melanoma must have been completely excised with adequate surgical margins) who had not received previous systemic therapy for melanoma from 91 hospitals located in 19 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally by an interactive voice response system, to receive intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab or placebo every 3 weeks for four doses, then every 3 months for up to 3 years. Using a minimisation technique, randomisation was stratified by disease stage and geographical region. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival, assessed by an independent review committee, and analysed by intention to treat. Enrollment is complete but the study is ongoing for follow-up for analysis of secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2007-001974-10, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00636168.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween July 10, 2008, and Aug 1, 2011, 951 patients were randomly assigned to ipilimumab (n=475) or placebo (n=476), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. At a median follow-up of 2\u00b774 years (IQR 2\u00b728-3\u00b722), there were 528 recurrence-free survival events (234 in the ipilimumab group vs 294 in the placebo group). Median recurrence-free survival was 26\u00b71 months (95% CI 19\u00b73-39\u00b73) in the ipilimumab group versus 17\u00b71 months (95% CI 13\u00b74-21\u00b76) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b775; 95% CI 0\u00b764-0\u00b790; p=0\u00b70013); 3-year recurrence-free survival was 46\u00b75% (95% CI 41\u00b75-51\u00b73) in the ipilimumab group versus 34\u00b78% (30\u00b71-39\u00b75) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group were gastrointestinal (75 [16%] vs four [<1%] in the placebo group), hepatic (50 [11%] vs one [<1%]), and endocrine (40 [8%] vs none). Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 245 (52%) of 471 patients who started ipilimumab (182 [39%] during the initial treatment period of four doses). Five patients (1%) died due to drug-related adverse events. Five (1%) participants died because of drug-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group; three patients died because of colitis (two with gastrointestinal perforation), one patient because of myocarditis, and one patient because of multiorgan failure with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAdjuvant ipilimumab significantly improved recurrence-free survival for patients with completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma. The adverse event profile was consistent with that observed in advanced melanoma, but at higher incidences in particular for endocrinopathies. The risk-benefit ratio of adjuvant ipilimumab at this dose and schedule requires additional assessment based on distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival endpoints to define its definitive value.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb.",

This randomized, open-label, phase 3 study compared nivolumab with everolimus in patients with renal-cell carcinoma who had received previous treatment.\n## METHODS\nA total of 821 patients with advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma for which they had received previous treatment with one or two regimens of antiangiogenic therapy were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive 3 mg of nivolumab per kilogram of body weight intravenously every 2 weeks or a 10-mg everolimus tablet orally once daily. The primary end point was overall survival. The secondary end points included the objective response rate and safety.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 25.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.8 to not estimable) with nivolumab and 19.6 months (95% CI, 17.6 to 23.1) with everolimus. The hazard ratio for death with nivolumab versus everolimus was 0.73 (98.5% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P=0.002), which met the prespecified criterion for superiority (P\u22640.0148). The objective response rate was greater with nivolumab than with everolimus (25% vs. 5%; odds ratio, 5.98 [95% CI, 3.68 to 9.72]; P<0.001). The median progression-free survival was 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) with nivolumab and 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.5) with everolimus (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03; P=0.11). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19% of the patients receiving nivolumab and in 37% of the patients receiving everolimus; the most common event with nivolumab was fatigue (in 2% of the patients), and the most common event with everolimus was anemia (in 8%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with previously treated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, overall survival was longer and fewer grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred with nivolumab than with everolimus.

Our aim was to assess the use of ipilimumab after radiotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy.\n## METHODS\nWe did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial in which men with at least one bone metastasis from castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive bone-directed radiotherapy (8 Gy in one fraction) followed by either ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to four doses. Non-progressing patients could continue to receive ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg or placebo as maintenance therapy every 3 months until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effect, or death. Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment group via a minimisation algorithm, and stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, alkaline phosphatase concentration, haemoglobin concentration, and investigator site. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00861614.\n## FINDINGS\nFrom May 26, 2009, to Feb 15, 2012, 799 patients were randomly assigned (399 to ipilimumab and 400 to placebo), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Median overall survival was 11\u00b72 months (95% CI 9\u00b75-12\u00b77) with ipilimumab and 10\u00b70 months (8\u00b73-11\u00b70) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b785, 0\u00b772-1\u00b700; p=0\u00b7053). However, the assessment of the proportional hazards assumption showed that it was violated (p=0\u00b70031). A piecewise hazard model showed that the HR changed over time: the HR for 0-5 months was 1\u00b746 (95% CI 1\u00b710-1\u00b795), for 5-12 months was 0\u00b765 (0\u00b750-0\u00b785), and beyond 12 months was 0\u00b760 (0\u00b743-0\u00b786). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were immune-related, occurring in 101 (26%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 11 (3%) of patients in the placebo group. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events included diarrhoea (64 [16%] of 393 patients in the ipilimumab group vs seven [2%] of 396 in the placebo group), fatigue (40 [11%] vs 35 [9%]), anaemia (40 [10%] vs 43 [11%]), and colitis (18 [5%] vs 0). Four (1%) deaths occurred because of toxic effects of the study drug, all in the ipilimumab group.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAlthough there was no significant difference between the ipilimumab group and the placebo group in terms of overall survival in the primary analysis, there were signs of activity with the drug that warrant further investigation.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb.",

In this phase 3 study, ipilimumab--which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 to potentiate an antitumor T-cell response--administered with or without a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine was compared with gp100 alone in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma.\n## METHODS\nA total of 676 HLA-A*0201-positive patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed while they were receiving therapy for metastatic disease, were randomly assigned, in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive ipilimumab plus gp100 (403 patients), ipilimumab alone (137), or gp100 alone (136). Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, was administered with or without gp100 every 3 weeks for up to four treatments (induction). Eligible patients could receive reinduction therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 10.0 months among patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as compared with 6.4 months among patients receiving gp100 alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.68; P<0.001). The median overall survival with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio for death in the comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003). No difference in overall survival was detected between the ipilimumab groups (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100, 1.04; P=0.76). Grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 to 15% of patients treated with ipilimumab and in 3% treated with gp100 alone. There were 14 deaths related to the study drugs (2.1%), and 7 were associated with immune-related adverse events.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIpilimumab, with or without a gp100 peptide vaccine, as compared with gp100 alone, improved overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. Adverse events can be severe, long-lasting, or both, but most are reversible with appropriate treatment. (Funded by Medarex and Bristol-Myers Squibb; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00094653.)",

Durvalumab is an anti-programmed death ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. The phase III open-label CAURAL trial (NCT02454933) investigated osimertinib plus durvalumab versus osimertinib monotherapy in\u00a0patients with EGFR-TKI sensitizing and EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression after EGFR-TKI therapy.\n## METHODS\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally administered osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with or\u00a0without durvalumab (10 mg/kg administered intravenously every 2 weeks) until progression. Treatment could continue beyond progression, providing clinical benefit continued (judged by the investigator). The amended primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib plus durvalumab; efficacy was an exploratory objective.\n## RESULTS\nCAURAL recruitment was terminated early because of increased incidence of interstitial lung disease-like events in the osimertinib plus durvalumab arm from the separate phase Ib TATTON trial (NCT02143466). At termination of CAURAL recruitment, 15 patients had been randomly assigned to treatment with osimertinib and 14 to treatment with osimertinib plus durvalumab. The most common AEs were diarrhea (53% [grade \u22653 in 6% of patients])\u00a0in the osimertinib arm and rash (67% [grade \u22653 in 0 patients]) in the combination arm. One patient who had been randomized to the combination arm reported grade 2 interstitial lung disease while receiving osimertinib monotherapy (after discontinuing durvalumab therapy after one dose). The objective response rates were 80% in the osimertinib arm and 64% in the combination arm.\n## CONCLUSION\nLimited patient numbers preclude formal safety and efficacy comparisons between the two treatment arms. The combination of programmed cell death 1/programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors and EGFR-TKIs as therapy for NSCLC is not well understood, but it requires a careful approach if considered in the future.",

Pembrolizumab showed antitumour activity and manageable toxicity in early-phase trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care therapy for the treatment of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.\n## METHODS\nWe did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study at 97 medical centres in 20 countries. Patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma that progressed during or after platinum-containing treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease (or both), or whose disease recurred or progressed within 3-6 months of previous multimodal therapy containing platinum for locally advanced disease, were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks intravenously or investigator's choice of standard doses of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab intravenously (standard-of-care group). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in the as-treated population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02252042, and is no longer enrolling patients.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Dec 24, 2014, and May 13, 2016, 247 patients were randomly allocated to pembrolizumab and 248 were randomly allocated to standard of care. As of May 15, 2017, 181 (73%) of 247 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 207 (83%) of 248 patients in the standard-of-care group had died. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 8\u00b74 months (95% CI 6\u00b74-9\u00b74) with pembrolizumab and 6\u00b79 months (5\u00b79-8\u00b70) with standard of care (hazard ratio 0\u00b780, 0\u00b765-0\u00b798; nominal p=0\u00b70161). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab than with standard of care had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events (33 [13%] of 246 vs 85 [36%] of 234). The most common treatment-related adverse event was hypothyroidism with pembrolizumab (in 33 [13%] patients) and fatigue with standard of care (in 43 [18%]). Treatment-related death occurred in four patients treated with pembrolizumab (unspecified cause, large intestine perforation, malignant neoplasm progression, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and two patients treated with standard of care (malignant neoplasm progression and pneumonia).\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe clinically meaningful prolongation of overall survival and favourable safety profile of pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma support the further evaluation of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapy in earlier stages of disease.\n## FUNDING\nMerck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co.",

This phase 3 study was designed to assess atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in metastatic colorectal cancer. Here, we report the comparison of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib or atezolizumab monotherapy versus regorafenib in the third-line setting.\n## METHODS\nIMblaze 370 is a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial, done at 73 academic medical centres and community oncology practices in 11 countries. Patients aged at least 18 years with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and disease progression on or intolerance to at least two previous systemic chemotherapy regimens were enrolled. We used permuted-block randomisation (block size four) to assign patients (2:1:1) via an interactive voice and web response system to atezolizumab (840 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) plus cobimetinib (60 mg orally once daily for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle), atezolizumab monotherapy (1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks), or regorafenib (160 mg orally once daily for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle). Stratification factors were extended RAS status (wild-type vs mutant) and time since diagnosis of first metastasis (<18 months vs \u226518 months). Recruitment of patients with high microsatellite instability was capped at 5%. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the population of patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. IMblaze370 is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788279.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween July 27, 2016, and Jan 19, 2017, 363 patients were enrolled (183 patients in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 90 in the regorafenib group). At data cutoff (March 9, 2018), median follow-up was 7\u00b73 months (IQR 3\u00b77-13\u00b76). Median overall survival was 8\u00b787 months (95% CI 7\u00b700-10\u00b761) with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, 7\u00b710 months (6\u00b705-10\u00b705) with atezolizumab, and 8\u00b751 months (6\u00b741-10\u00b771) with regorafenib; the hazard ratio was 1\u00b700 (95% CI 0\u00b773-1\u00b738; p=0\u00b799) for the combination versus regorafenib and 1\u00b719 (0\u00b783-1\u00b771; p=0\u00b734) for atezolizumab versus regorafenib. Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 109 (61%) of 179 patients in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 28 (31%) of 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 46 (58%) of 80 in the regorafenib group. The most common all-cause grade 3-4 adverse events in the combination group were diarrhoea (20 [11%] of 179), anaemia (ten [6%]), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (12 [7%]), and fatigue (eight [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 71 (40%) of 179 patients in the combination group, 15 (17%) of 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 18 (23%) of 80 in the regorafenib group. Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the combination group (sepsis) and one in the regorafenib group (intestinal perforation).\n## INTERPRETATION\nIMblaze370 did not meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib or atezolizumab versus regorafenib. The safety of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib was consistent with those of the individual drugs. These results underscore the challenge of expanding the benefit of immunotherapy to patients whose tumours have lower baseline levels of immune inflammation, such as those with microsatellite-stable metastatic colorectal cancer.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd/Genentech Inc.",

Randomisation was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (\u226550% vs 1-49%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0\u00b70122, p=0\u00b70120, and p=0\u00b70124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the previous findings were significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894.\n## FINDINGS\nFrom Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57-69]) with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 patients (64%) had a TPS of 20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12\u00b78 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (\u226550% hazard ratio 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b785, p=0\u00b70003; \u226520% 0\u00b777, 0\u00b764-0\u00b792, p=0\u00b70020, and \u22651% 0\u00b781, 0\u00b771-0\u00b793, p=0\u00b70018). The median surival values by TPS population were 20\u00b70 months (95% CI 15\u00b74-24\u00b79) for pembrolizumab versus 12\u00b72 months (10\u00b74-14\u00b72) for chemotherapy, 17\u00b77 months (15\u00b73-22\u00b71) versus 13\u00b70 months (11\u00b76-15\u00b73), and 16\u00b77 months (13\u00b79-19\u00b77) versus 12\u00b71 months (11\u00b73-13\u00b73), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18%) of 636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41%) of 615 in the chemotherapy group and led to death in 13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients, respectively.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab monotherapy can be extended as first-line therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or ALK alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS.\n## FUNDING\nMerck Sharp & Dohme.",

Here, we report results of IMmotion151, a phase 3 trial comparing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib in first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n## METHODS\nIn this multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, patients with a component of clear cell or sarcomatoid histology and who were previously untreated, were recruited from 152 academic medical centres and community oncology practices in 21 countries, mainly in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region, and were randomly assigned 1:1 to either atezolizumab 1200 mg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks or sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off. A permuted-block randomisation (block size of 4) was applied to obtain a balanced assignment to each treatment group with respect to the stratification factors. Study investigators and participants were not masked to treatment allocation. Patients, investigators, independent radiology committee members, and the sponsor were masked to PD-L1 expression status. Co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the PD-L1 positive population and overall survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02420821.\n## FINDINGS\nOf 915 patients enrolled between May 20, 2015, and Oct 12, 2016, 454 were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 461 to the sunitinib group. 362 (40%) of 915 patients had PD-L1 positive disease. Median follow-up was 15 months at the primary progression-free survival analysis and 24 months at the overall survival interim analysis. In the PD-L1 positive population, the median progression-free survival was 11\u00b72 months in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group versus 7\u00b77 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b774 [95% CI 0\u00b757-0\u00b796]; p=0\u00b70217). In the ITT population, median overall survival had an HR of 0\u00b793 (0\u00b776-1\u00b714) and the results did not cross the significance boundary at the interim analysis. 182 (40%) of 451 patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 240 (54%) of 446 patients in the sunitinib group had treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events: 24 (5%) in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 37 (8%) in the sunitinib group had treatment-related all-grade adverse events, which led to treatment-regimen discontinuation.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab plus bevacizumab prolonged progression-free survival versus sunitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and showed a favourable safety profile. Longer-term follow-up is necessary to establish whether a survival benefit will emerge. These study results support atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as a first-line treatment option for selected patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech Inc.",

Whether pembrolizumab plus axitinib would result in better outcomes than sunitinib in such patients was unclear.\n## METHODS\nIn an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 861 patients with previously untreated advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks plus axitinib (5 mg) orally twice daily (432 patients) or sunitinib (50 mg) orally once daily for the first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle (429 patients). The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The key secondary end point was the objective response rate. All reported results are from the protocol-specified first interim analysis.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 12.8 months, the estimated percentage of patients who were alive at 12 months was 89.9% in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 78.3% in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 0.74; P<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 15.1 months in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 11.1 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.84; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 59.3% (95% CI, 54.5 to 63.9) in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 35.7% (95% CI, 31.1 to 40.4) in the sunitinib group (P<0.001). The benefit of pembrolizumab plus axitinib was observed across the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups (i.e., favorable, intermediate, and poor risk) and regardless of programmed death ligand 1 expression. Grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 75.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and in 70.6% in the sunitinib group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival, as well as a higher objective response rate, than treatment with sunitinib.

The addition of a third drug to the combination is likely to improve treatment efficacy. KEYNOTE-185 assessed the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone with and without pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Here, we present the results of an unplanned interim analysis done to assess the benefit-risk of the combination at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n## METHODS\nKEYNOTE-185 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 95 medical centres across 15 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, UK, and USA). Transplantation-ineligible patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who were treatment naive were enrolled, and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone using an interactive voice or integrated web response system. Patients received oral lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1-21 and oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which was investigator-assessed because of early trial termination. Efficacy was analysed in all randomly assigned patients and safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579863, and it is closed for accrual.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 7, 2016, and June 9, 2017, 301 patients were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=151) or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=150). On July 3, 2017, the FDA decided to halt the study because of the imbalance in the proportion of death between groups. At database cutoff (June 2, 2017), with a median follow-up of 6\u00b76 months (IQR 3\u00b74-9\u00b76), 149 patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 145 in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had received their assigned study drug. Median progression-free survival was not reached in either group; progression-free survival estimates at 6-months were 82\u00b70% (95% CI 73\u00b72-88\u00b71) versus 85\u00b70% (76\u00b78-90\u00b75; hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b722; 95% CI 0\u00b767-2\u00b722; p=0\u00b775). Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (54%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 57 (39%) patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; the most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (nine [6%]) and pyrexia (seven [5%]) in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and pneumonia (eight [6%]) and sepsis (two [1%]) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. Six (4%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, myocarditis, large intestine perforation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism) and two (1%) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and respiratory failure).\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe results from this unplanned, FDA-requested, interim analysis showed that the benefit-risk profile of pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone is unfavourable for patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple myeloma.

All patients were randomised to receive either avelumab 10\u2009mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2\u2009weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 80\u2009mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 or irinotecan 150\u2009mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, each of a 4-week treatment cycle); patients ineligible for chemotherapy received best supportive care. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 371 patients were randomised. The trial did not meet its primary end point of improving OS {median, 4.6 versus 5.0\u2009months; hazard ratio (HR)=1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.4]; P\u2009=\u20090.81} or the secondary end points of PFS [median, 1.4 versus 2.7\u2009months; HR=1.73 (95% CI 1.4-2.2); P\u2009>\u20090.99] or ORR (2.2% versus 4.3%) in the avelumab versus chemotherapy arms, respectively.

Patients were categorised by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk status into favourable-risk, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk subgroups and randomly assigned (1:1) to open-label nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) every 2 weeks; or sunitinib (50 mg orally) once daily for 4 weeks (6-week cycle). Randomisation was done through an interactive voice response system, with a block size of four and stratified by risk status and geographical region. The co-primary endpoints for the trial were overall survival, progression-free survival per independent radiology review committee (IRRC), and objective responses per IRRC in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival per IRRC, and objective responses per IRRC in the intention-to-treat population, and adverse events in all treated patients. In this Article, we report overall survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, investigator-assessed objective response, characterisation of response, and safety after extended follow-up. Efficacy outcomes were assessed in all randomly assigned patients; safety was assessed in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02231749, and is ongoing but now closed to recruitment.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Oct 16, 2014, and Feb 23, 2016, of 1390 patients screened, 1096 (79%) eligible patients were randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab or sunitinib (550 vs 546 in the intention-to-treat population; 425 vs 422 intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, and 125 vs 124 favourable-risk patients). With extended follow-up (median follow-up 32\u00b74 months [IQR 13\u00b74-36\u00b73]), in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, results for the three co-primary efficacy endpoints showed that nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to be superior to sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI 35\u00b76-not estimable] vs 26\u00b76 months [22\u00b71-33\u00b74]; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b766 [95% CI 0\u00b754-0\u00b780], p<0\u00b70001), progression-free survival (median 8\u00b72 months [95% CI 6\u00b79-10\u00b70] vs 8\u00b73 months [7\u00b70-8\u00b78]; HR 0\u00b777 [95% CI 0\u00b765-0\u00b790], p=0\u00b70014), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (178 [42%] of 425 vs 124 [29%] of 422; p=0\u00b70001). Similarly, in intention-to-treat patients, nivolumab and ipilimumab showed improved efficacy compared with sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI not estimable] vs 37\u00b79 months [32\u00b72-not estimable]; HR 0\u00b771 [95% CI 0\u00b759-0\u00b786], p=0\u00b70003), progression-free survival (median 9\u00b77 months [95% CI 8\u00b71-11\u00b71] vs 9\u00b77 months [8\u00b73-11\u00b71]; HR 0\u00b785 [95% CI 0\u00b773-0\u00b798], p=0\u00b7027), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (227 [41%] of 550 vs 186 [34%] of 546 p=0\u00b7015). In all treated patients, the most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events in the nivolumab and ipilimumab group were increased lipase (57 [10%] of 547), increased amylase (31 [6%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (28 [5%]), whereas in the sunitinib group they were hypertension (90 [17%] of 535), fatigue (51 [10%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (49 [9%]). Eight deaths in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and four deaths in the sunitinib group were reported as treatment-related.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe results suggest that the superior efficacy of nivolumab plus ipilimumab over sunitinib was maintained in intermediate-risk or poor-risk and intention-to-treat patients with extended follow-up, and show the long-term benefits of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma across all risk categories.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb and ONO Pharmaceutical.",

More recently, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was shown to significantly prolong overall survival among patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nIn this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 559 patients with untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles; all the patients also received carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]-paclitaxel for the first 4 cycles. Primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival was 15.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 14.8) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001). The overall survival benefit was consistent regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. The median progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebo-combination group. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was more frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination group (13.3% vs. 6.4%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) versus chemotherapy in this patient population.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted this multicentre, open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial (IMvigor211) at 217 academic medical centres and community oncology practices mainly in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients (aged \u226518 years) with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice and web response system with a permuted block design (block size of four), to receive atezolizumab 1200 mg or chemotherapy (physician's choice: vinflunine 320 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 13, 2015, and Feb 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 931 patients from 198 sites to receive atezolizumab (n=467) or chemotherapy (n=464). In the IC2/3 population (n=234), overall survival did not differ significantly between patients in the atezolizumab group and those in the chemotherapy group (median 11\u00b71 months [95% CI 8\u00b76-15\u00b75; n=116] vs 10\u00b76 months [8\u00b74-12\u00b72; n=118]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b787, 95% CI 0\u00b763-1\u00b721; p=0\u00b741), thus precluding further formal statistical analysis. Confirmed objective response rates were similar between treatment groups in the IC2/3 population: 26 (23%) of 113 evaluable patients had an objective response in the atezolizumab group compared with 25 (22%) of 116 patients in the chemotherapy group. Duration of response was numerically longer in the atezolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (median 15\u00b79 months [95% CI 10\u00b74 to not estimable] vs 8\u00b73 months [5\u00b76-13\u00b72]; HR 0\u00b757, 95% CI 0\u00b726-1\u00b726). In the intention-to-treat population, patients receiving atezolizumab had fewer grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events than did those receiving chemotherapy (91 [20%] of 459 vs 189 [43%] of 443 patients), and fewer adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (34 [7%] vs 78 [18%] patients).\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab was not associated with significantly longer overall survival than chemotherapy in patients with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma overexpressing PD-L1 (IC2/3). However, the safety profile for atezolizumab was favourable compared with chemotherapy, Exploratory analysis of the intention-to-treat population showed well-tolerated, durable responses in line with previous phase 2 data for atezolizumab in this setting.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche, Genentech.",

At study closeout, which occurred 8 months after the interim analysis, the median OS durations were 12.7 months (95% CI, 10.5-18.9) and 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.3-not estimable), respectively. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 23% of ipilimumab-treated patients, in whom diarrhea (9%) and fatigue (5%) were most frequent, and in 9% of active BSC-treated patients.Conclusions: Although ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg was manageable, it did not improve irPFS versus BSC. However, comparable median OS of approximately 1 year and a favorable safety profile support the investigation of ipilimumab in combination with other therapies for advanced gastric cancer.

In an open-label phase 3 trial, we compared first-line nivolumab with chemotherapy in patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nWe randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC and a PD-L1 tumor-expression level of 1% or more to receive nivolumab (administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight once every 2 weeks) or platinum-based chemotherapy (administered once every 3 weeks for up to six cycles). Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to receive nivolumab at the time of disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by means of blinded independent central review, among patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more.\n## RESULTS\nAmong the 423 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, the median progression-free survival was 4.2 months with nivolumab versus 5.9 months with chemotherapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.45; P=0.25), and the median overall survival was 14.4 months versus 13.2 months (hazard ratio for death, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.30).

This randomized, double-blind, phase III study investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line ipilimumab or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced squamous NSCLC. Patients and Methods Patients with stage IV or recurrent chemotherapy-na\u00efve squamous NSCLC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin plus blinded ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks on a phased induction schedule comprising six chemotherapy cycles, with ipilimumab or placebo from cycles 3 to 6 and then, after induction treatment, ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy. Results Of 956 randomly assigned patients, 749 received at least one dose of blinded study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 388; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 361). Median OS was 13.4 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 12.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.07; P = .25). Median progression-free survival was 5.6 months for both groups (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01). Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), any-grade serious TRAEs, and TRAEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (51%, 33%, and 28%, respectively) than with chemotherapy plus placebo (35%, 10%, and 7%, respectively). Seven treatment-related deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, and one occurred with chemotherapy plus placebo. Conclusion The addition of ipilimumab to first-line chemotherapy did not prolong OS compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. The safety profile of chemotherapy plus ipilimumab was consistent with that observed in previous lung and melanoma studies.

In the DETERMINE study, we investigated the effects of the cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody tremelimumab in patients with previously treated advanced malignant mesothelioma.\n## METHODS\nDETERMINE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial done at 105 study centres across 19 countries in patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who had progressed after one or two previous systemic treatments for advanced disease. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease as defined in the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST version 1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) in blocks of three, stratified by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer status (low risk vs high risk), line of therapy (second line vs third line), and anatomic site (pleural vs peritoneal), by use of an interactive voice or web system, to receive intravenous tremelimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 7 doses and every 12 weeks thereafter until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01843374.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween May 17, 2013, and Dec 4, 2014, 571 patients were randomly assigned to receive tremelimumab (n=382) or placebo (n=189), of whom 569 patients received treatment (two patients in the tremelimumab group were excluded from the safety population because they did not receive treatment). At the data cutoff date (Jan 24, 2016), 307 (80%) of 382 patients had died in the tremelimumab group and 154 (81%) of 189 patients had died in the placebo group. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population did not differ between the treatment groups: 7\u00b77 months (95% CI 6\u00b78-8\u00b79) in the tremelimumab group and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b79-8\u00b77) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b792 [95% CI 0\u00b776-1\u00b712], p=0\u00b741). Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 246 (65%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 91 (48%) of 189 patients in the placebo group; the most common were dyspnoea (34 [9%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs 27 [14%] patients in the placebo group), diarrhoea (58 [15%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (26 [7%] vs none). The most common serious adverse events were diarrhoea (69 [18%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs one [<1%] patient in the placebo group), dyspnoea (29 [8%] vs 24 [13%]), and colitis (24 [6%] vs none). Treatment-emergent events leading to death occurred in 36 (9%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 12 (6%) of 189 in the placebo group; those leading to the death of more than one patient were mesothelioma (three [1%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs two [1%] in the placebo group), dyspnoea (three [1%] vs two [1%]); respiratory failure (one [<1%] vs three [2%]), myocardial infarction (three [1%] vs none), lung infection (three [1%] patients vs none), cardiac failure (one [<1%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (two [<1%] vs none). Treatment-related adverse events leading to death occurred in five (1%) patients in the tremelimumab group and none in the placebo group. The causes of death were lung infection in one patient, intestinal perforation and small intestinal obstruction in one patient; colitis in two patients, and neuritis and skin ulcer in one patient.\n## INTERPRETATION\nTremelimumab did not significantly prolong overall survival compared with placebo in patients with previously treated malignant mesothelioma. The safety profile of tremelimumab was consistent with the known safety profile of CTLA-4 inhibitors. Investigations into whether immunotherapy combination regimens can provide greater efficacy than monotherapies in malignant mesothelioma are ongoing.\n## FUNDING\nAstraZeneca.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nAtezolizumab is a humanised antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1 and programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 and B7-1 interactions, reinvigorating anticancer immunity. We assessed its efficacy and safety versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.\n## METHODS\nWe did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (OAK) in 194 academic or community oncology centres in 31 countries. We enrolled patients who had squamous or non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, were 18 years or older, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had received one to two previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (one or more platinum based combination therapies) for stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease and those who had received previous treatments with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, or therapies targeting the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenously receive either atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween March 11, 2014, and April 29, 2015, 1225 patients were recruited. In the primary population, 425 patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab and 425 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer with atezolizumab in the ITT and PD-L1-expression populations. In the ITT population, overall survival was improved with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel (median overall survival was 13\u00b78 months [95% CI 11\u00b78-15\u00b77] vs 9\u00b76 months [8\u00b76-11\u00b72]; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b773 [95% CI 0\u00b762-0\u00b787], p=0\u00b70003). Overall survival in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population was improved with atezolizumab (n=241) compared with docetaxel (n=222; median overall survival was 15\u00b77 months [95% CI 12\u00b76-18\u00b70] with atezolizumab vs 10\u00b73 months [8\u00b78-12\u00b70] with docetaxel; HR 0\u00b774 [95% CI 0\u00b758-0\u00b793]; p=0\u00b70102). Patients in the PD-L1 low or undetectable subgroup (TC0 and IC0) also had improved survival with atezolizumab (median overall survival 12\u00b76 months vs 8\u00b79 months; HR 0\u00b775 [95% CI 0\u00b759-0\u00b796]). Overall survival improvement was similar in patients with squamous (HR 0\u00b773 [95% CI 0\u00b754-0\u00b798]; n=112 in the atezolizumab group and n=110 in the docetaxel group) or non-squamous (0\u00b773 [0\u00b760-0\u00b789]; n=313 and n=315) histology. Fewer patients had treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events with atezolizumab (90 [15%] of 609 patients) versus docetaxel (247 [43%] of 578 patients). One treatment-related death from a respiratory tract infection was reported in the docetaxel group.\n## INTERPRETATION\nTo our knowledge, OAK is the first randomised phase 3 study to report results of a PD-L1-targeted therapy, with atezolizumab treatment resulting in a clinically relevant improvement of overall survival versus docetaxel in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression or histology, with a favourable safety profile.\n## FUNDING\nF.

The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer, including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-infiltrating immune cells, or both. We assessed efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1 expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population.\n## METHODS\nIn this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating immune cell status, histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block size of four) using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3\u226550%, TC2\u22655% and <50%, TC1\u22651% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3\u226510%, IC2\u22655% and <10%, IC1\u22651% and <5%, and IC0<1%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at 173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993.\n## FINDINGS\nPatients were enrolled between Aug 5, 2013, and March 31, 2014. 144 patients were randomly allocated to the atezolizumab group, and 143 to the docetaxel group. 142 patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and 135 received docetaxel. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 12\u00b76 months (95% CI 9\u00b77-16\u00b74) for atezolizumab versus 9\u00b77 months (8\u00b76-12\u00b70) for docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b773 [95% CI 0\u00b753-0\u00b799]; p=0\u00b704). Increasing improvement in overall survival was associated with increasing PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3 HR 0\u00b749 [0\u00b722-1\u00b707; p=0\u00b7068], TC2/3 or IC2/3 HR 0\u00b754 [0\u00b733-0\u00b789; p=0\u00b7014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0\u00b759 [0\u00b740-0\u00b785; p=0\u00b7005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1\u00b704 [0\u00b762-1\u00b775; p=0\u00b7871]). In our exploratory analysis, patients with pre-existing immunity, defined by high T-effector-interferon-\u03b3-associated gene expression, had improved overall survival with atezolizumab. 11 (8%) patients in the atezolizumab group discontinued because of adverse events versus 30 (22%) patients in the docetaxel group. 16 (11%) patients in the atezolizumab group versus 52 (39%) patients in the docetaxel group had treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events, and one (<1%) patient in the atezolizumab group versus three (2%) patients in the docetaxel group died from a treatment-related adverse event.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab significantly improved survival compared with docetaxel in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is predictive for atezolizumab benefit. Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile distinct from chemotherapy.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech Inc.",

Nivolumab, an anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, was assessed as treatment for this condition.\n## METHODS\nIn this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial, we assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 361 patients with recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck whose disease had progressed within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or standard, single-agent systemic therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab). The primary end point was overall survival. Additional end points included progression-free survival, rate of objective response, safety, and patient-reported quality of life.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 9.1) in the nivolumab group versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) in the group that received standard therapy. Overall survival was significantly longer with nivolumab than with standard therapy (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 97.73% CI, 0.51 to 0.96; P=0.01), and the estimates of the 1-year survival rate were approximately 19 percentage points higher with nivolumab than with standard therapy (36.0% vs. 16.6%). The median progression-free survival was 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.1) with nivolumab versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.1) with standard therapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.13; P=0.32). The rate of progression-free survival at 6 months was 19.7% with nivolumab versus 9.9% with standard therapy. The response rate was 13.3% in the nivolumab group versus 5.8% in the standard-therapy group. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 13.1% of the patients in the nivolumab group versus 35.1% of those in the standard-therapy group. Physical, role, and social functioning was stable in the nivolumab group, whereas it was meaningfully worse in the standard-therapy group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with platinum-refractory, recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, treatment with nivolumab resulted in longer overall survival than treatment with standard, single-agent therapy.

We assessed the efficacy of pembrolizumab for patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.\n## METHODS\nWe did this randomised, open-label, phase 2/3 study at 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries. Patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumour cells were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six per stratum with an interactive voice-response system to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival both in the total population and in patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells. We used a threshold for significance of p<0.00825 (one-sided) for the analysis of overall survival and a threshold of p<0.001 for progression-free survival. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01905657.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we enrolled 1034 patients: 345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 346 allocated to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 allocated to docetaxel. By Sept 30, 2015, 521 patients had died. In the total population, median overall survival was 10.4 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 12.7 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 8.5 months with docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.88; p=0.0008) and for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0.61, 0.49-0.75; p<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 3.9 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 4.0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 4.0 months with docetaxel, with no significant difference for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0.88, 0.74-1.05; p=0.07) or for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94; p=0.004). Among patients with at least 50% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1, overall survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 14.9 months vs 8.2 months; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38-0.77; p=0.0002) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (17.3 months vs 8.2 months; 0.50, 0.36-0.70; p<0.0001). Likewise, for this patient population, progression-free survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 5.0 months vs 4.1 months; HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.78; p=0.0001) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (5.2 months vs 4.1 months; 0.59, 0.45-0.78; p<0.0001).

The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and has a non-overlapping toxicity profile with chemotherapy. We assessed whether the addition of pembrolizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy improves efficacy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nIn this randomised, open-label, phase 2 cohort of a multicohort study (KEYNOTE-021), patients were enrolled at 26 medical centres in the USA and Taiwan. Patients with chemotherapy-naive, stage IIIB or IV, non-squamous NSCLC without targetable EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four stratified by PD-L1 tumour proportion score (<1% vs \u22651%) using an interactive voice-response system to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg plus carboplatin area under curve 5 mg/mL per min and pemetrexed 500 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Nov 25, 2014, and Jan 25, 2016, 123 patients were enrolled; 60 were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 63 to the chemotherapy alone group. 33 (55%; 95% CI 42-68) of 60 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group achieved an objective response compared with 18 (29%; 18-41) of 63 patients in the chemotherapy alone group (estimated treatment difference 26% [95% CI 9-42%]; p=0\u00b70016). The incidence of grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events was similar between groups (23 [39%] of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 16 [26%] of 62 in the chemotherapy alone group). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were anaemia (seven [12%] of 59) and decreased neutrophil count (three [5%]); an additional six events each occurred in two (3%) for acute kidney injury, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, neutropenia, and sepsis, and thrombocytopenia.

Crossover from the chemotherapy group to the pembrolizumab group was permitted in the event of disease progression. The primary end point, progression-free survival, was assessed by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic review. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response rate, and safety.\n## RESULTS\nMedian progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P<0.001). The estimated rate of overall survival at 6 months was 80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; P=0.005). The response rate was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (44.8% vs. 27.8%), the median duration of response was longer (not reached [range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months] vs. 6.3 months [range, 2.1+ to 12.6+]), and treatment-related adverse events of any grade were less frequent (occurring in 73.4% vs. 90.0% of patients), as were grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events (26.6% vs. 53.3%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall survival and with fewer adverse events than was platinum-based chemotherapy.

This randomized, double-blind phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab or placebo plus etoposide and platinum in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one to receive chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for a total of four doses each in a phased induction schedule (chemotherapy in cycles one to four; ipilimumab or placebo beginning in cycle three up to cycle six), followed by ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks. Primary end point was overall survival (OS) among patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy. Results Of 1,132 patients randomly assigned, 954 received at least one dose of study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 478; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 476). Median OS was 11.0 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 10.9 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09; P = .3775). Median progression-free survival was 4.6 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 4.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97). Rates and severity of treatment-related adverse events were similar between arms, except for diarrhea, rash, and colitis, which were more frequent with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Rate of treatment-related discontinuation was higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (18% v 2% with chemotherapy plus placebo). Five treatment-related deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and two with chemotherapy plus placebo. Conclusion Addition of ipilimumab to chemotherapy did not prolong OS versus chemotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. No new or unexpected adverse events were observed with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Several ongoing studies are evaluating ipilimumab in combination with programmed death-1 inhibitors in SCLC.",

We aimed to assess ipilimumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected stage III melanoma at high risk of recurrence.\n## METHODS\nWe did a double-blind, phase 3 trial in patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma (excluding lymph node metastasis \u22641 mm or in-transit metastasis) with adequate resection of lymph nodes (ie, the primary cutaneous melanoma must have been completely excised with adequate surgical margins) who had not received previous systemic therapy for melanoma from 91 hospitals located in 19 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally by an interactive voice response system, to receive intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab or placebo every 3 weeks for four doses, then every 3 months for up to 3 years. Using a minimisation technique, randomisation was stratified by disease stage and geographical region. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival, assessed by an independent review committee, and analysed by intention to treat. Enrollment is complete but the study is ongoing for follow-up for analysis of secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2007-001974-10, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00636168.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween July 10, 2008, and Aug 1, 2011, 951 patients were randomly assigned to ipilimumab (n=475) or placebo (n=476), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. At a median follow-up of 2\u00b774 years (IQR 2\u00b728-3\u00b722), there were 528 recurrence-free survival events (234 in the ipilimumab group vs 294 in the placebo group). Median recurrence-free survival was 26\u00b71 months (95% CI 19\u00b73-39\u00b73) in the ipilimumab group versus 17\u00b71 months (95% CI 13\u00b74-21\u00b76) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b775; 95% CI 0\u00b764-0\u00b790; p=0\u00b70013); 3-year recurrence-free survival was 46\u00b75% (95% CI 41\u00b75-51\u00b73) in the ipilimumab group versus 34\u00b78% (30\u00b71-39\u00b75) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group were gastrointestinal (75 [16%] vs four [<1%] in the placebo group), hepatic (50 [11%] vs one [<1%]), and endocrine (40 [8%] vs none). Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 245 (52%) of 471 patients who started ipilimumab (182 [39%] during the initial treatment period of four doses). Five patients (1%) died due to drug-related adverse events. Five (1%) participants died because of drug-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group; three patients died because of colitis (two with gastrointestinal perforation), one patient because of myocarditis, and one patient because of multiorgan failure with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAdjuvant ipilimumab significantly improved recurrence-free survival for patients with completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma. The adverse event profile was consistent with that observed in advanced melanoma, but at higher incidences in particular for endocrinopathies. The risk-benefit ratio of adjuvant ipilimumab at this dose and schedule requires additional assessment based on distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival endpoints to define its definitive value.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb.",

Our aim was to assess the use of ipilimumab after radiotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy.\n## METHODS\nWe did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial in which men with at least one bone metastasis from castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive bone-directed radiotherapy (8 Gy in one fraction) followed by either ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to four doses. Non-progressing patients could continue to receive ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg or placebo as maintenance therapy every 3 months until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effect, or death. Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment group via a minimisation algorithm, and stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, alkaline phosphatase concentration, haemoglobin concentration, and investigator site. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00861614.\n## FINDINGS\nFrom May 26, 2009, to Feb 15, 2012, 799 patients were randomly assigned (399 to ipilimumab and 400 to placebo), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Median overall survival was 11\u00b72 months (95% CI 9\u00b75-12\u00b77) with ipilimumab and 10\u00b70 months (8\u00b73-11\u00b70) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b785, 0\u00b772-1\u00b700; p=0\u00b7053). However, the assessment of the proportional hazards assumption showed that it was violated (p=0\u00b70031). A piecewise hazard model showed that the HR changed over time: the HR for 0-5 months was 1\u00b746 (95% CI 1\u00b710-1\u00b795), for 5-12 months was 0\u00b765 (0\u00b750-0\u00b785), and beyond 12 months was 0\u00b760 (0\u00b743-0\u00b786). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were immune-related, occurring in 101 (26%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 11 (3%) of patients in the placebo group. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events included diarrhoea (64 [16%] of 393 patients in the ipilimumab group vs seven [2%] of 396 in the placebo group), fatigue (40 [11%] vs 35 [9%]), anaemia (40 [10%] vs 43 [11%]), and colitis (18 [5%] vs 0). Four (1%) deaths occurred because of toxic effects of the study drug, all in the ipilimumab group.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAlthough there was no significant difference between the ipilimumab group and the placebo group in terms of overall survival in the primary analysis, there were signs of activity with the drug that warrant further investigation.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb.",

We conducted a phase 3 study of ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma.\n## METHODS\nWe randomly assigned 502 patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma, in a 1:1 ratio, to ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter) plus placebo, given at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, followed by dacarbazine alone every 3 weeks through week 22. Patients with stable disease or an objective response and no dose-limiting toxic effects received ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks thereafter as maintenance therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.\n## RESULTS\nOverall survival was significantly longer in the group receiving ipilimumab plus dacarbazine than in the group receiving dacarbazine plus placebo (11.2 months vs. 9.1 months, with higher survival rates in the ipilimumab-dacarbazine group at 1 year (47.3% vs. 36.3%), 2 years (28.5% vs. 17.9%), and 3 years (20.8% vs. 12.2%) (hazard ratio for death, 0.72; P<0.001).

In this phase 3 study, ipilimumab--which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 to potentiate an antitumor T-cell response--administered with or without a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine was compared with gp100 alone in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma.\n## METHODS\nA total of 676 HLA-A*0201-positive patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed while they were receiving therapy for metastatic disease, were randomly assigned, in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive ipilimumab plus gp100 (403 patients), ipilimumab alone (137), or gp100 alone (136). Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, was administered with or without gp100 every 3 weeks for up to four treatments (induction). Eligible patients could receive reinduction therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 10.0 months among patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as compared with 6.4 months among patients receiving gp100 alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.68; P<0.001). The median overall survival with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio for death in the comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003). No difference in overall survival was detected between the ipilimumab groups (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100, 1.04; P=0.76). Grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 to 15% of patients treated with ipilimumab and in 3% treated with gp100 alone. There were 14 deaths related to the study drugs (2.1%), and 7 were associated with immune-related adverse events.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIpilimumab, with or without a gp100 peptide vaccine, as compared with gp100 alone, improved overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma.

They have been implemented in several African and Asian countries but have never been evaluated rigorously. We aimed to evaluate the effect of two versions of the community health club model on child health and nutrition outcomes.\n## METHODS\nWe did a cluster-randomised trial in Rusizi district, western Rwanda. We defined villages as clusters. We assessed villages for eligibility then randomly selected 150 for the study using a simple random sampling routine in Stata. We stratified villages by wealth index and by the proportion of children younger than 2 years with caregiver-reported diarrhoea within the past 7 days. We randomly allocated these villages to three study groups: no intervention (control; n=50), eight community health club sessions (Lite intervention; n=50), or 20 community health club sessions (Classic intervention; n=50). Households in these villages were enrolled in 2013 for a baseline survey, then re-enrolled in 2015 for an endline survey. The primary outcome was caregiver-reported diarrhoea within the previous 7 days in children younger than 5 years. Analysis was by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01836731.\n## FINDINGS\nAt the baseline survey undertaken between May, 2013, and August, 2013, 8734 households with children younger than 5 years of age were enrolled. At the endline survey undertaken between Sept 21, 2015, and Dec 22, 2015, 7934 (91%) of the households were re-enrolled. Among children younger than 5 years, the prevalence of caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the previous 7 days was 514 (14%) of 3616 assigned the control, 453 (14%) of 3196 allocated the Lite intervention (prevalence ratio compared with control 0\u00b797, 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b716; p=0\u00b774), and 495 (14%) of 3464 assigned the Classic intervention (prevalence ratio compared with control 0\u00b799, 0\u00b785-1\u00b715; p=0\u00b787).\n## INTERPRETATION\nCommunity health clubs, in this setting in western Rwanda, had no effect on caregiver-reported diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years.

A total of 185 (98%) households with children ages 0-18 months in five contiguous villages were targeted for the interventions. A comparison site was selected for a detailed observational study and for use as a control for the intervention. About 97% of all households with children ages 0-18 months were enrolled for study at the control site. Children in this age group were targeted because at this developmental stage they were most vulnerable to diarrhoeal morbidity and malnutrition (related to unhygienic practices). The intervention was implemented with the assistance of village leaders through a \"Clean Life\" campaign by local project workers and volunteer mothers who were chosen from the target households. The intervention activities started in January 1986 and lasted for 7 months. Higher adoption rates of the intervention were associated with better cleanliness status, which was related to lower diarrhoea and malnutrition rates in the intervention site. The results of between-site longitudinal analyses showed that after the intervention, the intervention site had substantially higher cleanliness scores, lower diarrhoeal morbidity, and better growth status compared to those of the control site, with differences increasing over time. The findings suggest that this type of community-based intervention can be very beneficial in modifying hygiene behaviours and lowering childhood diarrhoea and malnutrition.",

Two intervention groups of DCCs families performed educational and hand hygiene measures, 1 with soap and water (soap and water group; n\u202f=\u202f274), another with hand sanitizer (hand sanitizer group [HSG]; n\u202f=\u202f339), and the control group (CG; n\u202f=\u202f298) followed usual handwashing procedures. We compared AGE episode rates with Poisson regression model.\n## RESULTS\nseven hundred fourteen AGE episodes were registered, significant differences between HSG and CG children were found during December and January. A multivariate model was applied and the adjusted incidence rate ratios by rotavirus vaccination found significant differences when children were previously vaccinated, the children in the soap and water group had a higher risk of AGE episodes (incidence rate ratio: 1.28, 95% confidence interval:1.0-1.64), compared with those in the HSG.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrated that hand hygiene programs that included hand sanitizer were most effective in the winter months.

From 21 study day care centers, they randomly selected 10 (\"intervention day care centers\") to receive staff training in procedures to reduce transmission of infectious diarrhea. Continuing active surveillance in the 10 intervention and 11 control day care centers found no difference between diarrhea rates in intervention day care centers in the pre- and posttraining years and no difference between diarrhea rates in the two groups of centers either before or after the training intervention. Biweekly family-based surveys during the two months after training also demonstrated no difference between infant-toddler diarrhea rates in intervention and control day care centers. These surveys found the 21 study day care centers to have significantly higher diarrhea rates than did day care homes or households not using day care, but significantly lower rates than day care centers not included in the active surveillance. Continuous surveillance without training was associated with a significant decrease in diarrheal illness during the course of longitudinal study.

Few diarrhoea prevention programmes have been implemented in Bandundu Province, where available data suggest an annual prevalence rate of 10%. The urgent need to reduce diarrhoeal morbidity in Zaire, together with the potential effectiveness and feasibility of hygiene education as a diarrhoea prevention strategy, led to the development of the present research project.\n## METHODS\nA randomized, controlled trial of an education intervention to reduce diarrhoea through improved personal and domestic hygiene behaviours was conducted in 18 geographically separate village clusters (sites) in rural Zaire. For 12 weeks baseline information on the diarrhoeal morbidity of 2082 children aged 3-35 months was collected at weekly home visits, and structured observations of hygiene practices related to diarrhoea were made on a subset of 300 families. Intervention messages addressed disposal of animal faeces from the yard, handwashing after defecation and before meal preparation and eating, and disposal of children's faeces. Three months after the start of the intervention and exactly 1 year after the baseline studies, a second diarrhoeal morbidity study and a second observational study were conducted in order to evaluate the intervention.\n## RESULTS\nChildren in intervention communities experienced an 11% reduction in the risk of reporting diarrhoea during the peak diarrhoeal season, compared to controls (P < 0.025). The largest differences were seen among children aged 24-35 months, with those from intervention communities reporting significantly fewer episodes, shorter mean durations and hence fewer days of diarrhoea. There was some evidence that greater reductions in diarrhoea occurred in sites where the quality of the intervention, a scored measure of volunteer efficacy and community participation, was highest.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this study suggest that hygiene education may be an effective approach to reduce the incidence and duration of diarrhoeal episodes in rural Zaire. Children aged 2 years appear to benefit the most. A Hawthorne effect of the education may contribute to diarrhoeal reductions.",

One member of each pair was randomly assigned to an intervention group and the other to a control group. Intervention centers received new diaper-changing, hand-washing, and food-preparation equipment, and both intervention and control centers received hygiene and sanitation training with reinforcement and follow-up as needed. Families with children in participating classrooms were called biweekly to ascertain the frequency and severity of any diarrheal illness episodes. Staff attendance was monitored, and staff hygiene and sanitation behaviors were observed and recorded monthly.\n## RESULTS\nAlthough hygiene and sanitation behaviors improved in both intervention and control centers, there was a significant difference favoring the intervention centers with respect to frequency of diarrheal illness (0.90 vs 1.58 illnesses per 100 child-days in control centers) and proportion of days ill as a result of diarrhea (4.0% vs 5.0% in control centers) among the children.

This is the first study to evaluate the impact of hand-washing on markers of subclinical, asymptomatic infections associated with childhood growth faltering.\n## METHODS\nWe recruited a total sample of infants in the target age-range (3-12 months) living in the eight largest Kathmandu slums, allocating them to intervention (n = 45) and control (n = 43) groups. In intervention areas, a small-scale community-based hand-washing program was implemented for six months; in control areas, mothers continued their normal practices. Time series linear regression was used to assess the impact of the intervention on levels of morbidity, mucosal damage, immune stimulation and growth.\n## RESULTS\nAs expected, children with higher levels of mucosal damage exhibited worse growth over the period of the intervention (P = 0.01, <0.001 and 0.03 for height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height z-scores, respectively). We observed a 41% reduction in diarrheal morbidity (P = 0.023) for the intervention group relative to control. However, the hand-washing intervention did not lower levels of mucosal damage or immune stimulation, nor slow growth faltering.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nReducing exposure to pathogens is an important global health priority. This study confirms the importance of hand-washing campaigns for reducing childhood morbidity. Yet our data suggest that promoting hand-washing is necessary but not sufficient to address chronic, subclinical infections. From a human biology standpoint, tackling the root causes of childhood infections is needed to address growth faltering in the context of highly contaminated slum environments.",

Field workers visited participating households at least weekly from April 15, 2002, to April 5, 2003. Eligible households located in the study area had at least 2 children younger than 15 years, at least 1 of whom was younger than 5 years.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nWeekly visits in 25 neighborhoods to promote handwashing with soap after defecation and before preparing food, eating, and feeding a child. Within intervention neighborhoods, 300 households (1523 children) received a regular supply of antibacterial soap and 300 households (1640 children) received plain soap.

We aimed to assess whether water quality, sanitation, and handwashing interventions alone or combined with nutrition interventions reduced diarrhoea or growth faltering.\n## METHODS\nThe WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster-randomised trial enrolled pregnant women from villages in rural Bangladesh and evaluated outcomes at 1-year and 2-years' follow-up. Pregnant women in geographically adjacent clusters were block-randomised to one of seven clusters: chlorinated drinking water (water); upgraded sanitation (sanitation); promotion of handwashing with soap (handwashing); combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; counselling on appropriate child nutrition plus lipid-based nutrient supplements (nutrition); combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition; and control (data collection only). Primary outcomes were caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the past 7 days among children who were in utero or younger than 3 years at enrolment and length-for-age Z score among children born to enrolled pregnant women. Masking was not possible for data collection, but analyses were masked. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCC01590095.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween May 31, 2012, and July 7, 2013, 5551 pregnant women in 720 clusters were randomly allocated to one of seven groups. 1382 women were assigned to the control group; 698 to water; 696 to sanitation; 688 to handwashing; 702 to water, sanitation, and handwashing; 699 to nutrition; and 686 to water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. 331 (6%) women were lost to follow-up. Data on diarrhoea at year 1 or year 2 (combined) were available for 14\u2008425 children (7331 in year 1, 7094 in year 2) and data on length-for-age Z score in year 2 were available for 4584 children (92% of living children were measured at year 2). All interventions had high adherence. Compared with a prevalence of 5\u00b77% (200 of 3517 child weeks) in the control group, 7-day diarrhoea prevalence was lower among index children and children under 3 years at enrolment who received sanitation (61 [3\u00b75%] of 1760; prevalence ratio 0\u00b761, 95% CI 0\u00b746-0\u00b781), handwashing (62 [3\u00b75%] of 1795; 0\u00b760, 0\u00b745-0\u00b780), combined water, sanitation, and handwashing (74 [3\u00b79%] of 1902; 0\u00b769, 0\u00b753-0\u00b790), nutrition (62 [3\u00b75%] of 1766; 0\u00b764, 0\u00b749-0\u00b785), and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition (66 [3\u00b75%] of 1861; 0\u00b762, 0\u00b747-0\u00b781); diarrhoea prevalence was not significantly lower in children receiving water treatment (90 [4\u00b79%] of 1824; 0\u00b789, 0\u00b770-1\u00b713). Compared with control (mean length-for-age Z score -1\u00b779), children were taller by year 2 in the nutrition group (mean difference 0\u00b725 [95% CI 0\u00b715-0\u00b736]) and in the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group (0\u00b713 [0\u00b702-0\u00b724]). The individual water, sanitation, and handwashing groups, and combined water, sanitation, and handwashing group had no effect on linear growth.\n## INTERPRETATION\nNutrient supplementation and counselling modestly improved linear growth, but there was no benefit to the integration of water, sanitation, and handwashing with nutrition. Adherence was high in all groups and diarrhoea prevalence was reduced in all intervention groups except water treatment. Combined water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions provided no additive benefit over single interventions.\n## FUNDING\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

In the intervention arm, CHVs were deployed in their own community with the key task of conducting home visits for health education and community mobilization. The primary outcomes of the trial were diarrhea and fever prevalence at 6 and 12 months among under-5 children based on caregivers' recall. Secondary outcomes included oral rehydration treatment and rapid diagnostic testing for malaria among under-5 children, and family planning practices of caregivers. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a log link and exchangeable correlation matrix were used to determine the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diarrhea, fever, and secondary outcomes adjusted for clustering and stratification. Between April 18 and May 4, 2015, 1,956 children were recruited and followed up until September 20, 2016. At 6 and 12 months post-randomization, 1,660 (85%) and 1,609 (82%) participants, respectively, had outcomes assessed. CHVs' home visits had no statistically significant effect on diarrhea or fever prevalence at either time point. After a follow-up of 12 months, the prevalence of diarrhea and fever was 7.0% (55/784) and 18.4% (144/784), respectively, in the control communities and 4.5% (37/825) and 14.7% (121/825), respectively, in the intervention communities (12-month RR adjusted for clustering and stratification: diarrhea, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37-1.45, p = 0.37; fever, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.14, p = 0.20). However, the following were observed: improved hand hygiene practices, increased utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets, and greater participation in community outreach programs (p-values < 0.05) in the intervention group. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, the prevalence of diarrhea and fever at 6 months was 3.2% (2/62) and 17.7% (11/62), respectively, in the intervention communities with \u226570% coverage and a \u226530-minute visit duration, and 14.4% (116/806) and 30.2% (243/806) in the control communities (RR adjusted for clustering, stratification, baseline prevalence, and covariates: diarrhea, RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.60, p = 0.003; fever, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.92, p = 0.01). The main limitations were the following: We were unable to investigate the longer-term effects of CHVs; the trial may have been underpowered to detect small to moderate effects due to the large decline in diarrheal and fever prevalence in both the intervention and control group; and caregivers' practices were based on self-report, and the possibility of caregivers providing socially desirable responses cannot be excluded.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe found no effect of CHVs' home visits on the prevalence of child diarrhea or fever. However, CHV programs with high community coverage and regular household contacts of effective duration may reduce childhood infectious disease prevalence.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nInternational Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry, ISRCTN49236178.",

Community-based interventions may reduce complementary-food contamination and disease rates.\n## METHODS AND FINDINGS\nA public health intervention using critical control points and motivational drivers, delivered February-April 2015 in The Gambia, was evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial at 6- and 32-month follow-up in September-October 2015 and October-December 2017, respectively. After consent for trial participation and baseline data were collected, 30 villages (clusters) were randomly assigned to intervention or control, stratified by population size and geography. The intervention included a community-wide campaign on days 1, 2, 17, and 25, a reminder visit at 5 months, plus informal community-volunteer home visits. It promoted 5 key complementary-food and 1 key drinking-water safety and hygiene behaviours through performing arts, public meetings, and certifications delivered by a team from local health and village structures to all villagers who attended the activities, to which mothers of 6- to 24-month-old children were specifically invited. Control villages received a 1-day campaign on domestic-garden water use. The background characteristics of mother and clusters (villages) were balanced between the trial arms. Outcomes were measured at 6 and 32 months in a random sample of 21-26 mothers per cluster. There were no intervention or research team visits to villages between 6 and 32 months. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of the number of times key complementary-food behaviours were observed as a proportion of the number of opportunities to perform the behaviours during the observation period at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the rate of each recommended behaviour; microbiological growth from complementary food and drinking water (6 months only); and reported acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and diarrhoea hospitalisation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat analysis adjusted by clustering. (Registration: PACTR201410000859336). We found that 394/571 (69%) of mothers with complementary-feeding children in the intervention villages were actively involved in the campaign. No villages withdrew, and there were no changes in the implementation of the intervention. The intervention improved behaviour adoption significantly. For the primary outcome, the rate was 662/4,351(incidence rate [IR] = 0.15) in control villages versus 2,861/4,378 (IR = 0.65) in intervention villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 4.44, 95% CI 3.62-5.44, p < 0.001), and at 32 months the aIRR was 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.29, p = 0.001). Secondary health outcomes also improved with the intervention: (1) mother-reported diarrhoea at 6 months, with adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 0.39 (95% CI 0.32-0.48, p < 0.001), and at 32 months, with aRR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.48-0.96, p = 0.027); (2) mother-reported diarrhoea hospitalisation at 6 months, with aRR = 0.35 (95% CI 0.19-0.66, p = 0.001), and at 32 months, with aRR = 0.38 (95% CI 0.18-0.80, p = 0.011); and (3) mother-reported acute respiratory tract infections at 6 months, with aRR = 0.67 (95% CI 0.53-0.86, p = 0.001), though at 32 months improvement was not significant (p = 0.200). No adverse events were reported. The main limitations were that only medium to small rural villages were involved. Obtaining laboratory cultures from food at 32 months was not possible, and no stool microorganisms were investigated.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe found that low-cost and culturally embedded behaviour change interventions were acceptable to communities and led to short- and long-term improvements in complementary-food safety and hygiene practices, and reported diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nThe trial was registered on the 17th October 2014 with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry in South Africa with number (PACTR201410000859336) and 32-month follow-up as an amendment to the trial.",

We aimed to assess whether water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition interventions reduced diarrhoea or growth faltering.\n## METHODS\nThe WASH Benefits cluster-randomised trial enrolled pregnant women from villages in rural Kenya and evaluated outcomes at 1 year and 2 years of follow-up. Geographically-adjacent clusters were block-randomised to active control (household visits to measure mid-upper-arm circumference), passive control (data collection only), or compound-level interventions including household visits to promote target behaviours: drinking chlorinated water (water); safe sanitation consisting of disposing faeces in an improved latrine (sanitation); handwashing with soap (handwashing); combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; counselling on appropriate maternal, infant, and young child feeding plus small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements from 6-24 months (nutrition); and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. Primary outcomes were caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the past 7 days and length-for-age Z score at year 2 in index children born to the enrolled pregnant women. Masking was not possible for data collection, but analyses were masked. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704105.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Nov 27, 2012, and May 21, 2014, 8246 women in 702 clusters were enrolled and randomly assigned an intervention or control group. 1919 women were assigned to the active control group; 938 to passive control; 904 to water; 892 to sanitation; 917 to handwashing; 912 to combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; 843 to nutrition; and 921 to combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. Data on diarrhoea at year 1 or year 2 were available for 6494 children and data on length-for-age Z score in year 2 were available for 6583 children (86% of living children were measured at year 2). Adherence indicators for sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition were more than 70% at year 1, handwashing fell to less than 25% at year 2, and for water was less than 45% at year 1 and less than 25% at year 2; combined groups were comparable to single groups. None of the interventions reduced diarrhoea prevalence compared with the active control. Compared with active control (length-for-age Z score -1\u00b754) children in nutrition and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition were taller by year 2 (mean difference 0\u00b713 [95% CI 0\u00b701-0\u00b725] in the nutrition group; 0\u00b716 [0\u00b705-0\u00b727] in the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group). The individual water, sanitation, and handwashing groups, and combined water, sanitation, and handwashing group had no effect on linear growth.\n## INTERPRETATION\nBehaviour change messaging combined with technologically simple interventions such as water treatment, household sanitation upgrades from unimproved to improved latrines, and handwashing stations did not reduce childhood diarrhoea or improve growth, even when adherence was at least as high as has been achieved by other programmes. Counselling and supplementation in the nutrition group and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition interventions led to small growth benefits, but there was no advantage to integrating water, sanitation, and handwashing with nutrition. The interventions might have been more efficacious with higher adherence or in an environment with lower baseline sanitation coverage, especially in this context of high diarrhoea prevalence.\n## FUNDING\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, United States Agency for International Development.",

A fifth group served as a control (n=2,377). Interventions were randomized across 32 villages in Wardak province. Outcomes were measured through two household surveys separated by one year and twice-weekly household surveillance conducted over 16 months. The households receiving all three interventions showed reduction in diarrhoea compared with the control group, through both longitudinal surveillance data (IRR [95% CI]=0.61 [0.47-0.81]) and cross-sectional survey data (AOR [95% CI]=0.53 [0.30-0.93]). This reduction was significant when all household members were included, but did not reach significance when only children under five were considered. These results suggest multi-barrier methods are necessary where there are many opportunities for water contamination. Surveillance data suggested a greater impact of interventions on reducing diarrhoeal diseases than data from the surveys. Higher economic status as measured through household assets was associated with lower rates of diarrhoea and greater intervention uptake, excepting Clorin.

Behaviours were preselected from a previous study and the intervention was designed to promote hand washing, especially before feeding a baby, cooking, eating, and after defaecation or cleaning a baby's bottom, and dish washing immediately after eating. A bacteriological indicator (enumerating faecal streptococci using a finger impression technique) was developed to measure changes in hand washing behaviour and observation (spot checks) of dirty dishes to indicate dish washing practice. There was a significant improvement in both behaviours and a significant reduction in diarrhoeal disease as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, both indicators were retrospectively found to be positively related to diarrhoeal disease incidence. However, receiving and being able to recall the intervention messages was not necessarily sufficient to ensure behaviour change, as some adults found it difficult to change old habits. Villages showing the greatest improvement tended to have a stronger sense of community than others and to have more people actively involved in the intervention.",

We set out to discover whether transmission of gastrointestinal infections in child care could be reduced by improved infection control procedures.\n## METHODS\nWe performed a cluster randomized, controlled trial of an infection control intervention conducted in child care centers for 1 city in Australia. The intervention was training of child care staff about transmission of infection and handwashing and focused on both staff and child behavior. Implementation of the intervention was recorded by an observer. Illness was measured by parent report in telephone interviews every 2 weeks.\n## RESULTS\nThere were 311 child-years of surveillance for diarrheal episodes. The rate of episodes of diarrhea was 1.9 per child-year in intervention centers and 2.7 per child-year in control centers. Multivariable analysis showed that diarrheal episodes were significantly reduced in intervention center children by 50%. However, the impact of the intervention was confined to children over 24 months of age. For those centers in which children's compliance with handwashing was high, diarrheal episodes were reduced by 66%.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis trial supports education about infection control, for staff and children in child care, as a means of reducing transmission of diarrhea. Reduction in episodes of diarrhea in children in child care was limited to children over 24 months of age.",

Fifty-one communities, each comprising 38 families, were randomized either to receive (n = 25) or not to receive (n = 26) the intervention.

At the same time, evidence on the effectiveness of at-scale behavior change interventions to improve sanitation and hygiene practices is limited. This paper presents the results of two large-scale, government-led handwashing and sanitation promotion campaigns in rural Tanzania. For the campaign, 181 wards were randomly assigned to receive sanitation promotion, handwashing promotion, both interventions together, or neither. One year after the end of the program, sanitation wards increased latrine construction rates from 38.6 to 51 percent and reduced regular open defecation from 23.1 to 11.1 percent. Households in handwashing wards show marginal improvements in handwashing behavior related to food preparation, but not at other critical junctures. Limited interaction is observed between handwashing and sanitation on intermediate outcomes: wards that received both handwashing and sanitation promotion are less likely to have feces visible around their latrine and more likely to have a handwashing station close to their latrine facility relative to individual treatment groups. Final health effects on child health measured through diarrhea, anemia, stunting, and wasting are absent in the single-intervention groups. The combined-treatment group produces statistically detectable, but biologically insignificant and inconsistent, health impacts. The results highlight the importance of focusing on intermediate outcomes of take-up and behavior change as a critical first step in large-scale programs before realizing the changes in health that sanitation and hygiene interventions aim to deliver.",

Yet rates of handwashing remain very low throughout the world. Handwashing with soap campaigns are de rigueur in developing countries, but little is known about their effectiveness. Few have been rigorously evaluated, and none on a large-scale. This paper evaluates a large-scale handwashing campaign in three provinces of Vietnam in 2010. Exposure to the campaign resulted in a slight increase in the availability of handwashing materials in the household, and caregivers in the treatment group were more likely to report washing hands at some of the times emphasized by the campaign. However, observed handwashing with soap at these times is low, and there isn\u2019t any difference between the treatment and control groups. As a result, no impact on health or productivity is found. These results suggest that even under seemingly optimal conditions, where knowledge and access to soap and water are not main constraints, behavior change campaigns that take place on a large scale face tradeoffs in terms of intensity and effectiveness.",

The sample included mothers who delivered a live birth in Colorado, New York State, and North Carolina from 1996 (New York only) to 1999. We assessed risk factors for self-reports of being very depressed in the months after delivery using logistic regression.\n## RESULTS\nOverall, 5.9% (95% CI = 5.3, 6.4) of new mothers reported being very depressed in the months after delivery. Women who reported that their pregnancy was a \"very hard time\" or \"one of the worst times of my life\" had the highest prevalence of reporting being very depressed in the months after delivery (24.9%, 95% CI = 21.3, 28.5) and, when all risk factors were adjusted for simultaneously, were 4.6 times (95% CI = 3.1, 6.3) more likely to report being very depressed in the months after delivery than other women. Other significant risk factors for self-reports of being very depressed in the months after delivery included experiencing partner-associated stress (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5, 2.5), physical abuse during pregnancy (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1, 2.4), and not breast-feeding (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1, 1.8).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe highest prevalence for self-reports of being very depressed in the months after delivery was in women who reported that their pregnancy was a \"very hard time\" or \"one of the worst times of my life.\" Clinicians need to be aware of the needs of some women for mental health services both during and after pregnancy.",

This study investigated whether race/ethnicity, age, finances, and partnership status were associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms.\n## SETTING\n1662 participants in Project Viva, a US cohort study.\n## DESIGN\nMothers indicated mid-pregnancy and six month postpartum depressive symptoms on the Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS). Associations of sociodemographic factors with odds of scoring >12 on the EPDS were estimated.\n## MAIN RESULTS\nThe prevalence of depressive symptoms was 9% at mid-pregnancy and 8% postpartum. Black and Hispanic mothers had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms compared with non-Hispanic white mothers. These associations were explained by lower income, financial hardship, and higher incidence of poor pregnancy outcome among minority women. Young maternal age was associated with greater risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms, largely attributable to the prevalence of financial hardship, unwanted pregnancy, and lack of a partner. The strongest risk factor for antenatal depressive symptoms was a history of depression (OR = 4.07; 95% CI 3.76, 4.40), and the strongest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms was depressive symptoms during pregnancy (6.78; 4.07, 11.31) or a history of depression before pregnancy (3.82; 2.31, 6.31).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFinancial hardship and unwanted pregnancy are associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms. Women with a history of depression and those with poor pregnancy outcomes are especially vulnerable to depressive symptoms during the childbearing year.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed associations between pregnancy intentions or level of happiness about being pregnant and multiple psychosocial and behavioral risk factors, and identified correlates of happiness to be pregnant.\n## RESULTS\nPregnancy intentions and happiness were strongly associated, but happiness was the better predictor of risk. Unhappy women had higher odds than happy women of smoking, being depressed, experiencing intimate partner violence, drinking and using illicit drugs (odds ratios, 1.7-2.6). The odds of being happy were reduced among women who had other children or a child younger than two, who were single or did not have a current partner, who had had more than one sexual partner in the past year and who reported that the baby's father did not want the pregnancy (0.3-0.6).

Data collection was carried out by means of a self-reported questionnaire. The outcome variable was depression during the third trimester of pregnancy measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.

The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated by fitting a logistic regression model.\n## RESULTS\nThe prevalence of pregnancy depression was higher among women (10.3%) than men (6.5%). In both sexes, the probability of depression during pregnancy was higher in those with marital dissatisfaction (aOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.59 to 5.82 for women and 3.14, 95% CI 1.24 to 7.99 for men) and among those whose with a previous history of depression (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.89 for women and 5.22, 95% CI 2.05 to 13.34 for men).

Psychosocial correlates were obtained through prenatal surveys; electronic medical records were used to ascertain maternal health and pregnancy outcomes.\n## RESULTS\nSixty-two percent of the women indicated an unintended pregnancy, with 44% (578) mistimed and 18% (245) unwanted. Only 38% of the pregnancies were characterized as wanted. Women with unwanted and with mistimed pregnancies were similar demographically, but they differed significantly on psychosocial profiles and maternal characteristics. Women with mistimed and with wanted pregnancies differed in demographics and psychosocial profiles. Wanted pregnancies had the healthiest, mistimed an intermediate, and unwanted the poorest psychosocial profile. Women with unwanted pregnancies had the highest depression, perceived stress, and negative paternal support scores (p<0.05) and the lowest self-efficacy, social support, and positive paternal support scores (p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, women with riskier psychosocial profiles had higher odds of being in the unwanted category. Controlling for psychosocial and demographic variables, perceived stress and positive paternal support remained significant predictors of belonging to the unwanted and mistimed groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFully characterizing pregnancy intention and its relationship to psychosocial profiles may provide a basis for identifying women with highest risk during pregnancy and early motherhood.

The LQ scores indicated a probable depressive illness (PDI) in 17.2% of the study group. The best predictors in a multiple regression analysis were history of major depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=3.23), and major life events (AOR=2.43). A perceived lack of social support from partner (AOR=1.79) and lack of support by family (AOR=1.23) were also significant determinants. Lack of planning of pregnancy (AOR=1.12) and a history of unfavourable obstetric outcome (AOR=1.42) also seem to predispose to PDI.

Adopting a staged approach to the analysis, the study investigates whether pregnancy intention influences maternal health behaviours during pregnancy independent of background characteristics, and whether pregnancy intention carries any additional risk for adverse infant and maternal health outcomes when we adjust for background characteristics and prenatal behaviours.\n## RESULTS\nThe study confirmed that sociodemographic factors are strongly associated with unintended pregnancy and that unintended pregnancy is associated with a range of health compromising behaviours that are known to be harmful to the developing fetus. While there was little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention was associated with adverse neonatal outcomes or developmental delay independent of other covariates, there was strong evidence that intention status had a bearing on the mother's psychosocial health. Unintended pregnancy was associated with increased risk of depression (risk ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 1.19, 1.54]), and higher parenting stress (risk ratio 1.27 [95% confidence interval 1.16, 1.38]).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAscertaining the mother's pregnancy intention during the first antenatal visit may represent a means for monitoring those at greatest risk for adverse mother and child outcomes.",

A subset of birth records from the New York Statewide Perinatal Data System (n = 19,219) was used in this secondary analysis of cross-sectional data. Univariate and multivariate multinomial regression was used to identify factors that are independently associated with four self-reported levels of prenatal depression symptoms. Women with unintended pregnancies were more likely (AOR, 95 % CI) to report severe (3.6, 2.6-5.1) or moderate (2.0, 1.6-2.5) prenatal depression symptoms and less likely to report no symptoms, compared to women with intended pregnancies.

Unintended pregnancies, reaching close to 50% of the pregnancies in the United States, have become a major health concern. While many physiologic and psychosocial causes have been analyzed, few studies have examined the relationship between unintended pregnancy and symptoms of PPD.A cross-sectional study was conducted using surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 2009 to 2011. The PRAMS population-based random sample included women who have had recent live births and is representative of 78% of the United States population. The chi-squared test was used to examine bivariate associations. Binary logistic regression was utilized to study unadjusted and adjusted associations between PPD and pregnancy intendedness, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers in the sample. Multicollinearity in the adjusted model was evaluated using variance inflation factors. Sampling weights were used to account for PRAMS' complex sampling design.Of the 110,231 mothers included in the sample, only 32.3% reported desiring the pregnancy at the time of conception. Women with pregnancies categorized as mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, or unwanted were 20% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u200a=\u200a1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.3), 30% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4), and 50% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.7) more likely to experience symptoms of PPD, respectively, compared to women with desired pregnancies. Other factors found to be associated with experiencing symptoms of PPD were a gestational age of <27 weeks (AOR\u200a=\u200a3.1; 95% CI: 2.5-4.0), having a previous history of depression (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.8; 95% CI: 1.6-2.0), and being abused during or before pregnancy (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-2.0).We found that women with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies were more likely to experience symptoms of PPD.

The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between unintended pregnancies and maternal mental health and timing of prenatal care among low-income women.\n## METHODS\nIn this cross-sectional study, 870 women, whom were participating in the First 1000\u2009Days program in three community health centers in the Boston area, were enrolled at their first prenatal visit from August 2016 - September 2017. We assessed pregnancy intention by self-report using the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. We used self-reported survey information and electronic health record data to assess the following outcomes: current stress, current depression, and timing of initial prenatal visit. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations and adjusted for sociodemographic factors.\n## RESULTS\nWomen were a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.1), and 39.2% reported that their pregnancy was unintended. 50.6% of women were Hispanic, 28.4% were White, 10.1% were Black, and 10.9% were other races. 78.9% of women reported an annual household income <$50,000. Overall, 26.7% of women reported current stress, 8.2% reported current depression, and 18.3% of women initiated prenatal care after their first trimester. In multivariable analyses, women with unintended pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing current stress (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.41), current depression (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.20), and initiation of prenatal care post-first trimester (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.74).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nUnintended pregnancies were associated with current stress and depression, and delayed prenatal care in this sample of low-income women suggesting the importance of identifying high-risk women and tailoring interventions to support women's needs.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03191591; Retrospectively registered on June 19, 2017).",

This study aimed to examine the effect of father involvement and IPV on the association between unintended pregnancy and PND. A sample of 1,083 pregnant women who attended antenatal clinic at selected hospitals in Hong Kong completed two surveys to report on their pregnancy intention, antenatal depression, PND, IPV during pregnancy, their partner's (i.e., father's) involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth, and perceived social support. Comparisons were made between women with unintended pregnancy and those with intended pregnancy, and the effects of unintended pregnancy, father involvement, IPV, and other factors on maternal PND were examined. Results show that women with unintended pregnancy were more likely to report PND, IPV, fear, postnatal stress, lower degree of father involvement, and lower level of social support. Unintended pregnancy independently increased the risk of PND by 1.95 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.15, 3.28]), after adjustment for all other variables. When father involvement was included in the regression model, the negative effects of IPV and the related fear on PND became nonsignificant.

We find that pregnancy timing is related to maternal experience during pregnancy, but not to infant outcomes at birth-both of which are consistent with prior research. In an addition to the literature, we show that pregnancy timing is relevant for a number of maternal outcomes, such as the onset of depression and intimate partner violence, changes in smoking behavior, and receipt of medical care.

In this study, we evaluate how different dimensions of pregnancy intentions (pregnancy planning and pregnancy acceptance) relate to two maternal depressive symptoms and perceived psychological distress.\n## METHODS\nThis study draws from a cross-sectional national survey conducted in all maternities in France over a one-week period in 2016. All mothers 18\u2009years and older who had a live birth during the study period were invited to participate. After excluding women who underwent infertility treatment, our analytical sample included 10,339 women. We first described levels and correlates of pregnancy planning and acceptance, defined in four categories; planned/welcomed, unplanned/welcomed, planned/unwelcomed, unplanned/unwelcomed. We then assessed the bivariate and multivariate associations between pregnancy planning and acceptance and two outcomes: women's self-perceived psychological health and the presence of two depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We used multivariate logistic regressions to evaluate these associations, after adjusting for socio-demographic and medical factors.\n## RESULTS\nAltogether 7.5 to 24.1% of mothers perceived their psychological health during pregnancy was poor, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories and 10.3 to 22.4% indicated feelings of sadness and loss of interest during pregnancy, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories. As compared to women with planned/welcomed pregnancies, the odds of perceived poor psychological health and depressive symptoms were 2.55 times (CI 2.20-2.95) and 1.75 times higher (CI 1.51-2.02), respectively, among unplanned/unwelcomed pregnancies and 2.02 (CI 1.61-2.53) and 2.07 (CI 1.7-2.5) higher, among planned/unwelcomed pregnancies. Among women with unplanned pregnancies, we also found higher odds of perceived poor psychological health among women whose pregnancy was unwelcomed while the odds of depressive symptoms were not different by pregnancy planning status among women with unwelcomed pregnancies.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings consolidate previous reports of the association between pregnancy intentions and maternal psychological distress, while further specifying the relationship, which mostly depends on the acceptance of pregnancy timing rather than on pregnancy planning. Identifying women with low pregnancy acceptance can potentially enhance current medical practice by improving early detection of maternal depression.",

The study questionnaire asked about maternal behaviors and characteristics around the time of pregnancy.\n## RESULTS\nWomen who had mistimed or unwanted pregnancies reported significantly higher levels of abuse at any time during the 12 months before conception or during pregnancy (12.6% and 15.3%, respectively) compared with those with intended pregnancies (5.3%). Higher rates of abuse were reported by women who were younger, Black, unmarried, less educated, on Medicaid, living in crowded conditions, entering prenatal care late, or smoking during the third trimester.

A cross-sectional interview measuring pregnancy intent, IPV, and acculturation, using the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II), was conducted among Latina women in their 2(nd) or 3(rd) trimester of pregnancy at clinics in Los Angeles (n = 313). Overall, 44% of women reported an unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of physical (any) and emotional (only) abuse 12 months before pregnancy was 11% and 22%, respectively. Although both types of IPV decreased during pregnancy (10% and 19%, respectively), most reports of physical IPV during pregnancy (53%) were among women who did not report physical abuse before pregnancy. After adjusting for other factors, physical IPV before pregnancy was not associated with unintended pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.40, 2.16). The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was highest (76%) among highly acculturated Latinas. However, when an unintended pregnancy occurred among less acculturated Latinas, who comprised the majority of the sample (n = 270), it was associated with greater risk of physical IPV during pregnancy (unadjusted OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.06, 6.23); although the confidence interval included one after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 0.98, 7.92). An unintended pregnancy may have a unique impact on relationships in the context of Latino culture, where family and pregnancy are highly valued. Pregnancy often creates an opportunity for providers to discuss issues related to abuse and family planning with women who do not regularly access care. The results from this study may be used to increase the cultural sensitivity with which violence and reproductive health are addressed among the diverse population of Latinas when they connect with prenatal services.",

Unintended pregnancies are associated with increased health risks, also for women for whom pregnancy continues to childbirth. Our objective was to present the prevalence of unintended pregnancy in six European countries among pregnant women attending routine antenatal care, and to investigate the association with a history of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.\n## METHODS\nA prospective cross-sectional study, of 7102 pregnant women who filled out a questionnaire during pregnancy as part of a multi-country cohort study (Bidens) with the participating countries: Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway and Sweden. A validated instrument, the Norvold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAq) consisting of 10 descriptive questions measured abuse. Pregnancy intendedness was assessed using a single question asking women if this pregnancy was planned. Cross-tabulation, Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression analysis were used.\n## RESULTS\nApproximately one-fifth (19.2 %) of all women reported their current pregnancy to be unintended. Women with an unintended pregnancy were significantly younger, had less education, suffered economic hardship, had a different ethnic background from the regional majority and more frequently were not living with their partner. The prevalence of an unintended pregnancy among women reporting any lifetime abuse was 24.5 %, and 38.5 % among women reporting recent abuse. Women with a history of any lifetime abuse had significantly higher odds of unintended pregnancy, also after adjusting for confounding factors, AOR for any lifetime abuse 1.41 (95 % CI 1.23-1.60) and for recent abuse AOR 2.03 (95 % CI 1.54-2.68).\n## CONCLUSION\nWomen who have experienced any lifetime abuse are significantly more likely to have an unintended pregnancy.

This study examined whether risk factors for physical IPV victimization during pregnancy (a pregnancy that was not planned and prenatal substance use) differed for women with versus without early childhood victimization. Participants were 236 ethnically diverse, low-income biological mothers ( M = 30.94 years; 50.0% Latina, 16.9% Caucasian, 13.1% African American, and 16.9% multiracial) of children aged 0 to 6 years. Mothers were classified into four groups based on whether they had experienced early childhood victimization and physical IPV victimization during pregnancy with the target child. Multinomial logistic regressions, controlling for demographic characteristics, examined whether a pregnancy not planned and prenatal substance use predicted group membership. Compared to mothers with early victimization only, mothers with both early childhood victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy were more than 3 times as likely to report that their pregnancy with the target child was not planned. In follow-up analyses, mothers with early victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy also reported higher lifetime parity than mothers with physical IPV during pregnancy but no early victimization.

The questionnaire contained an item to measure intendedness of the pregnancy. A total of 922 women comprised the final sample for analysis. For the analyses, intendedness was dichotomised as: intended (wanted now or sooner) vs. unintended (mistimed, unwanted or unsure). Overall, 13.7% of all births to women in the sample were preterm. In a logistic regression model, after controlling for potential confounding by clinical and behavioural predictors of preterm delivery, unintended pregnancy was significantly associated with preterm delivery (adjusted RR = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [1.08,3.08], P = 0.026). In this study of a cohort of urban, clinic-attending, low-income, pregnant black women, unintended pregnancy had a statistically significant association with preterm birth. After adjustment for behavioural and clinical risks, women with unintended pregnancies had almost twice the risk of a preterm delivery as women with intended pregnancies.",

For racial and ethnic groups in which an association was found, sequential logistic regression was conducted to further examine the relationship while controlling for socioeconomic characteristics.\n## RESULTS\nIn unadjusted results, pregnancy intention was associated with preterm birth among both whites and immigrant Latinas, but not among blacks or U.S.-born Latinas. Among whites, compared with women who reported that their pregnancy was intended, those who were unsure about their pregnancy had elevated odds of preterm birth (odds ratio, 1.4), as did those who reported their pregnancy was unwanted (1.7) or mistimed (1.4). Among immigrant Latinas, those who reported being unsure about their pregnancy were at higher risk of preterm birth than were those who reported an intended pregnancy (1.6).

This study investigates the association of early prenatal care, preterm birth, and low birth weight with the couple relationship context, including partners' joint intentions for the pregnancy, their marital status at conception, and the presence of relationship problems during pregnancy. Data are drawn from the first wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Birth Cohort, a representative study of births in 2001. The sample is composed of parents residing together with their biological child at the time the child is 9 months old, where both the mother and father completed the self-report interview (N = 5,788). Couple-level multivariate logistic regression models, weighted to account for the complex sampling design, were used in the analysis. Risk of inadequate prenatal care and preterm birth was increased when partners did not share intentions or when neither partner intended the pregnancy. Couples were at additional risk of inadequate prenatal care when the pregnancy was conceived nonmaritally and when the mother did not tell the father about the pregnancy, particularly when neither partner intended the pregnancy. The risk of premature birth was particularly high when the partners were unmarried and either or both did not intend the pregnancy. The couple context of pregnancy is important for a healthy pregnancy and birth.

We evaluate a multi-dimensional measure of pregnancy intention among pregnant adolescents and quantify the association between intention dimensions and adverse outcomes and risk behaviors. Pregnancy intention measures were examined in a cohort of 300 pregnant adolescent women. We considered 18 items assessing elements of pregnancy intention including pregnancy planning, timing, emotional response, and readiness. Latent class analysis was performed to identify dimensions of pregnancy intention. Parsimonious scores were created by minimizing the number of covariates while maintaining substantial agreement with the latent class. Associations between intention measures and prenatal care, risk behaviors, and pregnancy outcomes were quantified using multivariable logistic regression. Two constructs of pregnancy intention were identified: planning and emotional readiness. Compared with emotionally ready adolescents, adolescents categorized as not emotionally ready had an increased odds of inadequate prenatal care (OR = 2.70, 95% CI:1.27-5.72), delayed prenatal care (OR = 2.54, 95% CI:1.27-5.09), and self-reported depression at the time of the first prenatal visit (OR = 2.21, 95% CI:1.03-4.77).

Smoking during pregnancy has been well-researched and there is clear evidence of harm. But there has been little research on the health impact of planning for pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the independent effects of pregnancy planning and smoking during pregnancy on neonatal outcome.\n## METHODS\nThis analysis made use of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. The study sample consisted of 18,178 singleton babies born in UK between 2000 and 2001. The neonatal outcomes of interest were low birthweight (<2.5 Kg) and pre-term birth (<37 completed weeks gestation). Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between pregnancy planning and/or smoking and neonatal outcome. Adjusted odds ratios were used to calculate population attributable risk fractions (PAFs).\n## RESULTS\n43% of mothers did not plan their pregnancy and 34% were smoking just before and/or during pregnancy. Planners were half as likely to be smokers just before pregnancy, and more likely to give up or reduce the amount smoked if smokers. Unplanned pregnancies had 24% increased odds of low birth weight and prematurity compared to planned pregnancies (AORLBW1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; AORPREM1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), independent of smoking status. The odds of low birth weight for babies of mothers who were smoking just before pregnancy was 91% higher than that of mothers who were not (AORLBW1.91, 95% CI 1.56-2.34). Women who quit or reduced the amount smoked during pregnancy lowered the risk of a low birth weight baby by one third (AORLBW0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85) compared with women whose smoking level did not change. Smaller effects were found for prematurity. If all women planned their pregnancy and did not smoke before or during pregnancy, 30% of low birthweight and 14% of prematurity could, in theory, be avoided.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPlanning a pregnancy and avoiding smoking during pregnancy has clear, independent, health benefits for babies. Quitting or reducing the amount smoked during pregnancy can reduce the risk of low birthweight.",

Propensity score methods were used to control for confounding. Births mistimed by two or more years (OR .58) and unwanted births (OR .33) had significantly lower odds than intended births of having a mother who recognized the pregnancy within the first 8 weeks; they were also about half as likely as intended births to receive early prenatal care, and had significantly higher likelihoods of exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Breastfeeding was significantly less likely among unwanted births (OR .68); breastfeeding for at least 6 months was significantly less likely among seriously mistimed births (OR .70). We find little association between intention status and early childhood measures. Measured associations of intention status on health behaviors and outcomes were most evident in the prenatal period, limited in the immediate prenatal period, and mostly insignificant by age two.

These associations were explained by lower income, financial hardship, and higher incidence of poor pregnancy outcome among minority women. Young maternal age was associated with greater risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms, largely attributable to the prevalence of financial hardship, unwanted pregnancy, and lack of a partner. The strongest risk factor for antenatal depressive symptoms was a history of depression (OR = 4.07; 95% CI 3.76, 4.40), and the strongest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms was depressive symptoms during pregnancy (6.78; 4.07, 11.31) or a history of depression before pregnancy (3.82; 2.31, 6.31).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFinancial hardship and unwanted pregnancy are associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms. Women with a history of depression and those with poor pregnancy outcomes are especially vulnerable to depressive symptoms during the childbearing year. Once these factors are taken in account, minority mothers have the same risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms as white mothers.",

Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed associations between pregnancy intentions or level of happiness about being pregnant and multiple psychosocial and behavioral risk factors, and identified correlates of happiness to be pregnant.\n## RESULTS\nPregnancy intentions and happiness were strongly associated, but happiness was the better predictor of risk. Unhappy women had higher odds than happy women of smoking, being depressed, experiencing intimate partner violence, drinking and using illicit drugs (odds ratios, 1.7-2.6). The odds of being happy were reduced among women who had other children or a child younger than two, who were single or did not have a current partner, who had had more than one sexual partner in the past year and who reported that the baby's father did not want the pregnancy (0.3-0.6). In contrast, the odds of being happy were elevated among women who had better coping strategies (1.03), who had not used birth control at conception (1.6) and who had 1-2 household members, rather than five or more (2.1).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAdditional psychosocial screening for happiness about being pregnant and for partner characteristics, particularly the father's desire to have this child, may help improve prenatal care services and prevent adverse health outcomes.",

Data collection was carried out by means of a self-reported questionnaire. The outcome variable was depression during the third trimester of pregnancy measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Predictor variables were psychosocial (marital dissatisfaction, confidant and affective social support) and personal (previous history of depression, partner depression and unplanned pregnancy) variables. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated by fitting a logistic regression model.\n## RESULTS\nThe prevalence of pregnancy depression was higher among women (10.3%) than men (6.5%). In both sexes, the probability of depression during pregnancy was higher in those with marital dissatisfaction (aOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.59 to 5.82 for women and 3.14, 95% CI 1.24 to 7.99 for men) and among those whose with a previous history of depression (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.89 for women and 5.22, 95% CI 2.05 to 13.34 for men).

Only 38% of the pregnancies were characterized as wanted. Women with unwanted and with mistimed pregnancies were similar demographically, but they differed significantly on psychosocial profiles and maternal characteristics. Women with mistimed and with wanted pregnancies differed in demographics and psychosocial profiles. Wanted pregnancies had the healthiest, mistimed an intermediate, and unwanted the poorest psychosocial profile. Women with unwanted pregnancies had the highest depression, perceived stress, and negative paternal support scores (p<0.05) and the lowest self-efficacy, social support, and positive paternal support scores (p<0.05).

Adopting a staged approach to the analysis, the study investigates whether pregnancy intention influences maternal health behaviours during pregnancy independent of background characteristics, and whether pregnancy intention carries any additional risk for adverse infant and maternal health outcomes when we adjust for background characteristics and prenatal behaviours.\n## RESULTS\nThe study confirmed that sociodemographic factors are strongly associated with unintended pregnancy and that unintended pregnancy is associated with a range of health compromising behaviours that are known to be harmful to the developing fetus. While there was little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention was associated with adverse neonatal outcomes or developmental delay independent of other covariates, there was strong evidence that intention status had a bearing on the mother's psychosocial health. Unintended pregnancy was associated with increased risk of depression (risk ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 1.19, 1.54]), and higher parenting stress (risk ratio 1.27 [95% confidence interval 1.16, 1.38]).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAscertaining the mother's pregnancy intention during the first antenatal visit may represent a means for monitoring those at greatest risk for adverse mother and child outcomes.",

Less is known about maternal risks for PD, which could inform preventive strategies for perinatal and interconceptional care. This exploratory study investigates associations between prenatal depression symptoms and unintended and mistimed pregnancies and other maternal risk factors for PD. A subset of birth records from the New York Statewide Perinatal Data System (n = 19,219) was used in this secondary analysis of cross-sectional data. Univariate and multivariate multinomial regression was used to identify factors that are independently associated with four self-reported levels of prenatal depression symptoms. Women with unintended pregnancies were more likely (AOR, 95 % CI) to report severe (3.6, 2.6-5.1) or moderate (2.0, 1.6-2.5) prenatal depression symptoms and less likely to report no symptoms, compared to women with intended pregnancies. Likewise, women with mistimed pregnancies were more likely to report severe (2.7, 2.2-3.5) or moderate (1.7, 1.5-2.1) prenatal depression symptoms than no symptoms, compared to women with intended pregnancies. Low education, drug use, smoking, minority race, being unmarried and having Medicaid insurance were also significant, independent predictors of PD symptoms. Results suggest that routine screening for depression, intendedness of pregnancy and other associated risk factors such as smoking and drug use during prenatal and interconceptional care visits may enable coordinated interventions that can reduce prenatal depression and unintended and mistimed pregnancies and improve pregnancy outcomes.",

Identifying women with chronic depressive or anxiety symptoms can provide opportunities to reduce distress and improve pregnancy outcomes.

Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured in the second and third trimesters using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, respectively. On the basis of the timing and persistence of symptoms, the following three mutually exclusive subgroups for each anxiety and depressive symptoms were created: never symptomatic, symptomatic only in the second trimester, and symptomatic at both time points. Separate logistic regression models were used to derive risk factors for each subgroup.\n## FINDINGS\nwomen with chronic anxiety or depressive symptoms were distinguished from those with transient symptoms or no symptoms by their optimism scores, in which less optimistic pregnant women had a four-fold increased risk for developing chronic depressive or anxiety symptoms compared with more optimistic women (AOR varied from 4.30 to 4.93). Additionally, high perceived stress, low social support, history of mental health issues were common predictors of chronic anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnancy. Partner tension was the exclusive predictor of anxiety symptoms (AOR varied from 1.94 to 2.31) and poor physical health (AOR 2.54; 95% CI 1.32-4.89), unplanned pregnancy (AOR 3.05; 95% CI 1.61-5.79), and infertility treatments (AOR 4.98; 95% CI 1.85-13.39) were unique predictors of chronic depressive symptoms.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nknowledge of the risk factors of chronic poor mental health during pregnancy might inform the development of effective strategies within the limited resources of health-care systems to target populations with greater needs for interventions.",

Unintended pregnancies, reaching close to 50% of the pregnancies in the United States, have become a major health concern. While many physiologic and psychosocial causes have been analyzed, few studies have examined the relationship between unintended pregnancy and symptoms of PPD.A cross-sectional study was conducted using surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 2009 to 2011. The PRAMS population-based random sample included women who have had recent live births and is representative of 78% of the United States population. The chi-squared test was used to examine bivariate associations. Binary logistic regression was utilized to study unadjusted and adjusted associations between PPD and pregnancy intendedness, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers in the sample. Multicollinearity in the adjusted model was evaluated using variance inflation factors. Sampling weights were used to account for PRAMS' complex sampling design.Of the 110,231 mothers included in the sample, only 32.3% reported desiring the pregnancy at the time of conception. Women with pregnancies categorized as mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, or unwanted were 20% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u200a=\u200a1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.3), 30% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4), and 50% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.7) more likely to experience symptoms of PPD, respectively, compared to women with desired pregnancies. Other factors found to be associated with experiencing symptoms of PPD were a gestational age of <27 weeks (AOR\u200a=\u200a3.1; 95% CI: 2.5-4.0), having a previous history of depression (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.8; 95% CI: 1.6-2.0), and being abused during or before pregnancy (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-2.0).We found that women with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies were more likely to experience symptoms of PPD. Our findings support the current US Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for an integrated approach to screening for depression, aiding in the maximization of intervention and early referral for women at risk for PPD.",

A sample of 1,083 pregnant women who attended antenatal clinic at selected hospitals in Hong Kong completed two surveys to report on their pregnancy intention, antenatal depression, PND, IPV during pregnancy, their partner's (i.e., father's) involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth, and perceived social support. Comparisons were made between women with unintended pregnancy and those with intended pregnancy, and the effects of unintended pregnancy, father involvement, IPV, and other factors on maternal PND were examined. Results show that women with unintended pregnancy were more likely to report PND, IPV, fear, postnatal stress, lower degree of father involvement, and lower level of social support. Unintended pregnancy independently increased the risk of PND by 1.95 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.15, 3.28]), after adjustment for all other variables.

We then assessed the bivariate and multivariate associations between pregnancy planning and acceptance and two outcomes: women's self-perceived psychological health and the presence of two depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We used multivariate logistic regressions to evaluate these associations, after adjusting for socio-demographic and medical factors.\n## RESULTS\nAltogether 7.5 to 24.1% of mothers perceived their psychological health during pregnancy was poor, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories and 10.3 to 22.4% indicated feelings of sadness and loss of interest during pregnancy, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories. As compared to women with planned/welcomed pregnancies, the odds of perceived poor psychological health and depressive symptoms were 2.55 times (CI 2.20-2.95) and 1.75 times higher (CI 1.51-2.02), respectively, among unplanned/unwelcomed pregnancies and 2.02 (CI 1.61-2.53) and 2.07 (CI 1.7-2.5) higher, among planned/unwelcomed pregnancies. Among women with unplanned pregnancies, we also found higher odds of perceived poor psychological health among women whose pregnancy was unwelcomed while the odds of depressive symptoms were not different by pregnancy planning status among women with unwelcomed pregnancies.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings consolidate previous reports of the association between pregnancy intentions and maternal psychological distress, while further specifying the relationship, which mostly depends on the acceptance of pregnancy timing rather than on pregnancy planning. Identifying women with low pregnancy acceptance can potentially enhance current medical practice by improving early detection of maternal depression.",

The study questionnaire asked about maternal behaviors and characteristics around the time of pregnancy.\n## RESULTS\nWomen who had mistimed or unwanted pregnancies reported significantly higher levels of abuse at any time during the 12 months before conception or during pregnancy (12.6% and 15.3%, respectively) compared with those with intended pregnancies (5.3%). Higher rates of abuse were reported by women who were younger, Black, unmarried, less educated, on Medicaid, living in crowded conditions, entering prenatal care late, or smoking during the third trimester. Overall, women with unintended pregnancies had 2.5 times the risk of experiencing physical abuse compared with those whose pregnancies were intended. This association was modified by maternal characteristics, the association was strongest among women who were older, more educated, White, married, not on Medicaid, not living in crowded conditions, receiving first trimester prenatal care, or nonsmoking during the third trimester.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWomen with unintended pregnancies are at increased risk of physical abuse around the time of pregnancy compared with women whose pregnancies are intended.

A cross-sectional interview measuring pregnancy intent, IPV, and acculturation, using the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II), was conducted among Latina women in their 2(nd) or 3(rd) trimester of pregnancy at clinics in Los Angeles (n = 313). Overall, 44% of women reported an unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of physical (any) and emotional (only) abuse 12 months before pregnancy was 11% and 22%, respectively. Although both types of IPV decreased during pregnancy (10% and 19%, respectively), most reports of physical IPV during pregnancy (53%) were among women who did not report physical abuse before pregnancy. After adjusting for other factors, physical IPV before pregnancy was not associated with unintended pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.40, 2.16). The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was highest (76%) among highly acculturated Latinas. However, when an unintended pregnancy occurred among less acculturated Latinas, who comprised the majority of the sample (n = 270), it was associated with greater risk of physical IPV during pregnancy (unadjusted OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.06, 6.23); although the confidence interval included one after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 0.98, 7.92). An unintended pregnancy may have a unique impact on relationships in the context of Latino culture, where family and pregnancy are highly valued. Pregnancy often creates an opportunity for providers to discuss issues related to abuse and family planning with women who do not regularly access care. The results from this study may be used to increase the cultural sensitivity with which violence and reproductive health are addressed among the diverse population of Latinas when they connect with prenatal services.",

Unintended pregnancies are associated with increased health risks, also for women for whom pregnancy continues to childbirth. Our objective was to present the prevalence of unintended pregnancy in six European countries among pregnant women attending routine antenatal care, and to investigate the association with a history of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.\n## METHODS\nA prospective cross-sectional study, of 7102 pregnant women who filled out a questionnaire during pregnancy as part of a multi-country cohort study (Bidens) with the participating countries: Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway and Sweden. A validated instrument, the Norvold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAq) consisting of 10 descriptive questions measured abuse. Pregnancy intendedness was assessed using a single question asking women if this pregnancy was planned. Cross-tabulation, Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression analysis were used.\n## RESULTS\nApproximately one-fifth (19.2 %) of all women reported their current pregnancy to be unintended. Women with an unintended pregnancy were significantly younger, had less education, suffered economic hardship, had a different ethnic background from the regional majority and more frequently were not living with their partner. The prevalence of an unintended pregnancy among women reporting any lifetime abuse was 24.5 %, and 38.5 % among women reporting recent abuse. Women with a history of any lifetime abuse had significantly higher odds of unintended pregnancy, also after adjusting for confounding factors, AOR for any lifetime abuse 1.41 (95 % CI 1.23-1.60) and for recent abuse AOR 2.03 (95 % CI 1.54-2.68).\n## CONCLUSION\nWomen who have experienced any lifetime abuse are significantly more likely to have an unintended pregnancy. This is particularly true for women reporting recent abuse, suggesting that women living in a violent relationship have less control over their fertility.",

This study examined whether risk factors for physical IPV victimization during pregnancy (a pregnancy that was not planned and prenatal substance use) differed for women with versus without early childhood victimization. Participants were 236 ethnically diverse, low-income biological mothers ( M = 30.94 years; 50.0% Latina, 16.9% Caucasian, 13.1% African American, and 16.9% multiracial) of children aged 0 to 6 years. Mothers were classified into four groups based on whether they had experienced early childhood victimization and physical IPV victimization during pregnancy with the target child. Multinomial logistic regressions, controlling for demographic characteristics, examined whether a pregnancy not planned and prenatal substance use predicted group membership. Compared to mothers with early victimization only, mothers with both early childhood victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy were more than 3 times as likely to report that their pregnancy with the target child was not planned. In follow-up analyses, mothers with early victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy also reported higher lifetime parity than mothers with physical IPV during pregnancy but no early victimization. Early childhood victimization may place women on a risk pathway to physical IPV during pregnancy, particularly if the pregnancy is not planned.

This study investigates the association of early prenatal care, preterm birth, and low birth weight with the couple relationship context, including partners' joint intentions for the pregnancy, their marital status at conception, and the presence of relationship problems during pregnancy. Data are drawn from the first wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Birth Cohort, a representative study of births in 2001.

Couple-level multivariate logistic regression models, weighted to account for the complex sampling design, were used in the analysis. Risk of inadequate prenatal care and preterm birth was increased when partners did not share intentions or when neither partner intended the pregnancy. Couples were at additional risk of inadequate prenatal care when the pregnancy was conceived nonmaritally and when the mother did not tell the father about the pregnancy, particularly when neither partner intended the pregnancy. The risk of premature birth was particularly high when the partners were unmarried and either or both did not intend the pregnancy.

We evaluate a multi-dimensional measure of pregnancy intention among pregnant adolescents and quantify the association between intention dimensions and adverse outcomes and risk behaviors. Pregnancy intention measures were examined in a cohort of 300 pregnant adolescent women. We considered 18 items assessing elements of pregnancy intention including pregnancy planning, timing, emotional response, and readiness. Latent class analysis was performed to identify dimensions of pregnancy intention. Parsimonious scores were created by minimizing the number of covariates while maintaining substantial agreement with the latent class. Associations between intention measures and prenatal care, risk behaviors, and pregnancy outcomes were quantified using multivariable logistic regression. Two constructs of pregnancy intention were identified: planning and emotional readiness. Compared with emotionally ready adolescents, adolescents categorized as not emotionally ready had an increased odds of inadequate prenatal care (OR = 2.70, 95% CI:1.27-5.72), delayed prenatal care (OR = 2.54, 95% CI:1.27-5.09), and self-reported depression at the time of the first prenatal visit (OR = 2.21, 95% CI:1.03-4.77). Pregnancy planning was not associated with adverse pregnancy risk factors or outcomes. Among pregnant adolescents, emotional readiness for pregnancy and parenting was inversely associated with known risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, suggesting that emotional readiness rather than pregnancy planning may be the more pertinent intention construct for adolescents.",

                "key_reference_abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nPre-pregnancy health and care are important for the health of the future generations. Smoking during pregnancy has been well-researched and there is clear evidence of harm. But there has been little research on the health impact of planning for pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the independent effects of pregnancy planning and smoking during pregnancy on neonatal outcome.\n## METHODS\nThis analysis made use of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. The study sample consisted of 18,178 singleton babies born in UK between 2000 and 2001. The neonatal outcomes of interest were low birthweight (<2.5 Kg) and pre-term birth (<37 completed weeks gestation). Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between pregnancy planning and/or smoking and neonatal outcome. Adjusted odds ratios were used to calculate population attributable risk fractions (PAFs).\n## RESULTS\n43% of mothers did not plan their pregnancy and 34% were smoking just before and/or during pregnancy. Planners were half as likely to be smokers just before pregnancy, and more likely to give up or reduce the amount smoked if smokers. Unplanned pregnancies had 24% increased odds of low birth weight and prematurity compared to planned pregnancies (AORLBW1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; AORPREM1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), independent of smoking status. The odds of low birth weight for babies of mothers who were smoking just before pregnancy was 91% higher than that of mothers who were not (AORLBW1.91, 95% CI 1.56-2.34). Women who quit or reduced the amount smoked during pregnancy lowered the risk of a low birth weight baby by one third (AORLBW0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85) compared with women whose smoking level did not change. Smaller effects were found for prematurity. If all women planned their pregnancy and did not smoke before or during pregnancy, 30% of low birthweight and 14% of prematurity could, in theory, be avoided.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPlanning a pregnancy and avoiding smoking during pregnancy has clear, independent, health benefits for babies. Quitting or reducing the amount smoked during pregnancy can reduce the risk of low birthweight.",

Propensity score methods were used to control for confounding. Births mistimed by two or more years (OR .58) and unwanted births (OR .33) had significantly lower odds than intended births of having a mother who recognized the pregnancy within the first 8 weeks; they were also about half as likely as intended births to receive early prenatal care, and had significantly higher likelihoods of exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Breastfeeding was significantly less likely among unwanted births (OR .68); breastfeeding for at least 6 months was significantly less likely among seriously mistimed births (OR .70). We find little association between intention status and early childhood measures. Measured associations of intention status on health behaviors and outcomes were most evident in the prenatal period, limited in the immediate prenatal period, and mostly insignificant by age two.

The sample included mothers who delivered a live birth in Colorado, New York State, and North Carolina from 1996 (New York only) to 1999. We assessed risk factors for self-reports of being very depressed in the months after delivery using logistic regression.\n## RESULTS\nOverall, 5.9% (95% CI = 5.3, 6.4) of new mothers reported being very depressed in the months after delivery. Women who reported that their pregnancy was a \"very hard time\" or \"one of the worst times of my life\" had the highest prevalence of reporting being very depressed in the months after delivery (24.9%, 95% CI = 21.3, 28.5) and, when all risk factors were adjusted for simultaneously, were 4.6 times (95% CI = 3.1, 6.3) more likely to report being very depressed in the months after delivery than other women.

This study investigated whether race/ethnicity, age, finances, and partnership status were associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms.\n## SETTING\n1662 participants in Project Viva, a US cohort study.\n## DESIGN\nMothers indicated mid-pregnancy and six month postpartum depressive symptoms on the Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS). Associations of sociodemographic factors with odds of scoring >12 on the EPDS were estimated.\n## MAIN RESULTS\nThe prevalence of depressive symptoms was 9% at mid-pregnancy and 8% postpartum. Black and Hispanic mothers had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms compared with non-Hispanic white mothers. These associations were explained by lower income, financial hardship, and higher incidence of poor pregnancy outcome among minority women. Young maternal age was associated with greater risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms, largely attributable to the prevalence of financial hardship, unwanted pregnancy, and lack of a partner. The strongest risk factor for antenatal depressive symptoms was a history of depression (OR = 4.07; 95% CI 3.76, 4.40), and the strongest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms was depressive symptoms during pregnancy (6.78; 4.07, 11.31) or a history of depression before pregnancy (3.82; 2.31, 6.31).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFinancial hardship and unwanted pregnancy are associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed associations between pregnancy intentions or level of happiness about being pregnant and multiple psychosocial and behavioral risk factors, and identified correlates of happiness to be pregnant.\n## RESULTS\nPregnancy intentions and happiness were strongly associated, but happiness was the better predictor of risk. Unhappy women had higher odds than happy women of smoking, being depressed, experiencing intimate partner violence, drinking and using illicit drugs (odds ratios, 1.7-2.6). The odds of being happy were reduced among women who had other children or a child younger than two, who were single or did not have a current partner, who had had more than one sexual partner in the past year and who reported that the baby's father did not want the pregnancy (0.3-0.6).

In the first trimester, a greater prevalence of current depressive disorder was independently associated with unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, high neuroticism, low education, and a previous history of depression; in the second trimester with unplanned and unwanted pregnancy and high neuroticism; in the third trimester with unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, high neuroticism, and the occurrence of psychosocial stressors during the last year.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe highest prevalence of depressive disorders was found in the first trimester, the lowest in mid-pregnancy. Several determinants (unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, high neuroticism) were independent predictors of antenatal depressive disorders throughout whole pregnancy, while other determinants (low education, previous history of depression, the occurrence of psychosocial stressors at the end of pregnancy) were trimester specific.",

Only 38% of the pregnancies were characterized as wanted. Women with unwanted and with mistimed pregnancies were similar demographically, but they differed significantly on psychosocial profiles and maternal characteristics. Women with mistimed and with wanted pregnancies differed in demographics and psychosocial profiles. Wanted pregnancies had the healthiest, mistimed an intermediate, and unwanted the poorest psychosocial profile. Women with unwanted pregnancies had the highest depression, perceived stress, and negative paternal support scores (p<0.05) and the lowest self-efficacy, social support, and positive paternal support scores (p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, women with riskier psychosocial profiles had higher odds of being in the unwanted category. Controlling for psychosocial and demographic variables, perceived stress and positive paternal support remained significant predictors of belonging to the unwanted and mistimed groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFully characterizing pregnancy intention and its relationship to psychosocial profiles may provide a basis for identifying women with highest risk during pregnancy and early motherhood. Women with unwanted and mistimed pregnancies may appear similar demographically but are different psychosocially.

Adopting a staged approach to the analysis, the study investigates whether pregnancy intention influences maternal health behaviours during pregnancy independent of background characteristics, and whether pregnancy intention carries any additional risk for adverse infant and maternal health outcomes when we adjust for background characteristics and prenatal behaviours.\n## RESULTS\nThe study confirmed that sociodemographic factors are strongly associated with unintended pregnancy and that unintended pregnancy is associated with a range of health compromising behaviours that are known to be harmful to the developing fetus. While there was little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention was associated with adverse neonatal outcomes or developmental delay independent of other covariates, there was strong evidence that intention status had a bearing on the mother's psychosocial health. Unintended pregnancy was associated with increased risk of depression (risk ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 1.19, 1.54]), and higher parenting stress (risk ratio 1.27 [95% confidence interval 1.16, 1.38]).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAscertaining the mother's pregnancy intention during the first antenatal visit may represent a means for monitoring those at greatest risk for adverse mother and child outcomes.",

This study examines the relationship between a mother and/or her partner's pregnancy intentions and reported post-partum depressive symptoms (PPDs).\n## METHODS\nUsing Louisiana pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system, 2000-2003, a secondary cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 5549 mothers, stratified by race, who delivered a singleton, live birth and whose infant was still alive at the time of the survey. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted, taking into account the complex survey design.\n## RESULTS\nIn multivariable models, unwanted pregnancies were associated with severe PPDs (aOR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.23-2.53).

Unintended pregnancies, reaching close to 50% of the pregnancies in the United States, have become a major health concern. While many physiologic and psychosocial causes have been analyzed, few studies have examined the relationship between unintended pregnancy and symptoms of PPD.A cross-sectional study was conducted using surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 2009 to 2011. The PRAMS population-based random sample included women who have had recent live births and is representative of 78% of the United States population. The chi-squared test was used to examine bivariate associations. Binary logistic regression was utilized to study unadjusted and adjusted associations between PPD and pregnancy intendedness, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers in the sample. Multicollinearity in the adjusted model was evaluated using variance inflation factors. Sampling weights were used to account for PRAMS' complex sampling design.Of the 110,231 mothers included in the sample, only 32.3% reported desiring the pregnancy at the time of conception. Women with pregnancies categorized as mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, or unwanted were 20% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u200a=\u200a1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.3), 30% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4), and 50% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.7) more likely to experience symptoms of PPD, respectively, compared to women with desired pregnancies. Other factors found to be associated with experiencing symptoms of PPD were a gestational age of <27 weeks (AOR\u200a=\u200a3.1; 95% CI: 2.5-4.0), having a previous history of depression (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.8; 95% CI: 1.6-2.0), and being abused during or before pregnancy (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-2.0).We found that women with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies were more likely to experience symptoms of PPD. Our findings support the current US Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for an integrated approach to screening for depression, aiding in the maximization of intervention and early referral for women at risk for PPD.",

A sample of 1,083 pregnant women who attended antenatal clinic at selected hospitals in Hong Kong completed two surveys to report on their pregnancy intention, antenatal depression, PND, IPV during pregnancy, their partner's (i.e., father's) involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth, and perceived social support. Comparisons were made between women with unintended pregnancy and those with intended pregnancy, and the effects of unintended pregnancy, father involvement, IPV, and other factors on maternal PND were examined. Results show that women with unintended pregnancy were more likely to report PND, IPV, fear, postnatal stress, lower degree of father involvement, and lower level of social support. Unintended pregnancy independently increased the risk of PND by 1.95 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.15, 3.28]), after adjustment for all other variables. When father involvement was included in the regression model, the negative effects of IPV and the related fear on PND became nonsignificant.

We find that pregnancy timing is related to maternal experience during pregnancy, but not to infant outcomes at birth-both of which are consistent with prior research. In an addition to the literature, we show that pregnancy timing is relevant for a number of maternal outcomes, such as the onset of depression and intimate partner violence, changes in smoking behavior, and receipt of medical care.

In this study, we evaluate how different dimensions of pregnancy intentions (pregnancy planning and pregnancy acceptance) relate to two maternal depressive symptoms and perceived psychological distress.\n## METHODS\nThis study draws from a cross-sectional national survey conducted in all maternities in France over a one-week period in 2016. All mothers 18\u2009years and older who had a live birth during the study period were invited to participate. After excluding women who underwent infertility treatment, our analytical sample included 10,339 women. We first described levels and correlates of pregnancy planning and acceptance, defined in four categories; planned/welcomed, unplanned/welcomed, planned/unwelcomed, unplanned/unwelcomed. We then assessed the bivariate and multivariate associations between pregnancy planning and acceptance and two outcomes: women's self-perceived psychological health and the presence of two depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We used multivariate logistic regressions to evaluate these associations, after adjusting for socio-demographic and medical factors.\n## RESULTS\nAltogether 7.5 to 24.1% of mothers perceived their psychological health during pregnancy was poor, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories and 10.3 to 22.4% indicated feelings of sadness and loss of interest during pregnancy, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories. As compared to women with planned/welcomed pregnancies, the odds of perceived poor psychological health and depressive symptoms were 2.55 times (CI 2.20-2.95) and 1.75 times higher (CI 1.51-2.02), respectively, among unplanned/unwelcomed pregnancies and 2.02 (CI 1.61-2.53) and 2.07 (CI 1.7-2.5) higher, among planned/unwelcomed pregnancies. Among women with unplanned pregnancies, we also found higher odds of perceived poor psychological health among women whose pregnancy was unwelcomed while the odds of depressive symptoms were not different by pregnancy planning status among women with unwelcomed pregnancies.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings consolidate previous reports of the association between pregnancy intentions and maternal psychological distress, while further specifying the relationship, which mostly depends on the acceptance of pregnancy timing rather than on pregnancy planning.

Overall, 44% of women reported an unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of physical (any) and emotional (only) abuse 12 months before pregnancy was 11% and 22%, respectively. Although both types of IPV decreased during pregnancy (10% and 19%, respectively), most reports of physical IPV during pregnancy (53%) were among women who did not report physical abuse before pregnancy. After adjusting for other factors, physical IPV before pregnancy was not associated with unintended pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.40, 2.16). The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was highest (76%) among highly acculturated Latinas. However, when an unintended pregnancy occurred among less acculturated Latinas, who comprised the majority of the sample (n = 270), it was associated with greater risk of physical IPV during pregnancy (unadjusted OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.06, 6.23); although the confidence interval included one after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 0.98, 7.92). An unintended pregnancy may have a unique impact on relationships in the context of Latino culture, where family and pregnancy are highly valued. Pregnancy often creates an opportunity for providers to discuss issues related to abuse and family planning with women who do not regularly access care.

Unintended pregnancies are associated with increased health risks, also for women for whom pregnancy continues to childbirth. Our objective was to present the prevalence of unintended pregnancy in six European countries among pregnant women attending routine antenatal care, and to investigate the association with a history of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.\n## METHODS\nA prospective cross-sectional study, of 7102 pregnant women who filled out a questionnaire during pregnancy as part of a multi-country cohort study (Bidens) with the participating countries: Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway and Sweden. A validated instrument, the Norvold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAq) consisting of 10 descriptive questions measured abuse. Pregnancy intendedness was assessed using a single question asking women if this pregnancy was planned. Cross-tabulation, Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression analysis were used.\n## RESULTS\nApproximately one-fifth (19.2 %) of all women reported their current pregnancy to be unintended. Women with an unintended pregnancy were significantly younger, had less education, suffered economic hardship, had a different ethnic background from the regional majority and more frequently were not living with their partner. The prevalence of an unintended pregnancy among women reporting any lifetime abuse was 24.5 %, and 38.5 % among women reporting recent abuse. Women with a history of any lifetime abuse had significantly higher odds of unintended pregnancy, also after adjusting for confounding factors, AOR for any lifetime abuse 1.41 (95 % CI 1.23-1.60) and for recent abuse AOR 2.03 (95 % CI 1.54-2.68).\n## CONCLUSION\nWomen who have experienced any lifetime abuse are significantly more likely to have an unintended pregnancy. This is particularly true for women reporting recent abuse, suggesting that women living in a violent relationship have less control over their fertility.",

This study examined whether risk factors for physical IPV victimization during pregnancy (a pregnancy that was not planned and prenatal substance use) differed for women with versus without early childhood victimization. Participants were 236 ethnically diverse, low-income biological mothers ( M = 30.94 years; 50.0% Latina, 16.9% Caucasian, 13.1% African American, and 16.9% multiracial) of children aged 0 to 6 years. Mothers were classified into four groups based on whether they had experienced early childhood victimization and physical IPV victimization during pregnancy with the target child. Multinomial logistic regressions, controlling for demographic characteristics, examined whether a pregnancy not planned and prenatal substance use predicted group membership. Compared to mothers with early victimization only, mothers with both early childhood victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy were more than 3 times as likely to report that their pregnancy with the target child was not planned. In follow-up analyses, mothers with early victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy also reported higher lifetime parity than mothers with physical IPV during pregnancy but no early victimization. Early childhood victimization may place women on a risk pathway to physical IPV during pregnancy, particularly if the pregnancy is not planned.

Pregnant, black, low-income women were enrolled into this study at four hospital-based prenatal care clinics and one off-site hospital-affiliated prenatal clinic in Baltimore City. A self-administered questionnaire to assess demographic and psychosocial data was completed by each woman in the cohort at the time of enrolment in the study. The questionnaire contained an item to measure intendedness of the pregnancy. A total of 922 women comprised the final sample for analysis.

Data are drawn from the first wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Birth Cohort, a representative study of births in 2001.

Couple-level multivariate logistic regression models, weighted to account for the complex sampling design, were used in the analysis. Risk of inadequate prenatal care and preterm birth was increased when partners did not share intentions or when neither partner intended the pregnancy. Couples were at additional risk of inadequate prenatal care when the pregnancy was conceived nonmaritally and when the mother did not tell the father about the pregnancy, particularly when neither partner intended the pregnancy. The risk of premature birth was particularly high when the partners were unmarried and either or both did not intend the pregnancy.

We considered 18 items assessing elements of pregnancy intention including pregnancy planning, timing, emotional response, and readiness. Latent class analysis was performed to identify dimensions of pregnancy intention. Parsimonious scores were created by minimizing the number of covariates while maintaining substantial agreement with the latent class. Associations between intention measures and prenatal care, risk behaviors, and pregnancy outcomes were quantified using multivariable logistic regression. Two constructs of pregnancy intention were identified: planning and emotional readiness.

Smoking during pregnancy has been well-researched and there is clear evidence of harm. But there has been little research on the health impact of planning for pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the independent effects of pregnancy planning and smoking during pregnancy on neonatal outcome.\n## METHODS\nThis analysis made use of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. The study sample consisted of 18,178 singleton babies born in UK between 2000 and 2001. The neonatal outcomes of interest were low birthweight (<2.5 Kg) and pre-term birth (<37 completed weeks gestation). Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between pregnancy planning and/or smoking and neonatal outcome. Adjusted odds ratios were used to calculate population attributable risk fractions (PAFs).\n## RESULTS\n43% of mothers did not plan their pregnancy and 34% were smoking just before and/or during pregnancy. Planners were half as likely to be smokers just before pregnancy, and more likely to give up or reduce the amount smoked if smokers. Unplanned pregnancies had 24% increased odds of low birth weight and prematurity compared to planned pregnancies (AORLBW1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; AORPREM1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), independent of smoking status. The odds of low birth weight for babies of mothers who were smoking just before pregnancy was 91% higher than that of mothers who were not (AORLBW1.91, 95% CI 1.56-2.34). Women who quit or reduced the amount smoked during pregnancy lowered the risk of a low birth weight baby by one third (AORLBW0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85) compared with women whose smoking level did not change. Smaller effects were found for prematurity. If all women planned their pregnancy and did not smoke before or during pregnancy, 30% of low birthweight and 14% of prematurity could, in theory, be avoided.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPlanning a pregnancy and avoiding smoking during pregnancy has clear, independent, health benefits for babies.

Data from the 2004-2008 Oklahoma Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey and The Oklahoma Toddler Survey 2006-2010 were used to examine associations between a four category measure of pregnancy intentions (intended, mistimed <2 years, mistimed \u22652 years, unwanted) and maternal behaviors and child health outcomes up to age two. Propensity score methods were used to control for confounding. Births mistimed by two or more years (OR .58) and unwanted births (OR .33) had significantly lower odds than intended births of having a mother who recognized the pregnancy within the first 8 weeks; they were also about half as likely as intended births to receive early prenatal care, and had significantly higher likelihoods of exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Breastfeeding was significantly less likely among unwanted births (OR .68); breastfeeding for at least 6 months was significantly less likely among seriously mistimed births (OR .70). We find little association between intention status and early childhood measures. Measured associations of intention status on health behaviors and outcomes were most evident in the prenatal period, limited in the immediate prenatal period, and mostly insignificant by age two. In addition, most of the negative associations between intention status and health outcomes were concentrated among women with births mistimed by two or more years or unwanted births.

The sample included mothers who delivered a live birth in Colorado, New York State, and North Carolina from 1996 (New York only) to 1999. We assessed risk factors for self-reports of being very depressed in the months after delivery using logistic regression.\n## RESULTS\nOverall, 5.9% (95% CI = 5.3, 6.4) of new mothers reported being very depressed in the months after delivery. Women who reported that their pregnancy was a \"very hard time\" or \"one of the worst times of my life\" had the highest prevalence of reporting being very depressed in the months after delivery (24.9%, 95% CI = 21.3, 28.5) and, when all risk factors were adjusted for simultaneously, were 4.6 times (95% CI = 3.1, 6.3) more likely to report being very depressed in the months after delivery than other women.

This study investigated whether race/ethnicity, age, finances, and partnership status were associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms.\n## SETTING\n1662 participants in Project Viva, a US cohort study.\n## DESIGN\nMothers indicated mid-pregnancy and six month postpartum depressive symptoms on the Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS). Associations of sociodemographic factors with odds of scoring >12 on the EPDS were estimated.\n## MAIN RESULTS\nThe prevalence of depressive symptoms was 9% at mid-pregnancy and 8% postpartum. Black and Hispanic mothers had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms compared with non-Hispanic white mothers. These associations were explained by lower income, financial hardship, and higher incidence of poor pregnancy outcome among minority women. Young maternal age was associated with greater risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms, largely attributable to the prevalence of financial hardship, unwanted pregnancy, and lack of a partner. The strongest risk factor for antenatal depressive symptoms was a history of depression (OR = 4.07; 95% CI 3.76, 4.40), and the strongest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms was depressive symptoms during pregnancy (6.78; 4.07, 11.31) or a history of depression before pregnancy (3.82; 2.31, 6.31).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFinancial hardship and unwanted pregnancy are associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms. Women with a history of depression and those with poor pregnancy outcomes are especially vulnerable to depressive symptoms during the childbearing year.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed associations between pregnancy intentions or level of happiness about being pregnant and multiple psychosocial and behavioral risk factors, and identified correlates of happiness to be pregnant.\n## RESULTS\nPregnancy intentions and happiness were strongly associated, but happiness was the better predictor of risk. Unhappy women had higher odds than happy women of smoking, being depressed, experiencing intimate partner violence, drinking and using illicit drugs (odds ratios, 1.7-2.6). The odds of being happy were reduced among women who had other children or a child younger than two, who were single or did not have a current partner, who had had more than one sexual partner in the past year and who reported that the baby's father did not want the pregnancy (0.3-0.6).

Psychosocial correlates were obtained through prenatal surveys; electronic medical records were used to ascertain maternal health and pregnancy outcomes.\n## RESULTS\nSixty-two percent of the women indicated an unintended pregnancy, with 44% (578) mistimed and 18% (245) unwanted. Only 38% of the pregnancies were characterized as wanted. Women with unwanted and with mistimed pregnancies were similar demographically, but they differed significantly on psychosocial profiles and maternal characteristics. Women with mistimed and with wanted pregnancies differed in demographics and psychosocial profiles. Wanted pregnancies had the healthiest, mistimed an intermediate, and unwanted the poorest psychosocial profile. Women with unwanted pregnancies had the highest depression, perceived stress, and negative paternal support scores (p<0.05) and the lowest self-efficacy, social support, and positive paternal support scores (p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, women with riskier psychosocial profiles had higher odds of being in the unwanted category. Controlling for psychosocial and demographic variables, perceived stress and positive paternal support remained significant predictors of belonging to the unwanted and mistimed groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFully characterizing pregnancy intention and its relationship to psychosocial profiles may provide a basis for identifying women with highest risk during pregnancy and early motherhood. Women with unwanted and mistimed pregnancies may appear similar demographically but are different psychosocially. Women with unwanted pregnancies have multiple risk factors and would benefit from targeted interventions.",

Adopting a staged approach to the analysis, the study investigates whether pregnancy intention influences maternal health behaviours during pregnancy independent of background characteristics, and whether pregnancy intention carries any additional risk for adverse infant and maternal health outcomes when we adjust for background characteristics and prenatal behaviours.\n## RESULTS\nThe study confirmed that sociodemographic factors are strongly associated with unintended pregnancy and that unintended pregnancy is associated with a range of health compromising behaviours that are known to be harmful to the developing fetus. While there was little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention was associated with adverse neonatal outcomes or developmental delay independent of other covariates, there was strong evidence that intention status had a bearing on the mother's psychosocial health. Unintended pregnancy was associated with increased risk of depression (risk ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 1.19, 1.54]), and higher parenting stress (risk ratio 1.27 [95% confidence interval 1.16, 1.38]).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAscertaining the mother's pregnancy intention during the first antenatal visit may represent a means for monitoring those at greatest risk for adverse mother and child outcomes.",

A subset of birth records from the New York Statewide Perinatal Data System (n = 19,219) was used in this secondary analysis of cross-sectional data. Univariate and multivariate multinomial regression was used to identify factors that are independently associated with four self-reported levels of prenatal depression symptoms. Women with unintended pregnancies were more likely (AOR, 95 % CI) to report severe (3.6, 2.6-5.1) or moderate (2.0, 1.6-2.5) prenatal depression symptoms and less likely to report no symptoms, compared to women with intended pregnancies.

Multicollinearity in the adjusted model was evaluated using variance inflation factors. Sampling weights were used to account for PRAMS' complex sampling design.Of the 110,231 mothers included in the sample, only 32.3% reported desiring the pregnancy at the time of conception. Women with pregnancies categorized as mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, or unwanted were 20% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u200a=\u200a1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.3), 30% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4), and 50% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.7) more likely to experience symptoms of PPD, respectively, compared to women with desired pregnancies. Other factors found to be associated with experiencing symptoms of PPD were a gestational age of <27 weeks (AOR\u200a=\u200a3.1; 95% CI: 2.5-4.0), having a previous history of depression (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.8; 95% CI: 1.6-2.0), and being abused during or before pregnancy (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-2.0).We found that women with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies were more likely to experience symptoms of PPD. Our findings support the current US Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for an integrated approach to screening for depression, aiding in the maximization of intervention and early referral for women at risk for PPD.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between unintended pregnancies and maternal mental health and timing of prenatal care among low-income women.\n## METHODS\nIn this cross-sectional study, 870 women, whom were participating in the First 1000\u2009Days program in three community health centers in the Boston area, were enrolled at their first prenatal visit from August 2016 - September 2017. We assessed pregnancy intention by self-report using the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. We used self-reported survey information and electronic health record data to assess the following outcomes: current stress, current depression, and timing of initial prenatal visit. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations and adjusted for sociodemographic factors.\n## RESULTS\nWomen were a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.1), and 39.2% reported that their pregnancy was unintended. 50.6% of women were Hispanic, 28.4% were White, 10.1% were Black, and 10.9% were other races. 78.9% of women reported an annual household income <$50,000. Overall, 26.7% of women reported current stress, 8.2% reported current depression, and 18.3% of women initiated prenatal care after their first trimester. In multivariable analyses, women with unintended pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing current stress (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.41), current depression (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.20), and initiation of prenatal care post-first trimester (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.74).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nUnintended pregnancies were associated with current stress and depression, and delayed prenatal care in this sample of low-income women suggesting the importance of identifying high-risk women and tailoring interventions to support women's needs.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03191591; Retrospectively registered on June 19, 2017).",

This study aimed to examine the effect of father involvement and IPV on the association between unintended pregnancy and PND. A sample of 1,083 pregnant women who attended antenatal clinic at selected hospitals in Hong Kong completed two surveys to report on their pregnancy intention, antenatal depression, PND, IPV during pregnancy, their partner's (i.e., father's) involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth, and perceived social support. Comparisons were made between women with unintended pregnancy and those with intended pregnancy, and the effects of unintended pregnancy, father involvement, IPV, and other factors on maternal PND were examined. Results show that women with unintended pregnancy were more likely to report PND, IPV, fear, postnatal stress, lower degree of father involvement, and lower level of social support. Unintended pregnancy independently increased the risk of PND by 1.95 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.15, 3.28]), after adjustment for all other variables. When father involvement was included in the regression model, the negative effects of IPV and the related fear on PND became nonsignificant.

We find that pregnancy timing is related to maternal experience during pregnancy, but not to infant outcomes at birth-both of which are consistent with prior research. In an addition to the literature, we show that pregnancy timing is relevant for a number of maternal outcomes, such as the onset of depression and intimate partner violence, changes in smoking behavior, and receipt of medical care.

In this study, we evaluate how different dimensions of pregnancy intentions (pregnancy planning and pregnancy acceptance) relate to two maternal depressive symptoms and perceived psychological distress.\n## METHODS\nThis study draws from a cross-sectional national survey conducted in all maternities in France over a one-week period in 2016. All mothers 18\u2009years and older who had a live birth during the study period were invited to participate. After excluding women who underwent infertility treatment, our analytical sample included 10,339 women. We first described levels and correlates of pregnancy planning and acceptance, defined in four categories; planned/welcomed, unplanned/welcomed, planned/unwelcomed, unplanned/unwelcomed. We then assessed the bivariate and multivariate associations between pregnancy planning and acceptance and two outcomes: women's self-perceived psychological health and the presence of two depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We used multivariate logistic regressions to evaluate these associations, after adjusting for socio-demographic and medical factors.\n## RESULTS\nAltogether 7.5 to 24.1% of mothers perceived their psychological health during pregnancy was poor, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories and 10.3 to 22.4% indicated feelings of sadness and loss of interest during pregnancy, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories. As compared to women with planned/welcomed pregnancies, the odds of perceived poor psychological health and depressive symptoms were 2.55 times (CI 2.20-2.95) and 1.75 times higher (CI 1.51-2.02), respectively, among unplanned/unwelcomed pregnancies and 2.02 (CI 1.61-2.53) and 2.07 (CI 1.7-2.5) higher, among planned/unwelcomed pregnancies. Among women with unplanned pregnancies, we also found higher odds of perceived poor psychological health among women whose pregnancy was unwelcomed while the odds of depressive symptoms were not different by pregnancy planning status among women with unwelcomed pregnancies.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings consolidate previous reports of the association between pregnancy intentions and maternal psychological distress, while further specifying the relationship, which mostly depends on the acceptance of pregnancy timing rather than on pregnancy planning. Identifying women with low pregnancy acceptance can potentially enhance current medical practice by improving early detection of maternal depression.",

A cross-sectional interview measuring pregnancy intent, IPV, and acculturation, using the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II), was conducted among Latina women in their 2(nd) or 3(rd) trimester of pregnancy at clinics in Los Angeles (n = 313). Overall, 44% of women reported an unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of physical (any) and emotional (only) abuse 12 months before pregnancy was 11% and 22%, respectively. Although both types of IPV decreased during pregnancy (10% and 19%, respectively), most reports of physical IPV during pregnancy (53%) were among women who did not report physical abuse before pregnancy. After adjusting for other factors, physical IPV before pregnancy was not associated with unintended pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.40, 2.16). The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was highest (76%) among highly acculturated Latinas. However, when an unintended pregnancy occurred among less acculturated Latinas, who comprised the majority of the sample (n = 270), it was associated with greater risk of physical IPV during pregnancy (unadjusted OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.06, 6.23); although the confidence interval included one after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 0.98, 7.92). An unintended pregnancy may have a unique impact on relationships in the context of Latino culture, where family and pregnancy are highly valued. Pregnancy often creates an opportunity for providers to discuss issues related to abuse and family planning with women who do not regularly access care.

Unintended pregnancies are associated with increased health risks, also for women for whom pregnancy continues to childbirth. Our objective was to present the prevalence of unintended pregnancy in six European countries among pregnant women attending routine antenatal care, and to investigate the association with a history of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.\n## METHODS\nA prospective cross-sectional study, of 7102 pregnant women who filled out a questionnaire during pregnancy as part of a multi-country cohort study (Bidens) with the participating countries: Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway and Sweden. A validated instrument, the Norvold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAq) consisting of 10 descriptive questions measured abuse. Pregnancy intendedness was assessed using a single question asking women if this pregnancy was planned. Cross-tabulation, Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression analysis were used.\n## RESULTS\nApproximately one-fifth (19.2 %) of all women reported their current pregnancy to be unintended. Women with an unintended pregnancy were significantly younger, had less education, suffered economic hardship, had a different ethnic background from the regional majority and more frequently were not living with their partner. The prevalence of an unintended pregnancy among women reporting any lifetime abuse was 24.5 %, and 38.5 % among women reporting recent abuse. Women with a history of any lifetime abuse had significantly higher odds of unintended pregnancy, also after adjusting for confounding factors, AOR for any lifetime abuse 1.41 (95 % CI 1.23-1.60) and for recent abuse AOR 2.03 (95 % CI 1.54-2.68).\n## CONCLUSION\nWomen who have experienced any lifetime abuse are significantly more likely to have an unintended pregnancy.

This study examined whether risk factors for physical IPV victimization during pregnancy (a pregnancy that was not planned and prenatal substance use) differed for women with versus without early childhood victimization. Participants were 236 ethnically diverse, low-income biological mothers ( M = 30.94 years; 50.0% Latina, 16.9% Caucasian, 13.1% African American, and 16.9% multiracial) of children aged 0 to 6 years. Mothers were classified into four groups based on whether they had experienced early childhood victimization and physical IPV victimization during pregnancy with the target child. Multinomial logistic regressions, controlling for demographic characteristics, examined whether a pregnancy not planned and prenatal substance use predicted group membership. Compared to mothers with early victimization only, mothers with both early childhood victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy were more than 3 times as likely to report that their pregnancy with the target child was not planned. In follow-up analyses, mothers with early victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy also reported higher lifetime parity than mothers with physical IPV during pregnancy but no early victimization.

Results from our study indicate that unwanted pregnancy is associated with prenatal and postpartum maternal behaviors that adversely affect infant and child health, but that unwanted pregnancy has little association with birth weight and child cognitive outcomes. Estimates of the association between unwanted pregnancy and maternal behaviors were greatly reduced after controls for unmeasured family background were included in the model.

Despite the large number of these births, little is known about the outcomes of unintended pregnancies. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the association between intendedness of pregnancy and preterm birth in a large prospective cohort of women who reported for prenatal care. Pregnant, black, low-income women were enrolled into this study at four hospital-based prenatal care clinics and one off-site hospital-affiliated prenatal clinic in Baltimore City. A self-administered questionnaire to assess demographic and psychosocial data was completed by each woman in the cohort at the time of enrolment in the study. The questionnaire contained an item to measure intendedness of the pregnancy. A total of 922 women comprised the final sample for analysis. For the analyses, intendedness was dichotomised as: intended (wanted now or sooner) vs. unintended (mistimed, unwanted or unsure). Overall, 13.7% of all births to women in the sample were preterm. In a logistic regression model, after controlling for potential confounding by clinical and behavioural predictors of preterm delivery, unintended pregnancy was significantly associated with preterm delivery (adjusted RR = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [1.08,3.08], P = 0.026). In this study of a cohort of urban, clinic-attending, low-income, pregnant black women, unintended pregnancy had a statistically significant association with preterm birth. After adjustment for behavioural and clinical risks, women with unintended pregnancies had almost twice the risk of a preterm delivery as women with intended pregnancies.",

For racial and ethnic groups in which an association was found, sequential logistic regression was conducted to further examine the relationship while controlling for socioeconomic characteristics.\n## RESULTS\nIn unadjusted results, pregnancy intention was associated with preterm birth among both whites and immigrant Latinas, but not among blacks or U.S.-born Latinas.

Among immigrant Latinas, those who reported being unsure about their pregnancy were at higher risk of preterm birth than were those who reported an intended pregnancy (1.6).

Data are drawn from the first wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Birth Cohort, a representative study of births in 2001. The sample is composed of parents residing together with their biological child at the time the child is 9 months old, where both the mother and father completed the self-report interview (N = 5,788). Couple-level multivariate logistic regression models, weighted to account for the complex sampling design, were used in the analysis. Risk of inadequate prenatal care and preterm birth was increased when partners did not share intentions or when neither partner intended the pregnancy. Couples were at additional risk of inadequate prenatal care when the pregnancy was conceived nonmaritally and when the mother did not tell the father about the pregnancy, particularly when neither partner intended the pregnancy. The risk of premature birth was particularly high when the partners were unmarried and either or both did not intend the pregnancy.

We evaluate a multi-dimensional measure of pregnancy intention among pregnant adolescents and quantify the association between intention dimensions and adverse outcomes and risk behaviors. Pregnancy intention measures were examined in a cohort of 300 pregnant adolescent women. We considered 18 items assessing elements of pregnancy intention including pregnancy planning, timing, emotional response, and readiness. Latent class analysis was performed to identify dimensions of pregnancy intention. Parsimonious scores were created by minimizing the number of covariates while maintaining substantial agreement with the latent class. Associations between intention measures and prenatal care, risk behaviors, and pregnancy outcomes were quantified using multivariable logistic regression. Two constructs of pregnancy intention were identified: planning and emotional readiness. Compared with emotionally ready adolescents, adolescents categorized as not emotionally ready had an increased odds of inadequate prenatal care (OR = 2.70, 95% CI:1.27-5.72), delayed prenatal care (OR = 2.54, 95% CI:1.27-5.09), and self-reported depression at the time of the first prenatal visit (OR = 2.21, 95% CI:1.03-4.77).

Smoking during pregnancy has been well-researched and there is clear evidence of harm. But there has been little research on the health impact of planning for pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the independent effects of pregnancy planning and smoking during pregnancy on neonatal outcome.\n## METHODS\nThis analysis made use of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. The study sample consisted of 18,178 singleton babies born in UK between 2000 and 2001. The neonatal outcomes of interest were low birthweight (<2.5 Kg) and pre-term birth (<37 completed weeks gestation). Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between pregnancy planning and/or smoking and neonatal outcome. Adjusted odds ratios were used to calculate population attributable risk fractions (PAFs).\n## RESULTS\n43% of mothers did not plan their pregnancy and 34% were smoking just before and/or during pregnancy. Planners were half as likely to be smokers just before pregnancy, and more likely to give up or reduce the amount smoked if smokers. Unplanned pregnancies had 24% increased odds of low birth weight and prematurity compared to planned pregnancies (AORLBW1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; AORPREM1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), independent of smoking status. The odds of low birth weight for babies of mothers who were smoking just before pregnancy was 91% higher than that of mothers who were not (AORLBW1.91, 95% CI 1.56-2.34). Women who quit or reduced the amount smoked during pregnancy lowered the risk of a low birth weight baby by one third (AORLBW0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85) compared with women whose smoking level did not change. Smaller effects were found for prematurity. If all women planned their pregnancy and did not smoke before or during pregnancy, 30% of low birthweight and 14% of prematurity could, in theory, be avoided.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPlanning a pregnancy and avoiding smoking during pregnancy has clear, independent, health benefits for babies. Quitting or reducing the amount smoked during pregnancy can reduce the risk of low birthweight.",

Propensity score methods were used to control for confounding. Births mistimed by two or more years (OR .58) and unwanted births (OR .33) had significantly lower odds than intended births of having a mother who recognized the pregnancy within the first 8 weeks; they were also about half as likely as intended births to receive early prenatal care, and had significantly higher likelihoods of exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Breastfeeding was significantly less likely among unwanted births (OR .68); breastfeeding for at least 6 months was significantly less likely among seriously mistimed births (OR .70). We find little association between intention status and early childhood measures. Measured associations of intention status on health behaviors and outcomes were most evident in the prenatal period, limited in the immediate prenatal period, and mostly insignificant by age two.

Other independent factors included poor emotional support, a past history of depression, unplanned pregnancy and perceived potential conflicts with relatives over childcare antenatally and dissatisfaction, poor instrumental support postnatally. The prevalence of depression antenatally and postnatally was 12.2% and 6.8%, respectively.\n## LIMITATIONS\nMeasures of satisfaction with social support were based on self-report; there were high dropout rates at six weeks' postpartum; and other modulating social factors such as pre-existing interpersonal conflicts were not studied.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPerinatal depression in Singaporean women is common. Contrary to expectations, a negative 'confinement' experience is a significant risk factor for postnatal depression, and is not universally welcomed by women. Depression is modulated by dissimilar sets of psychosocial factors antenatally and postnatally.",

This study investigated whether race/ethnicity, age, finances, and partnership status were associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms.\n## SETTING\n1662 participants in Project Viva, a US cohort study.\n## DESIGN\nMothers indicated mid-pregnancy and six month postpartum depressive symptoms on the Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS). Associations of sociodemographic factors with odds of scoring >12 on the EPDS were estimated.\n## MAIN RESULTS\nThe prevalence of depressive symptoms was 9% at mid-pregnancy and 8% postpartum. Black and Hispanic mothers had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms compared with non-Hispanic white mothers. These associations were explained by lower income, financial hardship, and higher incidence of poor pregnancy outcome among minority women. Young maternal age was associated with greater risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms, largely attributable to the prevalence of financial hardship, unwanted pregnancy, and lack of a partner. The strongest risk factor for antenatal depressive symptoms was a history of depression (OR = 4.07; 95% CI 3.76, 4.40), and the strongest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms was depressive symptoms during pregnancy (6.78; 4.07, 11.31) or a history of depression before pregnancy (3.82; 2.31, 6.31).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFinancial hardship and unwanted pregnancy are associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms. Women with a history of depression and those with poor pregnancy outcomes are especially vulnerable to depressive symptoms during the childbearing year. Once these factors are taken in account, minority mothers have the same risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms as white mothers.",

Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed associations between pregnancy intentions or level of happiness about being pregnant and multiple psychosocial and behavioral risk factors, and identified correlates of happiness to be pregnant.\n## RESULTS\nPregnancy intentions and happiness were strongly associated, but happiness was the better predictor of risk. Unhappy women had higher odds than happy women of smoking, being depressed, experiencing intimate partner violence, drinking and using illicit drugs (odds ratios, 1.7-2.6). The odds of being happy were reduced among women who had other children or a child younger than two, who were single or did not have a current partner, who had had more than one sexual partner in the past year and who reported that the baby's father did not want the pregnancy (0.3-0.6).

Data collection was carried out by means of a self-reported questionnaire. The outcome variable was depression during the third trimester of pregnancy measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.

The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated by fitting a logistic regression model.\n## RESULTS\nThe prevalence of pregnancy depression was higher among women (10.3%) than men (6.5%). In both sexes, the probability of depression during pregnancy was higher in those with marital dissatisfaction (aOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.59 to 5.82 for women and 3.14, 95% CI 1.24 to 7.99 for men) and among those whose with a previous history of depression (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.89 for women and 5.22, 95% CI 2.05 to 13.34 for men).

Only 38% of the pregnancies were characterized as wanted. Women with unwanted and with mistimed pregnancies were similar demographically, but they differed significantly on psychosocial profiles and maternal characteristics.

Adopting a staged approach to the analysis, the study investigates whether pregnancy intention influences maternal health behaviours during pregnancy independent of background characteristics, and whether pregnancy intention carries any additional risk for adverse infant and maternal health outcomes when we adjust for background characteristics and prenatal behaviours.\n## RESULTS\nThe study confirmed that sociodemographic factors are strongly associated with unintended pregnancy and that unintended pregnancy is associated with a range of health compromising behaviours that are known to be harmful to the developing fetus. While there was little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention was associated with adverse neonatal outcomes or developmental delay independent of other covariates, there was strong evidence that intention status had a bearing on the mother's psychosocial health. Unintended pregnancy was associated with increased risk of depression (risk ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 1.19, 1.54]), and higher parenting stress (risk ratio 1.27 [95% confidence interval 1.16, 1.38]).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAscertaining the mother's pregnancy intention during the first antenatal visit may represent a means for monitoring those at greatest risk for adverse mother and child outcomes.",

Risk factors identified include a history of depression, multiparity, and young age.

Prespecified sociodemographic and clinical variables were tabulated against the incidence of antenatal depression and postnatal depression. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of the principal underlying variables.\n## RESULTS\nRisk factors for antenatal depression were multiparity, black and minority ethnic (BME) status, physical or mental health problems, living in a deprived area, and unplanned pregnancy. Different factors for postnatal depression were evident among women who had experienced antenatal depression: multiparity and BME status were protective, whereas being left alone in labor and experiencing poor postnatal health increased the risk of postnatal depression.\n## CONCLUSION\nThis study confirms previous research on risk factors for antenatal depression and stresses the importance of continuous support in labor and vigilance in the postnatal period regarding the potential ill effects of continuing postnatal health problems.",

A subset of birth records from the New York Statewide Perinatal Data System (n = 19,219) was used in this secondary analysis of cross-sectional data. Univariate and multivariate multinomial regression was used to identify factors that are independently associated with four self-reported levels of prenatal depression symptoms. Women with unintended pregnancies were more likely (AOR, 95 % CI) to report severe (3.6, 2.6-5.1) or moderate (2.0, 1.6-2.5) prenatal depression symptoms and less likely to report no symptoms, compared to women with intended pregnancies. Likewise, women with mistimed pregnancies were more likely to report severe (2.7, 2.2-3.5) or moderate (1.7, 1.5-2.1) prenatal depression symptoms than no symptoms, compared to women with intended pregnancies. Low education, drug use, smoking, minority race, being unmarried and having Medicaid insurance were also significant, independent predictors of PD symptoms.

Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured in the second and third trimesters using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, respectively. On the basis of the timing and persistence of symptoms, the following three mutually exclusive subgroups for each anxiety and depressive symptoms were created: never symptomatic, symptomatic only in the second trimester, and symptomatic at both time points. Separate logistic regression models were used to derive risk factors for each subgroup.\n## FINDINGS\nwomen with chronic anxiety or depressive symptoms were distinguished from those with transient symptoms or no symptoms by their optimism scores, in which less optimistic pregnant women had a four-fold increased risk for developing chronic depressive or anxiety symptoms compared with more optimistic women (AOR varied from 4.30 to 4.93). Additionally, high perceived stress, low social support, history of mental health issues were common predictors of chronic anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnancy. Partner tension was the exclusive predictor of anxiety symptoms (AOR varied from 1.94 to 2.31) and poor physical health (AOR 2.54; 95% CI 1.32-4.89), unplanned pregnancy (AOR 3.05; 95% CI 1.61-5.79), and infertility treatments (AOR 4.98; 95% CI 1.85-13.39) were unique predictors of chronic depressive symptoms.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nknowledge of the risk factors of chronic poor mental health during pregnancy might inform the development of effective strategies within the limited resources of health-care systems to target populations with greater needs for interventions.",

Unintended pregnancies, reaching close to 50% of the pregnancies in the United States, have become a major health concern. While many physiologic and psychosocial causes have been analyzed, few studies have examined the relationship between unintended pregnancy and symptoms of PPD.A cross-sectional study was conducted using surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 2009 to 2011. The PRAMS population-based random sample included women who have had recent live births and is representative of 78% of the United States population. The chi-squared test was used to examine bivariate associations. Binary logistic regression was utilized to study unadjusted and adjusted associations between PPD and pregnancy intendedness, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers in the sample. Multicollinearity in the adjusted model was evaluated using variance inflation factors. Sampling weights were used to account for PRAMS' complex sampling design.Of the 110,231 mothers included in the sample, only 32.3% reported desiring the pregnancy at the time of conception. Women with pregnancies categorized as mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, or unwanted were 20% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u200a=\u200a1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.3), 30% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4), and 50% (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.7) more likely to experience symptoms of PPD, respectively, compared to women with desired pregnancies. Other factors found to be associated with experiencing symptoms of PPD were a gestational age of <27 weeks (AOR\u200a=\u200a3.1; 95% CI: 2.5-4.0), having a previous history of depression (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.8; 95% CI: 1.6-2.0), and being abused during or before pregnancy (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-2.0).We found that women with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies were more likely to experience symptoms of PPD.

A sample of 1,083 pregnant women who attended antenatal clinic at selected hospitals in Hong Kong completed two surveys to report on their pregnancy intention, antenatal depression, PND, IPV during pregnancy, their partner's (i.e., father's) involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth, and perceived social support. Comparisons were made between women with unintended pregnancy and those with intended pregnancy, and the effects of unintended pregnancy, father involvement, IPV, and other factors on maternal PND were examined. Results show that women with unintended pregnancy were more likely to report PND, IPV, fear, postnatal stress, lower degree of father involvement, and lower level of social support. Unintended pregnancy independently increased the risk of PND by 1.95 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.15, 3.28]), after adjustment for all other variables.

In this research note, we examine these relationships using recent large-scale data and inverse propensity weights estimated from generalized boosted models. We find that pregnancy timing is related to maternal experience during pregnancy, but not to infant outcomes at birth-both of which are consistent with prior research. In an addition to the literature, we show that pregnancy timing is relevant for a number of maternal outcomes, such as the onset of depression and intimate partner violence, changes in smoking behavior, and receipt of medical care. These findings suggest that policy intended to improve infant welfare by preventing unintended pregnancies has little empirical support, but that policy focused on increasing reproductive autonomy and maternal well-being has the potential to improve outcomes.",

In this study, we evaluate how different dimensions of pregnancy intentions (pregnancy planning and pregnancy acceptance) relate to two maternal depressive symptoms and perceived psychological distress.\n## METHODS\nThis study draws from a cross-sectional national survey conducted in all maternities in France over a one-week period in 2016. All mothers 18\u2009years and older who had a live birth during the study period were invited to participate. After excluding women who underwent infertility treatment, our analytical sample included 10,339 women. We first described levels and correlates of pregnancy planning and acceptance, defined in four categories; planned/welcomed, unplanned/welcomed, planned/unwelcomed, unplanned/unwelcomed. We then assessed the bivariate and multivariate associations between pregnancy planning and acceptance and two outcomes: women's self-perceived psychological health and the presence of two depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We used multivariate logistic regressions to evaluate these associations, after adjusting for socio-demographic and medical factors.\n## RESULTS\nAltogether 7.5 to 24.1% of mothers perceived their psychological health during pregnancy was poor, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories and 10.3 to 22.4% indicated feelings of sadness and loss of interest during pregnancy, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories. As compared to women with planned/welcomed pregnancies, the odds of perceived poor psychological health and depressive symptoms were 2.55 times (CI 2.20-2.95) and 1.75 times higher (CI 1.51-2.02), respectively, among unplanned/unwelcomed pregnancies and 2.02 (CI 1.61-2.53) and 2.07 (CI 1.7-2.5) higher, among planned/unwelcomed pregnancies. Among women with unplanned pregnancies, we also found higher odds of perceived poor psychological health among women whose pregnancy was unwelcomed while the odds of depressive symptoms were not different by pregnancy planning status among women with unwelcomed pregnancies.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings consolidate previous reports of the association between pregnancy intentions and maternal psychological distress, while further specifying the relationship, which mostly depends on the acceptance of pregnancy timing rather than on pregnancy planning. Identifying women with low pregnancy acceptance can potentially enhance current medical practice by improving early detection of maternal depression.",

Higher rates of abuse were reported by women who were younger, Black, unmarried, less educated, on Medicaid, living in crowded conditions, entering prenatal care late, or smoking during the third trimester.

A cross-sectional interview measuring pregnancy intent, IPV, and acculturation, using the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II), was conducted among Latina women in their 2(nd) or 3(rd) trimester of pregnancy at clinics in Los Angeles (n = 313). Overall, 44% of women reported an unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of physical (any) and emotional (only) abuse 12 months before pregnancy was 11% and 22%, respectively. Although both types of IPV decreased during pregnancy (10% and 19%, respectively), most reports of physical IPV during pregnancy (53%) were among women who did not report physical abuse before pregnancy. After adjusting for other factors, physical IPV before pregnancy was not associated with unintended pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.40, 2.16). The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was highest (76%) among highly acculturated Latinas. However, when an unintended pregnancy occurred among less acculturated Latinas, who comprised the majority of the sample (n = 270), it was associated with greater risk of physical IPV during pregnancy (unadjusted OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.06, 6.23); although the confidence interval included one after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 0.98, 7.92). An unintended pregnancy may have a unique impact on relationships in the context of Latino culture, where family and pregnancy are highly valued. Pregnancy often creates an opportunity for providers to discuss issues related to abuse and family planning with women who do not regularly access care. The results from this study may be used to increase the cultural sensitivity with which violence and reproductive health are addressed among the diverse population of Latinas when they connect with prenatal services.",

Unintended pregnancies are associated with increased health risks, also for women for whom pregnancy continues to childbirth. Our objective was to present the prevalence of unintended pregnancy in six European countries among pregnant women attending routine antenatal care, and to investigate the association with a history of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.\n## METHODS\nA prospective cross-sectional study, of 7102 pregnant women who filled out a questionnaire during pregnancy as part of a multi-country cohort study (Bidens) with the participating countries: Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway and Sweden. A validated instrument, the Norvold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAq) consisting of 10 descriptive questions measured abuse. Pregnancy intendedness was assessed using a single question asking women if this pregnancy was planned. Cross-tabulation, Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression analysis were used.\n## RESULTS\nApproximately one-fifth (19.2 %) of all women reported their current pregnancy to be unintended. Women with an unintended pregnancy were significantly younger, had less education, suffered economic hardship, had a different ethnic background from the regional majority and more frequently were not living with their partner. The prevalence of an unintended pregnancy among women reporting any lifetime abuse was 24.5 %, and 38.5 % among women reporting recent abuse. Women with a history of any lifetime abuse had significantly higher odds of unintended pregnancy, also after adjusting for confounding factors, AOR for any lifetime abuse 1.41 (95 % CI 1.23-1.60) and for recent abuse AOR 2.03 (95 % CI 1.54-2.68).\n## CONCLUSION\nWomen who have experienced any lifetime abuse are significantly more likely to have an unintended pregnancy. This is particularly true for women reporting recent abuse, suggesting that women living in a violent relationship have less control over their fertility.",

This study examined whether risk factors for physical IPV victimization during pregnancy (a pregnancy that was not planned and prenatal substance use) differed for women with versus without early childhood victimization. Participants were 236 ethnically diverse, low-income biological mothers ( M = 30.94 years; 50.0% Latina, 16.9% Caucasian, 13.1% African American, and 16.9% multiracial) of children aged 0 to 6 years. Mothers were classified into four groups based on whether they had experienced early childhood victimization and physical IPV victimization during pregnancy with the target child. Multinomial logistic regressions, controlling for demographic characteristics, examined whether a pregnancy not planned and prenatal substance use predicted group membership. Compared to mothers with early victimization only, mothers with both early childhood victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy were more than 3 times as likely to report that their pregnancy with the target child was not planned. In follow-up analyses, mothers with early victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy also reported higher lifetime parity than mothers with physical IPV during pregnancy but no early victimization.

Among immigrant Latinas, those who reported being unsure about their pregnancy were at higher risk of preterm birth than were those who reported an intended pregnancy (1.6). After adjustment for socioeconomic factors, the association remained significant for immigrant Latinas who were unsure about their pregnancy (1.5), but none of the associations remained significant for whites.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWomen's interpretations of questions about pregnancy intention and their social experiences regarding pregnancy intention may vary by race or ethnicity. Studies on the association between pregnancy intention and preterm birth may need to be group-specific.",

This study investigates the association of early prenatal care, preterm birth, and low birth weight with the couple relationship context, including partners' joint intentions for the pregnancy, their marital status at conception, and the presence of relationship problems during pregnancy. Data are drawn from the first wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Birth Cohort, a representative study of births in 2001. The sample is composed of parents residing together with their biological child at the time the child is 9 months old, where both the mother and father completed the self-report interview (N = 5,788). Couple-level multivariate logistic regression models, weighted to account for the complex sampling design, were used in the analysis. Risk of inadequate prenatal care and preterm birth was increased when partners did not share intentions or when neither partner intended the pregnancy. Couples were at additional risk of inadequate prenatal care when the pregnancy was conceived nonmaritally and when the mother did not tell the father about the pregnancy, particularly when neither partner intended the pregnancy. The risk of premature birth was particularly high when the partners were unmarried and either or both did not intend the pregnancy. The couple context of pregnancy is important for a healthy pregnancy and birth. When the partner is present, practitioners and programs should maintain a focus on the couple, and researchers should make every effort to include the father's own perspective.",

We evaluate a multi-dimensional measure of pregnancy intention among pregnant adolescents and quantify the association between intention dimensions and adverse outcomes and risk behaviors. Pregnancy intention measures were examined in a cohort of 300 pregnant adolescent women. We considered 18 items assessing elements of pregnancy intention including pregnancy planning, timing, emotional response, and readiness. Latent class analysis was performed to identify dimensions of pregnancy intention. Parsimonious scores were created by minimizing the number of covariates while maintaining substantial agreement with the latent class. Associations between intention measures and prenatal care, risk behaviors, and pregnancy outcomes were quantified using multivariable logistic regression. Two constructs of pregnancy intention were identified: planning and emotional readiness. Compared with emotionally ready adolescents, adolescents categorized as not emotionally ready had an increased odds of inadequate prenatal care (OR = 2.70, 95% CI:1.27-5.72), delayed prenatal care (OR = 2.54, 95% CI:1.27-5.09), and self-reported depression at the time of the first prenatal visit (OR = 2.21, 95% CI:1.03-4.77). Pregnancy planning was not associated with adverse pregnancy risk factors or outcomes. Among pregnant adolescents, emotional readiness for pregnancy and parenting was inversely associated with known risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, suggesting that emotional readiness rather than pregnancy planning may be the more pertinent intention construct for adolescents.",

Smoking during pregnancy has been well-researched and there is clear evidence of harm. But there has been little research on the health impact of planning for pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the independent effects of pregnancy planning and smoking during pregnancy on neonatal outcome.\n## METHODS\nThis analysis made use of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. The study sample consisted of 18,178 singleton babies born in UK between 2000 and 2001. The neonatal outcomes of interest were low birthweight (<2.5 Kg) and pre-term birth (<37 completed weeks gestation). Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between pregnancy planning and/or smoking and neonatal outcome. Adjusted odds ratios were used to calculate population attributable risk fractions (PAFs).\n## RESULTS\n43% of mothers did not plan their pregnancy and 34% were smoking just before and/or during pregnancy. Planners were half as likely to be smokers just before pregnancy, and more likely to give up or reduce the amount smoked if smokers. Unplanned pregnancies had 24% increased odds of low birth weight and prematurity compared to planned pregnancies (AORLBW1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; AORPREM1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), independent of smoking status. The odds of low birth weight for babies of mothers who were smoking just before pregnancy was 91% higher than that of mothers who were not (AORLBW1.91, 95% CI 1.56-2.34). Women who quit or reduced the amount smoked during pregnancy lowered the risk of a low birth weight baby by one third (AORLBW0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85) compared with women whose smoking level did not change. Smaller effects were found for prematurity. If all women planned their pregnancy and did not smoke before or during pregnancy, 30% of low birthweight and 14% of prematurity could, in theory, be avoided.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPlanning a pregnancy and avoiding smoking during pregnancy has clear, independent, health benefits for babies. Quitting or reducing the amount smoked during pregnancy can reduce the risk of low birthweight.",

Propensity score methods were used to control for confounding. Births mistimed by two or more years (OR .58) and unwanted births (OR .33) had significantly lower odds than intended births of having a mother who recognized the pregnancy within the first 8 weeks; they were also about half as likely as intended births to receive early prenatal care, and had significantly higher likelihoods of exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Breastfeeding was significantly less likely among unwanted births (OR .68); breastfeeding for at least 6 months was significantly less likely among seriously mistimed births (OR .70). We find little association between intention status and early childhood measures. Measured associations of intention status on health behaviors and outcomes were most evident in the prenatal period, limited in the immediate prenatal period, and mostly insignificant by age two.

This cluster-randomized controlled implementation trial examines empowerment self-defense (ESD) for sexual assault risk reduction among school-age women in Malawi.\n## METHODS\nThe unit of randomization and analysis was the school (n\u2009=\u2009141). Intervention participants received a 12-h intervention over 6\u2009weeks, with refreshers. Primary outcomes were past-year prevalence and incident rate of sexual violence. Secondary outcomes included confidence, self-defense knowledge, and, for those victimized, violence disclosure. Interaction effects on outcomes were evaluated with Poisson models with school-correlated robust variance estimates for risk ratios and incident rate ratios (baseline n\u2009=\u20096644, follow-up n\u2009=\u20094278).\n## RESULTS\nPast-year sexual assault prevalence was reduced among intervention students (risk ratio [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.56, 0.82), but not control students (interaction effect p\u2009<\u20090.001).

The need for such interventions is especially great in South Africa, which has some of the highest rates of sexual assault in the world.\n## OBJECTIVES\nTo determine whether an HIV/sexually transmitted disease risk-reduction intervention that reduced sexual risk behavior and sexually transmitted disease prevalence also reduced the perpetration and experience of forced sex among South African adolescents.\n## DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nA cluster randomized clinical trial, at schools located in a township and a semirural area, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Matched pairs of schools were randomly selected (9 of 17); of 1118 students in sixth grade at these 18 schools who had parent or guardian consent, 1057 (94%) were enrolled, and those not reporting forced sex perpetration before the intervention were included in the analyses (n\u2009=\u20091052). Post hoc secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial was performed, with baseline and 3-, 6-, 12-, 42-, and 54-month postintervention assessments between October 4, 2004, and June 30, 2010. Generalized estimating equation Poisson regression analyses adjusting for gender and clustering within schools were conducted between August 23, 2017, and April 30, 2018. Recruiters and data collectors, but not intervention facilitators, were blind to the participants' intervention assignment.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nTheory-based, culturally adapted, 6-session HIV/sexually transmitted disease risk-reduction intervention (Let Us Protect Our Future intervention) and attention-matched, chronic disease prevention control intervention implemented by specially trained man and woman cofacilitators from the community.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nStudy outcomes for this secondary analysis (planned after the data were collected) are self-reports of perpetrating and experiencing forced vaginal intercourse.\n## RESULTS\nParticipants included 1052 adolescents (557 girls [53%]; mean [SD] age, 12.4 [1.2] years) reporting not perpetrating forced sex at baseline.

Despite broad calls for primary prevention, few programs with demonstrated effectiveness exist. This cluster-randomized trial examined the effectiveness of a DV perpetration prevention program targeting coaches and high school male athletes.\n## METHODS\nThe unit of randomization was the high school (16 schools), and the unit of analysis was the athlete (N = 2,006 students). Primary outcomes were intentions to intervene, recognition of abusive behaviors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary outcomes explored bystander behaviors and abuse perpetration. Regression models for clustered, longitudinal data assessed between-arm differences in over-time changes in mean levels of continuous outcomes in 1,798 athletes followed up at 3 months.\n## RESULTS\nIntervention athletes' changes in intentions to intervene were positive compared with control subjects, resulting in an estimated intervention effect of .12 (95% CI: .003, .24). Intervention athletes also reported higher levels of positive bystander intervention behavior than control subjects (.25, 95% CI: .13, .38). Changes in gender-equitable attitudes, recognition of abusive behaviors, and DV perpetration were not significant. Secondary analyses estimated intervention impacts according to intensity of program implementation. Compared with control subjects, athletes exposed to full-intensity implementation of the intervention demonstrated improvements in intentions to intervene (.16, 95% CI: .04, .27), recognition of abusive behaviors (.13, 95% CI: .003, .25), and positive bystander intervention (.28, 95% CI: .14, .41).\n## CONCLUSION\nThis cluster-randomized controlled trial supports the effectiveness of a school athletics-based prevention program as one promising strategy to reduce DV perpetration.",

Three-month (ie, time point 2 [T2]) and 9-month (ie, time point 3 [T3]) follow-ups were conducted. The trial took place in 20 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, neighborhoods and 1 centrally located site with concentrated disadvantage. Pittsburgh-based adolescent boys and young men (ages 13 to 19 years) were recruited between July 27, 2015, and June 5, 2017, through youth-serving organizations and community-based alternatives to residential placement for juvenile justice-involved youth. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted from June 2018 to November 2019.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nManhood 2.0, an international program adapted for adolescent boys and young men in US urban communities, encourages these individuals to challenge gender norms that foster violence against women and unhealthy sexual relationships. Individuals in the control population received job-readiness training. Each program was 18 hours.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was change in participant-level perpetration of sexual violence (SV) or adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) at T3.\n## RESULTS\nAmong 866 participants, 465 individuals (54%) enrolled in 11 intervention clusters and 401 individuals (46%) enrolled in 10 control clusters. In the intervention group, 325 participants (70%) were analyzed at T2 and 334 participants (72%) were analyzed at T3; in the control group, 262 participants (65%) were analyzed at T2 and 301 participants (75%) were analyzed at T3. Mean (SD) age was 15.5 (1.6) years; 609 participants (70%) self-identified as non-Hispanic Black, and 178 (20%) self-identified as Hispanic, multiracial, or other race/ethnicity other than White. Among individuals in the intervention group, 296 participants (64%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at baseline, and 173 participants (52%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at T3. Among individuals in the control group, 213 participants (53%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at baseline, and 124 participants (41%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at T3). The difference in reduction between groups was not significant. There was no evidence of an intervention effect for the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% CI, 0.86-2.01; P\u2009=\u2009.20).\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe findings from this evaluation of a community-based gender-transformative program for adolescent boys and young men did not show a significant intervention effect in reducing SV or ARA perpetration between Manhood 2.0 and a job-readiness control program. Combining gender-transformative approaches with job-readiness programs may be relevant for violence prevention in low-resource urban settings. Attention to improving implementation and strategies to sustain such community-based efforts are needed.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02427061.",

We conducted a group-randomized controlled trial of 10 middle schools from a large urban school district in Southeast Texas in 2014 to 2015. We used multilevel regression modeling; the final analytic sample comprised 709 sixth-grade students followed for 1 year.Results. Among the total sample, odds of DV perpetration were lower among intervention students than among control students (adjusted odds ratio = 0.46; 95% confidence interval = 0.28, 0.74). Odds of DV victimization were not significantly different. There were significant effects on some specific DV types.Conclusions. Me & You is effective in reducing DV perpetration and decreasing some forms of DV victimization in early middle-school ethnic-minority students.",

The current study's purpose was to test a one-session brief motivational interview-style intervention to decrease DA perpetration. We conducted a two-arm RCT of the Real Talk intervention with follow-up at 3 and 6\u00a0months. Participants were 172 youth ages 15-19\u00a0years old, recruited from the pediatric emergency department or outpatient care services of an urban hospital in the USA in 2014-2017. The primary outcome was change in self-reported DA perpetration, including subtypes of DA such as physical, sexual, psychological, and cyber DA. Youth in both intervention and control arms reduced DA perpetration over time. GEE models indicated no overall intervention effects for any, physical, sexual, or psychological DA. There were overall effects for cyber DA (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27, 0.87). There were also effects at 3\u00a0months for psychological DA (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06, 0.93) and cyber DA (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19, 0.79). Analyses stratified by gender also found overall effects for males for any DA (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07, 0.55), physical DA (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10, 0.89), and cyber DA (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01, 0.27). For males, intervention effects on any DA persisted to 6\u00a0months (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02, 1.01).

This study seeks to add to the literature by evaluating the effects of My Voice, My Choice (MVMC), a 90-minute assertive resistance training program that emphasizes skill practice in an immersive virtual environment (IVE). We hypothesized that MVMC would reduce male-to-female sexual victimization among adolescent girls over a 3-month follow-up period. We also examined whether these results would generalize to other forms of male-to-female relationship violence and to girls' psychological distress. Eighty-three female students from an urban public high school were randomized to MVMC (n=47) or to a wait-list control condition (n=36); 78 provided data over the 3-month follow-up period. Participants assigned to MVMC were less likely than control participants to report sexual victimization during the follow-up period. Our results also suggest that MVMC reduced risk for psychological victimization and for psychological distress among participants with greater prior victimization at baseline.

We investigated the efficacy of a life skills and safe spaces programme to reduce adolescent girls' experiences of interpersonal violence in a refugee setting.\n## METHODS\nIn this two-arm, single-blinded, cluster randomised controlled trial, we recruited 919 Sudanese and South Sudanese girls ages 13-19 years residing in refugee camps in Ethiopia. Girls were divided into 31 clusters, with 457 and 462 participants assigned to the intervention and control arms, respectively. Intervention clusters received 30 life skills sessions delivered in safe spaces and 8 complementary sessions for caregivers. The primary outcome was exposure to sexual violence in the previous 12 months. Secondary outcomes included disaggregated forms of sexual violence, physical violence, emotional violence, transactional sex, child marriage, feelings of safety, attitudes around rites of passage and perceptions of social support. Intent-to-treat analysis was used.\n## RESULTS\nAt 12-month follow-up, the intervention was not significantly associated with reduction in exposure to sexual violence (adjusted OR =0.96, 95% \u2009CI 0.59 to 1.57), other forms of violence, transactional sex or feelings of safety. The intervention was associated with improvements in attitudes around rites of passage and identified social supports. Additionally, the intervention showed a decrease in reported child marriage among girls who were married at baseline.\n## CONCLUSION\nWhile the intervention impacted key markers along the causal pathway to violence reduction, further research and programmatic adaptations are needed to prevent violence towards adolescents in humanitarian contexts.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nNCT02506543.",

The classroom intervention included a six-session curriculum emphasizing the laws and consequences for perpetrators of dating violence and sexual harassment (DV/H), the social construction of gender roles, and healthy relationships. The building-based intervention included the use of building-based restraining orders, higher levels of faculty/security presence in safe/unsafe \"hot spots\" mapped by students, and posters to increase DV/H awareness and reporting. Student surveys were implemented at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 6-months post-intervention. As hypothesized, behaviors improved as a result of the interventions. The building-only and the combined interventions were effective in reducing sexual violence victimization involving either peers or dating partners at 6-months post-intervention. This was mirrored by reductions in sexual violence perpetration by peers in the building-only intervention. While the preponderance of results indicates that the interventions were effective, an anomalous result (increase in sexual harassment victimization reports that was contradicted by lower frequency estimates) did emerge. However, after analysis these anomalous results were deemed to be most likely spurious.

A baseline survey and two follow-up surveys were administered immediately after the treatment (Wave 2) and about six months post-treatment (Wave 3). In an earlier paper, we demonstrated the effectiveness of two approaches to youth GV/SH prevention programming (a fact-based, law and justice curriculum and an interaction-based curriculum). In this paper, we explored whether these largely positive findings remain for both girls and boys, including whether girls experience higher levels of GV/SH than boys. Most of our statistical models proved to be non-statistically significant. However, in 2 of our 48 victimization/ perpetration (any violence, sexual violence and non-sexual violence) models (across two post-intervention follow-up points), we observed that the interventions reduced peer (male or female, non-dating partner) sexual violence victimization and reduced peer perpetration, but another outcome model indicated that the interventions increased dating perpetration. These mixed findings will need to be explored further in future research. Regarding our primary research question, we observed no statistically significant differences for the treatment multiplied by gender interaction terms for any of the perpetration or victimization outcome models, suggesting that the treatment had similar effects on girls and boys. However, we did observe that boys are more involved in violence than girls: both as victims and perpetrators. Boys experienced significantly more of three types of victimization from peers and dating partners compared to what girls experienced at the hands of their peers and dating partners. As perpetrators, boys committed more sexual victimization against peers (immediately post-intervention only) and more sexual victimization against dating partners than girls. The implications of these results are discussed.",
