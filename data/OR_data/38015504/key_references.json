            "abstract": "Rationale: Extremely preterm infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at risk for development of BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH). A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) shunt may be a modifiable risk factor for BPD-PH development. Objective: To determine whether the presence and duration of ductus arteriosus patency differs between extremely preterm infants with and without BPD-PH. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study among preterm infants of gestational age 22 weeks, 0 days, to 28 weeks, 6 days, who remained on respiratory support on postnatal day 28 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham from 2017 to 2020. Infants who were diagnosed with PH (cases) by echocardiography were compared with infants without PH (control subjects). Data from echocardiograms performed during the hospitalization after postnatal day 28 were included. Logistic regression adjusted for covariates that differed significantly between groups. A probit analysis related the duration of ductal patency to the development of BPD-PH. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 138 infants developed BPD alone, and 82 infants developed BPD-PH. After adjustment for differing covariates between groups, both PDA (adjusted odds ratio, 4.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-9.77) and moderate to large PDA (adjusted odds ratio, 4.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.78-9.64) remained significantly related to BPD-PH at discharge. By probit analysis, each additional month of PDA and hemodynamically significant PDA exposure was associated with an increased probability for the composite outcome of BPD-PH at discharge or death with coefficients of 0.40 (P < 0.001) and 0.45 (P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: In extremely preterm infants on respiratory support on postnatal day 28, both the presence of and a longer duration of ductus arteriosus patency were associated with the development of BPD-PH.",

Infants were classified as having either flow-associated BPD-PH (BPD-flow-PH) or BPD-PVD.\n## RESULTS\n256 infants survived \u226536 weeks: 105 had NO BPD (were off respiratory support by 36 weeks); 151 had BPD. 22/151 had BPD-PH (12/22 had BPD-flow-PH from a PDA that persisted beyond 36 weeks; 10/22 had BPD-PVD). Moderate/large PDA shunts that persisted beyond 36 weeks were significantly associated with an increased incidence of BPD-PH due to BPD-flow-PH. We found no association between the duration of PDA exposure and the incidence of BPD-PVD.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nModerate/large PDA shunts increase the risk of flow-associated BPD-PH when present beyond 36 weeks. Although term infants with PDA-congenital heart disease can develop pulmonary vascular remodeling and PVD after months of PDA exposure, we found no echocardiographic evidence in preterm infants that prolonged PDA exposure increases the incidence of BPD-PVD during the neonatal hospitalization.\n## IMPACT\nIn our study, preterm infants (<28 weeks' gestation) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) had a 15% incidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) beyond 36 weeks' postmenstrual age as a comorbidity. Moderate/large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) shunts increased the risk of flow-associated PH when present beyond 36 weeks. Although months of prolonged PDA exposure can cause pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) in term infants with PDA-congenital heart disease, we found no echocardiographic evidence for an association between the duration of PDA exposure and the incidence of late PVD during the neonatal hospitalization in preterm infants with BPD.\n",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of BPD, to identify characteristics associated with BPD and to identify characteristics associated with PH in infants with BPD.\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS\nA retrospective study was performed. Data were obtained from a regional neonatal database and by reviewing medical records of infants admitted during the 2002-2010 period. A total of 400 infants with a birth weight (BW) < 1,500 g were identified. Eight were excluded and 74 infants met the criteria for BPD. A total of 17 infants with BPD had PH.\n## RESULTS\nWe found that the incidence of BPD at the Neonatal Department at Hvidovre Hospital between January 2002 and December 2010 was 18%. Infants with BPD differed significantly from infants without BPD with regard to the following characteristics: Infants with BPD more frequently had a lower gestational age and BW, intubation at birth, mechanical ventilation within 24 hours of birth, a lower Apgar score at one minute and five minutes. The incidence of PH was 23% among infants with BPD. Furthermore, we found a significantly larger frequency of intubation at birth, postnatal infection, longer duration of continuous positive airway pressure treatment and use of oxygen therapy among infants with PH and BPD than among the remaining infants.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe incidence of BPD was 18%. Low gestational age was found to be the most important factor associated with development of BPD. Among BPD infants, postnatal infection was significantly associated with PH. Further prospective studies including routine echocardiography are needed to evaluate risk factors for PH.\n## FUNDING\nnot relevant.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nnot relevant.\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcome of PH in preterm infants with BPD and to identify the risk factors for PH.\n## SUBJECTS AND METHODS\nWe reviewed the records of 116 preterm infants with BPD cared for at a single tertiary center between 2004 and 2008.\n## RESULTS\nTwenty-nine (25%) infants had PH >2 months after birth. PH occurred initially at a median age of 65 days (range, 7-232 days). Severe BPD, a birth weight <800 g, long-term ventilator care and oxygen supplementation, a high ventilator setting, infection, and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were related to PH based on univariate analysis (p<0.05). The infants who had longer oxygen supplementation were significantly more likely to have PH (odds ratio, 18.5; 95% confidence interval, 4.1-84.6; p<0.001). PH was improved in 76% of infants after a median of 85 days (range, 20-765 days). Four infants (14%) died. The death of 3 infants was attributed to PH.\n## CONCLUSION\nBPD was frequently complicated by PH. Although PH resolved in the majority of infants, PH in preterm infants with BPD can be fatal. Regular screening for PH and adequate management are required.\n",

The objective was to determine the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension among ELBW infants by screening echocardiography and evaluate subsequent outcomes.\n## METHODS\nAll ELBW infants admitted to a regional perinatal center were evaluated for pulmonary hypertension with echocardiography at 4 weeks of age and subsequently if clinical signs suggestive of right-sided heart failure or severe lung disease were evident. Management was at discretion of the clinician, and infants were evaluated until discharge from the hospital or pre-discharge death occurred.\n## RESULTS\nOne hundred forty-five ELBW infants (birth weight: 755 \u00b1 144 g; median gestational age: 26 weeks [interquartile range: 24-27]) were screened from December 2008 to February 2011. Overall, 26 (17.9%) were diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at any time during hospitalization (birth weight: 665 \u00b1 140 g; median gestational age: 26 weeks [interquartile range: 24-27]): 9 (6.2%) by initial screening (early pulmonary hypertension) and 17 (11.7%) who were identified later (late pulmonary hypertension). Infants with pulmonary hypertension were more likely to receive oxygen treatment on day 28 compared with those without pulmonary hypertension (96% vs 75%, P < .05). Of the 26 infants, 3 died (all in the late group because of cor pulmonale) before being discharged from the hospital.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPulmonary hypertension is relatively common, affecting at least 1 in 6 ELBW infants, and persists to discharge in most survivors. Routine screening of ELBW infants with echocardiography at 4 weeks of age identifies only one-third of the infants diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension.

Pulmonary artery hypertension was graded through echocardiography for all patients; 13 patients also underwent cardiac catheterization.\n## RESULTS\nEighteen (43%) of 42 patients had severe pulmonary artery hypertension (systemic or suprasystemic right ventricular pressure). Among 13 patients who underwent catheterization, the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 43 +/- 8 mmHg and the pulmonary vascular resistance index was 9.9 +/- 2.8 Wood units. In 12 patients, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance improved with 100% oxygen and 80 ppm inhaled nitric oxide but remained elevated. The pulmonary vascular resistance index decreased to 7.9 +/- 3.8 Wood units in 100% oxygen and to 6.4 +/- 3.1 Wood units with the addition of nitric oxide. Sixteen patients (38%) died during the follow-up period. Estimated survival rates were 64% +/- 8% at 6 months and 53% +/- 11% at 2 years after diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension. In multivariate analyses, severe pulmonary artery hypertension and small birth weight for gestational age were associated with worse survival rates. Among 26 survivors (median follow-up period: 9.8 months), pulmonary artery hypertension was improved, relative to its most severe level, in 24 patients (89%).\n## CONCLUSION\nPremature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and severe pulmonary artery hypertension are at high risk of death, particularly during the first 6 months after diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension.\n",

En nuestro medio, disponemos de escasa informaci\u00f3n epidemiol\u00f3gica sobre la HP asociada a DBP. Objetivos: Nuestro objetivo primario fue definir la frecuencia de HP asociada a DBP establecida por ecocardiograf\u00eda durante el ingreso hospitalario neonatal. Los objetivos secundarios fueron establecer la asociaci\u00f3n de HP con morbimortalidad, analizar potenciales factores de riesgo y describir los hallazgos obtenidos en otras pruebas complementarias de imagen. Pacientes y M\u00e9todos: Reclutamos prospectiva y consecutivamente, entre 2010 y 2012, reci\u00e9n nacidos prematuros (edad gestacional [EG] menor o igual a 30 sem+6 d\u00edas y /o peso al nacimiento [PRN] menor o igual a 1500g) que desarrollaron DBP seg\u00fan los criterios de los Institutos Nacionales de la Salud de los Estados Unidos. Evaluamos la aparici\u00f3n de signos ecocardiogr\u00e1ficos compatibles con HP a partir de los 2 meses de vida o antes del alta hospitalaria. Seguimos la evoluci\u00f3n hasta el a\u00f1o de vida (persistencia o resoluci\u00f3n de los signos de HP, mortalidad, duraci\u00f3n de hospitalizaci\u00f3n, rehospitalizaci\u00f3n). Resultados: De 84 RNPT con DBP, encontramos 22 casos con signos ecogr\u00e1ficos de HP, la mayor\u00eda en formas moderadas o graves de DBP. Los signos de HP persistieron al a\u00f1o de vida en 3 pacientes. En el seguimiento, hubo 3 fallecimientos en la cohorte global, todos en el grupo de HP durante el ingreso. Los pacientes con HP tuvieron m\u00e1s eventos adversos (mortalidad o estancia hospitalaria prolongada o reingresos tras el alta; 68% frente a 35%, p=0,01) que el grupo sin HP. El grupo de la cohorte con HP fue de PRN y EG medios menores que el grupo sin HP (806 g frente a 923g, p=0,03; 26 semanas frente a 27,3 semanas, p=0,005), precis\u00f3 de mayor duraci\u00f3n de ventilaci\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica (duraci\u00f3n mediana de 41 d\u00edas frente a 6 d\u00edas, p<0,001), y estuvo m\u00e1s tiempo hospitalizado (126 d\u00edas frente a 86 d\u00edas, p<0,001). El cierre quir\u00fargico del ductus se asoci\u00f3, de forma independiente a peso y EG, con el desarrollo de HP (odds ratio ajustada de 4,13 [1,34-12,77]). Encontramos malformaciones vasculares (colaterales sist\u00e9mico-pulmonares, estenosis de venas pulmonares) potencialmente relevantes en pruebas adicionales de imagen tor\u00e1cica (angiotomograf\u00eda computarizada tor\u00e1cica) que definieron la extensi\u00f3n de la afectaci\u00f3n pulmonar de estos pacientes. Conclusiones: La HP fue un hallazgo ecocardiogr\u00e1fico frecuente (al menos uno de cada seis pacientes en la inferencia poblacional) en RNPT que desarrollaron DBP, y aunque se resolvi\u00f3 en la mayor\u00eda de los supervivientes durante el primer a\u00f1o de vida, se asoci\u00f3 con eventos adversos de morbimortalidad m\u00e1s frecuentes. El ductus que precis\u00f3 cirug\u00eda fue un factor de riesgo de HP. ## Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) complicates the evolution of preterm infants who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Epidemiological data about DBP-associated PH is scarce in Spain. Aims: We primarily aimed to define the frequency of DBP-associated PH, as established by echocardiography, during the neonatal admission. Secondarily, we aimed to assess the association of PH to morbidity and mortality, to analyse potential risk factors, and describe image findings in ancillary tests. Patients and Methods: Between 2010 and 2012, we prospectively, consecutively recruited preterm newborns (gestational age[GE] equal or under 30 weeks plus 6 days and/or birth weight [BW] equal or under 1500 grams) who developed BPD according to National Institutes of Health criteria. We assessed the presence of echo signs compatible with PH beyond two months of life of before discharge, following evolution until the first year of life (persistence of resolution of PH; mortality, length of hospital stay, or readmission). Results: 22 out of 84 preterm newborns with BPD showed echographic signs of PH, most with moderate or severe BPD. PH signs persisted in 3 patients at one year. At follow-up, there were 3 deaths in the full cohort, all in the PH group. Patients with PH had more adverse events (composite of death or prolonged hospital stay or readmission after neonatal discharge; 68% vs. 35%, p=0.01) than the group without PH. PH cohort had both lower mean birth weight and gestational age than the group without PH (806 g vs. 923 g, p=0.03; 26 weeks vs. 27.3 weeks, p=0.005, required longer support on mechanical ventilation (median duration of 41 days vs. 6 days, p<0.001), and had longer hospital stay (median stay of 126 days vs. 86 days, p<0,001). Surgical closure of a ductus arteriosus was associated with development of PH, independently of birth weight and gestational age (adjusted odds ratio of 4.13 [1.34-12.77]). We found vascular anomalies (systemic-to-pulmonary collaterals, pulmonary vein stenosis) in ancillary image testing (chest angio-computed tomography scan) defining the extent of lung damage. Conclusions: PH was a frequent echo finding (at least one in six patients, as inferable population-wide) in preterm newborns who developed BPD. Although PH resolved in most of the survivors in the first year of life, it was associated with more adverse events of morbidity and mortality. Surgical closure of a ductus arteriosus was a risk factor for PH.",

            "abstract": "## Purpose: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is known as a major risk factor for preterm infants deaths, and associated with low gestational age, low birth weight, longer duration of oxygen therapy, low Apgar scores, and oligohydramnios. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for PH in preterm infants with chronic lung disease. ## Methods: A retrospective review was performed of data from 86 infants (<32 weeks of gestation) who diagnosed with chronic lung disease at Severance Children\u2019s Hospital from July 2006 to June 2011. PH was diagnosed on the basis of echocardiogram demonstrating elevated right ventricle pressure. The infants were divided into two groups: PH group (n=18) or control group (n=67). ## Results: PH group showed lower gestational age and underwent longer duration of oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and hospitalization compared with control group. PH group received more surfactant therapy, and the frequency of the development of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (\u2265G3) and severe chronic lung disease was higher in PH group than control group. According to multivariate analysis, IVH (\u2265G3) (OR=5.00, 95% CI=1.10-22.63, P=0.037) and severe BPD (OR=2.43, 95% CI=1.03-15.41, P=0.045) were found to be significant risk factors for PH in preterm infants with chronic lung disease. ## Conclusion: Pulmonary hypertension was significantly increased in preterm infants with chronic lung disease when associated with IVH (\u2265G3). We suggest that effort for early diagnosis and management for PH would be helpful in preterm infants with chronic lung disease when severe IVH was combined.",
