            "criteria": "Two reviewers (E.V. and E.v.W.-K.) extracted data from relevant studies, and another reviewer (M.J.H.) checked data extraction for accuracy and completeness. Discrepancies were resolved by consulting the primary report. The outcome considered in meta-analysis was BPD-PH, defined by any echocardiographic criteria as long as the evaluation was performed at a postnatal age greater than 4 weeks. The exposure to PDA was divided into 6 groups on the basis of the categories provided in the different studies: (1) any PDA (any ductal shunt detected by echocardiography); (2) hsPDA; (3) medically treated PDA; (4) surgically ligated or catheter-occluded PDA; (5) medically treated and/or surgically ligated or catheter-occluded PDA; and (6) prolonged PDA (exposure to PDA beyond 4 weeks postpartum or 36 weeks postmenstrual age). When a study reported different periods of exposure to PDA, the longest period was selected. In addition to these 6 PDA groups, PDA exposure time was collected as a continuous variable.",
