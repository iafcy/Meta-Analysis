            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Pulmonary hypertension is a deadly complication of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the most common pulmonary morbidity of prematurity. Despite these catastrophic consequences, no evidence-based therapies are available for the prevention of pulmonary hypertension in this population. Sildenafil is a potent pulmonary vasodilator approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults. Preclinical models suggest a beneficial effect of sildenafil on premature lungs through improved alveolarization and preserved vascular development. Sildenafil may therefore prevent the development of pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease of prematurity by reducing pulmonary vascular remodeling and lowering pulmonary vascular resistance; however, clinical trial evidence is needed. The present study, supported by the National Institutes of Health's National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, will generate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary effectiveness data on sildenafil in a population of premature infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia at risk for pulmonary hypertension.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We have designed a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential dose-escalating, double-masked, safety trial of sildenafil in premature infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We will randomize 120 premature infants < 29 weeks gestational age with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 32-40 weeks postmenstrual age in a dose-escalating approach 3:1 (sildenafil: placebo) sequentially into each of 3 cohorts at ~ 30 clinical sites. Participants will receive up to 34 days of study drug, followed by 28 days of safety monitoring. The primary outcome will be safety as determined by incidence of hypotension. Secondary outcomes will include pharmacokinetics and preliminary effectiveness of sildenafil based on presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension diagnosed by echocardiography at the end of treatment period.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Sildenafil is a promising intervention to prevent the development of pulmonary hypertension in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Clinical trials of sildenafil specifically designed for premature infants are urgently needed. The current study will make substantial contributions to scientific knowledge of the safety of sildenafil in premature infants at risk for pulmonary hypertension. Results from the study will be used by investigators to inform the design of a pivotal efficacy trial.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04447989 .

            "abstract": "The Authors Chang Liu B.S and Yuan Shi commented our paper on Fluid restriction in management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in Italy. With our study, we conducted a prospective cross-sectional survey among all Italian Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) to address conservative management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants below 29 weeks' gestational age (GA), with specific regard to fluid restriction (FR). The Authors wondered if the heterogeneity of use of fluid restriction both as a prophylactic tool and as a conservative tool when a hemodynamically significant PDA is diagnosed, was due to economic disparities among areas of the included centers. Conducting a secondary analysis of our data, we observed that if we separately consider the responses of two areas, northern and central-southern Italy, FR is slightly more frequently applied in Central and Southern regions (82%) as compared to Northern regions (78%), although this finding does not reach statistical significance. No correlation between the likelihood to adopt conservative measures and the amount of allowed fluid intake was found. The hypothesis that \"less fluid intake resulted in milder clinical and echocardiographic presentations of PDA, and thus a lower rate of pharmacological treatment\" cannot be supported by our current study design and might deserve future investigations."

There is a need for improved delivery of targeted PAH therapies for this subgroup of patients who have severe and persistent PAH despite standard respiratory care for chronic lung disease. Currently infants who have severe PAH despite oral or inhaled therapy receive continuous intravenous prostanoid therapy (mostly epoprostenol), which is complicated because of the need for central venous access and associated catheter-related complications. We present a series of 5 infants who were successfully treated with a continuous infusion of subcutaneous treprostinil, which is a longer-acting prostanoid with similar hemodynamic effects. There were improvements in echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular function and estimated pulmonary hypertension, and in respiratory support required within weeks of therapy. Unlike commonly in adults, these 5 infants had no instances of severe site erythema, bleeding, bruising, or infection. In our experience with 5 former extremely preterm infants who had PAH associated with chronic lung disease, subcutaneous treprostinil was safe, efficacious, and well tolerated. We believe that subcutaneous treprostinil can be beneficial in a select group of former premature infants who have chronic lung disease and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension who have not responded adequately to conservative therapies."

VLBW infants with pneumonia and therapy-resistant, severe respiratory failure soon after birth were studied. Despite their infection, there was no detectable alveolar inducible NO synthase or nitrotyrosine, which is a toxic oxidation product of NO. These infants do not respond to exogenous surfactant and demonstrate severe pulmonary hypertension. However, they require exogenous surfactant prior to iNO.

Many approaches have been developed with the aim of decreasing the incidence of or alleviating BPD, but effective methods are still lacking. Gasotransmitters, a type of small gas molecule that can be generated endogenously, exert a protective effect against BPD-associated lung injury; nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are three such gasotransmitters. The protective effects of NO have been extensively studied in animal models of BPD, but the results of these studies are inconsistent with those of clinical trials. NO inhalation seems to have no effect on BPD, although side effects have been reported. NO inhalation is not recommended for BPD treatment in preterm infants, except those with severe pulmonary hypertension. Both CO and H2S decreased lung injury in BPD rodent models in preclinical studies. Another small gas molecule, hydrogen, exerts a protective effect against BPD. The nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) axis seems to play a central role in the protective effect of these gasotransmitters on BPD. Gasotransmitters play important roles in mammals, but further clinical trials are needed to explore their effects on BPD."

Observational studies on the association between early PHT diagnosed within the first 2 weeks after birth and its clinical outcomes in preterm infants born before 37 weeks of gestation or with very low birth weight (< 1500 g) were included. Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of each study using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We performed meta-analysis using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.3. A total of 1496 potentially relevant studies were found, of which 8 studies (7 cohort studies and 1 case-control study) met the inclusion criteria comprising 1435 preterm infants. The event rate of early PHT was 24% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.174-0.310).

            "abstract": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is the most common neonatal form and mostly reversible after a few days with improvement of the underlying pulmonary condition. When pulmonary hypertension (PH) persists despite adequate treatment, the severity of parenchymal lung disease should be assessed by chest CT. Pulmonary vein stenosis may need to be ruled out by cardiac catheterisation and lung biopsy, and genetic workup is necessary when alveolar capillary dysplasia is suspected. In PPHN, optimisation of the cardiopulmonary situation including surfactant therapy should aim for preductal SpO2between 91% and 95% and severe cases without post-tricuspid-unrestrictive shunt may receive prostaglandin E1 to maintain ductal patency in right heart failure. Inhaled nitric oxide is indicated in mechanically ventilated infants to reduce the need for extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and sildenafil can be considered when this therapy is not available. ECMO may be indicated according to the ELSO guidelines. In older preterm infant, where PH is mainly associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or in term infants with developmental lung anomalies such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia or cardiac anomalies, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction/left atrial hypertension or pulmonary vein stenosis, can add to the complexity of the disease. Here, oral or intravenous sildenafil should be considered for PH treatment in BPD, the latter for critically ill patients. Furthermore, prostanoids, mineralcorticoid receptor antagonists, and diuretics can be beneficial. Infants with proven or suspected PH should receive close follow-up, including preductal/postductal SpO2measurements, echocardiography and laboratory work-up including NT-proBNP, guided by clinical improvement or lack thereof."

However, little is known about the long-term impact prematurity has on the pulmonary vasculature.Objectives: Determine the long-term effects of prematurity on right ventricular and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics.Methods: Preterm subjects (n = 11) were recruited from the Newborn Lung Project, a prospectively followed cohort at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, born preterm with very low birth weight (≤1,500 g; average gestational age, 28 wk) between 1988 and 1991. Control subjects (n = 10) from the same birth years were recruited from the general population. All subjects had no known adult cardiopulmonary disease. Right heart catheterization was performed to assess right ventricular and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics at rest and during hypoxic and exercise stress.Measurements and Main Results: Preterm subjects had higher mean pulmonary arterial pressures (mPAPs), with 27% (3 of 11) meeting criteria for borderline pulmonary hypertension (mPAP, 19-24 mm Hg) and 18% (2 of 11) meeting criteria for overt pulmonary hypertension (mPAP ≥ 25 mm Hg). Pulmonary vascular resistance and elastance were higher at rest and during exercise, suggesting a stiffer vascular bed. Preterm subjects were significantly less able to augment cardiac index or right ventricular stroke work during exercise. Among neonatal characteristics, total ventilatory support days was the strongest predictor of adult pulmonary pressure.Conclusions: Young adults born preterm demonstrate early pulmonary vascular disease, characterized by elevated pulmonary pressures, a stiffer pulmonary vascular bed, and right ventricular dysfunction, consistent with an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension."

We sought to determine the role of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) in the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) in a hyperoxia-induced neonatal mouse model of PH and RVH. After birth, C57BL/6 mice were placed in room air (RA) or 75% O2 (CH) for 14 days to induce PH and RVH. Mice were euthanized at 14 days or recovered in RA for 14 days or 42 days prior to euthanasia at 28 or 56 days of age. Some pups received sildenafil or vehicle (3 mg·kg(-1)·dose(-1) sc) every other day from P0. RVH was assessed by Fulton's index [RV wt/(LV + septum) wt]. PDE5 protein expression was analyzed via Western blot, PDE5 activity was measured by commercially available assay, and cGMP was measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Hyperoxia induced RVH in mice after 14 days, and RVH did not resolve until 56 days of age. Hyperoxia increased PDE5 expression and activity in RV, but not LV + S, after 14 days. PDE5 expression normalized by 28 days of age, but PDE5 activity did not normalize until 56 days of age. Sildenafil given during hyperoxia prevented RVH, decreased RV PDE5 activity, and increased RV cGMP levels. Mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of PDE5 had increased RVH in RA. These findings suggest normal RV PDE5 function is disrupted by hyperoxia, and elevated PDE5 contributes to RVH and remodeling. Therefore, in addition to impacting the pulmonary vasculature, sildenafil also targets PDE5 in the neonatal mouse RV and decreases RVH."

Surgical closure of the ODA is recommended for overloads of the left heart or signs of pulmonary hypertension in the presence of blood discharge from left to right and after previously suffered endocarditis. The article analyzes current information about the treatment of premature infants with ODA."

            "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most prevalent long-term morbidity in surviving extremely preterm infants and is linked to increased risk of reactive airways disease, pulmonary hypertension, post-neonatal mortality, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. BPD affects approximately 20% of premature newborns, and up to 60% of premature infants born before completing 26 weeks of gestation. It is characterized by the need for assisted ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Approaches to prevention and treatment of BPD have evolved with improved understanding of its pathogenesis. This review will focus on recent advancements and detail current research in pharmacotherapy for BPD. The evidence for both current and potential future experimental therapies will be reviewed in detail. As our understanding of the complex and multifactorial pathophysiology of BPD changes, research into these current and future approaches must continue to evolve."

            "abstract": "Mechanical assisted ventilation for neonatal respiratory failure is associated with residual lung disease. Because ECMO rests the lungs, it has been suggested that ECMO will prevent chronic lung disease in survivors. To determine whether or not ECMO survivors have evidence of pulmonary sequelae, we studied 19 infants who were treated with ECMO for neonatal respiratory failure. Ten infants still required supplemental oxygen or pulmonary medications or both to treat clinical lung disease during the first six months of life. Thoracic gas volume was normal. Pulmonary mechanics in ECMO survivors were compared with those of 13 preterm infants with BPD at similar age. We conclude that a significant proportion of ECMO survivors have residual abnormalities in pulmonary mechanics at 6 months of age. We speculate that neonatal lung injury due to meconium aspiration and other causes is a more important determinant of abnormal pulmonary sequelae than the method of treatment."

            "abstract": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a severe pulmonary disorder which occurs at a rate of one in every 500 live births. About 10-50% of the victims will die of the problem and 7-20% of the survivors develop long-term impairments such as hearing deficit, chronic lung disease, and intracranial bleed. Most adult survivors show evidence of augmented pulmonary vasoreactivity, suggesting a phenotypical change. Several animal models have been used to study the pathophysiology and help to develop new therapeutic modality for PPHN. The etiology of PPHN can be classified into three groups: (1) abnormally constricted pulmonary vasculature as a result of parenchymal diseases; (2) hypoplastic pulmonary vasculature; and (3) normal parenchyma with remodeled pulmonary vasculature. Impaired vasorelaxation of pulmonary artery and reduced blood vessel density in lungs are two characteristic findings in PPHN. Medical treatment includes sedation, oxygen, mechanical ventilation, vasorelaxants (inhaled nitric oxide, inhaled or intravenous prostacyclin, intravenous prostaglandin E1, magnesium sulfate), and inotropic agents. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors have recently been studied as another therapeutic agent for PPHN. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) inhibitors have been studied in animals and a case of premature infant with PPHN successfully treated with an ET-I inhibitor has been reported in the literature. Surfactants have been reported as an adjunct treatment for PPHN as a complication of meconium aspiration syndrome. Even with the introduction of several new therapeutic modalities there has been no significant change in survival rate. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenator is used when medical treatment fails and the patient is considered to have a recoverable cause of PPHN."

Early PROM impairs lung structures and function through 3 mechanisms : 1) oligo-hydramnios ; 2) fetal inflammatory syndrome ; and 3) prematurity. Thus, the related causes of respiratory failure at birth after PROM are: hyaline membrane disease, persistent pulmonary hypertension induced by impaired endothelial function and/or lung hypoplasia, materno-fetal infection, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia resulting at least in part from the fetal inflammatory syndrome. Severity of the respiratory morbidity is largely unpredictable. Even if gestational age at PROM is considered as a prognostic factor, survival without morbidity exist after PROM as early as 18 weeks GA. Better knowledge of the pathophysiology improved the outcome of the preterm infants born after early PROM. Optimal management of the respiratory failure including minimizing barotrauma is required to prevent from bronchopulmonary dysplasia."

Indomethacin, available since 1976, has been the conventional pharmacologic treatment for PDA, but its use is associated with vasoconstrictive effects that impair renal, mesenteric and cerebral blood flow. Intravenous (IV) ibuprofen lysine, approved in the United States in 2006, has less severe vasoconstrictive effects on these vital organs than IV indomethacin. Clinical trials have shown both of these COX inhibitors to be equally effective in closing the PDA in approximately 70%-80% of treated infants, with less vasoconstrictive and adverse renal effects occurring with IV ibuprofen lysine.1,2 Several clinical considerations are important in the process of medical decision-making when faced with the need for PDA treatment with one of these pharmacologic agents in the premature infant. This paper focuses on these clinical considerations, including cerebral, renal and mesenteric blood flow, renal function, pulmonary effects, protein-binding capacity as it relates to hyperbilirubinemia, and platelet aggregation. No differences in chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, hyperbilirubinemia and coagulopathy were observed in clinical trials when comparing these 2 COX inhibitors; however, significant differences have been observed in arterial blood flow to the cerebral, renal and mesenteric organs, suggesting that IV ibuprofen lysine may be the more favorable agent."

            "abstract": "Progressive improvements in perinatal care and respiratory management of preterm infants have resulted in increased survival of newborns of extremely low gestational age over the past few decades. However, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the chronic lung disease after preterm birth, has not changed. Studies of the long-term follow-up of adults born preterm have shown persistent abnormalities of respiratory, cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary function, possibly leading to a lower exercise capacity. The underlying causes of these abnormalities are incompletely known, but we hypothesize that dysanapsis, i.e. discordant growth and development, in the respiratory and cardiovascular systems is a central structural feature that leads to a lower exercise capacity in young adults born preterm than those born at term. We discuss how the hypothesized system dysanapsis underscores the observed respiratory, cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary limitations. Specifically, adults born preterm have: (1) normal lung volumes but smaller airways, which causes expiratory airflow limitation and abnormal respiratory mechanics but without impacts on pulmonary gas exchange efficiency; (2) normal total cardiac size but smaller cardiac chambers; and (3) in some cases, evidence of pulmonary hypertension, particularly during exercise, suggesting a reduced pulmonary vascular capacity despite reduced cardiac output. We speculate that these underlying developmental abnormalities may accelerate the normal age-associated decline in exercise capacity, via an accelerated decline in respiratory, cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary function. Finally, we suggest areas of future research, especially the need for longitudinal and interventional studies from infancy into adulthood to better understand how preterm birth alters exercise capacity across the lifespan."

In 2011 and 2014, the National Institutes of Health and American Academy of Pediatrics respectively recommended against the use of iNO in preterm infants <34 weeks. However, these guidelines were based on trials conducted with varying inclusion criteria and outcomes. Recent guidelines from the American Thoracic Society/American Heart Association, the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet) and European Pediatric Pulmonary Vascular Disease Network recommend the use of iNO in preterm neonates with HRF with confirmed pulmonary hypertension. This review discusses the available evidence for off-label use of iNO. Preterm infants with prolonged rupture of membranes and pulmonary hypoplasia appear to respond to iNO. Similarly, preterm infants with physiology of pulmonary hypertension with extrapulmonary right-to-left shunts may potentially have an oxygenation response to iNO. An overview of relative and absolute contraindications for iNO use in neonates is provided. Absolute contraindications to iNO use include a ductal dependent congenital heart disease where systemic circulation is supported by a right-to-left ductal shunt, severe left ventricular dysfunction and severe congenital methemoglobinemia. In preterm infants, we do not recommend the routine use of iNO in HRF due to parenchymal lung disease without pulmonary hypertension and prophylactic use to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Future randomized trials evaluating iNO in preterm infants with pulmonary hypertension and/or pulmonary hypoplasia are warranted. (233/250 words)."

            "abstract": "Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) can be performed in patients with severe emphysematous disease. However, LVRS in pediatric patients has not yet been reported. Here, we report our experience with 2 cases of pediatric LVRS. The first patient was a preterm infant girl with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The emphysematous portion of the right lung was removed via sternotomy and right hemiclamshell incision. The patient was discharged on full-time home ventilator support for 3 months after the surgery. Since then, her respiratory function has improved continuously. She no longer needs oxygen supplementation or ventilator care. Her T-cannula was removed recently. The second patient was also a preterm infant girl with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. She was born with pulmonary hypertension and multiple congenital anomalies, including an atrial septal defect. Despite receiving the best supportive care, she could not be taken off the mechanical ventilator because of severe hypercapnia. We performed LVRS on the right lung via thoracotomy. She was successfully weaned off the mechanical ventilator 1 month after the surgery. She was discharged without severe complications at 3 months after the operation. At present, she is growing well with the help of intermittent home ventilator support. She can now tolerate an oral diet. Our experience shows that LVRS can be considered as a treatment option for pediatric patients with severe emphysematous lung. It is especially helpful for discontinuing prolonged mechanical ventilator care for patients with respiratory failure."

With a frequency of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) as high as 70% in preterm infants born before 28-week gestation, the role of the hemodynamically significant PDA (hs-PDA) remains unclear. Objective: To determine if AKI and systemic hypertension is more common in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGAN) with hs PDA compared to ELGAN with no or non-hs PDA using modified AKIN and Neonatal Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of Kidney Function, and End-stage (N-RIFLE) scoring systems. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of infants ≤28 weeks gestational age born between 2010 and 2016 who had echocardiographic PDA evaluation completed for hemodynamical significance as well as serial serum creatinine and urine output measurement documented, needed for the two AKI scoring systems: modified AKIN (based on serial serum creatinine) and N-RIFLE (using urine output data). Blood pressure measurements and therapy were evaluated during the hospitalization and on the day of NICU discharge. Baseline characteristics and outcome variables were compared between the hs-PDA and no or non-hs PDA using unpaired t-tests for continuous variables and chi square tests for categorical data. Results: One hundred fifty-one infants were eligible of which 110 had hs-PDA. Infants with hs-PDA were smaller (777 versus 867 g, p = .026), less mature (25.8 versus 26.4 weeks, p = .023) and had greater exposure to nephrotoxic drugs (14 versus 9.4 days, p = .001). Other clinical and demographic variables were similar between the two groups. The overall incidence of AKI was not different between the hs-PDA and no PDA or non-hs PDA groups when evaluated by the acute kidney injury network (AKIN) or N-RIFLE staging; however, preterm newborns with hs-PDA demonstrated a trend towards increased risk of AKI injury (12.7 versus 0.02%, p = .06). The N-RIFLE and AKIN scoring systems demonstrated very poor degree of agreement (kappa = 0.00853) in our study. There was no difference in the rates of hypertension during the hospitalization as well as on the day of NICU discharge. Conclusion: Preterm neonates with hs-PDA had similar rates of AKI and hypertension as neonates with no or non-hs PDA."

Preterm infants with IUGR are at especially high risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease hallmarked by alveolar hypoplasia. Although vitamin A supplementation has been shown to decrease the incidence of BPD or death in preterm very low birth weight infants, its potential to reduce BPD or death in preterm infants with IUGR remains unknown. We used a well-characterized rat model of caloric restriction to mimic IUGR and determine the impact of IUGR on lung development. We hypothesized that retinoic acid treatment would preserve alveolar formation through increases in key signaling molecules of the retinoic acid signaling pathway. Our results showed that alveolar hypoplasia caused by caloric restriction can be reversed with refeeding, and that retinoic acid prevents the alveolar hypoplasia coincident with the increased expression of elastin and retinoic acid receptor-α and decreased transforming growth factor-β activity in developing rat lungs. These findings suggest that alveolar hypoplasia attributable to caloric restriction is reversible, and raises the possibility that retinoic acid therapy may prove a useful strategy to prevent adverse pulmonary sequelae such as BPD in preterm infants with IUGR."

Exposure of preterm fetal lambs to intra-amniotic (IA) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces chorioamnionitis, causes hypertrophy of pulmonary resistance arterioles, and alters expression of pulmonary vascular growth proteins. We investigated the cardiopulmonary and systemic hemodynamic consequences of IA LPS in preterm lambs. Pregnant ewes received IA injection of LPS (n=6) or saline (controls; n=8) at 122 days gestation, 7 days before exteriorization, instrumentation, and delivery of the fetus with pulmonary and systemic flow probes and catheters at 129 days gestation. Newborn lambs were ventilated, targeting a tidal volume of 6-7 ml/kg and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 4 cmH2O. At 30 min, all lambs underwent a PEEP challenge: PEEP was increased by 2 cmH2O at 10-min intervals to 10 cmH2O and then decreased similarly to 4 cmH2O. Ventilation parameters, arterial blood flows, and pressures were recorded in real-time for 90 min. LPS lambs had higher total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (P<0.002), increased medial thickness of arteriolar walls (P=0.013), and right ventricular hypertrophy (P=0.012). Compared with controls, LPS lambs had worse oxygenation (P<0.001), decreased pulmonary blood flow (P=0.05), and higher pulsatility index (P<0.001) and pulmonary (P<0.001) and systemic arterial pressures (P=0.005) than controls. Intra-amniotic LPS increased right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus (P=0.018) and decreased left ventricular output (P<0.001). We conclude that inflammation and pulmonary remodeling induced by IA LPS adversely alters pulmonary hemodynamics with subsequent cardiovascular and systemic sequelae, which may predispose the preterm lamb to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn."

PPHN is a serious event affecting both term and preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. It is often associated with diseases such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia, meconium aspiration, sepsis, congenital pneumonia, birth asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome. The diagnosis of PPHN should include echocardiographic evidence of increased pulmonary pressure, with demonstrable right-to-left shunt across the DA or FO, and the absence of cyanotic heart diseases. The mainstay therapy of PPHN includes treatment of underlying causes, maintenance of adequate systemic blood pressure, optimized ventilator support for lung recruitment and alveolar ventilation, and pharmacologic measures to increase pulmonary vasodilation and decrease pulmonary vascular resistance. Inhaled nitric oxide has been proved to treat PPHN successfully with improved oxygenation in 60-70% of patients and to significantly reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). About 14%-46% of the survivors develop long-term impairments such as hearing deficits, chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy and other neurodevelopmental disabilities."

Echocardiography was used to define PH and to measure speckle tracking derived longitudinal and circumferential strain of the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). Sixty-nine infants with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) gestational age of 25.6 (24.9-26.4) weeks and a median birthweight of 770 (645-945) gram were included. Eight (12%) infants had signs of PH at six months corrected age. RV fractional area change was lower in infants with severe BPD and PH at six months compared to infants without PH (35% ± 9% vs. 43% ± 9%, P = 0.03).

            "abstract": "The premature infant is born into the world unprepared to naturally thrive in a foreign environment. Lung development entails immense growth, structural remodeling and differentiation of specialized cells during the normal term perinatal and postnatal periods. Thus, the premature infant presents with a lung deficient for appropriate respiration. Disruption of lung development seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and chronic lung disease (CLD) results in not only impaired airway growth but also a deficiency in the accompanying vasculature including the capillary system required for gas exchange. Deficient vascular area can lead to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Unlike PH seen in children and adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), treatment with conventional pulmonary vasodilators can be limited in developmental lung disease-associated PH because there are fewer blood vessels to dilate.

Twenty two infants (81.5%) had a PDA and flow patterns indicating pulmonary arterial pressure above or approaching systemic arterial pressure.

Here, we characterized blood samples collected from 51 preterm infants longitudinally at five time points, 20 healthy term infants at birth and age 3 to 16 weeks, and 5 healthy adults. We observed strong associations between type 2 immune polarization in circulating CD3+CD4+ T cells and cardiopulmonary illness, with odds ratios up to 24. Maternal magnesium sulfate therapy, delayed hepatitis B vaccination, and increasing fetal, but not maternal, chorioamnionitis severity were associated with attenuated type 2 polarization. Blocking type 2 mediators such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13, or signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in murine neonatal cardiopulmonary disease in vivo prevented changes in cell type composition, increases in IL-1β and IL-13, and losses of pulmonary capillaries, but not gains in larger vessels. Thereby, type 2 blockade ameliorated lung inflammation, protected alveolar and vascular integrity, and confirmed the pathological impact of type 2 cytokines and STAT6. In-depth flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptomics of mouse lungs further revealed complex associations between immune polarization and cardiopulmonary disease. Thus, this work advances knowledge on developmental immunology and its impact on early life disease and identifies multiple therapeutic approaches that may relieve inflammation-driven suffering in the youngest patients."

The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of the arterial duct on neonatal pulse oximetry saturation (POS) on the left hand.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this observational study, arterial oxygen saturation on both hands and on one foot was measured within the first 4 hours of life.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Two hundred fifty-one newborns were studied: 53% males and 47% were delivered by caesarean section. The median gestational age was 38 4/7 weeks (90% CI, 32 6/7 - 41 2/7 weeks), the median birth weight was 3140 g (90% CI, 1655 - 4110 g) and the median age at recording was 60 minutes (90% CI, 15 - 210 minutes). The mean POS for the overall study population was 95.7% (90% CI, 90 - 100%) on the right hand, 95.7% (90% CI, 90 - 100%) on the left hand, and 94.9% (90% CI, 86 - 100%) on the foot. Four subgroups (preterm infants, babies with respiratory disorders, neonates delivered by caesarean section, and newborns < or =15 minutes of age) were formed and analysed separately. None of the subgroups showed a statistically significant difference between the right and left hands. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression did not identify any associated factors influencing the POS on the left hand.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      With the exception of some children with complex or duct dependent congenital heart defects and some children with persistent pulmonary hypertension, POS on both hands can be considered equally pre-ductal."

            "abstract": "## HYPOTHESIS\nPremature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at increased risk of secondary pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH). Prior studies yielded mixed results on the utility of echocardiographic screening at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). We present our experience using echocardiographic screening at the time of BPD diagnosis to identify infants at highest risk of BPD-PH at discharge.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nRetrospective cohort analysis of clinical/ demographic data and screening echocardiograms in patients with BPD. Discharge echocardiograms identified infants with or without BPD-PH at discharge. 36 weeks PMA screening echocardiograms and clinical data were then reviewed to identify which factors were associated with increased odds of BPD-PH at discharge. Associations between echocardiographic findings were evaluated with 2- and 3-variable models to predict increased risk of BPD-PH at discharge.\n## RESULTS\nIn our cohort of 64 infants with severe BPD, BPD-PH was present in 22/64 (34%) infants at discharge. There were no clinical differences at time of 36 weeks PMA screening evaluation (mean PMA 36.6 ± 2.9 weeks). PH at screening was poorly predictive of PH at discharge as PH at screening resolved in 49% of patients. However, having an ASD, RV dilation, hypertrophy, or reduced function on screening, especially in combination, were associated with BPD-PH at discharge.\n## CONCLUSION\nIn our cohort of premature infants with BPD, 36 weeks PMA screening echocardiogram identified patients at increased risk for BPD-PH at discharge when ASD, RVH, or impaired RV function were present. Larger prospective studies are indicated to validate these findings.\n"

            "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most important respiratory morbidity of preterm infants with few effective preventive strategies. Administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) was considered effective to prevent BPD via paracrine extracellular vesicles (EVs), while appropriate regimens of MSC-EVs and the mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, we established a hyperoxia-induced rat BPD model, and examined the effect of early intraperitoneal MSC-EVs with different doses on BPD. We found that MSC-EVs ameliorated hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a dose-dependent manner, and high-dose MSC-EVs ameliorated alveolar simplification and fibrosis. Also, MSC-EVs showed its beneficial effects on vascular growth and pulmonary hypertension. Primary AT2 cells were observed to transdifferentiate into AT1 cells when exposure to hyperoxia in vitro. Administration of MSC-EVs at the first-day culture significantly delayed the transdifferentiation of AT2 cells induced by hyperoxia. We further found that exposure to hyperoxia led to elevated expression of WNT5a mRNA and protein, a key agent in AT2 transdifferentiation, while MSC-EVs administration decreased it. Further study is warranted that MSC-EVs may delay the transdifferentiation of AT2 cells via WNT5a. These studies provide key preclinical evidence of MSC-EVs therapeutics on BPD and highlight the effect of MSC-EVs on suppressing the transdifferentiation of AT2 cells and its possible mechanism through downregulation of WNT5a."

This study is a retrospective analysis of all premature infants <37 weeks of gestation with PV stenosis and PHT in two French pediatric congenital cardiac centers from 1998 till 2015. Diagnosis, hemodynamics and outcome are described. Sixteen patients met the inclusion criteria. Median gestational age was 28 weeks (25 + 6-35) with a median birth weight of 842 g (585-1500). The majority of infants (87.5 %) had chronic lung disease and associated cardiac defects. Median age at diagnosis was 6.6 months (1.5-71). Fifty-six percentage (n = 9) had initially unilateral PV stenosis affecting in 89 % the left PV. Median initial invasive mean pulmonary artery pressure was 42 mmHg (25-70). Treatment options included surgical intervention (n = 6), interventional cardiac catheter (n = 3) and/or targeted therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (n = 5). In six patients, decision of nonintervention was taken. Global mortality was 44 %. All deaths occurred within 7 months after diagnosis regardless of chosen treatment option. Mean follow-up was 6 years (4.9 months-12 years). At last visit, all eight survivors were in stable clinical condition with five of them receiving targeted therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. PV stenosis is an unusual cause of PHT in the premature infant with chronic lung disease. Diagnosis is challenging since initial echocardiography can be normal and the disease is progressive. Treatment options are numerous, but prognosis remains guarded."

BPD results from the complex interplay between impairments in the premature lung such as surfactant deficiency, perinatal insults such as infection, and damage resulting from supportive care of the infant due to barotrauma or volutrauma from mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity from supplemental oxygen administration. These factors result in chronic inflammation in the infant lung with recurring cycles of lung damage and repair that may impair alveolarization and vascularization in the developing lungs. As our insight in how to treat BPD improves along with the ability to do so with developing technology and therapies, the underlying pathogenesis will also change.

            "abstract": "Premature infants are exposed to increased generation of reactive oxygen species, and on the other hand, they have a deficient antioxidant defense system. Oxidative insult is a salient part of lung injury that begins as acute inflammatory injury in respiratory distress disease and then evolves into chronic and structural scarring leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oxidative stress is also involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension in newborns through the modulation of the vascular tone and the response to pulmonary vasodilators, with consequent decrease in the density of the pulmonary vessels and thickening of the pulmonary arteriolar walls. Oxidative stress has been recognized as both a trigger and an endpoint for several events, including inflammation, hypoxia, hyperoxia, drugs, transfusions, and mechanical ventilation, with impairment of pulmonary function and prolonged lung damage. Redoxomics is the most fascinating new measure to address lung damage due to oxidative stress. The new challenge is to use omics data to discover a set of biomarkers useful in diagnosis, prognosis, and formulating optimal and individualized neonatal care. The aim of this review was to examine the most recent evidence on the relationship between oxidative stress and lung diseases in preterm newborns. What is currently known regarding oxidative stress-related lung injury pathogenesis and the available preventive and therapeutic strategies are also discussed."

            "abstract": "The pathological hallmarks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of premature infants, include inflammation, arrested alveolarization, and dysregulated angiogenesis. Severe BPD is often complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PH) that significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, cell proliferation and survival, and inflammation by modulating multiple signaling pathways, particularly the nuclear transcription factor, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Aberrant GSK-3β signaling is linked to BPD. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of GSK-3β is beneficial in preventing hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, an experimental model of BPD. Newborn rats were exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (90% oxygen), and received daily intraperitoneal injections of placebo (DMSO) or SB216763, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of GSK-3β, for 14 days. Hyperoxia exposure in the presence of the placebo increased GSK-3β phosphorylation, which was correlated with increased inflammation, decreased alveolarization and angiogenesis, and increased pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. However, treatment with SB216763 decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and lung inflammation during hyperoxia. Furthermore, treatment with the GSK-3β inhibitor also improved alveolarization and angiogenesis, and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. These data indicate that GSK-3β signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, and that inhibition of GSK-3β is beneficial in preventing inflammation and protecting alveolar and vascular structures during hyperoxia. Thus, targeting GSK-3β signaling may offer a novel strategy to prevent and treat preterm infants with BPD."

Imaging showed suprasystemic right-sided pressures and pulmonary venous stenosis. Despite aggressive management of respiratory status and surgical marsupialization of stenoses, the infant expired after 3 weeks. At autopsy, 3 of 4 pulmonary veins showed a fibrous ridge obstructing atrial ostia with otherwise normal anatomy. The lungs showed bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertensive vascular changes, and features of venous obstruction. Pulmonary venous stenosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants may be pathogenetically related.

Data sources were PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline. Studies reporting the effectiveness of sildenafil therapy in BPD-associated PH in newborns and infants were included. All-cause mortality, improvement in PH, improvement in respiratory scores, and adverse events were extracted. Five studies were included, yielding a total of 101 patients with 94.2 patient-years of total follow-up. The pooled mortality rate was 29.7%/year (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.8–52.7).

There were no serious adverse events during sildenafil therapy. This systematic review shows that in the treatment of BPD-associated PH in preterm infants, sildenafil may be associated with improvement in PAP and respiratory scores. However, there is no clear evidence of its effect on mortality rates.

PH was diagnosed on the basis of echocardiogram demonstrating elevated right ventricle pressure.

Ventilator-induced lung injury has been recognized as a major contributing factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS) could decrease lung injury, and early respiratory support management might affect pulmonary outcomes. We conducted a study to evaluate the changes in early respiratory support management and their impact on respiratory outcome and complications of preterm infants in 3 different time periods over the last 13 years.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study was a retrospective, single-center cohort study. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of preterm infants < 32 weeks of gestational age born in our hospital from 2007-2020. The study period was divided into three 3-y discrete periods: 2007-2009 (period A), 2013-2015 (period B), and 2018-2020 (period C). Changes in early respiratory support management were assessed in the 3 periods.

The use of antenatal corticosteroids increased over time (56.1% in period A, 56.7% in period B, and 74.0% in period C (P < .001). The need for surfactant decreased from 65.6% in period A to 40.7% in period B and 45.9% in period C. Increased utilization of NIRS was associated with decreased invasive mechanical ventilation within 24 h after birth. NIRS only during the hospital stay increased from 22.9% in period A to 36.8% and 45.1% in the latter 2 periods (P < .001). Oxygen therapy duration decreased from 24.3 d in period A to 14.4 d in period B and 17.2 d in period C (P < .001). The overall incidence of BPD was 32.4% in the first period, 23.9% in the second period, and 25.4% in the third period (P < .001). The moderate-to-severe forms of BPD decreased from 12.8% in period A to 7.9% in period B and 7.6% in period C (P = .009). Other neonatal complications, such as pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, surgical necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage grade III/IV, and periventricular leukomalacia, were unchanged among the 3 periods.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      From 2007-2020, respiratory management was characterized by a marked reduction in invasive mechanical ventilation and an increase in the use of NIRS.

All studies compared the effectiveness of ibuprofen to indomethacin for the closure of a PDA. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity of treatment effect for any of the outcomes. For the primary outcome (failure of ductal closure), there was no statistically significant difference between ibuprofen and indomethacin groups [RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.69, 1.22)]. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality, surgical duct ligation, duration of ventilator support, IVH, PVL, NEC, time to full enteral feeds, ROP, sepsis, duration of hospital stay or gastrointestinal bleed. For many of these outcomes the sample size was small and the estimates imprecise. The incidence of decreased urine output (< 1cc/kg/hr) was lower in the ibuprofen group as compared to the indomethacin group [NNT 9 (95% CI 5-14)]. This was the only statistically significant clinical finding favouring ibuprofen. Chronic lung disease defined as oxygen requirement at 28 days post-natally was statistically significantly more likely to occur in the ibuprofen group [RR 1.37 (95% CI 1.01, 1.86); NNH 7 (95% CI 3 - 100)].

Ibuprofen reduces the risk of oliguria. However, ibuprofen may increase the risk for chronic lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension has been observed in three infants after prophylactic use of ibuprofen. Based on currently available information ibuprofen does not appear to confer a net benefit over indomethacin for the treatment of a PDA. We conclude that indomethacin should remain the drug of choice for the treatment of a PDA. Future research may include a four arm trial where infants are randomized at birth, either to a prophylaxis arm starting at birth or to an arm in which treatment starts after a PDA is diagnosed by echocardiography within the first seven days of life. Within the prophylaxis and treatment arms, the infants would be randomized to either ibuprofen or indomethacin. The primary outcome should be intact survival (survival without handicap) at 18 months corrected age."

Nineteen women who received indomethacin (initial dose of 50-100 mg followed by 50-100 mg/day) and their 25 infants were identified. Delivery was delayed for a week or longer in 86.6% of the mothers. There were two deaths: a stillborn with multiple congenital anomalies and a neonate with congenital listeriosis. Seven infants were born at term without complications. Fifteen infants born prematurely were compared to 15 control infants not exposed to indomethacin antenatally.

Although advances in surfactant therapy, corticosteroids, and antiinflammatory drugs have improved clinical management of preterm infants, those who suffer with severe vascular complications still lack viable treatment options. Paucity of the alveolar capillary network in ACDMPV causes respiratory distress and leads to mortality in a vast majority of infants with ACDMPV. The discovery of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in 1997 brought forth the paradigm of postnatal vasculogenesis and hope for promoting vascularization in fragile patient populations, such as those with BPD and ACDMPV. The identification of diverse EPC populations, both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic in origin, provided a need to identify progenitor cell-selective markers that are linked to progenitor properties needed to develop cell-based therapies. Focusing on the future potential of EPCs for regenerative medicine, this review will discuss various aspects of EPC biology, beginning with the identification of hematopoietic, nonhematopoietic, and tissue-resident EPC populations. We will review knowledge related to cell surface markers, signature gene expression, and key transcriptional regulators and will explore the translational potential of EPCs for cell-based therapy for BPD and ACDMPV. The ability to produce pulmonary EPCs from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro holds promise for restoring vascular growth and function in the lungs of patients with pediatric pulmonary disorders."

            "abstract": "Infants born preterm face a number of challenges. Depending on the degree of prematurity, they are at a risk of developing several specific conditions and diseases related to organ immaturity and complications of long-term neonatal intensive care. Various organ systems are affected, such as the lung, resulting in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); the vascular system, resulting in pulmonary hypertension; the brain, with the risk of intracranial hemorrhage; the eye with retinopathy of prematurity; and the gut, manifesting in the severe complication of necrotizing enterocolitis. A common hallmark for all these prematurity-related conditions is that inflammation seems to be a major driving force in the pathogenesis, and that injury repair is essential for recovery and long-term health. In addition, the available treatment options are often only supportive, not curative. This chapter reviews the recent advances of stem cell therapy that have opened up new possibilities to restore organ function following prematurity."

            "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) complicating bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) worsens clinical outcomes in former preterm infants. Increased serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) signaling plays a prominent role in PH pathogenesis and progression in adults. We hypothesized that increased 5-HT signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of neonatal PH, complicating BPD and neonatal lung injury. Thus, we investigated 5-HT signaling in neonatal mice exposed to bleomycin, previously demonstrated to induce PH and alveolar simplification. Newborn wild-type mice received intraperitoneal PBS, ketanserin (1 mg/kg), bleomycin (3 U/kg) or bleomycin (3 U/kg) plus ketanserin (1 mg/kg) three times weekly for 3 wk. Following treatment with bleomycin, pulmonary expression of the rate-limiting enzyme of 5-HT synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (Tph1), was significantly increased. Bleomycin did not affect pulmonary 5-HT 2A receptor (R) expression, but did increase pulmonary gene expression of the 5-HT 2BR and serotonin transporter. Treatment with ketanserin attenuated bleomycin-induced PH (increased RVSP and RVH) and pulmonary vascular remodeling (decreased vessel density and increased muscularization of small vessels). In addition, we found that treatment with ketanserin activated pulmonary MAPK and Akt signaling in mice exposed to bleomycin. We conclude that 5-HT signaling is increased in a murine model of neonatal PH and pharmacological inhibition of the 5-HT 2AR protects against the development of PH in neonatal lung injury. We speculate this occurs through restoration of MAPK signaling and increased Akt signaling."

Despite the handful of advances in neonatal care through ground-breaking clinical trials, the management of neonatal shock is often dependent on the bedside clinician's experience and training without the aid of high-level evidence. However, the recognition for the importance of comprehensive and serial hemodynamic assessment is growing. There is now a wealth of literature investigating the use of functional echocardiography, near-infrared spectroscopy, and noninvasive impedance-based cardiometry to complement common bedside hemodynamic measures such as blood pressure and heart rate measurement.

Advances in pulmonary vascular biology over the past few decades have led to new insights into the pathogenesis of BPD; however, many unique issues persist regarding our understanding of pulmonary vascular development and disease in preterm infants at risk for chronic lung disease.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Recent studies have highlighted the important contribution of the developing pulmonary circulation to lung growth in the setting of preterm birth.

Epidemiological studies underscore gaps in our understanding of PVD in the context of BPD, including universally accepted definitions, approaches to diagnosis and treatment, and patient outcomes. Unfortunately, therapeutic strategies for pulmonary hypertension in BPD are based on small observational studies with poorly defined endpoints and rely on results from older children and adult studies.

We report the prevalence of LAH in an institutional cohort with BPD-PH with careful examination of hemodynamic contributors and impact on patient outcomes. This single-center, retrospective cohort study examined children <2 years of age with BPD-PH who underwent cardiac catheterization at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford. Patients with unrepaired simple shunt congenital heart disease (CHD) and pulmonary vein stenosis (only 1 or 2 vessel disease) were included. Patients with complex CHD were excluded.

Using an unadjusted logistic regression model, baseline requirement for positive pressure ventilation at time of cardiac catheterization was associated with increased risk for LAH (odds ratio 8.44, 95% CI 1.46-48.85, p = 0.02). Small for gestational age birthweight, sildenafil use, and CHD were not associated with increased risk for LAH.

Time under MV with a greater chance of developing moderate to severe BPD was estimated by the ROC curve. Perinatal and hospitalization outcomes were compared between groups. A logistic regression was performed to verify the influence of variables associated to moderate to severe BPD development, such as pulmonary hypertension (PH), gender, gestational age (GA) and weight at birth, as well the time under MV found with ROC curve.

Inhaled NO is currently indicated for the treatment of term and near-term neonates with hypoxemia and PH. Since regulatory approval, several studies have suggested that NO inhalation can prevent chronic lung disease in premature infants. In addition, unanticipated systemic effects of inhaled NO may lead to treatments for a variety of disorders including ischemia-reperfusion injury. This review summarizes the pharmacology and physiological effects of breathing NO. The application of inhaled NO to hypoxemic neonates with PH is discussed including recent studies exploring the use of inhaled NO to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. This review also highlights the application of inhaled NO to treat adults with cardiopulmonary disease, strategies to augment the efficacy of inhaled NO, and potential applications of the systemic effects of the gas."

Mechanisms that inhibit distal lung growth are poorly understood, but recent studies suggest that impaired vascular endothelial growth factor signaling and reduced nitric oxide (NO) production decreases alveolar and vessel growth in the developing lung, features observed in experimental oxygen-induced BPD. NO exerts its biological activity by stimulating guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) production.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Because cGMP is inactivated by phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, we hypothesized that the cGMP-specific PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil would promote angiogenesis and attenuate oxygen-induced lung injury in newborn rats. METHODS, MEASUREMENTS, AND MAIN RESULTS: In vitro, sildenafil (10(-4) M) increased endothelial capillary network formation of human pulmonary endothelial cells exposed to hyperoxia. In vivo, rat pups were randomly exposed from birth to normoxia, hyperoxia (95% O(2), BPD model), and hyperoxia+sildenafil (100 mg/kg/day subcutaneously). Rat pups exposed to hyperoxia showed fewer and enlarged air spaces as well as decreased capillary density, mimicking pathologic features seen in human BPD. These structural anomalies were associated with echographic (decreased pulmonary acceleration time) and structural (right ventricular hypertrophy and increased medial wall thickness) signs of pulmonary hypertension. Sildenafil preserved alveolar growth and lung angiogenesis, and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular hypertrophy and medial wall thickness.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest a role for the NO/cGMP pathway during alveolar development.

However, with improved survival of premature infants at risk for PDA and an increase in cases discovered incidentally on echocardiograms performed for other purposes, the incidence of PDA is rising. Thus, primary care physicians need to be alert to the clinical situations suggesting a previously undiagnosed PDA. It is estimated that the incidence of PDA is approximately 0.02% to 0.04% in term infants and slightly higher in premature infants. PDA accounts for 6% to 11% of all congenital heart defects. Although most cases of PDA would seem to occur sporadically, multifactorial inheritance is believed to underlie many cases. These people are thought to possess a genetic predisposition acted on by an environmental trigger that occurs at an unknown but vulnerable time during the pregnancy. The clinical spectrum of presentation of a PDA may range from a \"silent\" PDA, one with no clinical manifestations but which is incidentally discovered on echocardiogram for other purposes, to patients who present with congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, signs of volume overload, endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, or \"recurrent pneumonia.\" We describe 2 cases that illustrate the discovery of an asymptomatic PDA during routine physical examination of adult patients."

TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) is an antiangiogenic protein that activates TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1), a cytokine strongly linked to both experimental and human BPD. Objectives:1) To examine effects of inhibiting TSP-1-mediated TGF-β1 activation (LSKL [leucine-serine-lysine-leucine]) in neonatal rats with bleomycin-induced lung injury; 2) to examine effects of a TSP-1 mimic (ABT-510) on lung morphology; and 3) to determine whether TSP-1 and related signaling peptides are increased in lungs of human preterm infants at risk for BPD. Methods: From Postnatal Days 1 to 14, rat pups received daily intraperitoneal bleomycin (1 mg/kg) or vehicle and were treated with daily subcutaneous LSKL (20 mg/kg) or vehicle alone. Separate animals were treated with vehicle or ABT-510 (30 mg/kg/d). Paraffin-embedded lung tissues from 47 autopsies (controls; death <28 d, n = 30 and BPD at risk; death ⩾28 d, n = 17) performed on infants born <29 completed weeks' gestation were semiquantified for injury markers (collagen, macrophages, and 3-nitrotyrosine), TSP-1, and TGF-β1. Measurements and Main Results: Bleomycin or ABT-510 increased lung TGF-β1 activity and macrophage influx, caused pulmonary hypertension, and led to alveolar and microvascular hypoplasia. Treatment with LSKL partially prevented abnormal lung morphology secondary to bleomycin. Lungs from human infants at risk for BPD had increased contents of TSP-1 and TGF-β1 when compared with controls. TGF-β1 content correlated with markers of lung injury. Conclusions: TSP-1 inhibits alveologenesis in neonatal rats, in part via the upregulated activity of TGF-β1. Observations in human lungs suggest a similar pathogenic role for TSP-1 in infants at risk for BPD."

Currently, no early marker exists which could help clinicians identify which preterm infants will develop BPD. Given the evidence that NTproBNP is elevated in children with BPD, we hypothesized that it could be used as an early marker of BPD development. We conducted a prospective cohort study including very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) admitted to our NICU between January 2015 and January 2017 in which we determined serial NTproBNP levels on days 1 and 3 and then weekly, until 49 days of life. A total of 101 patients were recruited (mean birth weight 1152 g (SD 247.5), mean gestational age 28.9 weeks (SD 1.9)). NTproBNP levels differed among infants who did and did not develop BPD from 14 to 35 days of life with the greatest difference on day 14 of life (non-BPD group (n = 86): 1155 (IQR 852-1908) pg/mL, BPD (n = 15): 9707 (IQR 3212-29,560) pg/mL; p = 0.0003).

What is Known: • Children with BPD have elevated NTproBNP levels, which are related to the severity of BPD and the development of pulmonary hypertension. What is New: • NTproBNP at 14 days of life is higher in those who later develop BPD, regardless of the presence of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus. • A calculated cutoff point of 2264 pg/mL of NTproBNP at 14 days has a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 86% in the prediction of BPD."

After an initial uncomplicated clinical course, her oxygen requirement increased, which was interpreted as an early sign of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At 3 weeks of age, she suddenly collapsed and died of severe pulmonary hypertension. At autopsy, multiple pulmonary artery emboli and several older renal vein thromboses were found. Results of genetic analyses of the infant and her family were negative for thrombophilia. Although embolism represents a frequent emergency in adults, fatal pulmonary embolism has never, to our knowledge, been described for premature infants. This case suggests that thrombotic events are underdiagnosed and that additional studies are needed to define infants at risk and optimal treatment strategies."

            "abstract": "We aimed at establishing the state of the art in fluid restriction practice in our national setting and providing a foundation for future research efforts. A prospective cross-sectional survey was conducted among all 114 Italian Neonatal Units in order to address conservative management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants below 29 weeks' gestational age (GA), with specific regard to fluid restriction. Response rate was 80%. Conservative measures for PDA management are provided in the majority of NICUs and 80% of centers reduce fluid intake in neonates with PDA. No relationship can be found among pharmacologically or surgically treated patients per year and the approach to fluid restriction. The minimum intake administered at regimen when fluid restriction is applied is associated to the ratio between the maximum number of neonates managed pharmacologically and number of admitted < 29 weeks' GA newborns.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our survey shows an extreme variability among centers in terms of use of fluid restriction as a prophylactic tool but also in terms of its use (both opportunity and modality) when a hemodynamically significant PDA is diagnosed.

            "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the risk factors and short-term prognosis of early pulmonary hypertension (PH) in preterm infants. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was performed in preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 2012 to December 2019. Eighty preterm infants with a diagnosis of PH between 3 and 14 days (early PH group) were matched in gestational age and sex with the controls (1∶2) of the same period in NICU. Perinatal clinical records, complications, echocardiography and early outcomes were collected. Characteristics and outcomes were compared between the two groups with t-test, nonparametric test or Chi-square test. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to analyze the predictive factors of early PH. Results: The gestational age of the early PH group and the control group were both (27.9±1.4) weeks, and 52 (65.0%) and 104 (65.0%) were males in each group, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that birth weights were lower in the early PH group than those in the control group (1 030 (850, 1 200) vs. 1 110 (1 000, 1 278) g, Z=-3.27, P=0.001). The early PH group had higher rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension, prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) >1 week, born by caesarean, small for gestational age (SGA), 1 and 5 min Apgar score ≤7 scores, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and hemodynamic significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) (12.5% (10/80) vs. 3.8% (6/160), 11.2% (9/80) vs. 3.8% (6/160), 48.8% (39/80) vs. 28.8% (46/160), 10.0% (8/80) vs. 1.9% (3/160), 70.8% (51/72) vs. 51.7% (74/143), 50.0% (36/72) vs. 20.3% (29/143), 88.8% (71/80) vs. 59.4% (95/160), 85.0% (68/80) vs. 22.5% (36/160), χ2=6.56, 5.12, 3.31, 8.05, 7.17, 20.05, 21.58, 84.84, all P<0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the independent predictive factors of early PH were PROM >1 week, SGA, 5 min Apgar score ≤7 scores, nenonatal RDS and hsPDA (OR=10.40, 18.61, 4.47, 4.13, 20.10, 95%CI 1.93-56.12, 2.82-122.76, 1.91-10.46, 1.50-11.39, 8.28-48.80, all P<0.05),respectively. Infants with early PH had higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), BPD associated PH, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), extrauterine growth retardation (EUGR), laser treatment for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and mortality than the controls (all P<0.05). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was also longer in the early PH group than that in the control group (P<0.05). Conclusions: Risk of early PH will be increased in preterm infants with PROM >1 week, SGA, 5 min Apgar score ≤7 scores, and comorbidities of nenonatal RDS and hsPDA. Early PH is associated with increased mortality, BPD, BPD associated PH, severe IVH, EUGR and laser treatment for ROP."

En nuestro medio, disponemos de escasa información epidemiológica sobre la HP asociada a DBP. Objetivos: Nuestro objetivo primario fue definir la frecuencia de HP asociada a DBP establecida por ecocardiografía durante el ingreso hospitalario neonatal. Los objetivos secundarios fueron establecer la asociación de HP con morbimortalidad, analizar potenciales factores de riesgo y describir los hallazgos obtenidos en otras pruebas complementarias de imagen. Pacientes y Métodos: Reclutamos prospectiva y consecutivamente, entre 2010 y 2012, recién nacidos prematuros (edad gestacional [EG] menor o igual a 30 sem+6 días y /o peso al nacimiento [PRN] menor o igual a 1500g) que desarrollaron DBP según los criterios de los Institutos Nacionales de la Salud de los Estados Unidos. Evaluamos la aparición de signos ecocardiográficos compatibles con HP a partir de los 2 meses de vida o antes del alta hospitalaria. Seguimos la evolución hasta el año de vida (persistencia o resolución de los signos de HP, mortalidad, duración de hospitalización, rehospitalización). Resultados: De 84 RNPT con DBP, encontramos 22 casos con signos ecográficos de HP, la mayoría en formas moderadas o graves de DBP. Los signos de HP persistieron al año de vida en 3 pacientes. En el seguimiento, hubo 3 fallecimientos en la cohorte global, todos en el grupo de HP durante el ingreso. Los pacientes con HP tuvieron más eventos adversos (mortalidad o estancia hospitalaria prolongada o reingresos tras el alta; 68% frente a 35%, p=0,01) que el grupo sin HP. El grupo de la cohorte con HP fue de PRN y EG medios menores que el grupo sin HP (806 g frente a 923g, p=0,03; 26 semanas frente a 27,3 semanas, p=0,005), precisó de mayor duración de ventilación mecánica (duración mediana de 41 días frente a 6 días, p<0,001), y estuvo más tiempo hospitalizado (126 días frente a 86 días, p<0,001). El cierre quirúrgico del ductus se asoció, de forma independiente a peso y EG, con el desarrollo de HP (odds ratio ajustada de 4,13 [1,34-12,77]). Encontramos malformaciones vasculares (colaterales sistémico-pulmonares, estenosis de venas pulmonares) potencialmente relevantes en pruebas adicionales de imagen torácica (angiotomografía computarizada torácica) que definieron la extensión de la afectación pulmonar de estos pacientes. Conclusiones: La HP fue un hallazgo ecocardiográfico frecuente (al menos uno de cada seis pacientes en la inferencia poblacional) en RNPT que desarrollaron DBP, y aunque se resolvió en la mayoría de los supervivientes durante el primer año de vida, se asoció con eventos adversos de morbimortalidad más frecuentes. El ductus que precisó cirugía fue un factor de riesgo de HP. ## Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) complicates the evolution of preterm infants who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Epidemiological data about DBP-associated PH is scarce in Spain. Aims: We primarily aimed to define the frequency of DBP-associated PH, as established by echocardiography, during the neonatal admission. Secondarily, we aimed to assess the association of PH to morbidity and mortality, to analyse potential risk factors, and describe image findings in ancillary tests. Patients and Methods: Between 2010 and 2012, we prospectively, consecutively recruited preterm newborns (gestational age[GE] equal or under 30 weeks plus 6 days and/or birth weight [BW] equal or under 1500 grams) who developed BPD according to National Institutes of Health criteria. We assessed the presence of echo signs compatible with PH beyond two months of life of before discharge, following evolution until the first year of life (persistence of resolution of PH; mortality, length of hospital stay, or readmission). Results: 22 out of 84 preterm newborns with BPD showed echographic signs of PH, most with moderate or severe BPD. PH signs persisted in 3 patients at one year. At follow-up, there were 3 deaths in the full cohort, all in the PH group. Patients with PH had more adverse events (composite of death or prolonged hospital stay or readmission after neonatal discharge; 68% vs. 35%, p=0.01) than the group without PH. PH cohort had both lower mean birth weight and gestational age than the group without PH (806 g vs. 923 g, p=0.03; 26 weeks vs. 27.3 weeks, p=0.005, required longer support on mechanical ventilation (median duration of 41 days vs. 6 days, p<0.001), and had longer hospital stay (median stay of 126 days vs. 86 days, p<0,001). Surgical closure of a ductus arteriosus was associated with development of PH, independently of birth weight and gestational age (adjusted odds ratio of 4.13 [1.34-12.77]). We found vascular anomalies (systemic-to-pulmonary collaterals, pulmonary vein stenosis) in ancillary image testing (chest angio-computed tomography scan) defining the extent of lung damage. Conclusions: PH was a frequent echo finding (at least one in six patients, as inferable population-wide) in preterm newborns who developed BPD. Although PH resolved in most of the survivors in the first year of life, it was associated with more adverse events of morbidity and mortality. Surgical closure of a ductus arteriosus was a risk factor for PH."

As a result of an intricately intertwined network of both physiological and biochemical changes, this vessel constricts rapidly after birth. Deoxygenated blood is diverted away from the placenta and through the lungs now vital for gas exchange. Premature closure of the ductus in utero can cause pulmonary hypertension and even death. Conversely, failure to close after birth can exacerbate respiratory distress, precipitate congestive heart failure and increase the risk of subsequent intestinal ischaemia leading to necrotising enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, renal hypoperfusion and/or cerebral ischaemia. In this review we summarise current knowledge of the delicately orchestrated control of the ductus arteriosus, focusing on the role of cyclo-oxygenase isoforms on prostaglandin production, on the interaction between prostaglandins and oxygen, and on the effects of these on ductal patency. We also seek to describe some of the standard and nonstandard therapeutic approaches available to the clinician when natural closure fails, reviewing alternative protocols for indomethacin administration and comparing indomethacin treatment with newer approaches such as ibuprofen.

There has been an improvement in perinatal care, but many infants still suffer from impaired branching morphogenesis, alveolarization, and pulmonary capillary formation, causing lung function impairments and BPD. There is an increased risk of respiratory infections, pulmonary hypertension, and neurodevelopmental delays in infants with BPD, all of which can lead to long-term morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, treatment options for Bronchopulmonary dysplasia are limited. A growing body of evidence indicates that mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) can treat various lung diseases in regenerative medicine. MSCs are multipotent cells that can differentiate into multiple cell types, including lung cells, and possess immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and regenerative properties. MSCs are regulated by mitochondrial function, as well as oxidant stress responses. Maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis will likely be key for MSCs to stimulate proper lung development and regeneration in Bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In recent years, MSCs have demonstrated promising results in treating and preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Studies have shown that MSC therapy can reduce inflammation, mitochondrial impairment, lung injury, and fibrosis. In light of this, MSCs have emerged as a potential therapeutic option for treating Bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The article explores the role of MSCs in lung development and disease, summarizes MSC therapy's effectiveness in treating Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and delves into the mechanisms behind this treatment."

Inhaled Nitric Oxide, an effective therapy for pulmonary hypertension and hypoxic respiratory failure in the full term infant, has also been studied in preterm infants. The most recent Cochrane review of preterm infants includes 11 studies and 3,370 participants. The results show a statistically significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or chronic lung disease (CLD) in two studies with routine use of iNO in intubated preterm infants. However, uncertainty remains as a larger study (Kinsella 2006) showed no significant benefit for iNO for this combined outcome. Also, trials that included very ill infants do not demonstrate significant benefit. One trial of iNO treatment at a later postnatal age reported a decrease in the incidence of CLD.

The literature is especially lacking on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on extremely preterm (<28 weeks gestation) infants who have underdeveloped immune systems. We report the case of an extremely preterm, 25-week 5-days old infant, born to a mother with severe COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) pneumonia. In this case, there is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, despite extreme prematurity. However, it appears that severe maternal COVID-19 may have been associated with extremely preterm delivery, based on observed histologic chorioamnionitis. This is the first reported case of an extremely preterm infant born to a mother with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who required intubation, and was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma, inhaled nitric oxide, and prone positioning for severe hypoxemic respiratory failure prior to and after delivery of this infant. The infant remains critically ill with severe respiratory failure on high-frequency ventilation, inotropic support, hydrocortisone for pressor-resistant hypotension, and inhaled nitric oxide for severe persistent pulmonary hypertension with a right to left shunt across the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale.

The PH prevalence in group BPD was higher than in group NoBPD (44/159 (28%) vs 5/45 (11%); P=0.028). In group BPD, BW and GA were lower in infants with PH compared with NoPH. Following correction for BW and GA, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), atrial septal defect (ASD), and mortality were independently associated with PH in infants with BPD. In group NoBPD, NEC was the only identified factor associated with PH. Altogether, screening only those infants with NEC and infants with BPD who also had a BW <840 g would have yielded a 84% sensitivity for detecting PH, and reduced the number of screening echocardiograms by 43%.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPH in prematurity is associated with NEC in infants with and without BPD. In infants with BPD, smaller GA and BW, severe IVH, ASD and mortality are also associated with PH.

The diagnosis was suspected on the basis of a discrepancy between the X-ray findings and the severity of the clinical status as reflected by hypoxia despite maximal ventilatory support. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was made by pre- and postductal oxygen saturation differences or by echodoppler cardiography, showing suprasystemic right ventricular pressures or right to left shunts through a patent foramen ovale or the ductus arteriosus. The response to surfactant was quantified by the arterial/alveolar (a/A) ratio difference before and 1 hr after therapy (\"delta a/A ratio\"); the delta a/A ratio was 0 +/- 0.01, which indicates a nonresponse. A single dose of 1 mg/kg tolazoline was administrated and the response assessed by a/A difference. A delta a/A ratio of 0.11 +/- 0.11 (range 0.02-0.32) represented a dramatic response and enabled oxygenation in these severely ill infants. No significant side effects were observed. We conclude that pulmonary hypertension may be an important and reversible condition in certain cases of respiratory distress syndrome and has to be considered in infants who do not respond to surfactant."

As a result of increased survival, many individuals born preterm manifest chronic respiratory symptoms throughout infancy, childhood, and adult life. The archetypical respiratory disease of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, is the second most common chronic pediatric respiratory disease after asthma. However, there are several commonly held misconceptions. These misconceptions include that bronchopulmonary dysplasia is rare, that bronchopulmonary dysplasia resolves within the first few years of life, and that bronchopulmonary dysplasia does not impact respiratory health in adult life. This focused review describes a spectrum of respiratory conditions that individuals born prematurely may experience throughout their lifespan. Specifically, this review provides quantitative estimates of the number of individuals with alveolar, airway, and vascular phenotypes associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as non-bronchopulmonary dysplasia respiratory phenotypes such as airway malacia, obstructive sleep apnea, and control of breathing issues. Furthermore, this review illustrates what is known about the potential for progression and/or lack of resolution of these respiratory phenotypes in childhood and adult life. Recognizing the spectrum of respiratory phenotypes associated with individuals born preterm and providing comprehensive and personalized care to these individuals may help to modulate adverse respiratory outcomes in later life."

Objectives: We hypothesized that infants with BPD-PH have patterns of intermittent hypoxemia (IH) that differ from infants with BPD without PH. Methods: We conducted a matched case-control study of extremely preterm infants from 22 weeks 0 days to 28 weeks 6 days born between 2018 and 2020 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. BPD-PH status was determined using echocardiographic data performed after postnatal Day 28. Physiologic data were compared between infants with BPD-PH (cases) and BPD alone (control subjects). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis estimated the predictive ability of cumulative hypoxemia, desaturation frequency, and duration of intermittent hypoxemic events in the week preceding echocardiography to discriminate between cases and control subjects. Measurements and Main Results: Forty infants with BPD-PH were compared with 40 infants with BPD alone. Infants with and without PH had a similar frequency of IH events, but infants with PH had more prolonged hypoxemic events for desaturations below 80% (7 s vs. 6 s; P = 0.03) and 70% (105 s vs. 58 s; P = 0.008). Among infants with BPD-PH, infants who died had longer hypoxemic events below 70% (145 s vs. 72 s; P = 0.01). Using the duration of hypoxemic events below 70%, the areas under the ROC curves for diagnosis of BPD-PH and death in BPD-PH infants were 0.71 and 0.77, respectively. Conclusions: Longer duration of intermittent hypoxemic events was associated both with a diagnosis of BPD-PH and with death among infants with BPD-PH."

At present, no standardised screening protocol exists for detecting late pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants. We assessed the utility of oxygen supplementation as a predictor of late pulmonary hypertension.\n## METHODS\nA retrospective single-centre review of extremely low birth weight infants with no evidence of CHD and those surviving for >30 days was performed. The association between oxygen ⩾30% at day of life 30 and diagnosis of late pulmonary hypertension was estimated with an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval using logistic regression. Doppler echocardiography was used to diagnose pulmonary hypertension in the infants.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 230 infants met the study criteria. The incidence of late pulmonary hypertension was 8.3% (19/230). Infants with late pulmonary hypertension were more likely to have a lower mean birth weight (667.1±144 versus 799.3±140 g, p=0.001) and more likely to be small for gestational age (47.4 versus 14.2%, p=0.004). Oxygen requirement ⩾30% at day of life 30 was associated with increased risk of late pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio=3.77, 95% confidence interval=1.42-10.00, p=0.008) in univariate analysis and after adjusting for birth weight (odds ratio=2.47, 95% confidence interval=0.89-6.84, p=0.08).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe need of oxygen supplementation ⩾30% at day of life 30 may be a good screening tool for detecting late pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants.\n"

Eighteen of 19 newborn infants have survived at least 2 months after ECMO. The 15 infants receiving ECMO (nine with meconium aspiration, six with persisting pulmonary hypertension) who did not have a congenital diaphragmatic hernia were normal survivors. One death occurred at 5 months of age from chronic lung disease. Three of four infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia were discharged following ECMO and appeared normal at 6, 9 and 18 months of age.

            "abstract": "Improved survival of extremely preterm newborn infants has increased the number of infants at risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Despite efforts to prevent BPD, many of these infants still develop severe BPD (sBPD) and require long-term invasive mechanical ventilation. The focus of research and clinical management has been on the prevention of BPD, which has had only modest success. On the other hand, research on the management of the established sBPD patient has received minimal attention even though this condition poses large economic and health problems with extensive morbidities and late mortality. Patients with sBPD, however, have been shown to respond to treatments focused not only on ventilatory strategies but also on multidisciplinary approaches where neurodevelopmental support, growth promoting strategies, and aggressive treatment of pulmonary hypertension improve their long-term outcomes. In this review we will try to present a physiology-based ventilatory strategy for established sBPD, emphasizing a possible paradigm shift from acute efforts to wean infants at all costs to a more chronic approach of stabilizing the infant. This chronic approach, herein referred to as chronic phase ventilation, aims at allowing active patient engagement, reducing air trapping, and improving ventilation-perfusion matching, while providing sufficient support to optimize late outcomes. IMPACT: Based on pathophysiological aspects of evolving and established severe BPD in premature infants, this review presents some lung mechanical properties of the most severe phenotype and proposes a chronic phase ventilatory strategy that aims at reducing air trapping, improving ventilation-perfusion matching and optimizing late outcomes."

The records of all live-born infants with body birth weight of less than 1,000 g from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1996, were evaluated. Infants with major anomalies or whose parents refused resuscitation were excluded from the analysis. There were 81 ELBW infants (0.59%) among a total of 13,835 live births during the study period, and 73 cases were enrolled for study. The mean gestational age (GA) was 27.2 (range, 24-34) weeks. Sixty-six percent of the ELBW infants were born by cesarean delivery. Respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 64% of infants and exogenous surfactant therapy was given to 47%, while intermittent mandatory ventilation was given to 85%. Symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus occurred in 34% of infants, septicemia in 30%, chronic lung disease in 48%, grade III to IV intraventricular hemorrhage in 27%, stage III to V retinopathy of prematurity in 33%, and necrotizing enterocolitis in 8%. Neonatal survival was 74%, survival to discharge was 60%, and intact survival was 50%. The survival rate was 40% for infants with a birth body of weight less than or equal to 750 g, and 68% for those with a birth body weight of greater than 750 g. While survival was 27% for infants with a GA of less than 26 weeks, it was 75% for those with a GA of greater than or equal to 26 weeks. The survival rate improved year by year for those with a GA less than 28 weeks. Cox regression analysis of survival showed that Apgar score at 1 minute (p = 0.0063), pulmonary hypertension (p = 0.012), and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (p = 0.0031) were the most important factors associated with mortality. Though the outcome of ELBW infants in our institute seems poorer than in some more developed countries, it is improving. The prognosis for ELBW infants of 24 to 25 weeks' GA remains guarded under our present care."

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a disorder that alters the pulmonary microvasculature. Immunohistochemistry for VEGFA(165), an endothelial cell mitogen, and its receptor Flt-1, was performed on lung tissues from autopsies from four fetuses, three preterm infants, four term infants without primary lung disease, four infants with BPD, and four infants with PPHN. VEGF was measured in tracheal aspirates from 31 preterm infants, 5 intubated term infants without primary lung injury, and 12 infants with PPHN during the first 10 postnatal days, and from 8 infants with BPD. Immunohistochemistry for VEGF and Flt-1 was similar in fetuses, preterm infants, and term infants: for VEGF mostly in bronchial epithelium and alveolar macrophages, and for Flt-1 mostly in vascular endothelial cells and bronchial epithelial cells. In patients with BPD, and PPHN, staining for VEGF and Flt-1 appeared also in Type II pneumocytes. Preterm infants with more severe RDS had lower VEGF than those who recovered. The persistent expression of VEGF and Flt-1 during the fetal and neonatal period supports a physiological role for VEGF in human lung development. The lower pulmonary VEGF in preterm infants with more severe RDS may contribute to the pathophysiology of the acute lung injury. In BPD, the expression of VEGF in alveolar epithelium may represent a compensatory increase after the acute phase of the lung disease. In PPHN, that more cell types express VEGF and Flt-1, and the tendency toward a higher concentration of pulmonary VEGF may represent enhanced production of VEGF in response to impaired endothelial function."

We aimed to describe the prevalence of PH in extremely preterm infants and the policy on screening and follow-up in the ten Dutch intensive care units (NICUs). We performed a retrospective cohort study at the University Medical Centre Groningen on infants with gestational age < 30 weeks and/or birthweight < 1000 g, born between 2012 and 2013. Additionally, we carried out a survey among the Dutch NICUs covering questions on the awareness of PH, the perceived prevalence, and policy regarding screening and following PH in extremely preterm infants. Prevalence of early-onset PH in our study was 26% and 5% for late-onset PH. PH was associated with poor survival and early-onset PH was associated with subsequent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). All the NICUs completed the questionnaire and we found that no standardized policy existed regarding screening and following PH in extremely preterm infants.Conclusion: Despite the frequent occurrence of PH and its clinically important consequences, (inter-)national standardized guidelines regarding screening and following of PH in extremely preterm infants are lacking. Standardizing screening and follow-up will enable early identification of infants with late-onset PH and allow for earlier treatment. Additionally, greater clarity is required regarding the prevalence of early PH as are new preventive treatment strategies to combat BPD. What is known? • Pulmonary hypertension (PH) substantially impairs the survival of extremely preterm infants. • PH is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): Early-onset PH predicts the development of BPD. Late-onset PH is prevalent in infants with severe BPD. What is new? • Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is prevalent in preterm infants. Its consequences for morbidity and mortality justify a standardized policy aimed at early detection to improve prevention and treatment. • No structured policy exists in the Netherlands regarding screening/follow-up for PH in extremely preterm infants."

In this prospective observational cohort study conducted in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit, 83 preterm infants with BPD born <28-wk gestation and still inpatients at 36-wk corrected age received an echocardiogram and blood tests of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin I, and YKL-40. Infants were analyzed according to echocardiographic evidence of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Thirty infants had evidence of TR on echocardiogram at 36-wk corrected age. Infants with or without TR had similar baseline demographics: mean ± SD gestational age 261 ± 12 vs. 261 ± 11 wk and birth weight 830 ± 206 vs. 815 ± 187 g, respectively. There was no difference in duration of respiratory support. The right ventricular systolic pressure of infants with evidence of TR was 40 ± 16 mmHg.

To improve representation of the multifactorial origins of BPD and BPD-PH, we established a double hit model, combining antenatal systemic inflammation followed by postnatal hyperoxia. On embryonic day 14, pups are exposed to systemic maternal inflammation via a single intraperitoneal injection of 150 µg/kg of lipopolysaccharide to the dam. Within 24 h after birth, pups and dams are randomized and exposed to gas with either an FiO2 of 0.21 (room air) or 0.65 (hyperoxia 65%).

Oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation are common treatments, which can cause hyperoxia-induced lung injury, but the underlying mechanism is not yet understood. Mitochondrial fission is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis. The objective of this study was to determine whether mitochondrial fission (dynamin-related protein 1, Drp1) is an important mediator of hyperoxia lung injury in rats. Methods: The animal model of BPD was induced with high oxygen (80-85% O2). Pulmonary histological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Pulmonary microvessels were observed by immunofluorescence staining of von Willebrand Factor (vWF). Protein expression levels of Drp1 and p-Drp1 (Ser616) were observed using Western Blot. We used echocardiography to measure pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAT), pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi), peak flow velocity of the pulmonary artery (PFVP), pulmonary arteriovenous diameter, and pulmonary vein peak velocity. Mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) was used as an inhibitor of Drp1, and administered through intraperitoneal injection (25 mg/kg). Results: Pulmonary artery resistance of the hyperoxide-induced neonatal rat model of BPD increased after it entered normoxic convalescence. During the critical stage of alveolar development in neonatal rats exposed to high oxygen levels for an extended period, the expression and phosphorylation of Drp1 increased in lung tissues. When Drp1 expression was inhibited, small pulmonary vessel development improved and PH was relieved. Conclusion: Our study shows that excessive mitochondrial fission is an important mediator of hyperoxia-induced pulmonary vascular injury, and inhibition of mitochondrial fission may be a useful treatment for hyperoxia-induced related pulmonary diseases."

As a result, professional societies recommend PH screening in premature infants. However, the risk factors for and the outcomes of PH may differ depending on the timing of its diagnosis, and little evidence is available to determine at-risk infants in the referral neonatal population. ﻿The objective of this study was to define clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of infants with pulmonary hypertension during the neonatal hospital course and at or near-term﻿.\n## METHODS\nInfants who had the following billing codes: < 32 weeks, birth weight < 1500 g, neonatal unit, and echocardiograph had records abstracted from a data warehouse at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. The outcome was defined as late PH on the final echocardiogram for all patients, and, separately, for patients with multiple studies. Descriptive statistics, univariable, and multivariable models were evaluated, and odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are expressed below as (OR, CI).\n## RESULTS\n556 infants were included in the overall study, 59 had PH on their final echocardiogram (11%). In multivariable analyses, atrial septal defect (2.9, 1.4-6.1), and intrauterine growth restriction (2.7, 1.2-6.3) increased the odds of late PH, whereas caffeine therapy decreased PH (0.4, 0.2-0.8). When the analyses were restricted to 32 infants who had multiple echocardiograms during their hospitalization, the association between atrial septal defect (5.9, 2.0-16.5) and growth restriction (3.7, 1.3-10.7) and late PH was strengthened, but the effect of caffeine therapy was no longer significant. In this smaller subgroup, infants with late PH had their final echocardiogram at a median of 116 days of life, and 42-74% of them had right ventricular pathology.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nEarly clinical variables are associated with PH persistence in a referral neonatal population. Identification of early clinical factors may help guide the ascertainment of infant risk for late PH, and may aid in targeting sub-groups that are most likely to benefit from PH screening.\n"

(2) There are rare clinical situations, including pulmonary hypertension or hypoplasia, that have been inadequately studied in which inhaled nitric oxide may have benefit in infants <34 weeks gestation. In such situations, clinicians should communicate with families regarding the current evidence on its risks and benefits as well as remaining uncertainties. (3) Basic research and animal studies have contributed to important understandings of inhaled nitric oxide benefits on lung development and function in infants at high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. These promising results have only partly been realized in clinical trials of inhaled nitric oxide treatment in premature infants. Future research should seek to understand this gap. (4) Predefined subgroup and post hoc analyses of previous trials showing potential benefit of inhaled nitric oxide have generated hypotheses for future research for clinical trials. Prior strategies shown to be ineffective are discouraged unless new evidence emerges. The positive results of one multicenter trial, which was characterized by later timing, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment, require confirmation. Future trials should attempt to quantify the individual effects of each of these treatment-related variables (timing, dose, and duration), ideally by randomizing them separately. (5) Based on assessment of currently available data, hospitals, clinicians, and the pharmaceutical industry should avoid marketing inhaled nitric oxide for premature infants <34 weeks gestation."

            "abstract": "50 years ago, Northway described Broncopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants exposed to mechanical ventilation. Since then, their survival has increased, nevertheless a \"new BPD\" has appeared and its incidence has not diminished. One of the characteristics of this pathology is the the abnormal vascular remodeling, which in its most severe expression is known as Pulmonary Hyper tension (PH); with an incidence of 17% in patients with BPD, which is proportional to the severity of the disease (33% in severe BPD), and as mortality factor (up to 48% 2-year mortality in PH-BPD). Thereby, it is important to know the diagnostic methods and therapeutic alternatives, topics discus sed in this review. Considering the high mortality in BPD associated PH, screening strategies in at risk population become important. The gold standard is cardiac catheterization; however, transtho-rathic echocardiography is a useful tool for the screening and diagnosis of PH in displasic patients, using cuantitive measures and cualitative changes in the evaluation. Seric type-B natriuretic peptide has shown to be useful for follow-up; regarding images, CT scan is used in severe cases. In terms of therapy; inhaled Nitric Oxide as a pulmonary vasodilator, phosphodiesterase inhibitors -sildenafil-, endotelin antagonists -bosentan-, and prostacyclin analogues -iloprost-, have been proposed. Their use, dosis and treatment lenght still lack support of high quality evidence, but diverse clinical expe riences have been described. Interdisciplinary care is also important, highlighting to optimize nu trition. Therefore, the challenge is to effectively prevent BPD and its complications. A PH screening protocol should be associated with risk stratification and treatment guidelines."

            "abstract": "Through this study, we aimed to assess the ability of routine neonatal screening at time of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) diagnosis to predict the development of late pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). This is a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 37 premature infants with BPD assessing the utility of screening serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and echocardiograms performed at the time of BPD diagnosis ('early PHTN') to predict 'late PHTN' at the last follow-up. Screening evaluation demonstrated early PHTN in 9/37 patients. At an average follow-up interval of 52.7 ± 38.7 weeks, 4/9 had late PHTN; one patient without early PHT had late PHT. At initial screening, infants with late PHTN were significantly more likely to have demonstrated elevated BNP values (p = 0.003), and echocardiographic evidence of right atrial dilatation (p = 0.01), right ventricular hypertrophy (p = 0.01), lower right ventricular area change percentage (p = 0.03), and larger main pulmonary artery Z-scores (p = 0.02). Serum BNP and echocardiographic evaluation performed at the time of BPD diagnosis can detect patients at increased risk of late PHTN. Large, prospective studies are necessary to further address this question."

            "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a form of chronic lung disease in premature infants following respiratory distress at birth. With increasing survival of extremely low birth weight infants, alveolar simplification is the defining lung characteristic of infants with BPD, and along with pulmonary hypertension, increasingly contributes to both respiratory morbidity and mortality in these infants. Growth restricted infants, infants born to mothers with oligohydramnios or following prolonged preterm rupture of membranes are at particular risk for early onset pulmonary hypertension. Altered vascular and alveolar growth particularly in canalicular and early saccular stages of lung development following mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy, results in developmental lung arrest leading to BPD with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Early recognition of PH in infants with risk factors is important for optimal management of these infants. Screening tools for early diagnosis of PH are evolving; however, echocardiography is the mainstay for non-invasive diagnosis of PH in infants. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance are being used as imaging modalities, however their role in improving outcomes in these patients is uncertain. Follow-up of infants at risk for PH will help not only in early diagnosis, but also in appropriate management of these infants. Aggressive management of lung disease, avoidance of hypoxemic episodes, and optimal nutrition determine the progression of PH, as epigenetic factors may have significant effects, particularly in growth-restricted infants. Infants with diagnosis of PH are managed with pulmonary vasodilators and those resistant to therapy need to be worked up for the presence of cardio-vascular anomalies. The management of infants and toddlers with PH, especially following premature birth is an emerging field. Nonetheless, combination therapies in a multi-disciplinary setting improves outcomes for these infants."

The definition was developed based on the evolution of non-invasive respiratory support and to achieve better prediction of later outcomes. Our objective was to evaluate the association between different definitions of BPD and occurrence of pulmonary hypertension (PHN) and long term outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This retrospective study enrolled preterm infants born at < 32 weeks of gestation between 2014 and 2018.

Limited treatment options exist with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation being one of the few associated with diminished BPD. However, little is known about the effect of the distending pressure of CPAP on the developing lung exposed to hyperoxia. We aimed to identify the functional and structural effects of CPAP in a preterm hyperoxia rabbit model of BPD. Premature rabbit pups were randomized to normoxia, hyperoxia (≥95% O2), or hyperoxia plus 4 h daily CPAP [fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.95, 5 cmH2O]. On day 7 postdelivery we performed invasive pressure-volume- and forced oscillation-based pulmonary function tests, before lung harvest for histological evaluation. Alveolar and vascular morphology, airway smooth muscle content, respiratory epithelium height, extracellular matrix components, and inflammatory cytokine expression were quantified. Hyperoxia-reared pups had restrictive lungs: alveolar walls were thickened, with the lung parenchymal tissue, collagen content, and airway smooth muscle content increased. In addition, peripheral pulmonary artery wall thickness was increased. CPAP increased alveolar recruitment and limited the structural effect of hyperoxia on the respiratory epithelium and pulmonary arteries. Additionally, CPAP improved lung function, mitigating hyperoxia-associated changes to respiratory system resistance, tissue damping, and tissue elastance. Hyperoxia disrupted functional and structural lung development. Daily intermittent CPAP limited hyperoxia-associated decreased lung function and attenuated structural changes to pulmonary arteries and respiratory epithelium while having no structural alveolar consequences. The mechanism by which CPAP has these beneficial effects needs further investigation."

Prophylactic piclamilast treatment reduced pulmonary fibrin deposition, septum thickness, arteriolar wall thickness, arteriolar vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and RVH, and prolonged survival. In the late treatment and injury-recovery model, hyperoxia caused persistent aberrant alveolar and vascular development, PH, and RVH.

Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (FiO(2)=0.75) for two weeks, were then treated with one intravenous dose of CM from either MSCs or primary mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs), and placed in room air for two to four weeks. Histological analysis of lungs harvested at four weeks of age was performed to determine the degree of alveolar injury, blood vessel number, and vascular remodeling. At age six weeks, pulmonary artery pressure (PA acceleration time) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH; RV wall thickness) were assessed by echocardiography, and pulmonary function tests were conducted. When compared to MLF-CM, a single dose of MSC-CM-treatment (1) reversed the hyperoxia-induced parenchymal fibrosis and peripheral PA devascularization (pruning), (2) partially reversed alveolar injury, (3) normalized lung function (airway resistance, dynamic lung compliance), (4) fully reversed the moderate PH and RVH, and (5) attenuated peripheral PA muscularization associated with hyperoxia-induced BPD. Reversal of key features of hyperoxia-induced BPD and its long-term adverse effects on lung function can be achieved by a single intravenous dose of MSC-CM, thereby pointing toward a new therapeutic intervention for chronic lung diseases."

The magnitudes of right ventricle function measures were lower in preterm-born infants at each time period (p < 0.01 for all) and right ventricle morphology indices were wider in all preterm infants by 1 year corrected age, irrespective of lung disease. Measures of a) right ventricle function were further decreased and b) morphology increased through 1 year in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or pulmonary hypertension (p < 0.01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Preterm infants exhibit abnormal right ventricle performance with remodelling at 32 weeks post-menstrual age that persists through 1 year corrected age, suggesting a less developed intrinsic myocardial function response following preterm birth.

            "abstract": "Objectives Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is a rare, often lethal anomaly associated with poor outcomes. Given the association between bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and cardiovascular complications, we tested the hypotheses that (1) a subgroup of neonates with severe BPD develop PVS (BPD-PVS) and have worse outcomes than do neonates with severe BPD alone (BPD); (2) among a cohort of neonates with severe BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH), PVS is an additional risk factor for adverse outcomes and mortality. Study Design We performed a retrospective review of neonates with severe BPD, based on the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD) criteria, at our institution between June 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. PVS was determined based on serial review of echocardiograms performed during their hospitalization. Neonates with congenital heart disease or chromosomal anomalies were excluded. Results Of 213 patients with severe BPD, 10 (4.7%) were found to have PVS (BPD-PVS). Neonates with BPD-PVS had lower birth weight (634 ± 178 vs. 767 ± 165 g; p < 0.01) and were more likely to be intrauterine growth restricted (80 vs. 11%; p < 0.01) than neonates with BPD alone. Time on mechanical ventilation and length of hospitalization were longer in the BPD-PVS group than BPD group. Survival was lower in the BPD-PVS group than BPD group (5/10 [50%] vs. 196/203 [97%]; log-rank test p < 0.01). Among a subgroup of neonates with BPD-PH, survival was lower among infants with PVS than those without PVS (5/9 [56%] vs. 26/30 [86%]; log-rank test p = 0.01). Conclusions Compared with neonates with severe BPD alone, those with acquired PVS are at increased risk for worse outcomes, including higher mortality. Evidence-based recommendations regarding screening protocols and surveillance are needed in this high-risk subgroup of BPD neonates."

Clinical features range from isolated recurrent episodes of liver failure to multisystemic syndrome including short stature, skeletal osteopenia and dysplasia, optic atrophy, and a variable immunological, cutaneous, muscular, and neurological abnormalities. Hemizygous variants in CUL4B cause syndromic X-linked intellectual disability characterized by limitations in intellectual functions, developmental delays in gait, cognitive, and speech functioning, and other features including short stature, dysmorphism, and cerebral malformations. In this study, we report on a 4.5-month-old preterm infant with a complex phenotype mainly characterized by placental-related severe intrauterine growth restriction, post-natal growth failure with spontaneous bone fractures, which led to a suspicion of osteogenesis imperfecta, and lethal bronchopulmonary dysplasia with pulmonary hypertension. Whole exome sequencing identified compound heterozygosity for a known frameshift and a novel missense variant in NBAS and hemizygosity for a known CUL4B nonsense mutation. In vitro functional studies on the novel NBAS missense substitution demonstrated altered Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum retrograde vesicular trafficking and reduced collagen secretion, likely explaining part of the patient's phenotype. We also provided a comprehensive overview of the phenotypic features of NBAS and CUL4B deficiency, thus updating the recently emerging NBAS genotype-phenotype correlations. Our findings highlight the power of a genome-first approach for an early diagnosis of complex phenotypes."

Advances in neonatology including surfactant instillation, high-frequency ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and, most importantly, inhaled nitric oxide (INO), have revolutionized the management of PPHN. However, given that INO does not improve oxygenation in a significant proportion (30-40%) of cases, there is an urgent need to consider other therapeutic options for PPHN. The issue is more important for developing nations with a higher PPHN-related health burden and limited resources. This article discusses the evidence about INO in term and preterm neonates in brief, and focuses mainly on the potential alternative drugs in the management of PPHN."

Although overall incidence rates have not changed, recent advancements in medical care have resulted in lower mortality rates, and those affected are beginning to live longer. As a result, the long-term repercussions of BPD are becoming more apparent. Whereas BPD has been thought of as a disease of just the lungs, resulting in abnormalities such as increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections, impaired exercise tolerance, and pulmonary hypertension, the enduring complications of BPD have been found to extend much further. This includes an increased risk for cerebral palsy and developmental delays, lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, impaired executive functioning, behavioral challenges, delays in expressive and receptive language development, and an increased risk of growth failure. In addition, the deficits of BPD have been found to influence much more than just physical health; BPD survivors have been noted to have higher rates of health care use, starting with the initial hospitalization and continuing with therapy and specialist follow-up, as well as impairments in quality of life, both physical and psychological, that continue into adulthood. The long-term consequences of BPD may best be addressed through future research, including better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to BPD, further comparisons between newborns with BPD and those without, and long-term assessment and management of BPD patients as adults."

Although, with the current management, the survival rate has improved in these infants, but bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious complication associated with a high mortality rate. During the neonatal developmental period, these infants are vulnerable to stress. Hypoxia, hyperoxia, and ventilation injury lead to oxidative and inflammatory stress, which induce further damage in the lung alveoli and vasculature. Development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in infants with BPD worsens the prognosis. Despite considerable progress in the management of premature infants, therapy to prevent BPD is not yet available. Animal experiments have shown deregulation of multiple signaling factors such as transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), caveolin-1, wingless & Int-1 (WNT)/β-catenin, and elastin in the pathogenesis of BPD.

NT-proBNP values of 118 preterm infants born ≤ 31 weeks GA were determined during the first week of life, after 4 ± 1 weeks of life, and at a corrected GA of 36 ± 2 weeks. Infants were divided into two groups: those without relevant complications and those with complications related to prematurity. NT-proBNP values of infants without complications define our exploratory reference values. The Median NT-proBNP level of these infants was 1896 ng/l (n = 27, interquartile range (IQR): 1277-5200) during the first week of life, 463 ng/l (n = 26, IQR: 364-704) at 4 ± 1 weeks of life, and 824 ng/l (n = 33, IQR: 714-1233) at a corrected GA of 36 ± 2 weeks.

Growth restriction or PDA status could not account for the difference in NT-proBNP values between GA groups.Conclusions: The results of our observational and cross-sectional study describe exploratory reference values for NT-proBNP levels in preterm infants of ≤ 31 weeks GA according to postnatal age. NT-proBNP levels during the first week of life are high and widely distributed in preterm infants and decrease subsequently to reach a distinctly lower and stable plateau at around 1 month of life. Our results suggest an influence of GA on NT-proBNP values in the first week of life. What is Known: • Several complications related to prematurity, e.g., hemodynamically significant PDA, pulmonary hypertension, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy of prematurity, have been associated with a temporary rise in NT-proBNP values in preterm infants during their first weeks of life. What is New: • This observational study provides reference values for NT-proBNP levels of very and extremely preterm infants during their first weeks of life. • In premature infants without complications, NT-proBNP values during their first week of life depend on gestational age at birth."

Inhaled NO (iNO) ameliorates the BPD phenotype in experimental models and in some premature infants. Arginosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and arginosuccinate lyase (ASL) convert L-citrulline to L-arginine; L-citrulline is regenerated during NO synthesis from L-arginine. Plasma levels of these NO precursors are low in PH. We hypothesized that L-citrulline prevents experimental O2-induced BPD in newborn rats. Rat pups were assigned from birth through postnatal day (P) 14 to room air (RA), RA + L-citrulline, 95% hyperoxia (BPD model), and 95%O2 + L-citrulline. Rat pups exposed to hyperoxia had fewer and enlarged air spaces and decreased capillary density, mimicking human BPD. This was associated with decreased plasma L-arginine and L-citrulline concentrations on P7. L-citrulline treatment significantly increased plasma L-arginine and L-citrulline concentrations and increased ASL protein expression in hyperoxia. L-citrulline preserved alveolar and vascular growth in O2-exposed pups and decreased pulmonary arterial medial wall thickness (MWT) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Increased lung arginase (ARG) activity in O2-exposed pups was reversed by L-citrulline treatment. L-citrulline supplementation prevents hyperoxia-induced lung injury and PH in newborn rats.

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcome of PH in preterm infants with BPD and to identify the risk factors for PH.\n## SUBJECTS AND METHODS\nWe reviewed the records of 116 preterm infants with BPD cared for at a single tertiary center between 2004 and 2008.\n## RESULTS\nTwenty-nine (25%) infants had PH >2 months after birth. PH occurred initially at a median age of 65 days (range, 7-232 days). Severe BPD, a birth weight <800 g, long-term ventilator care and oxygen supplementation, a high ventilator setting, infection, and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were related to PH based on univariate analysis (p<0.05). The infants who had longer oxygen supplementation were significantly more likely to have PH (odds ratio, 18.5; 95% confidence interval, 4.1-84.6; p<0.001). PH was improved in 76% of infants after a median of 85 days (range, 20-765 days). Four infants (14%) died. The death of 3 infants was attributed to PH.\n## CONCLUSION\nBPD was frequently complicated by PH. Although PH resolved in the majority of infants, PH in preterm infants with BPD can be fatal. Regular screening for PH and adequate management are required.\n"

Eighty-four VLBW infants weighing less than 1,500 g were examined using serial color Doppler echocardiography from 3 hours to day 7 after birth. The AT:RVET(c) of infants born after 30 weeks of gestation showed a rapid, significant increase during the early neonatal period, whereas those of the groups born at less than 30 weeks showed no significant increase before day 14. At 24 hours after birth, the AT:RVET(c) values of VLBW infants did not correlate well with either the ratio of the right preejection period to the right ventricular ejection time on M-mode echocardiography or the pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the right atrium, as estimated by tricuspid regurgitation on pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The AT:RVET(c) value for the chronic lung disease (CLD) group did not differ significantly from that for the oxygen-dependent group at any assessment point. During the early neonatal period, the AT:RVET(c) of VLBW infants, as calculated by pulsed Doppler echocardiography, differed with their gestational age and did not appear to correlate well with PAP. Our data also suggest that AT:RVET(c) values may not be a good predictor of the subsequent occurrence of CLD in VLBW infants."

While it is mostly seen in term and near-term infants, it can be recognized in some premature infants with respiratory distress or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Most commonly, PPHN is secondary to delayed or impaired relaxation of the pulmonary vasculature associated with diverse neonatal pulmonary pathologies, such as meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and respiratory distress syndrome. Gentle ventilation strategies, lung recruitment, inhaled nitric oxide, and surfactant therapy have improved outcome and reduced the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in PPHN. Newer modalities of treatment discussed in this article include systemic and inhaled vasodilators like sildenafil, prostaglandin E1, prostacyclin, and endothelin antagonists. With prompt recognition/treatment and early referral to ECMO centers, the mortality rate for PPHN has significantly decreased. However, the risk of potential neurodevelopmental impairment warrants close follow-up after discharge for infants with PPHN."

Agglomerative hierarchical clustering on principal components was used to divide the data into different clusters based on common characteristics. Two distinct subphenotypes of preterm infants with hemodynamically significant PDA were identified: \"inflamed,\" characterized by high leukocyte, neutrophil, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and \"respiratory acidosis,\" characterized by low pH and high pCO2 levels. Conclusions: This study suggests that there may be two distinct subphenotypes of preterm infants with hemodynamically significant PDA: \"inflamed\" and \"respiratory acidosis.\" By dividing the population into different subgroups based on common characteristics, it is possible to get a more nuanced understanding of the effectiveness of PDA interventions.

            "abstract": "Both \"new\" and \"old\" bronchopulmonary dysplasia features overlap in preterm infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The optimal ventilation strategy for infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia has not been clarified yet. Principally, the lung is a multi-com- partmental heterogeneous tissue with regionally varying compliance and resistance. Generally, 2 critical strategical errors are common while ventilating infants with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia: (i) ventilatory management as if they are still in the acute phase of respiratory distress syndrome and (ii) early extubation attempts with the aim of reducing ventilator-induced lung injury. Considering the heterogeneous character of bronchopulmo- nary dysplasia, although there is no unique formulation for optimal ventilation, the most physi- ologically appropriate ventilation mode may be the combined mode of volume-guaranteed synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation and pressure support ventilation. With the volume-guaranteed synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation mode, slow compart- ments of the lung with high resistance and low compliance can be adequately ventilated, while fast compartments having relatively normal resistance and compliance can be venti- lated well with the pressure support ventilation mode. The following settings are advisable: frequency = 12-20 breaths per minute, tidal volume = 10-15 mL/min, positive end expiratory pressure = 7-12 cmH2O, and inspiratory to expiratory time ratio = 1 : 5. Higher oxygen satura- tions such as 92%-95% should be targeted to avoid subsequent pulmonary hypertension. In conclusion, there is no evidence-based ventilation recommendation for infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, given the changing pattern of the disease and the underlying pathophysiology, these infants should not be ventilated as if they were in the acute phase of respiratory distress syndrome."

While advances in neonatal care have resulted in improved survival rates of premature infants, limited progress has been made in reducing rates of BPD. Lack of progress may in part be attributed to the limited therapeutic options available for prevention and treatment of BPD. Several lung-protective strategies have been shown to reduce risks, including use of non-invasive support, as well as early extubation and volume ventilation when intubation is required. These approaches, along with optimal nutrition and medical therapy, decrease risk of BPD; however, impacts on long-term outcomes are poorly defined. Characterization of late outcomes remain a challenge as rapid advances in medical management result in current adult BPD survivors representing outdated neonatal care. While pulmonary disease improves with growth, long-term follow-up studies raise concerns for persistent pulmonary dysfunction; asthma-like symptoms and exercise intolerance in young adults after BPD. Abnormal ventilatory responses and pulmonary hypertension can further complicate disease. These pulmonary morbidities, combined with environmental and infectious exposures, may result in significant long-term pulmonary sequalae and represent a growing burden on health systems. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine outcomes beyond the second decade, and define risk factors and optimal treatment for late sequalae of disease."

To determinne the impact of hyperoxia on pulmonary artery (PA) cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling in a murine model of lung injury and PH, neonatal C57BL/6 mice were placed in room air, 75% O2 for 14 days (chronic hyperoxia [CH]) or 75% O2 for 24 hours, followed by 13 days of room air (acute hyperoxia with recovery [AHR]) with or without sildenafil. At 14 days, mean alveolar area, PA medial wall thickness (MWT), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and vessel density were assessed. PA protein was analyzed for cGMP, soluble guanylate cyclase, and PDE5 activity. CH and AHR mice had RVH, but only CH mice had increased alveolar area and MWT and decreased vessel density. In CH and AHR PAs, soluble guanylate cyclase activity was decreased, and PDE5 activity was increased. In CH mice, sildenafil attenuated MWT and RVH but did not improve mean alveolar area or vessel density. In CH and AHR PAs, sildenafil decreased PDE5 activity and increased cGMP. Our results indicate that prolonged hyperoxia leads to lung injury, PH, RVH, and disrupted PA cGMP signaling. Furthermore, 24 hours of hyperoxia causes RVH and disrupted PA cGMP signaling that persists for 13 days. Sildenafil reduced RVH and restored vascular cGMP signaling but did not attenuate lung injury. Thus, hyperoxia can rapidly disrupt PA cGMP signaling in vivo with sustained effects, and concurrent sildenafil therapy can be protective."

            "abstract": "Despite efforts to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, some preterm infants require positive pressure support after 36 weeks' post-menstrual age. Infants with severe BPD typically experience progressive mismatch of ventilation and perfusion, which manifests as respiratory distress, hypoxemia in room air, hypercarbia, and growth failure. Lung compliance varies, but lung resistance generally increases with prolonged exposure to positive pressure ventilation and other sources of inflammation. Serial lung radiographs reveal a heterogeneous pattern, with areas of both hyperinflation and atelectasis; in extreme cases, macrocystic changes may be noted. Efforts to wean the respiratory support are often unsuccessful, and trials of high frequency ventilation, exogenous corticosteroids, and diuretics are common. The incidence of pulmonary hypertension increases with the severity of BPD, as does the mortality rate. Therefore, periodic screening and efforts to mitigate the risk of PH is fundamental to the management of longstanding BPD. Failure of conventional, lung-protective strategies (e.g., high rate/low tidal-volume and/or high frequency ventilation) warrants consideration of ventilatory strategies individualized to the disease physiology. Non-invasive modes of respiratory support may be successful in infants with mild to moderate BPD phenotypes. However, infants with moderate to severe BPD phenotypes often require invasive respiratory support, and pressure-limited or volume-targeted conventional ventilation may be better suited to the physiology than high-frequency ventilation. The consistent provision of adequate support is fundamental to the management of longstanding BPD and is best achieved with a stepwise increase in ventilator support until comfortable spontaneous respirations are achieved. Adequately supported infants typically experience improvements in both oxygenation and ventilation, which, if sustained, may arrest and generally reverses the course of a potentially lethal lung disease. Care should be individualized to address the most likely pulmonary mechanics, including variable lung compliance, elevated airway resistance, and variable airway obstruction."

            "abstract": "More than 50 years after the first description of Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) by Northway, this chronic lung disease affecting many preterm infants is still poorly understood. Additonally, approximately 40% of preterm infants suffering from severe BPD also suffer from Bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH), leading to a significant increase in total morbidity and mortality. Until today, there is no curative therapy for both BPD and BPD-PH available. It has become increasingly evident that growth factors are playing a central role in normal and pathologic development of the pulmonary vasculature. Thus, this review aims to summarize the recent evidence in our understanding of BPD-PH from a basic scientific point of view, focusing on the potential role of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)/FGF10 signaling pathway contributing to disease development, progression and resolution."

Pulmonary artery hypertension was graded through echocardiography for all patients; 13 patients also underwent cardiac catheterization.\n## RESULTS\nEighteen (43%) of 42 patients had severe pulmonary artery hypertension (systemic or suprasystemic right ventricular pressure). Among 13 patients who underwent catheterization, the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 43 +/- 8 mmHg and the pulmonary vascular resistance index was 9.9 +/- 2.8 Wood units. In 12 patients, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance improved with 100% oxygen and 80 ppm inhaled nitric oxide but remained elevated. The pulmonary vascular resistance index decreased to 7.9 +/- 3.8 Wood units in 100% oxygen and to 6.4 +/- 3.1 Wood units with the addition of nitric oxide. Sixteen patients (38%) died during the follow-up period. Estimated survival rates were 64% +/- 8% at 6 months and 53% +/- 11% at 2 years after diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension. In multivariate analyses, severe pulmonary artery hypertension and small birth weight for gestational age were associated with worse survival rates. Among 26 survivors (median follow-up period: 9.8 months), pulmonary artery hypertension was improved, relative to its most severe level, in 24 patients (89%).\n## CONCLUSION\nPremature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and severe pulmonary artery hypertension are at high risk of death, particularly during the first 6 months after diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension.\n"

            "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension has emerged as a life-threatening disease in preterm infants suffering from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Its development is closely linked to respiratory disease, as vasculogenesis and alveologenesis are closely interconnected. Once clinically significant, BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) can be challenging to manage, due to poor reversibility and multiple comorbidities frequently associated. The pulmonary vascular disease process underlying BPD-PH is the result of multiple innate and acquired factors, and emerging evidence suggests that it progressively develops since birth and, in certain instances, may begin as early as fetal life. Therefore, early recognition and intervention are of great importance in order to improve long-term outcomes. Based on the most recent knowledge of BPD-PH pathophysiology, we review state-of-the-art screening and diagnostic imaging techniques currently available, their utility for clinicians, and their applicability and limitations in this specific population. We also discuss some biochemical markers studied in humans as a possible complement to imaging for the detection of pulmonary vascular disease at its early stages and the monitoring of its progression. In the second part, we review pharmacological agents currently available for BPD-PH treatment or under preclinical investigation, and discuss their applicability, as well as possible approaches for early-stage interventions in fetuses and neonates. IMPACT: BPD-associated PH is a complex disease involving genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as environmental exposures starting from fetal life. The value of combining multiple imaging and biochemical biomarkers is emerging, but requires larger, multicenter studies for validation and diffusion. Since \"single-bullet\" approaches have proven elusive so far, combined pharmacological regimen and cell-based therapies may represent important avenues for research leading to future cure and prevention."

There is evidence implicating that functional echo alters neonatal treatment and may improve outcome. Functional echo does not aim to replace the detailed structural assessments provided by consultative services of pediatric cardiologists. Close collaboration with pediatric cardiology is essential.

            "abstract": "Chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity is a common disorder in preterm infants who were ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) at birth. Premature birth, mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen are the major risk factors for the development of CLD. Although the exact pathophysiology is unclear, recent evidence suggests that pulmonary inflammation may play a pivotal role in the development of CLD. Histologically, the evolution of CLD can be divided into an early inflammatory phase followed by a subacute and chronic fibroproliferative phase. The early, inflammatory phase of CLD is clinically indistinguishable from RDS. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid an influx of inflammatory cells and increased levels of cytokines can be found. Pathological examination of the lungs reveals persisting hyaline membranes, necrosis of airway and alveolar epithelium and an influx of inflammatory cells in the lung. In the subacute fibroproliferative or reparative phase of CLD, persistent respiratory distress and hypercapnia are seen and patients require oxygen with or without ventilatory support. Histologically, this phase is characterized by hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, hypertrophy of bronchial and bronchiolar smooth muscle and interstitial and perialveolar fibrosis. In the chronic fibroproliferative phase (up to 1 yr), airway remodelling occurs. Respiratory distress continues and many patients remain oxygen dependent. Cyanotic spells are frequently seen and chronic hypoxia may lead to pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Many patients have severe feeding problems and somatic growth is poor. In surviving patients, persisting lung function abnormalities are found. Airway resistance and airway responsiveness are increased and residual volume (RV) and RV/total lung capacity ratios remain elevated, indicating air trapping. Although lung function improves during childhood, residual abnormalities are still found in young adults, raising concerns about the evolution of pulmonary function in old age."

The challenge in BPD management is the lack of effective and safe antiinflammatory agents. Leukadherin-1 (LA1) is a novel agonist of the leukocyte surface integrin CD11b/CD18 that enhances leukocyte adhesion to ligands and vascular endothelium and thus reduces leukocyte transendothelial migration and influx to the injury sites. Its functional significance in preventing hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that administration of LA1 is beneficial in preventing hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, an experimental model of BPD. Newborn rats were exposed to normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (85% O2) and received twice-daily intraperitoneal injection of LA1 or placebo for 14 days. Hyperoxia exposure in the presence of the placebo resulted in a drastic increase in the influx of neutrophils and macrophages into the alveolar airspaces. This increased leukocyte influx was accompanied by decreased alveolarization and angiogenesis and increased pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension (PH), the pathological hallmarks of BPD. However, administration of LA1 decreased macrophage infiltration in the lungs during hyperoxia. Furthermore, treatment with LA1 improved alveolarization and angiogenesis and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. These data indicate that leukocyte recruitment plays an important role in the experimental model of BPD induced by hyperoxia. Targeting leukocyte trafficking using LA1, an integrin agonist, is beneficial in preventing lung inflammation and protecting alveolar and vascular structures during hyperoxia. Thus, targeting integrin-mediated leukocyte recruitment and inflammation may provide a novel strategy in preventing and treating BPD in preterm infants."

            "abstract": "Does inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) during high-frequency ventilation (HFV) lead to a more pronounced improvement in oxygenation than iNO during conventional ventilation? We report two cases of newborn infants with profound hypoxaemia, who did not respond with an increase in arterial oxygenation following iNO therapy during conventional mechanical ventilation. The first infant was a term neonate with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) following postnatal hypoxia, the second patient a premature infant of 29 weeks of gestation with PPHN secondary to lung hypoplasia and perinatal asphyxia. After the initial failure of iNO we switched both neonates to HFV without NO, which did not lead to a significant improvement of oxygenation in either case. Shortly after the initiation of HFV a second trial of iNO was started. Both infants responded favourably to iNO with a marked and sustained increase in arterial oxygenation and absent right-to-left shunting via the ductus arteriosus and the foramen ovale. We conclude that the favourable response to inhaled nitric oxide is dependent on the degree of lung expansion and is more readily achieved by the use of high-frequency ventilation than conventional ventilation."

The echocardiogram showed evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). There are a number of well-known causes of neonatal HCM including genetic, metabolic and endocrine. PDA is commonly present in preterm infants, and this can contribute to cardiac remodelling and result in cardiac changes mimicking HCM. Furthermore, medications such as steroids can also cause HCM through various mechanisms. A careful consideration of all the different aetiologies for HCM is important for appropriate management of such cases.

Accumulating evidence shows that dysregulated metabolism of glucose, lipids and amino acids are observed in premature infants. Animal and cell studies demonstrate that abnormal metabolism of these substrates results in apoptosis, inflammation, reduced migration, abnormal proliferation or senescence in response to hyperoxic exposure, and that rectifying metabolic dysfunction attenuates neonatal hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification and vascular dysgenesis in the lung. BPD is often associated with several comorbidities, including pulmonary hypertension and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, which significantly increase the morbidity and mortality of this disease. Here, we discuss recent progress on dysregulated metabolism of glucose, lipids and amino acids in premature infants with BPD and in related in vivo and in vitro models. These findings suggest that metabolic dysregulation may serve as a biomarker of BPD and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. We also highlight that targeting metabolic pathways could be employed in the prevention and treatment of BPD."

            "abstract": "Administration of supplemental oxygen remains a critical clinical intervention for survival of preterm infants with respiratory failure. However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia can augment pulmonary damage, resulting in developmental lung diseases embodied as hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We sought to investigate the role of autophagy in hyperoxia-induced apoptotic cell death in developing lungs. We identified increased autophagy signaling in hyperoxia-exposed mouse lung epithelial-12 cells, freshly isolated fetal type II alveolar epithelial cells, lungs of newborn wild-type mice, and human newborns with respiratory distress syndrome and evolving and established BPD. We found that hyperoxia exposure induces autophagy in a Trp53-dependent manner in mouse lung epithelial-12 cells and in neonatal mouse lungs. Using pharmacological inhibitors and gene silencing techniques, we found that the activation of autophagy, upon hyperoxia exposure, demonstrated a protective role with an antiapoptotic response. Specifically, inhibiting regulatory-associated protein of mechanistic target of rapamycin (RPTOR) in hyperoxia settings, as evidenced by wild-type mice treated with torin2 or mice administered (Rptor) silencing RNA via intranasal delivery or Rptor+/-, limited lung injury by increased autophagy, decreased apoptosis, improved lung architecture, and increased survival. Furthermore, we identified increased protein expression of phospho-beclin1, light chain-3-II and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, suggesting altered autophagic flux in the lungs of human neonates with established BPD. Collectively, our study unveils a novel demonstration of enhancing autophagy and antiapoptotic effects, specifically through the inhibition of RPTOR as a potentially useful therapeutic target for the treatment of hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and BPD in developing lungs."

Case description A 9-year-old girl was admitted to our department to undergo BLTx. She was born at 23 weeks and 4 days gestation with a weight of 507 g. She received ventilation for the first 2 months and required further respiratory care due to repetitive, severe respiratory infections. She was diagnosed with BPD-PH at 6 months of age and oral administration of pulmonary vasodilators were initiated. She was registered as a lung transplant candidate at 4 years of age after the life-threatening exacerbation. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed severe lung conditions with ground-glass opacities and emphysematous low-density areas in the upper and lower lobes. BLTx from a brain-dead male donor was performed. The pathological findings of her resected lung revealed saccular, hypoplastic lung with alveolar repair/regeneration, and medial hypertrophy and muscularization of peripheral arteries.

High frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV) compared to slow rate ventilation significantly reduced the incidence of airleaks, but this has yet to be confirmed in infants routinely exposed to antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant. Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) is useful for infants with obstructive or mixed apnoea and reduces the need for extra respiratory support following extubation, whether it reduces chronic lung disease (CLD) remains to be appropriately tested. Randomised trials have failed to identify long term benefits of patient triggered ventilation (PTV) in infants with acute respiratory distress; but it is the most efficacious mode of weaning. High volume strategy, high frequency oscillation (HFO), if commenced within 24 hours of birth, lowers the CLD rate, but may increase airleak and intracranial pathology. Nitric oxide (NO) can improve oxygenation in preterm infants with suspected pulmonary hypertension, but does not appear to influence outcome. Liquid ventilation is a promising, but relatively untested technique in preterm infants. Ventilator techniques have not been rigorously examined in infants developing or with established CLD. It is essential that the relative merits of new respiratory support techniques are compared in well designed studies which include infants with acute and chronic respiratory distress, only then can their appropriate roles in the management of prematurely born infants be identified."

Substantial advances into the understanding of its pathophysiology and pathogenesis have been made and are reflected in new therapeutic interventions. Much current research is directed towards the role of prevention, exploring new approaches for accelerating lung maturation with combined maternal steroid and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) therapy, surfactant replacement therapy, high frequency oscillatory ventilation, antioxidant administration, manipulation of endogenous antioxidants, and other pharmacologic strategies to minimize lung injury. The impact of other technologies, such as synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, perfluorocarbon (liquid) ventilation, and perhaps inhaled nitric oxide therapy may become additional parts of the clinical regimen for some cases of severe neonatal respiratory failure. Less information is available on mechanisms which can hasten lung healing. Ongoing studies of inflammatory products, growth factors, and cytokines may lead to new therapies which will favorably influence the fibroproliferative phase of disease. In the meantime, the medical and social impact of BPD continues to remain a significant problem not only during infancy but also throughout life. Mildred Stahlman, MD, recently wrote that (a)s sanguine as the future looks for surfactant therapy, it may leave us with more very low-birth weight infants who survive, whose potential for normal pulmonary growth and development is unknown, and whose very immature organ systems, besides the lung, are still susceptible to metabolic, neurologic, and other problems. As more survivors are reaching young adulthood, respiratory and neurodevelopmental complications persist.

In summary, pulmonary hypertension is noted in a fifth of extremely low birth weight infants, primarily those with moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and persists to discharge in many infants.

Sildenafil is increasingly used off-label in premature infants despite scant safety and efficacy data. Sildenafil reduces lung injury and preserves normal vasculature in preclinical models, and improves outcomes in children with pulmonary hypertension, and thus is a promising candidate for BPD. Following phase I studies, we developed the phase II SIL02 trial to describe the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary effectiveness of intravenous and enteral sildenafil in premature infants at risk for BPD. SIL02 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-cohort, sequential dose-escalating trial of enteral or intravenous (IV) sildenafil dosed every 8 h for up to 34 days. The target IV doses were 0.125, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/dose in cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively; while the enteral doses will be double the IV doses. Eligible infants must be < 29 weeks' gestation at birth and requiring respiratory support at 7-28 days' postnatal age. Adverse events and preliminary effectiveness will be compared by treatment group. Using the final population PK model, empirical Bayesian estimates will be generated for each patient. Preliminary effectiveness will be measured by the incidence of moderate to severe BPD or death at 36 weeks and change in the BPD risk estimation."

Infants with BPD-PH carry alarmingly high mortality rates of up to 47%. Effective PH-targeted pharmacotherapies are desperately needed for these infants. Although many PH-targeted pharmacotherapies are commonly used to treat BPD-PH, all current use is off-label. Moreover, all current recommendations for the use of any PH-targeted therapy in infants with BPD-PH are based on expert opinion and consensus statements. Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) are needed to determine the efficacy of PH-targeted treatments in premature infants with or at risk of BPD-PH. Prior to performing efficacy RCTs, studies need to be conducted to obtain pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety data for any pharmacotherapy used in this understudied and fragile patient population. This review will discuss current and needed treatment strategies, identify knowledge deficits, and delineate both challenges to be overcome and approaches to be taken to develop effective PH-targeted pharmacotherapies that will improve outcomes for premature infants with or at risk of developing BPD-PH."

Cyanosis as well as clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure in the neonate are unspecific and may represent cardiac and noncardiac disease (primary pulmonary disease, septicemia, intracranial haemorrhage or meningitis, polyglobulism). Besides detailed analysis of clinical symptoms, the examination of arterial bloodgases when breathing from room air and 100% oxygen, the electrocardiogram, the chest-roentgenogram, and the echocardiogram are of diagnostic value. Specific cardiovascular problems during the neonatal period are the patent ductus arteriosus in the premature infant and the so-called persistent fetal circulation. Among the many congenital cardiac defects potentially causing problems in the neonate the most important are complete transposition of the great arteries, coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and severe tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect. With good cooperation between obstetrician, neonatologist and paediatric cardiologist, most neonates with cardiologic problems can nowadays be timely diagnosed and successfully treated."

Investigators are refining the definition of BPD in light of changes in clinical care and increasing survival rates of very preterm infants. Despite improvements in perinatal care the incidence of BPD continues to increase. There is growing recognition that antenatal risk factors play a key role in the development of BPD. Strategies designed to prevent or limit neonatal lung injury continue to evolve. Defining the phenotype of infants with BPD can meaningfully direct treatment. Infants with BPD benefit from an interdisciplinary approach to longitudinal care with a focus on growth and neurocognitive development. While the ultimate impact of BPD on long-term pulmonary morbidity remains an active area of investigation, current data indicate that most children and adolescents with a history of BPD have a quality of life comparable to that of other preterm infants."

Moderate and severe BPD have a worse outcome and relate more frequently with PH. The prediction of moderate or severe BPD development in extremely premature newborns is vital to implement preventive strategies. Starting with the hypothesis that molecular biomarkers were better than clinical and echocardiographic factors, this study aims to explore the ability of clinical, echocardiographic and analytical variables to predict moderate or severe BPD in a cohort of extremely preterm infants.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      We designed a prospective longitudinal study, in which we followed a cohort of preterm newborns (gestational age <28 weeks and weight ≤ 1250 grams).

Injection of BMSC-CM had a more pronounced effect than BMSCs, preventing both vessel remodeling and alveolar injury. Treated animals had normal alveolar numbers at Day 14 of hyperoxia and a drastically reduced lung neutrophil and macrophage accumulation compared with PASMC-CM-treated controls.

IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) is markedly decreased in normal preterm infants, but whether IGF-1 treatment can prevent BPD or PH is unknown.Objectives: To evaluate whether postnatal treatment with rhIGF-1 (recombinant human IGF-1)/BP3 (binding peptide 3) improves lung growth and prevents PH in two antenatal models of BPD induced by intraamniotic exposure to endotoxin (ETX) or sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1), and in a postnatal model due to prolonged hyperoxia.Methods: ETX or sFlt-1 were administered into the amniotic sac of pregnant rats at Embryonic Day 20 to simulate antenatal models of chorioamnionitis and preeclampsia, respectively. Pups were delivered by cesarean section at Embryonic Day 22 and treated with rhIGF-1/BP3 (0.02-20 mg/kg/d intraperitoneal) or buffer for 2 weeks. Study endpoints included radial alveolar counts (RACs), vessel density, and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Direct effects of rhIGF-1/BP3 (250 ng/ml) on fetal lung endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation and alveolar type 2 cell proliferation were studied by standard methods in vitro.Measurements and Main Results: Antenatal ETX and antenatal sFlt-1 reduced RAC and decreased RVH in infant rats. In both models, postnatal rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment restored RAC and RVH to normal values when compared with placebo injections. rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment also preserved lung structure and prevented RVH after postnatal hyperoxia. In vitro studies showed that rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment increased lung endothelial cell and alveolar type 2 cell proliferation.Conclusions: Postnatal rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment preserved lung structure and prevented RVH in antenatal and postnatal BPD models. rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment may provide a novel strategy for the prevention of BPD in preterm infants."

With advances in neonatal medicine, this \"old\" bronchopulmonary dysplasia has changed to a \"new\" bronchopulmonary dysplasia characterized by an arrest in lung growth, leading to alveolar simplification and pulmonary vascular dysangiogenesis. While the old definition was based on the need for oxygen supplementation at a postnatal age of 28 days or at a corrected gestational age of 36 weeks, the newer definition looks at the mode of respiratory support required (eg, invasive versus noninvasive) and is then graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia may present with significantly impaired pulmonary function, reactive airway disease, or exercise intolerance. Over time, these patients may develop asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was made. A hemodynamically relevant, persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was surgically ligated after failed pharmacologic PDA closure using indomethacin and ibuprofen. The patient was discharged with an estimated 2/3 systemic pulmonary artery pressure. One month after hospital discharge, on low-flow oxygen supplementation (0.5 L/min FiO2 100%), at the corrected age of 16 weeks, she was readmitted to our emergency department with signs of respiratory distress and circulatory decompensation. Echocardiography demonstrated suprasystemic PH. Severe PH persisted despite initiated invasive mechanical ventilation, triple vasodilating therapy [iNO, macitentan, and continuous intravenous (IV) sildenafil], as well as levosimendan, milrinone, and norepinephrine for recompensation from cardiac shock. Thus, we started off-label oral selexipag therapy (oral IP receptor agonist) in the smallest patient reported so far (4 kg body weight). Subsequently, RV systolic pressure decreased to half-systemic, allowing successful weaning of iNO, norepinephrine, and milrinone, and extubation of the patient over 4 days. The infant was discharged 4 weeks after pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission in stable cardiorespiratory condition, with an oral, specific, triple antihypertensive PAH-targeted therapy using selexipag, macitentan, and sildenafil as well as oxygen therapy at low-flow (0.5 l/min) and spironolactone. The first cardiac catheterization at the age of 9 months under aforementioned triple PAH-targeted therapy revealed mild PH with 35% systemic PA pressure (mPAP/mSAP = 0.35) and isolated pulmonary vein stenosis. A transthoracic biopsy at the age of 12 months confirmed the diagnosis of BPD and further showed pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis and severe pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, without involvement of the pulmonary venules (chILD A2, A3, and B4 according to the Deutsch-Classification). The patient is currently in stable cardiorespiratory condition undergoing triple PH-targeted therapy including selexipag.

There was no significant difference between the postnatal ages of two groups (p > 0.05). Neither pulmonary hypertension nor pulmonary/tricuspid regurgitation was detected. The M-mode echocardiography measurements did not differ between patients and control group (p > 0.05). Tissue doppler echocardiography, tricuspid valve medial segment early diastolic myocardial relaxation velocity (TME') measurements of patients were found significantly lower, peak transtricuspid filling velocity in the early diastole (TE)/TME' ratios and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) measurements were found significantly higher than control group (p < 0.05). Tricuspid E, TE/TLE' (Tricuspid valve lateral segment early diastolic myocardial relaxation velocity), TE/RVLE'(Right ventricular lateral segment early diastolic myocardial relaxation velocity), TE/TME' levels were also found as significantly abnormal in patients with severe BPD. A significant correlation was found between right ventricular diastolic disfunctions and severity of BPD (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between NT-proBNP levels, BPD stages and tissue doppler echocardiography measurements (p > 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This is the first study evaluating cardiac findings in patients with BPD by tissue doppler echocardiography and NT-proBNP at the same time. On the basis of cardiac evaluations, tissue doppler echocardiography measurements were found as significant and specific for the early assessment of right ventricular diastolic disfunctions."

The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial, and the clinical phenotype is variable. BPD is associated with substantial mortality and short- and long-term morbidity. The incidence of BPD has remained stable or increased, as advances in neonatal care have led to improved survival of more extremely preterm infants. Extensive basic science, translational, and clinical research focusing on BPD has improved the current understanding of the factors that contribute to BPD pathogenesis. However, despite a better understanding of its pathophysiology, BPD continues to be challenging to prevent and manage adequately.

            "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension secondary to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD-PH) represents a major complication of BPD in extremely preterm infants for which there are currently no safe and effective interventions. The abundance of interleukin-1 (IL-1) is strongly correlated with the severity and long-term outcome of BPD infants and we have previously shown that IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) protects against murine BPD; therefore, we hypothesized that IL-1Ra may also be effective against BPD-PH. We employed daily injections of IL-1Ra in a murine model in which BPD/BPD-PH was induced by antenatal LPS and postnatal hyperoxia of 65% O2. Pups reared in hyperoxia for 28 days exhibited a BPD-PH-like disease accompanied by significant changes in pulmonary vascular morphology: micro-CT revealed an 84% reduction in small vessels (4-5 μm diameter) compared to room air controls; this change was prevented by IL-1Ra. Pulmonary vascular resistance, assessed at day 28 of life by echocardiography using the inversely-related surrogate marker time-to-peak-velocity/right ventricular ejection time (TPV/RVET), increased in hyperoxic mice (0.27 compared to 0.32 in air controls), and fell significantly with daily IL-1Ra treatment (0.31). Importantly, in vivo cine-angiography revealed that this protection afforded by IL-1Ra treatment for 28 days is maintained at day 60 of life. Despite an increased abundance of mediators of pulmonary angiogenesis in day 5 lung lysates, namely vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), no difference was detected in ex vivo pulmonary vascular reactivity between air and hyperoxia mice as measured in precision cut lung slices, or by immunohistochemistry in alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and endothelin receptor type-A (ETA) at day 28. Further, on day 28 of life we observed cardiac fibrosis by Sirius Red staining, which was accompanied by an increase in mRNA expression of galectin-3 and CCL2 (chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2) in whole hearts of hyperoxic pups, which improved with IL-1Ra. In summary, our findings suggest that daily administration of the anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra prevents the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and the pulmonary dysangiogenesis of murine BPD-PH, thus pointing to IL-1Ra as a promising candidate for the treatment of both BPD and BPD-PH."

However, there is no effective and safe treatment for PH due to BPD in infants. Successful treatment for cases of BPD-associated PH with Tadalafil combined with bosentan is rare. This case may make a significant contribution to the literature because PH is difficult to manage as a serious complication of BPD in preterm infants. Mortality is high, especially when it is complicated by heart failure.\n    \n\n\n          Case summary:\n        \n      \n      An extremely premature neonate with a gestational age of 26+5 wk and birth weight of 0.83 kg was diagnosed with BPD associated with PH; oral sildenafil did not improve the PH. The infant experienced sudden cardiac arrest and serious heart failure with severe PH. After a series of treatments, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), the respiratory and circulatory status improved but the pulmonary artery pressure remained high. Then oral sildenafil was replaced with oral tadalafil and bosentan; pulmonary artery pressure improved, and the infant recovered at our hospital. After 2 years of follow-up, she is in good condition, without any cardiovascular complications.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      INO can effectively improve the respiratory and circulatory status of infants with PH associated with premature BPD. B-type natriuretic peptide should be routinely measured during hospitalization to evaluate the risk and prognosis of BPD-associated PH in preterm infants. Tadalafil combined with bosentan for the treatment of PH associated with premature BPD was better than sildenafil in this case. Further studies are needed to explore the efficacy and safety of different vasodilators in the treatment of PH associated with premature BPD."

From January 1989 to December 1995, of 369 premature newborns in their first postnatal week, 196 underwent ductal evaluations echocardiographically: 47 of these 196 cases were found to have PDA. Each echocardiogram had complete data for cardiac output, ejection fraction, the left atrial-to-the-aortic ratio (LA/AO), the systolic time interval of the right ventricle (RVSTI), the transvalvular pressure gradient from tricuspid regurgitation (TGTR) and ductal Doppler color flow maps. These 47 premature newborns with PDA were grouped into (A) \"asymptomatic\" patients whose ductus closed spontaneously within a one-year follow-up (15 subjects), (B) \"symptomatic\" patients whose ductus were closed by pharmacological or surgical managements (20 subjects), and (C) \"complicated\" patients whose ductus caused mortality of the host (12 subjects). The remaining 149 premature newborns with a closed ductus (CD) served as controls. The RVSTI in these 47 premature newborns with PDA was found to be significantly higher than those of 149 CD (0.26 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.06, p < 0.005), and denoting that PM-PDA had a higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure.

The birth weight of Group C neonates was lower than that of Group A (1366.17 +/- 684.28 gm vs. 2061.67 +/- 751.77 gm. p < 0.01), therefore, extreme prematurity and small-for-gestational-age could have increased the mortality of PM-PDA. Doppler color flow maps of group C showed a wider ductal patency, less ductal waist-narrowing, more vehement red-color forward flow and less midstream mosaicism.

Hyperoxia (95-100 %O2) causes DNA damage and growth arrest of lung cells and consequently cells die by apoptosis or necrosis. Although supplemental oxygen therapy is clinically important, the level and duration of hyperoxic exposure that would allow lung cells to reenter the cell cycle remains unclear. We hypothesized that cells exposed to lower concentrations of hyperoxia will retain the capacity to enter cell cycle when recovered in room air. We employed varying concentrations of oxygen (21-95 %) to determine the response of lung cells to hyperoxia. Our results indicate that cells were growth arrested and failed to reenter the cell cycle when exposed to greater than 60 % oxygen. Cell cycle checkpoint proteins were increased in a biphasic manner, increasing until 70 % oxygen, but declined in greater than 90 % oxygen. Microarray analysis shows that there is significant decrease in the abundance of Cdks 6-8 and retinoblastoma protein (Rb), p107 and p130 in exposure to 90 % oxygen for 48 h. We further tested the effect of clinically relevant as needed oxygen [(pro-re-nata (prn)] in premature infant (125-days and 140-days) baboon model of BPD.

The approved and solidly evidence-based indication is for treatment of late preterm and term infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN); however, off-label use of iNO has become widespread. Although iNO treatment of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia constitutes one of the approved indications, available evidence from randomized trials suggests marginal if any efficacy. Rescue therapy in preterm infants with severe respiratory failure has been studied extensively and is not supported by data from a number of controlled trials. Such use is widespread, but should be discouraged. There may be a subgroup of such infants with pulmonary hypoplasia and documented PPHN who may benefit from this treatment, but the data are limited. Several studies have examined the use of iNO for prevention of chronic lung disease with inconsistent results. This promising application requires more study before it can be recommended. There may be a role of iNO in treating infants with pulmonary hypertension complicating severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but there are limited data on long term outcomes. Alternate therapies such as sildenafil may be beneficial in this specific population as well as in other causes of pulmonary hypertension.

We sought to determine the effects, if any, of the interaction of inhaled INO with ET-1 in these two separate disorders. Infants (n=21) with PPHN (mean gestation age, 39.4 weeks; mean birth weight, 3470 g) were treated with INO. All infants were <72 h of age at baseline. Plasma obtained at baseline and after 24 h of INO therapy was assessed for ET-1. The change in ET-1 levels with INO was inversely correlated with change in arterial partial pressure of O(2) (r=-0.71, P=0.0003). A separate group of 33 patients with CLD (mean gestational age, 27 weeks; mean birth weight, 740 g; mean age, 19 days) had tracheal aspirate levels of ET-1 obtained before, during, and after 7 days' administration of INO.

There was not a significant correlation between baseline fractional inspired O(2) and ET-1 levels. There was a non-significant trend in the correlation between the change in ET-1 and the change in interleukin-8 levels in tracheal aspirate. This report confirms the presence of ET-1 in tracheal aspirate of premature infants who are developing CLD and reaffirms the presence of ET-1 in plasma of infants with PPHN. Short-term INO therapy was associated with a decrease in plasma ET-1 levels in PPHN, but did not affect tracheal aspirate ET-1 in CLD. Given the vasconstrictive, profibrotic, and proinflammatory properties of ET-1, specific ET-1 receptor antagonists could be considered as candidates for trials as adjunct therapy in either or both of these disorders."

Basic clinical data on the perinatal period, echocardiographic measurements, and molecular biomarkers (N-terminal-pro-B-brain natriuretic peptide, NT-proBNP) were collected. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to establish an early predictive model for detecting BPD development in preterm infants of gestational age ≤32 weeks. We also used a receiver operating characteristic curve to assess the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No significant differences were found between the BPD and non-BPD groups in terms of sex, birth weight, gestational age, incidence of asphyxia, maternal age, gravidity, parity, mode of delivery, premature rupture of membranes >18 h, use of prenatal hormones, placental abruption, gestational diabetes mellitus, amniotic fluid contamination, prenatal infections, and maternal diseases. The use of caffeine, albumin, gamma globulin; ventilation; days of FiO2 ≥ 40%; oxygen inhalation time; red blood cell suspension infusion volume (ml/kg); and proportion of infants who received total enteral nutrition (120 kcal/kg.d) ≥24 d after birth were higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group. The levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and albumin in the BPD group were significantly lower than those in the non-BPD group. The total calorie intake was significantly lower in the BPD group on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th day after birth than in the non-BPD group (P < 0.05). The incidence rates of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), pulmonary hypertension, and tricuspid regurgitation were significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group (P < 0.05).

Prostacyclin (50 ng x kg(-1)) was injected as an endotracheal bolus. In two patients the prostacyclin bolus was repeated and in one patient prostacyclin was administered continuously. Oxygenation was evaluated through the oxygenation index and the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen. The mean arterial blood pressure was used to evaluate systemic circulation. The oxygenation index (+/-SD) decreased significantly from 39 (+/-13.3) to 7 (+/-2.5) and the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (+/-SD) increased significantly from 47 (+/-13) to 218 (+/-67), most likely related to a reduction of the pulmonary vascular resistance with a reversal of the extrapulmonary shunting at the ductus arteriosus and atrial level. The blood pressure did not change. All effects were reversed on drug withdrawal. Repeated or continuous endotracheal administration of prostacyclin in three children demonstrated a sustained response without tachyphylaxis, and without overt side-effects. Endotracheal instillation of prostacyclin resulted in an improved oxygenation without systemic vascular repercussions in four preterm infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension.

            "abstract": "The present review considers some controversial management practices during extremely premature perinatal transition. We focus on perinatal prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in immature infants. New concerns regarding antenatal corticosteroid management have been raised. Many fetuses are only exposed to potential adverse effects of the drug. Hence, the formulation and the dosage may need to be modified. Another challenge is to increase the fraction of the high-risk fetuses that benefit from the drug and to minimize the harmful effects of the drug. On the other hand, boosting anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties of surfactant requires further attention. Techniques of prophylactic surfactant administration to extremely immature infants at birth may be further refined. Also, new findings suggest that prophylactic treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) of a high-risk population rather than later selective closure of PDA may be preferred. The TREOCAPA trial (Prophylactic treatment of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants by acetaminophen) evaluates, whether early intravenous paracetamol decreases the serious cardiorespiratory consequences following extremely premature birth. Lastly, is inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) used in excess? According to current evidence, iNO treatment of uncomplicated RDS is not indicated. Considerably less than 10% of all very premature infants are affected by early persistence of pulmonary hypertension (PPHN). According to observational studies, effective ventilation combined with early iNO treatment are effective in management of this previously fatal disease. PPHN is associated with prolonged rupture of fetal membranes and birth asphyxia. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immunotolerance and hypoxia-reperfusion-induced oxidant stress may inactivate NO-synthetases in pulmonary arterioles and terminal airways. Prospective trials on iNO in the management of PPHN are indicated. Other pulmonary vasodilators may be considered as comparison drugs or adjunctive drugs. The multidisciplinary challenge is to understand the regulation of pregnancy duration and the factors participating the onset of extremely premature preterm deliveries and respiratory adaptation. Basic research aims to identify deficiencies in maternal and fetal tissues that predispose to very preterm births and deteriorate the respiratory adaptation of immature infants. Better understanding on causes and prevention of extremely preterm births would eventually provide effective antenatal and neonatal management practices required for the intact survival."

We previously reported the expression profile of APN and its receptors in neonatal rat lung homogenates during the first 3 weeks of postnatal development. Here, we characterize the expression profile of APN and its receptors in specific lung cells and the effects of exogenous recombinant APN (rAPN) on lipopolysaccharide-(LPS)-induced cytokine and chemokine production in total lung homogenates and specific lung cells. In vitro, rAPN added to primary cultures of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells attenuated the expression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, intraperitoneal rAPN (2 mg/kg), given 4 hr prior to intrapharyngeal administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) to newborn rats at postnatal day 4, significantly reduced gene and protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ß and reduced protein expression of the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α) in the lung. LPS-induced histopathological changes in the lung were also decreased. Moreover, rAPN given 20 hr after intrapharyngeal LPS had a similar effect on lung inflammation.

BPD is a multifactorial disease and its rising incidence in recent years means that general pediatricians are much more likely to encounter a child born extremely preterm, possibly with BPD, in their clinical practice. Short- and long-term sequelae in VLBW patients may affect not only pulmonary function (principally characterized by an obstructive pattern), but also other aspect including the neurological (neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders), the sensorial (earing and visual impairment), the cardiological (systemic and pulmonary hypertension, reduced exercise tolerance and ischemic heart disease in adult age), nutritional (feeding difficulties and nutritional deficits), and auxological (extrauterine growth restriction). For the most premature infants at least, a multidisciplinary follow-up is warranted after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit in order to optimize their respiratory and neurocognitive potential, and prevent respiratory infections, nutritional deficiencies or cardiovascular impairments. Conclusion: The aim of this review is to summarize the main characteristics of preterm and BPD infants, providing the general pediatrician with practical information regarding these patients' multidisciplinary complex follow-up. We explore the current evidence on respiratory outcomes and their management that actually does not have a definitive available option. We also discuss the available investigations, treatments, and strategies for prevention and prophylaxis to improve the non-respiratory outcomes and the quality of life for these children and their families, a critical aspect not always considered. This comprehensive approach, added to the increased needs of a VLBW subjects, is obviously related to very high health-related costs that should be beared in mind. What is Known: • Every day, a general pediatrician is more likely to encounter a former very low birth weight infant. • Very low birth weight and prematurity are frequently related not only with worse respiratory outcomes, but also with neurological, sensorial, cardiovascular, renal, and nutritional issues. What is New: • This review provides to the general pediatrician a comprehensive approach for the follow-up of former premature very low birth weight children, with information to improve the quality of life of this special population."

            "abstract": "While diagnoses of hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in preterm infants may be based on criteria similar to those in term infants, management approaches often differ. In preterm infants, HRF can be classified as 'early' or 'late' based on an arbitrary threshold of 28 postnatal days. Among preterm infants with late HRF, the pulmonary vascular abnormalities associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) represent a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), sildenafil, prostacyclin and endothelin receptor blockers have been used to manage infants with both early and late HRF. However, evidence is lacking for most therapies currently in use. Chronic oral sildenafil therapy for BPD-associated PH has demonstrated some preliminary efficacy. A favorable response to iNO has been documented in some preterm infants with early PH following premature prolonged rupture of membranes and oligohydramnios. Management is complicated by a lack of clear demarcation between interventions designed to manage respiratory distress syndrome, prevent BPD and treat HRF. Heterogeneity in clinical phenotype, pathobiology and genomic underpinnings of BPD pose challenges for evidence-based management recommendations. Greater insight into the spectrum of disease phenotypes represented by BPD can optimize existing therapies and promote development of new treatments. In addition, better understanding of an individual's phenotype, genotype and biomarkers may suggest targeted personalized interventions. Initiatives such as the Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program provide a framework to address these challenges using genetic, environmental, physiological and clinical data as well as large repositories of patient samples."

We hypothesized that MnSOD increases in human lung in response to oxygen treatment, although this response could be restricted to certain cell types and depend on gestational age. Therefore, the cell-specific expression of pulmonary immunoreactive MnSOD protein was investigated during development, and in patients with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), chronic lung disease (CLD), or persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN). Throughout ontogenesis, all cell types expressed MnSOD, but the most intense positivity was found in bronchiolar epithelium and (pre-) type-II pneumocytes. MnSOD protein did not increase during development. The MnSOD staining pattern in arterial endothelium was more intense in RDS patients than in age-matched controls, but this may be related to induction of MnSOD by increased blood flow rather than by oxygen. MnSOD expression in other cell types of RDS, CLD, or PPHN patients did not differ from that in age-matched controls. We conclude that, in terms of mitochondrial enzymatic superoxide scavenging capacity, preterm infants are not more vulnerable than term infants to oxygen-induced lung injury at physiological oxygen concentrations.

At 36 weeks, none of the infants with mild BPD had PH, whereas 20% of moderate and 32% of severe BPD infants had PH. After controlling for confounding variables severe BPD (OR 3.31, 95%CI 1.12, 9.74), and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (OR 17.9, 95%CI 3.9, 82.11) remained independent risk factors for BPD-associated PH.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Echocardiographic screening for PH can be safely restricted to infants with moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks PMA. We identified VAP as an independent risk factor for PH."

            "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator. The inhaled form (iNO) improves outcomes in term infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary hypertension in preterm infants. However, in preterm infants, the risks and benefits of iNO use are controversial. Substantial evidence reveals no significant impact on survival or other morbidities in preterm infants with iNO treatment, independent of indication, timing, or duration of use. Many scientific organizations do not recommend the use of iNO in preterm infants, except in unique clinical circumstances with echocardiographic findings of PPHN in the setting of presumed pulmonary hypoplasia."

            "title": "Targeted Therapy for Pulmonary Hypertension in Premature Infants.",
            "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and is associated with significant mortality. Despite expert consensus suggesting the use of targeted therapies such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, and prostanoids, there is little data on safety and outcomes in infants with BPD-associated PH (BPD-PH) treated with these medications. We sought to describe the pharmacologic management of BPD-PH and to report outcomes at our institution. Premature infants with BPD-PH born between 2005 and 2016 were included. Follow-up data were obtained through January 2020. A total of 101 patients (61 male, 40 female) were included. Of these, 99 (98.0%) patients were treated with sildenafil, 13 (12.9%) with bosentan, 35 (34.7%) with inhaled iloprost, 12 (11.9%) with intravenous epoprostenol, and nine (8.9%) with subcutaneous treprostinil. A total of 33 (32.7%) patients died during the study period and 10 (9.9%) were secondary to severe to pulmonary hypertension. Of the surviving patients, 57 (83.8%) had follow-up data at a median of 5.1 (range 0.38-12.65) years and 44 (77.2%) were weaned off PH medications at a median 2.0 (range 0-8) years. Mortality for BPD-PH remains high mostly due to co-morbid conditions. However, for those patients that survive to discharge, PH therapies can frequently be discontinued in the first few years of life."
