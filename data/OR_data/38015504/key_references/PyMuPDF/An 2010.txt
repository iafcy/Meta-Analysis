ABSTRACT 
Background and Objectives: With the increasing survival of preterm infants, pulmonary hypertension (PH) re-
lated to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has become an important complication. The aim of this study was 
to investigate the characteristics and outcome of PH in preterm infants with BPD and to identify the risk factors 
for PH. Subjects and Methods: We reviewed the records of 116 preterm infants with BPD cared for at a single ter-
tiary center between 2004 and 2008. Results: Twenty-nine (25%) infants had PH >2 months after birth. PH oc-
curred initially at a median age of 65 days (range, 7-232 days). Severe BPD, a birth weight <800 g, long-term ven-
tilator care and oxygen supplementation, a high ventilator setting, infection, and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 
were related to PH based on univariate analysis (p<0.05). The infants who had longer oxygen supplementation 
were significantly more likely to have PH (odds ratio, 18.5; 95% confidence interval, 4.1-84.6; p<0.001). PH was 
improved in 76% of infants after a median of 85 days (range, 20-765 days). Four infants (14%) died. The death 
of 3 infants was attributed to PH. Conclusion: BPD was frequently complicated by PH. Although PH resolved in 
the majority of infants, PH in preterm infants with BPD can be fatal. Regular screening for PH and adequate man-
agement are required. (Korean Circ J 2010;40:131-136)

Introduction 
 
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung 
disease in preterm infants that occurs following mechani-
cal ventilation and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory 
distress after birth. Despite improvement in perinatal 
care, chronic lung disease after preterm birth remains 
a major problem. BPD is one of the most significant se-
quelae of neonatal intensive care, affecting approxima-
tely 10,000 infants in the United States each year.1) 
Preterm infants with BPD are at high risk of cardio-
vascular sequelae. Pulmonary hypertension (PH), impair-
ed gas exchange due to abnormal vasoregulation, exercise 
intolerance, systemic hypertension, left ventricular hy-
pertrophy, and development of systemic to pulmonary 
collateral vessels may complicate the course.2)3) PH results 
in right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and cardiome-
galy and may lead to right heart failure.4) 
Even though severe PH is one of the life-threatening 
complications in neonates, there are few published stud-
ies on the incidence and prognosis of PH in preterm 
infants with BPD. The aim of this study was to deter-
mine the characteristics and outcome of PH in preterm 
infants and identify the risk factors for PH.  
 
Subjects and Methods 
 
A retrospective study was conducted by reviewing the 
medical records of all infants <32 weeks gestational age 
born between June 2004 and April 2008 at our hospital. 
The diagnosis of PH was made by echocardiography 
based on the following criteria: 1) velocity of tricuspid 
valve regurgitation (TR) ≥3 m/s in the absence of pul-

monary stenosis; and 2) flat or left-deviated interven-
tricular septal configuration, and RVH with chamber 
dilation. Infants with one or both of these findings at 
>2 months of age were characterized as having PH. Se-
ven BPD cases showed echocardiographic evidence of 
PH before 1 month of age, and the PH persisted beyond 
2 months of age; they were included in this study. How-
ever, infants with the typical ‘persistent PH of the new-
born’ were excluded. Infants with persistent foramen 
ovale and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were included 
in the study; however, infants with other congenital heart 
diseases, congenital diaphragmatic hernias, and meco-
nium aspiration syndrome were excluded. Risk factors 
that contribute to PH were analyzed. Improvement of 
PH was defined as a TR ≤2.5 m/s, a diminished amount 
of TR, restoration of interventricular septal configuration, 
regressed RVH and dilation, and discontinuation of oxy-
gen supplementation therapy.  
Definition and grading of BPD were based on Jobe-
Bancalari criteria.5) The severity of BPD was graded ac-
cording to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) or po-
sitive pressure ventilation (PPV), as follows: mild BPD, 
breathing room air; moderate BPD, requiring oxygen 
supplementation (FiO2 of <0.30); and severe BPD, requir-
ing FiO2 of ≥0.30 or PPV at 36 weeks gestational age.5) 
 
Statistical analysis 
Data for infant characteristics were expressed as the 
median and range or mean plus or minus standard de-
viation or percentage. Continuous values between the 
two groups were compared by Student’s t-test. Rate and 
proportion were tested with the chi-square test. Fac-
tors with a p<0.05 by univariate analysis were included 
in the logistic regression analysis. In all analyses, p< 
0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analysis was 
conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences (SPSS), version 12.  
 
Results 
 
General characteristics 
One hundred sixteen preterm infants with BPD met 
the inclusion criteria for this study. The median gesta-
tional age at birth was 26.7 weeks (range, 23.4-31.9 
weeks), and the median birth weight was 805 g (range, 
430-1,560 g) . Thirty-six patients (31%) were small for 
gestational age (SGA) at birth, defined as a weight be-
low the 10th percentile for the estimated gestational age. 
The median age of investigation was 18.5 months (range, 
2-48.5 months). The grades of BPD were classified as 
follows: severe (37%), moderate (37%), and mild (26%). 
Sixty-eight (59%) infants had respiratory distress syn-
drome (RDS) at birth, and 36 (31%) infants had surgi-
cal management for PDA. Seven infants died during 
the study. The characteristics of the infants studied are 
presented in Table 1. 
 
Pulmonary hypertension 
Twenty-nine infants with BPD (25%) met the crite-
ria of PH beyond 2 months of age. PH was initially 
diagnosed at a median postnatal age of 65 days (range, 
7-232 days). The median gestational age at birth was 
26 weeks (range, 23.9-31.0 weeks), and the median birth 
weight was 700 g (range, 430-1,450 g). RDS was diag-
nosed in 21 patients (72%). Severe BPD was diagnosed 
in 25 infants with PH (86%). Among 116 infants with 
BPD, PH was diagnosed in 58% of the infants with se-
vere BPD, 9.3% of the infants with moderate BPD, and 
0% of the infants with mild BPD cases (Fig. 1). The oc-
currence of PH was positively correlated with the seve-
rity of BPD (p<0.001). The degree of TR on echocar-
diography was trivial in 8 (27.6%) infants, mild in 13 
(44.8%) infants, and moderate in 8 (27.6%) infants. 
Right ventricular dilation or hypertrophy was noted in 
20 (68.9%) infants, and 23 infants (79.3%) exhibited a 
flat interventricular septum on echocardiography.

without pulmonary hypertension 
The clinical characteristics of the study infants are 
presented in Table 2. The mean birth weight of the PH 
group was lower than the non-PH group (p<0.02), al-

though the number of infants with a birth weight <3rd 
percentile was similar at birth. Severe BPD was more 
prevalent in the PH group (86%) than the non-PH 
group (20%, p<0.001). The PH group was comprised of 
more infants who had undergone surgery for PDA than 
the non-PH group (48% vs. 27%, p=0.025). The Ap-
gar score at 5 minutes was lower in the PH group than 
in the non-PH group (4.7±1.8 vs. 5.8±1.6, respecti-
vely, p=0.011). The PH group required more resusci-
tation at birth than the non-PH group (97% vs. 79%, 
respectively, p=0.039).  
Except for four of the infants, most of the infants 
had respiratory support, including mechanical venti-
lator and nasal continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) therapy during admission. The duration of ven-
tilator therapy was longer in the PH group than in the 
non-PH group {70 (4-502) days vs. 26 (1-121) days, p< 
0.001}. The duration of oxygen supplementation was 
longer in the PH group (median, 210 days; range, 75-
780 days) than in the non-PH group (median, 82 days; 
range, 30-510 days, p<0.001). The gestational age at dis-
charge was a mean of 44.1±6.4 and 40.9±6.4 days in 
the PH and non-PH groups, respectively (p=0.025). 
The postnatal growth was impaired in both groups from 
birth to discharge (patients with a weight <3rd percen-
tile 13% → 31%, p<0.001 in non-PH; 21% → 61%, 
p<0.001 in PH group). The proportion of low-body 
weight infants (<3rd percentile) was higher in the PH 
group at the time of discharge (31%：61%, p=0.009).  
Severe BPD, birth weight <800 g, long-term use of 
ventilator care and oxygen supplementation, application 
of high-frequency oscillator ventilator (HFO), high po-
sitive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) setting on the ven-
tilator, infection during hospitalization (duration of an-
tibiotic use), and PDA requiring surgical closure were 
related to PH based on univariate analysis (p<0.05) (Ta-
ble 3). Infants who had longer oxygen supplementa-
tion were significantly more likely to have PH than the 
other patients (odds ratio, 18.5; 95% confidence inter-
val, 4.1-84.6; p<0.001). Risk factors that contributed 
to PH were not identified on multivariate analysis. 
 
Outcome and prognosis 
The median duration of follow-up was 484 days 
(range, 18-999 days) in infants with PH. PH improved

in 22 infants (76%) at a median of 85 (range, 20-765 
days) after diagnosis. According to the Kaplan-Meier 
curve, PH improved in 68% of infants by 6 months of 
age and 73% of infants by 1 year of age (Fig. 2). Four 
infants (14%) died during the follow-up period. The 
deaths of 3 of the infants were attributed to PH. The 
death of the remaining infant was due to respiratory 
failure as a result of BPD. PH aggravated the condition 
in 1 infant. Two other patients have shown improved 
lung condition and are awaiting follow-up echocardio-
graphy. The mortality rate of the PH group was higher 
than the non-PH group (14%：3.4%, p=0.043). In-
fants with PH died by a median age of 162 days (range, 
70-274 days), which was a median of 117 days (range, 
42-190 days) after being diagnosed with PH. In the 
non-PH group, 3 infants died. One of them died due 
to sepsis, and the others died because of respiratory fail-
ure aggravated by respiratory infection.  
Pulmonary vasodilator therapy was used to treat 20 
of the PH infants (69%), and included the following: 
inhaled nitric oxide (NO), 13 (44.8%); sildenafil, 18 
(62%); bosentan, 3 (10.3%); and iloprost, 4 (13.8%).  
Inhaled NO was used for a median of 39 days (range, 
2-173 days). Sildenafil was most often administered at 
a median of 2.6 mg (range, 0.7-5 mg)/(kg·day) for a 
median of 186 days (range, 32-1,129 days). Oxygen sup-
plementation therapy was required for a median of 9.5 
months (range, 3-26 months), and PH eventually im-
proved 8.5 months (range, 3.2-29.3 months) later. 
 
Discussion 
 
Although the mechanisms responsible for elevated 
pulmonary vascular resistance and altered reactivity re-
main incompletely understood, the development of PH 
is recognized as a serious complication of BPD that can 
significantly contribute to the morbidity and mortality 
of preterm infants.6)7) One study involving 42 preterm 
infants with BPD complicated by PH (gestational age 
<32 weeks) reported that 43% of the infants had se-
vere PH and the mortality rate was 38%.6) In the current 
study, it was estimated that the prevalence of PH among 
the entire sample of preterm infants with BPD was 25%, 
and the mortality rate in the PH group was 14%. 
We determined the factors related to PH. The fac-
tors, including aggressive mechanical ventilation and 
high inspired oxygen concentrations are known to be 
related to BPD.8) There are many common factors be-
tween BPD and PH; however, we could not identify the 
specific risk factors for PH in preterm infants with BPD 
based on multivariate analysis. In BPD, structural ab-
normalities of the pulmonary vasculature lead to nar-

rowing of vessel diameters and decreased vascular com-
pliance. Decreased angiogenesis is another consequ-
ence of BPD and may contribute to reduce the vascu-
lar cross-sectional area. These factors contribute to ele-
vated pulmonary vascular resistance.6)9) The pulmonary 
circulation in these patients abnormally respond to oxy-
gen and other pulmonary vasodilators.10)  
PH affects the growth of preterm infants. There was no 
difference in the proportion of infants ≤3rd percen-
tile between the PH and the non-PH groups at birth. 
However, at the time of discharge, the proportion of in-
fants ≤3rd percentile increased significantly in the 
PH group. Infants with PH had longer periods of oxy-
gen supplementation and hospital admission than the 
other infants. The need for treatment can affect the qu-
ality of life and the financial status of the infant’s fa-
mily. Although the target systemic arterial oxygen sa-
turation in preterm infants is controversial, long-term 
supplemental oxygen therapy is the standard treatment 
for PH-associated BPD.5)11) There are some reports that 
elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure persists beyond 
infancy and early childhood in preterm infants with 
BPD.12)13) The removal of oxygen should be gradual and 
completed after evaluation of the infant’s condition. 
In the current study, PH was diagnosed at a median 
of 65 days (range, 7-232 days). The gestational age at 
birth was 24-26 weeks in 62% of the infants with PH. 
Early detection of PH is difficult in children. The diag-
nosis of PH in infants and neonates requires a high 
degree of suspicion because the signs and symptoms of 
PH may be subtle and non-specific and masked by un-
derlying BPD, even in infants with significantly elevat-
ed pulmonary artery pressure.14)15) However, there are 
no optimal methods or screening criteria for preterm 
infants with BPD. Doppler echocardiography is a non-
invasive test commonly used to screen and manage PH.16) 
Echocardiography also has limitations as a screening st-
rategy for PH in this population. Specifically, echocar-
diography could fail to detect a measurable TR jet ve-
locity in a significant number of high-risk patients; ab-
sence of a TR jet velocity does not rule out the presence 
of severe PH.14) In the current study, more than mode-
rate TR on echocardiography was observed in only 28% 
of the infants with PH. Because TR is not always meas-
urable, qualitative echocardiographic measures of PH, 
such as right atrial enlargement, RVH, right ventricular 
dilation, and septal flattening, seem to have good sen-
sitivity and a positive predictive value for diagnosing PH 
in children with chronic lung disease; however, the spe-
cificity and negative predictive value are poor.14) 
After discharge from the hospital, the diagnosis of 
PH was confirmed in 4 infants. Although the infants 
may be well at the time of discharge, symptoms of PH 
should be monitored with serial echocardiography.  
This study was limited by its retrospective design. 
Not every infant with BPD in our institution underwent 
echocardiography during the study period. The time of 
diagnosis, improvement, and aggravation may not be 
precise because the evaluation interval was determined 
based on the infant’s condition. 
The number of preterm infants is increasing. Survi-
val, as well as a good quality of life are thought to be 
important in leading a healthy life. The evaluation and 
management of complications of BPD are imperative. 
Preterm infants with BPD must be evaluated periodi-
cally for signs and symptoms of PH. More reliable sc-
reening methods for PH and severity stratification are 
needed. For PH treatment guidelines in preterm infants 
with chronic lung disease, further prospective randomiz-
ed controlled studies are warranted in preterm infants 
with BPD.
