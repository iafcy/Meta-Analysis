Abstract
Aim—To test the hypothesis that there are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of
the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH) in neonates with
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
Methods—Neonates with BPD were enrolled (n = 140) and clinical characteristics compared
between case (BPD + PH) and control (BPD) groups. DNA was isolated from blood leucocytes
and assayed for 17 SNPs in L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway genes by Sequenom massarray. Genes
included carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthase,
nitric oxide synthase and arginase. SNPs were selected from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information database for their putative functionality. Calculated minor allele
frequencies (MAF) of cases and controls were compared using χ2 and logistic regression.
Results—Of the 140 patients with BPD, 26% had echocardiographic evidence of PH. Ventilation
days were longer for cases than controls (mean 31 vs. 15 days, p < 0.05). Of the 17 SNPs,

hypertension in preterm neonates with BPD.

INTRODUCTION
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm
infants, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiovascular complication of BPD that is
associated with a marked increase in morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated that 25
to 40% of infants with BPD will develop PH (1–4), but there are currently no tests for
predicting which BPD patients might develop this life-threatening complication. Identifying
BPD- associated PH early may be important in capturing the reversible phase of PH and
thereby improving outcomes (1).
Endogenous nitric oxide synthesis is required for regulation of neonatal pulmonary vascular
resistance and vasore-activity (5–7). Disruption of the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway may
alter vascular reactivity and contribute to the development of PH in patients with BPD (1, 8).
Nitric oxide synthase and arginase compete for their common substrate L-arginine and have
opposing effects in PH. Nitric oxide synthase produces the potent vasodilator nitric oxide,
while arginase is the first step in polyamine and proline production leading to cellular
proliferation and vascular remodelling. In animal models of BPD, lung levels of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase are low and increasing nitric oxide production normalises patterns of
lung growth and vascularisation in these models (1, 8, 9). In term infants with another form
of PH, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, it has been found that the
circulating levels of L-arginine are lower due to decreased production of L-arginine by the
urea cycle enzymes, and this was associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
in the urea cycle gene carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (10). Therefore, our objective was to
test the hypothesis that in preterm infants with BPD there are SNPs in the L-arginine/ nitric
oxide pathway associated with the development of PH.
DESIGN/METHODS
The Institutional Review Board at Nationwide Children's Hospital approved this study.
Neonates were enrolled from the neonatal intensive care unit at Nationwide Children's
Hospital after 1 September 2009. Patients were enrolled if they met National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development criteria for the definition of BPD, which was defined
as treatment with supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days (11). The cohort included 140
patients with BPD, of which there were 36 patients with echocardiographic evidence of
elevated pulmonary arterial pressure who were classified as having PH and therefore

considered cases. Elevated pulmonary arterial pressure was considered to be present on
echocardiography if there was right ventricular hypertrophy, flattening of the
intraventricular septum, presence of tricuspid regurgitation in the absence of pulmonary
stenosis and/or elevated right ventricular pressure, as estimated by tricuspid regurgitant jet
velocity (2, 12). The controls were patients with BPD who did not have PH according to
these criteria. Patients with congenital heart disease, except patent ductus arteriosus or atrial
septal defect, were excluded from the study. Patients with anatomical causes of PH,
including diaphragmatic hernia or other causes of lung hypoplasia, were also excluded from
the study.
Genotyping
After consent was obtained, blood samples were collected, maintained on ice for no more
than six hours, and centrifuged. The blood cells were stored for isolation of DNA from
leucocytes. SNPs were selected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
SNP database for their putative functionality (5, 13–22). DNA was isolated from blood
leucocytes and assayed for 34 SNPs in genes of the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway by
Sequenom MassArray (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). Subsequently, 17 SNPs had
calculated minor allele frequencies (MAF) of zero and these SNPs were excluded from the
study. A total of 17 SNPs were studied in six genes, including carbamoyl-phosphate
synthetase (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthase (ASS),
nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), arginase (ARG1, ARG2).
Statistical analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between BPD and PH (cases)
versus BPD alone (control) groups. Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test.
Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test. Calculated MAF of cases and
controls were compared using the χ2 test. An additive logistic regression model was used to
estimate the adjusted odds ratio of the risk of individual genotypes in developing PH in
BPD. Analysis of the distributions of genotypes was performed by χ2 analysis with 1 degree
of freedom (10). A p-value <0.05 was considered to be significant. This study was designed
to test a specific hypothesis and only candidate genes in the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway
were included in the study. Given the limitation of study sample size, less conservative
values are also of interest, and may be hypothesis generating. Therefore, no correction was
made for multiple testing. STATA/IC 12.0 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA)
statistical software was used to complete all of the analyses in this study.
RESULTS
Among all 140 patients with BPD, 36 (26%) patients also had echocardiographic evidence
of PH. For patients with both BPD and PH, the average day of life for the first
echocardiogram was 11 ± 14 days and the average day of life of PH diagnosis was 29 ± 40
days. Table 1 compares demographic and clinical characteristics between case and control
groups. Overall, there were no significant differences between case and control groups,
except for ventilation days and number of echocardiograms. Ventilation days were
significantly longer for the case group (31 36 days) than for the control group (15 ± 27 days,

p = 0.02) ± and the number of echocardiograms were also increased in the PH group (3.9 vs.
2.5, p < 0.01).
Table 2 compares MAF for cases and controls for 17 of the SNPs studied. We found that the
rs2781666 (arginase I gene) T allele was less common in cases (MAF = 0.23) than in
controls (MAF = 0.37, p = 0.04). None of the other 16 SNPs showed a significant difference
in MAF between cases and controls.
Figure 1 demonstrates the allele frequencies for the arginase I SNP rs2781666 in cases and
controls. The proportion of patients who were homozygous for the G allele (wild type) was
greater in the BPD and PH group than in the BPD alone group (p = 0.03). Using an additive
logistic regression model, for each additional minor allele (T), having the minor allele
decreases the risk of PH in BPD by 43% (OR per additional T allele 0.57 [95% CI 0.31–
1.02]; p = 0.047).
In this cohort of BPD patients, 27% had mild BPD and 73% had moderate/severe BPD as
defined by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development consensus
workshop (11). Of the BPD patients with PH, 14% had mild BPD and 86% had moderate/
severe BPD, and this was not different from patients with BPD alone (31% mild, 69%
moderate/severe, p = 0.07).
DISCUSSION
The major objective of the present study was to investigate the association of SNPs in the L-
arginine/nitric oxide pathway with the development of PH in patients with BPD. The major
findings of this study were that the rs2781666 SNP in the arginase I gene was associated
with a lower incidence of PH in patients with BPD and the odds of PH were decreased by
43% for each copy of the minor allele of the rs2781666 SNP in patients with BPD. These
findings support our hypothesis that SNPs in genes involved in the L-arginine/nitric oxide
pathway are associated with the development of PH in preterm infants with BPD.
The rs2781666G/T SNP is located in the promoter region of the arginase I gene. There have
been reports of associated cardiovascular changes with the rs2781666G/T polymorphism of
arginase I. Meroufel et al. (21) reported that the rs2781666 SNP of the arginase I gene was
associated with a trend toward decreased systolic blood pressure (p = 0.067) in an adult
Algerian population. Furthermore, two separate reports by Dumont et al. (23) and Sediri et
al. (24) demonstrated the association of the arginase I rs2781666 SNP with the risk of
myocardial infarction. In addition to cardiovascular disease, arginase genes have also been
associated with childhood asthma. Salam et al. (22) reported that a particular arginase I
haplotype was associated with a reduced risk of asthma.
There are both in vitro and in vivo data supporting that changes in arginase levels are
associated with pulmonary vascular disease. An increase in arginase expression and activity
has been shown in both human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and microvascular
endothelial cells, resulting in greater cell proliferation (25, 26). In a murine model of PH,
arginase has been shown to be elevated in the lung homogenates (27). In addition, arginase
II has been shown to be elevated in adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (28).

In the present study, a SNP was found in the arginase I gene that differed between BPD
patients with and without PH. It remains to be elucidated exactly what effects this SNP has
on arginase activity, but we would speculate based on the above that the rs2781666 SNP
results in lower arginase activity.
There are several limitations of this study that should be noted. Our sample size was
relatively small, but using a directed gene approach we found a significant difference in the
rs2781666 SNP of arginase I gene between patients with BPD and PH and those with BPD
alone. We acknowledge that this study needs to be replicated in a larger cohort of patients,
but emphasise that our findings provide a novel insight into a potential marker for BPD-
associated PH. Another limitation of our study is the inherent difficulty of diagnosing PH in
the newborn period. The gold standard for diagnosis of PH is cardiac catheterisation, but due
to the invasiveness associated with cardiac catheterisation in preterm infants, 2D
echocardiography is the most common approach to diagnose PH in this population (12).
Our findings suggest that genetic variations in arginase I are associated with PH in preterm
infants with BPD. Our study provides important data that supports a more detailed
investigation of the SNPs in the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway genes in the BPD
population. These findings also highlight that there may be genetic markers that predict the
onset of PH in infants with BPD, such that therapeutic approaches might be developed to
prevent PH in BPD and thereby improve outcomes for patients with BPD.
