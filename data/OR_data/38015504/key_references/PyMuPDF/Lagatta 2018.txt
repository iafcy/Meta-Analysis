Abstract
Objective(s): To assess the effect of pulmonary hypertension on NICU mortality and hospital 
readmission through one year corrected age in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
with a large, multicenter cohort.
Study Design: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 1677 infants born <32 
weeks’ gestation with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (positive pressure ventilation, >2 L/min 
flow by nasal cannula, or fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) >0.3 at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age) 
enrolled in the Children’s Hospital Neonatal Consortium with records linked to the Pediatric 
Health Information System.
Results: Pulmonary hypertension occurred in 370/1677 (22%) infants. During the neonatal 
admission, pulmonary hypertension was associated with mortality (OR= 3.15, 95%CI 2.10–4.73, 
p<0.001), ventilator support at 36 weeks’ post-menstrual age (60% vs 40%, p<0.001), duration of 
ventilation (72 IQR 30–124 vs 41 IQR 17–74 days, p<0.001), and higher respiratory severity score 
(3.6 IQR 0.4–7.0 vs 0.8 IQR 0.3–3.3, p<0.001). At discharge, pulmonary hypertension was 
associated with tracheostomy (27% vs 9%, p<0.001), supplemental oxygen use (84% vs 61%, 
p<0.001), and tube feeds (80% vs 46%, p<0.001). Through one year corrected age, pulmonary 
hypertension was associated with increased frequency of readmission (IRR=1.38, 95%CI 1.18–
1.63, p<0.001).
Conclusion: Infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary 
hypertension have increased morbidity and mortality through one year corrected age. This 
highlights the urgent need for improved diagnostic practices and prospective studies evaluating 
treatments for this high-risk population.
Background
Severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD) occurs in more than 20% of extremely-low-
birth-weight infants. It is a major driver of mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and 
healthcare utilization after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).(1–4) 
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious comorbidity of sBPD, thought to result from a 
combination of intrinsic, secondary, and acquired abnormalities in the pulmonary 
vasculature.(5–8) Although diagnostic criteria vary, PH is found in 10–20% of infants with 
sBPD(2, 9–11) and has been linked with increased risk of death or tracheostomy.(8, 10, 12)
The understanding of PH has been limited by the small numbers of neonates reported in 
single-center studies, varied timing and diagnostic criteria of echocardiography, and logistic

limitations of cardiac catheterization.(11, 13–15) Regardless of how or when the diagnosis 
of PH is established, an understanding of outcomes following a diagnosis of PH could help 
categorize illness severity, plan clinical studies, and tailor bedside management by 
identifying effective therapies.
The overall goal of this study was to describe the NICU and post-NICU outcomes of PH in a 
large, multi-center cohort of infants with sBPD referred to regional NICUs. Our primary 
objective was to determine whether PH is associated with NICU mortality and hospital 
readmission through one year corrected age. We hypothesized that infants with sBPD and 
PH would have increased mortality and hospital readmission than those with sBPD alone.
Methods/Study Design
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants in the Children’s Hospitals Neonatal 
Database (CHND) between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2015. CHND prospectively 
captures clinical data of all infants admitted to participating referral-based NICUs.(16) Chart 
review is conducted by trained staff at each site and has been described previously.(17) 
Readmission data from neonatal discharge through one year corrected age were obtained by 
linking CHND data to the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), which holds 
administrative data about hospital encounters over time for all but three hospitals 
participating in CHND. Patient records in CHND and PHIS were linked using masked 
billing and medical record numbers. After linkage, multiple encounters of care (consisting of 
inpatient admissions, outpatient surgery, emergency department and observation visits) were 
observed for each patient through one year corrected age. Prior studies have demonstrated 
>94% linkage between CHND and PHIS.(18, 19)
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included all infants admitted to a CHND NICU who were born at <32 weeks’ gestation 
and had sBPD, defined as positive pressure ventilation, >2 L/min flow by nasal cannula, or 
fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) >0.3 at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age or at the time of 
referral to the CHND NICU, whichever came later.(20, 21) We excluded those who died 
prior to 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age, were hospitalized in a CHND NICU for < 3 days, or 
were admitted to centers with <20 CHND-PHIS-linked records. We also excluded infants 
with major congenital anomalies. Infants with patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defects, 
or ventricular septal defects were retained in the study unless other major cardiac 
malformations were also present.
Outcomes and covariates
The primary outcome was mortality after 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age during the neonatal 
admission. The CHND records data throughout the entire hospital stay from neonatal 
admission through discharge, even if the infant is transferred to another unit within the same 
hospital. Thus, we defined the “neonatal admission” as including the CHND NICU stay plus 
any transfer to another unit within the same institution. Secondary outcomes during the 
neonatal admission included the length of stay from 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age to 
discharge to adjust for differences due to prematurity, receipt of gastrostomy and/or

fundoplication, receipt of tracheostomy, and neonatal admission continuing beyond one year 
corrected age.
For infants who survived to discharge home from the CHND hospital and had PHIS-linked 
data available, a second primary outcome was hospital readmission between NICU discharge 
and one year corrected age. Readmission was defined as any inpatient-type episode of care 
occurring in PHIS between discharge from the neonatal admission and one year corrected 
age. Readmission to an ICU and the use of mechanical ventilation during an inpatient 
readmission were also identified in the PHIS. Emergency department, observation-only 
encounters, and outpatient surgical procedures in the PHIS were evaluated, but not 
considered as readmissions.
The main exposure was PH, as reported in the medical record and recorded in CHND. The 
diagnosis of PH was based on local clinical practices and standards. We did not define 
explicit criteria for clinical diagnosis of PH for this study, as this was a retrospective review 
of multiple centers over a five-year period. Only infants with an echocardiogram performed 
at ≥34 weeks’ postmenstrual age were included in our primary analysis. A sensitivity 
analysis was performed for all infants regardless of having undergone echocardiography. We 
recorded the number of infants at each center undergoing cardiac catheterization, however, 
the low frequency (n=66) of this procedure precluded further inquiries.
Additional covariates were obtained from the CHND. Gestational age was defined by 
obstetric estimate,(22) and small for gestational age was defined as <10th sex- and 
gestational age- specific birth weight percentiles.(23) Age at admission to the CHND NICU 
was rounded to the nearest week. Sex, maternal racial and ethnic status, insurance status, 
maternal chorioamnionitis, maternal diabetes, multiple gestation, antenatal steroids, surgical 
ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus, blood stream infection, and surgical necrotizing 
enterocolitis (characteristic systemic signs with pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas, 
and/or intraperitoneal gas and receipt of surgical procedure) were abstracted from the 
CHND. Receipt of mechanical ventilation was assessed at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age or 
time of admission to the CHND hospital, whichever occurred later. Respiratory severity 
score was defined for mechanically ventilated patients at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age as the 
product of mean airway pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen.(24) Ventilator days were 
counted from the time of admission to the CHND NICU through discharge. Postnatal 
systemic steroids were defined as receipt of any oral or intravenous, but not inhaled, 
corticosteroid during the CHND NICU admission. Weight-gain velocity was calculated from 
birth to 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age and reported in g/kg/day.(25)
Data analyses
We used descriptive statistics to compare illness characteristics for all infants stratified by 
PH. We assessed the correlation between each center’s prevalence of diagnosis of PH and 
use of echocardiography at ≥34 weeks’ postmenstrual age, as well as the correlation 
between center diagnosis of PH and center use of inhaled nitric oxide and sildenafil.
Next, we determined the relationship between PH and mortality and inpatient readmissions 
through one year corrected age. Unadjusted associations were compared using chi-squared

or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. To estimate independent associations, we performed 
multivariable regression with mixed effects. We included covariates which were associated 
with PH at p<0.1 in bivariate analyses and potential confounders of an association between 
PH and outcomes; covariates were removed by backwards elimination if they were not 
associated with the outcome (p>0.1). Center was used as a random intercept. Mortality was 
modeled using mixed logistic regression. Frequency of hospital readmission from NICU 
discharge through one year corrected age was modeled using mixed Poisson regression. For 
each model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated 
and goodness-of-fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. As a sensitivity 
analysis, we repeated both mortality and readmission models for all infants, regardless of 
receipt of an echocardiogram at ≥34 weeks’ postmenstrual age.
Statistical significance was defined as p <0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS version 
9 (Cary, NC). The CHND was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Stanley Manne 
Research Institute affiliated with the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago 
(#2011–14673), and all participating centers.
Results
There were 95,954 database records in the CHND; of those, 17,053 were from unique 
infants born <32 weeks’ gestation. We excluded infants who died prior to 36 weeks’ 
postmenstrual age (n=1659), who were hospitalized for <3 days (n=1059), or who had 
congenital anomalies (n=2114). We also excluded infants without sBPD (n=9242) and who 
came from centers with <20 CHND-PHIS linked cases (n=173).
Of the 23 centers included in this analysis, the median center prevalence of PH was 14% 
(IQR 8–20%), which varied significantly across centers (p<0.001). Echocardiography at ≥34 
weeks’ postmenstrual age was performed in 1677; the median center prevalence of 
echocardiography was 60% (IQR 51–68%) which was also different across centers 
(p<0.001) (Figure 1). There was no correlation between center prevalence of 
echocardiography and PH (R2 = 0.09). Infants with PH were frequently treated with inhaled 
nitric oxide [128/401 (32%)] during their CHND hospital stay, with a center median of 33% 
(IQR 20–42). Infants with PH were also often treated with sildenafil (222/401 (55%)), with a 
center median of 60% (IQR 49–78). The use of sildenafil (p<0.001) and inhaled nitric oxide 
(p<0.001) in patients with PH varied significantly by center (Figure 2, online only). 
However, there was no correlation between center prevalence of PH and use of inhaled nitric 
oxide (R2 = 0.0009) or sildenafil (R2 = 0.07).
There were 1677 infants with sBPD with at least one echocardiogram who were included for 
our primary analysis. PH was diagnosed in 370 (22%) patients. Infants with PH were more 
likely to be born at a lower birth weight, nearly twice as likely to be small for gestational 
age, and be born to mothers of black race. Although maternal chorioamnionitis was less 
common in PH, maternal hypertension was more common. Infants with PH were admitted 
seven weeks later by postmenstrual age to a CHND center and had more severe respiratory 
illness than infants without PH. Those with PH had longer duration of mechanical 
ventilation than those without PH, and were more likely to require mechanical ventilation at

36 weeks’ postmenstrual age or at admission. Among infants requiring mechanical 
ventilation at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age, PH was associated with a more than four-fold 
increase in respiratory severity score. Two-thirds of infants with PH received postnatal 
systemic steroids, which was almost twice as common as infants without PH (Table I). 
When analyzing all infants with sBPD regardless of echocardiography at ≥34 weeks 
postmenstrual age (n=2806), the comparison of clinical characteristics between infants with 
and without PH was essentially unchanged (Table IV, online only).
Infants with PH had an unadjusted 4-fold higher prevalence of mortality during the neonatal 
admission (21% vs 5%, p<0.001), and a higher likelihood of remaining hospitalized through 
one year corrected age (5% vs 1%, p<0.001). Among survivors to NICU discharge, PHIS 
linkage was available in 1145/1222 (94%) infants. Those with PH had higher prevalence of 
tracheostomy (27% vs 9%, p<0.001) and gastrostomy (80% vs 46%, p<0.001). At one year 
corrected age, surviving infants with sBPD had 2925 total inpatient encounters including 
inpatient, emergency room, observation and ambulatory surgery. Infants with PH were more 
likely to have inpatient readmissions, intensive care unit readmissions, and readmissions 
requiring mechanical ventilation. Mortality during readmission was infrequent and was 
similar among infants with and without PH (Table II). When comparing outcomes for infants 
regardless of receiving echocardiography at ≥ 34 weeks’ postmenstrual age, the associations 
between PH and outcomes were similar in direction and magnitude (Table V, online only).
In multivariable regressions, PH was independently associated with both mortality and 
readmissions. Infants with PH had a greater than 3-fold increased odds of mortality during 
the neonatal admission (p<0.001); respiratory failure or multi-system organ failure were the 
cause of death in 83% of infants. Mortality was also related to later postmenstrual age at 
admission to a CHND hospital, mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age, 
postnatal steroids, and atrial septal defects (Table III). Similarly, PH was associated with a 
38% increased frequency of inpatient readmissions (p<0.001) between NICU discharge and 
one year corrected age. Mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age, postnatal 
steroids, blood stream infections, and airway comorbidities such as 
laryngotracheobronchomalacia were also associated with increased frequency of 
readmission. While infants born to black mothers were more likely to be readmitted 
following the initial NICU discharge, those with private insurance were less likely to be 
readmitted (Table III). The association of pulmonary hypertension with mortality and 
hospital readmission persisted in the sensitivity analysis including all infants regardless of 
receiving echocardiography at ≥ 34 weeks’ postmenstrual age (Table VI, online only).
Discussion
This study compares outcomes of a large, contemporary, multicenter cohort of infants with 
sBPD by the presence of PH. We found that PH was associated with a broad range of 
adverse outcomes including mortality, gastrostomy, tracheostomy, home oxygen, and 
readmission before one year corrected age.
Many investigators have focused their efforts on risk factors for PH in infants with BPD.(8, 
10, 11, 26, 27) Most of these studies evaluated clinical characteristics, placental architecture,

or biomarkers of infants in a single center during the initial NICU hospitalization. Mourani 
et al described the relationship between early echocardiographic signs of pulmonary 
vascular disease and the later development of BPD and PH in two centers.(28) A strength of 
our study is that we evaluated neonatal morbidity and mortality in a large, multicenter cohort 
and followed infants through one year corrected age. To our knowledge, this study is the 
largest multi-center cohort that has evaluated outcomes for infants with sBPD-associated 
PH.
We identified associations between PH and both mortality as well as frequency of inpatient 
readmissions between NICU discharge and one year corrected age. As 5% of neonates with 
PH were not discharged by one year corrected age, our findings may underestimate the 
association between PH and hospital readmission. Ventilator use at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual 
age and use of postnatal steroids were also associated with adverse outcomes, likely 
reflecting increased underlying disease severity. Furthermore, we identified a racial disparity 
with infants born to black mothers having greater rates of hospital readmission, even after 
accounting for insurance status at NICU discharge as a surrogate for socioeconomic status. 
While prior reports have linked race to respiratory disease in premature infants (3, 29), to 
our knowledge, this is the first report linking race specifically to hospital readmission in 
neonates with sBPD.
A majority of infants diagnosed with PH were treated with sildenafil, inhaled nitric oxide or 
both despite the paucity of strong evidence for these therapies in sBPD-associated PH.(13–
15, 30, 31) In the absence of a standardized illness severity definition, we explicitly chose 
not to compare outcomes of individual infants treated versus not treated with PH-targeted 
medications. As severity of PH could not be directly assessed, patients not treated with 
pulmonary vasodilators could have mild disease; thus, our results may underestimate the 
impact of more severe PH and the potential benefits of treatment. The 2015 guidelines from 
the American Heart Association recognize that PH-targeted therapy could be useful for 
infants with BPD and symptomatic PH; further research on therapeutic interventions will be 
essential to improve outcomes in this population.(32)
We found wide variation in prevalence of PH and use of echocardiography across centers. 
Interestingly, centers that used echocardiography more often did not diagnose more patients 
with PH; this may be due to the lack of standardized guidelines for evaluation of PH in 
infants with sBPD during the study period. Cardiac catheterization was used rarely in this 
cohort. Prior studies have found that echocardiographic measures of PH are variably present 
and have limited reproducibility and predictive value, such that relying solely on 
echocardiography is also problematic.(8–10, 33) Standardized, practical, and validated 
definitions will be essential to future advances in the understanding of this disease and were 
recently suggested by Krishnan et al.(13)
This study has important limitations. The lack of standardized criteria to establish a 
diagnosis of PH is a significant limitation, both for this study and for the field in general. 
One of our main goals in conducting this study despite the absence of a standardized 
definition of PH was to assess outcomes for use in future study design. If infants without an 
echocardiogram were misclassified as not having PH, this could have caused us to

underestimate the true impact of PH. Conversely, if sicker infants received more frequent 
screening or were more likely to be labeled as having PH, it could falsely over-estimate the 
impact of PH on outcomes. However, outcomes were similar in the sensitivity analysis, 
suggesting that misclassification and ascertainment bias had minimal impact on our findings. 
Respiratory or multi-system organ failure were the causes of death in most infants, but we 
do not know exactly how PH may or may not have been linked to the infants’ demise.
Because CHND sites are largely referral-based children’s hospitals, echocardiographic data 
collected from referring centers may not be available. Although data abstractors are 
rigorously trained at each site, there is inter-center variability in reporting in the medical 
records. We attempted to minimize systematic bias by regular training for abstractors and 
requiring thresholds for inter-rater agreement at each site, so we believe that we have 
reduced this chance of error as much as possible.(17) While the the CHND allows for 
adjustment for many confounders, unmeasured confounders could have modified the 
associations.
With regards to readmissions, another important limitation is that infants may have been 
readmitted to institutions outside of participating hospitals in CHND and PHIS or readmitted 
for non-pulmonary causes. Readmission to a hospital outside the CHND and PHIS might be 
more common among less sick infants without PH; however, the readmission rates appear 
similar to other reports of readmissions for infants with sBPD (21, 34). Also, these results 
may not generalizeable to institutions that do not participate in CHND and PHIS. 
Nevertheless, we believe our findings reinforce the fact that lung disease severity including 
PH is a likely contributor to mortality and healthcare utilization after NICU discharge.(34, 
35)
In conclusion, this study identified outcomes associated with PH in a multi-center cohort of 
infants with sBPD in regional NICUs. Despite variation in diagnosis across centers, PH is 
associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes including tracheostomy, home oxygen 
use, gastrostomy tubes, hospital readmissions, and death. These data highlight the urgent 
need for improved diagnostic standards, better understanding of the specific cause of adverse 
outcomes, and prospective studies to evaluate treatments for PH in this high-risk population.
