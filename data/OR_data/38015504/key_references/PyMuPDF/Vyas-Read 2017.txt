Abstract
Background: Approximately 8–23% of premature infants develop pulmonary hypertension (PH), and this diagnosis
confers a higher possibility of mortality. As a result, professional societies recommend PH screening in premature
infants. However, the risk factors for and the outcomes of PH may differ depending on the timing of its diagnosis,
and little evidence is available to determine at-risk infants in the referral neonatal population. The objective of this
study was to define clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of infants with pulmonary hypertension during
the neonatal hospital course and at or near-term.
Methods: Infants who had the following billing codes: < 32 weeks, birth weight < 1500 g, neonatal unit, and
echocardiograph had records abstracted from a data warehouse at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. The outcome
was defined as late PH on the final echocardiogram for all patients, and, separately, for patients with multiple
studies. Descriptive statistics, univariable, and multivariable models were evaluated, and odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals are expressed below as (OR, CI).
Results: 556 infants were included in the overall study, 59 had PH on their final echocardiogram (11%). In
multivariable analyses, atrial septal defect (2.9, 1.4–6.1), and intrauterine growth restriction (2.7, 1.2–6.3) increased
the odds of late PH, whereas caffeine therapy decreased PH (0.4, 0.2–0.8). When the analyses were restricted to 32
infants who had multiple echocardiograms during their hospitalization, the association between atrial septal defect
(5.9, 2.0–16.5) and growth restriction (3.7, 1.3–10.7) and late PH was strengthened, but the effect of caffeine therapy
was no longer significant. In this smaller subgroup, infants with late PH had their final echocardiogram at a median
of 116 days of life, and 42–74% of them had right ventricular pathology.
Conclusions: Early clinical variables are associated with PH persistence in a referral neonatal population.
Identification of early clinical factors may help guide the ascertainment of infant risk for late PH, and may aid in
targeting sub-groups that are most likely to benefit from PH screening.

Background
For infants who are born early in the third trimester of
pregnancy or before, fetal factors coupled with prema-
turity and postnatal injury may combine to result in pul-
monary vascular disease, a process which manifests
clinically as pulmonary hypertension (PH) [1–4]. The in-
cidence of PH in very low birth weight infants is esti-
mated to range between 16 and 43% [5–8], and infants
with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and PH have been
suggested to have up to a 4.6-fold higher odds of mortal-
ity than those infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia
without PH [5–7, 9]. Further, infants who were born
prematurely continue to have an increased risk for PH
that persists into childhood and adolescence [10].
Given the potential for neonatal and post-neonatal
mortality, professional societies’ such as the American
Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society
recommend screening premature infants for the devel-
opment of PH [11]. Unfortunately, few predictors for the
development of PH are known. The most widely studied
predictor for PH is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
Among infants with the most severe form of BPD, 29 to
53% also had a diagnosis of PH, and infants with severe
BPD have over a 6-fold increased odds of PH when com-
pared to infants with less severe lung disease [1, 12–15].
Intrauterine growth restriction has also been associated
with PH, suggesting that fetal vascular programming may
play a role in the development of hypertension [5, 16–18].
Few other potential predictors have been identified
other than these, postnatal infection, and possibly
illicit drugs [14, 19, 20].
In this study, we utilized observational data from
very low birth weight, premature infants within our re-
ferral population to determine if early clinical factors
are associated with pulmonary hypertension. To our
knowledge, this cohort is the largest sample of neo-
nates who received echocardiograms to be studied for
PH. Because factors that contribute to the develop-
ment of PH, such as infant growth and mortality, may
differ in Identification of early clinical factors that are
associated with neonatal PH may aid in identifying an
“at risk” population that may require more echocardio-
graphic surveillance during the hospital stay or more
formal follow-up after hospital discharge.
Methods
Study design
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at Emory University and at Children’s Healthcare
of Atlanta. The study population was a retrospective, ob-
servational cohort of patients at two hospitals in Atlanta
(Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, Egleston or Scottish
Rite campus) from January 2010 to September 2014. In-
fants who were less than 32 weeks gestational age at
birth, had a birth weight of less than 1500 g, were in the
neonatal intensive care unit, and had an echocardiogram
were identified using ICD-9 codes and were included.
Patients were excluded if medical records were missing
or if they had multiple anomalies/aneuploidy, congenital
heart disease (other than atrial septal defect, ventricular
septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus), or congenital
lung disease.
Definitions of exposures and outcomes
Outcomes
The primary outcome was late pulmonary hyperten-
sion (late PH) on the final echocardiograph prior to
death or discharge from the neonatal intensive care
unit. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was defined as an
echocardiogram that showed: 1) a moderate-to-large
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with bidirectional or
right-to-left shunting; 2) a tricuspid regurgitation jet
gradient of ≥32 mmHg with septal flattening, right
ventricular hypertrophy, or right ventricular dilation;
or 3) a tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity of ≥45 mmHg
[16, 19, 21]. Echocardiographs were ordered at the dis-
cretion of the attending neonatologist and interpreted by
pediatric cardiologists.
Clinical variables
The following variables were abstracted from the infant
medical record: 1) maternal drug use, the use of tobacco
and/or alcohol; 2) illicit drug use, including the use of
illegal drugs such as cannabis, amphetamines, or other
substances; 3) infant race and gender; and 4) prenatal
and intrapartum complications. The following discrete
variables were abstracted from the clinical data ware-
house using ICD-9 codes: 1) intraventricular hemorrhage;
2) necrotizing enterocolitis; 3) retinopathy of prematurity;
4) medication use; 5) respiratory support; and 6) positive
blood culture. Death was defined as mortality from any
cause during the hospital course.
Echocardiographic variables
The echocardiographic characteristics of infants with
late PH were determined by the final echocardiogram of
the hospital stay. For infants with only one study, the
final echocardiogram was the infant’s first study in our
neonatal hospital system. For infants with more than
one study, the final echocardiogram was the infant’s last
study in our neonatal hospital system. Directionality of
the shunt through an ASD, ventricular septal defect, or
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was determined by the
pediatric cardiologist at the time of the echocardiogram
as 1) left-to-right or none 2) bidirectional or 3) right-to-
left. The tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity (TRJV) was
graded as 1) normal, < 32 mmHg 2) mild, 32–44 mmHg
3) moderate 45–60 mmHg and 4) severe ≥60 mmHg at

that time. Septal flattening was defined subjectively as
none, any, or severe by the pediatric cardiologist per-
forming the echocardiogram. Right ventricular dilata-
tion, hypertrophy, and dysfunction were defined as
either present or absent. Atrial septal defects were cate-
gorized as 1) none or patent foramen ovale (PFO), 2) pa-
tent foramen ovale versus atrial septal defect (PFO vs.
ASD), or 3) atrial septal defect (ASD). PDA was defined
as 1) none or small or ligated versus 2) moderate-to-
large on the first study echocardiogram. Ventricular
septal defects were defined as 1) intact, tiny, and small
or 2) moderate-to-large or multiple.
Descriptive statistics
Two-sample t-tests for normally distributed variables,
and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for skewed distributions
were utilized. For categorical variables, chi-square tests
of proportion were used to compare outcome groups
unless the cell frequency was ≤5, in which case the
Fisher’s exact test was used.
Univariable and multivariable analyses
To determine the effect of echocardiographic and
early hospital characteristics on the outcome of
late PH, univariable logistic regression was used to
arrive at odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals.
A
multivariable
model
was
constructed
by
the
manual addition of each significant variable to the
intercept and gestational age variable. The -2Log
likelihood values were determined, and the value of
each additional variable was determined using a like-
lihood ratio test with p ≥0.05 as a stopping rule. A
final model that included gestational age, atrial sep-
tal
defect
(ASD
vs.
None
or
PFO),
intrauterine
growth restriction (yes or no), caffeine (yes or no),
and positive-pressure ventilation at 28 days (yes vs.
no)
was
derived.
Although
gestational
age
and
positive-pressure
ventilation
were
not
statistically
significantly
different
between
groups,
they
were
forced into the model as important risk factors for
the
development
of
late
PH.
Additionally,
the
defined multivariable model was evaluated again in
infants
who
had
more
than
one
echocardiogram
performed, and who had evidence of late PH on this
final study. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals
were
constructed.
All
statistical
procedures
were
performed using SAS 9.4 statistical software and the
level of significance for comparisons was a p-value
<0.05.
Results
Patient selection
An initial search of the electronic health record (Clarity) data-
base from January 2010 to January 2015 yielded 586 infants
that met the inclusion criteria of having a gestational age of
less than 32 weeks at birth, having a birthweight less than
1500 g at birth, being admitted to the neonatal intensive care
unit, and having an echocardiographic procedure (Fig. 1). Of
these, 25 infants were excluded from the study population
due to multiple anomalies or aneuploidy (8 infants),
congenital heart disease other than PDA, ASD or VSD (11
infants), congenital lung disease (2 infants), or missing
medical
information
(4
infants).
Five
patients
were
excluded due to missing outcome data, and 556 infants
were included in the study cohort. Ninety-two infants
(16%) in the overall cohort had at least one echocardio-
gram that met criteria for pulmonary hypertension (PH)
during the hospital course. Infants who had echocardio-
graphic evidence of pulmonary hypertension on their last
neonatal study were defined as having late pulmonary
hypertension (late PH). If an infant had only one study,
then the first study determined the infant’s classification
into outcome groups. If an infant had more than one
study, then the final echocardiogram result determined
whether he/she was classified as having late PH. The ma-
jority of infants with and without late PH had an echocar-
diogram after 30 days of life, and 29–31% of infants had
early echocardiograms before 30 days of life (Fig. 2). The
median day of life for infants with over one study was
116 days for infants with late PH, and 101 for infants with-
out late PH, indicating that PH on the final echocardio-
gram was detected beyond 3 months of life for this group
(Fig. 2, panel B). All infants in both groups received at
least one echocardiogram. Twenty-five percent of infants
with late PH, and 27% of infants without late PH also had
a second echocardiogram. A higher proportion of infants
in the late PH group had over 2 echocardiograms when
compared with infants without late PH (29% vs. 19%).
Forty-six percent of infants in the late PH group had
evidence of PH on their first and only echocardiogram,
and 54% of infants had over one study and the final echo-
cardiogram showed PH.
Echocardiographic characteristics of infants with late PH
Of the 556 infants evaluated, 59 patients had late PH on
their final echocardiogram (10.6% of the total cohort,
64% of the infants with an initial diagnosis of PH), and
497 infants did not (Table 1). The median timing of the
echocardiogram was 77 days of life for infants in the late
PH group, and 41 days of life for infants without late
PH. Infants who had an atrial septal defect (ASD) had
4.6-fold higher odds of late PH, when compared with in-
fants without an ASD. The association between patent
ductus arteriosus size and late PH was not significant.
Forty-three percent of infants with late PH had an ASD
with bidirectional or right-to-left shunting, indicating
that patients in our PH group had poor right ventricular
compliance

elevated pulmonary pressure. Eighty-one percent of in-
fants
with
late PH
had
tricuspid
jet
velocities
of
≥32 mmHg, compared with 2% of patients without late
PH. The 11 infants with “normal” tricuspid regurgitation
in the late PH group also had a patent ductus arteriosus,
making interpretation of the jet gradient difficult. The
majority of infants with late PH had some evidence of
either right ventricular dilation (55% vs. 8%) or right
ventricular hypertrophy (56% vs. 10%), and one-third
had right-ventricular dysfunction (33% vs 3%), respect-
ively, when compared with those without late PH. Ven-
tricular septal defects and left ventricular dysfunction
did not differ between the late PH groups.
Associations between neonatal characteristics and late PH
In univariable analysis, infants with late PH overall had
lower birthweight than infants who did not have PH per-
sistence (0.75 ± 0.24 kg vs. 0.83 ± 0.25 kg, p = 0.02)
(Table 2). For each kilogram increase in an infant’s birth-
weight, the odds of PH dropped significantly (OR 0.2,
95% CI 0.1–0.7), and infants with intrauterine growth re-
striction had higher odds of developing late PH than
normally grown infants (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.3–6.2). Inter-
estingly, an association between caffeine and late PH
was also seen. Fifty-one percent of infants with late PH
received caffeine, compared with 69% of infants without
late PH (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3–0.8). Despite this discrep-
ancy in caffeine use, we did not detect a difference in
the level of respiratory support at 28 days of life or at
36 weeks corrected gestational age between groups.
Nineteen percent of infants with late PH were treated
with sildenafil, and 3% also were treated with bosentan.
Other birth variables and early hospital characteristics
did not differ between the comparison groups.
Because outcomes and predictors may differ based on
the timing of PH diagnosis, we then evaluated early clin-
ical and echocardiographic factors in infants who had
multiple studies and had an echocardiogram showing
PH on their final study [21]. This subgroup of 32 infants
had
their
final
echocardiogram
between
101
days

birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit, and echocardiographic procedure. 586 infants were identified, and 25 of these met exclusion criteria.
556 patients were included in the study, and 92 (16%) had PH on any one echocardiogram while in the neonatal intensive care unit. Of the
92 infants with PH, 59 (64%) also had PH on their final echocardiogram of the hospital stay. Of these 59 infants, 32 had more than one
echocardiogram and the last study during the neonatal stay showed PH

(infants without late PH) and 116 days (infants with
late PH) (Table 3). The gestational age of infants with
multiple studies ranged from 25.7 to 25.9 weeks in
both groups, placing the final echocardiogram be-
tween 39 and 41 weeks corrected gestational age. In-
fants in this subgroup with late PH had an Apgar
score that was significantly lower than their counter-
parts who did not have late PH (3.0 vs. 4.3, p = 0.01).
More than double the infants with multiple studies and
late PH had a history of intrauterine growth restriction,
when compared with infants without late PH (23% vs. 9%,
p = 0.03). In this subgroup that was evaluated later in the
neonatal course, caffeine therapy was not associated
with the outcome of late PH (63% vs. 68%, p = 0.55).
Interestingly, the use of respiratory support at 28 days
or 36 weeks again did not differ between groups.

pulmonary hypertension (late PH) if their final echocardiogram in the hospital showed PH. For infants with only one echocardiogram, the final
study was their first echocardiogram. For infants with more than one study, the final echocardiogram of the neonatal course was captured.
Echocardiograms were performed by clinical pediatric cardiologists and quantitative variables (tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity) and qualitative
variables (shunt directions, septal flattening, degree of right ventricular dysfunction/dilation/hypertrophy) were measured. Panel a shows the
distribution of the day of life for the first and final echocardiogram of the infants in the entire cohort. Panel b shows the day of life that the
echocardiograms were obtained, the number of studies by group, and the day of life and sequence of the first and final echocardiogram.

shunts through an ASD or PDA was much higher in
infants who had late PH on their final echocardio-
gram (46% vs. 12% and 57% vs. 0%, respectively). Fur-
ther,
a
large
proportion
of
infants
with
multiple
studies and late PH had some degree of septal flatten-
ing (97% vs. 53%, p < 0.001), right ventricular dilation
(69% vs. 11%, p < 0.001), right ventricular hypertrophy
(74% vs. 17%, p < 0.001), or right ventricular dysfunction
(42% vs. 5%, p < 0.001) on their final echocardiogram,
indicating this that this subgroup was a very high-risk
and high-acuity group within a sick, referral neonatal
population.
Multivariable model for the outcome of late PH
To assess how each co-variate found to be significant in
our univariable model affected the outcome of late PH
when other early characteristics were adjusted for, we
generated a multivariable model that evaluated gesta-
tional
age,
atrial
septal defect,
intrauterine growth
restriction, caffeine therapy, and positive-pressure venti-
lation at 28 days on late PH (Table 4, A). Gestational
age, instead of birth weight, was utilized as a co-variate
because of potential collinearity between birth weight
and intrauterine growth restriction. When other factors
were controlled, infants with ASD had a 2.9-fold higher

odds of late PH, compared to infants with no significant
atrial shunts (95% CI 1.4–6.1). In this cohort, gestational
age did not significantly increase the odds of late PH.
However, infants with intrauterine growth restriction
continued to have a 2.7-fold higher odds for late PH,
even when other significant variables were controlled
(95% CI 1.2–6.3). Infants receiving caffeine therapy had
a lower probability of late PH than those who did not re-
ceive
caffeine (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2–0.8). Positive-
pressure ventilation was not significantly associated with
late PH, when other factors were controlled (OR 1.5,
95% CI 0.8–2.9).
When the model was evaluated in the sicker subgroup
of infants who had multiple studies, infants with an ASD
had even higher odds of late PH than those who did not
have significant ASD, with other variables being held
constant (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.0–16.5). Similarly, infants
with multiple studies who had growth restriction had a

3.7-fold increase in the odds of late PH, when compared
with normally grown infants (95% CI 1.3–10.7). Interest-
ingly, the effect of caffeine on late PH was no longer
significant in this small subgroup of infants, when gesta-
tional age, ASD, growth restriction and positive-pressure
ventilation were controlled (OR 0.8, 0.3–1.8).
Discussion
In this study, we identify important risk factors for PH
in a referral neonatal population including birthweight,
the presence of an atrial septal defect, intrauterine
growth restriction, and caffeine therapy. Further, we have
shown that atrial septal defect and intrauterine growth
restriction are significantly associated with late PH in
infants who are at or near-term gestation.
In our multivariable model, the presence of an atrial
septal defect increased the odds of late PH significantly,
even when gestational age, growth restriction, caffeine
use, and positive-pressure ventilation were controlled.
Further, this association was strengthened in a subgroup
of infants who had their final echocardiogram showing
PH at or near term. Supporting these findings, other
investigators have also found an association between the
presence of an ASD and the development of PH in in-
fants with BPD, a diagnosis that conferred an increased
risk of mortality [22, 23]. Animal models of chronic left-
to-right shunting have increased pulmonary vascular re-
sistance and arteriolar medial thickness, implying bio-
logic plausibility to the association between ASD and
PH [24, 25]. Epidemiologically, ASDs account for 8–10%
of congenital heart defects, though the majority of these
close spontaneously in the first year of life [26]. For
those with persistent defects, small studies have sug-
gested that infants with BPD may have improved re-
spiratory outcome following transcatheter closure of
left-to-right shunts at approximately 6 months of age
[27, 28]. Unfortunately, our finding that ASDs were as-
sociated with PH development is difficult to interpret
causally. ASDs may cause right heart enlargement and
diastolic septal flattening due to volume load, which may
be confused with systolic septal flattening due to PH. In
a similar manner, the presence of a large PDA may com-
plicate the diagnosis of PH by echocardiography by ele-
vating the right ventricular pressure due to transmission
of aortic pressure to the pulmonary artery in the absence
of elevated pulmonary resistance. However, 43–57% of
infants in our analyses had bidirectional or right-to-left
shunts, offering some reassurance that our findings are
the result of elevated pulmonary resistance and not
echocardiographic detection bias due to left-to-right
shunting. Further, over half of the infants with late PH
also had either right ventricular dilation or hypertrophy,
supporting our hypotheses that these infants suffered
from chronically elevated pulmonary resistance.
Intrauterine growth restriction was associated with
pulmonary hypertension in descriptive analyses in our
investigation, and it continued to be associated with PH
when other clinical factors were controlled. Infants who
had intrauterine growth restriction had a 2.9-fold higher
odds of late PH when compared to normally grown in-
fants, and this association was enhanced in our sub-
group of infants who had late PH near term (OR 5.9 for
late PH). In a single center study by Check et al., infants
with BPD, who had a birth weight for gestational-age ra-
tio percentile of less than 25%, had a 3.9-fold increase in
the odds of PH at 36 weeks’ gestation. When this model
was further controlled for gestational age, multiple
gestation, gender and race, the odds of PH for growth-
restricted infants were increased to 5.9, similar to our
findings [16]. Our population differed slightly from that
in the prior study, in that we did not restrict our cohort
only to infants with BPD, and the overall proportion of
infants with intrauterine growth restriction was only 8%
(compared with 30%). Because evidence suggests that
fetal factors potentially influence the propensity for
disease in childhood and adulthood, the association be-
tween intrauterine growth restriction and PH should
likely be interrogated further [29–31].
Interestingly, caffeine therapy strongly decreased the
odds of late PH in our study overall. When gestational

and

pressure ventilation were controlled, the potentially pro-
tective effect of caffeine therapy on late PH was signifi-
cant (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.8). However, when the

cohort was restricted to infants who had late PH later in
life (the multiple studies group), the effect of caffeine on
the outcome was no longer significant (OR 0.8, 95% CI
0.3–1.8). This differential effect in the association be-
tween caffeine therapy and the outcome of late PH may
be secondary to the smaller numbers and potentially in-
adequate power in our subgroup analysis. Alternatively,
it is possible that the effect of caffeine therapy on PH
during the neonatal hospitalization is mediated through
bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In support of this possibil-
ity, others have shown that caffeine therapy, particularly
when initiated early in life, is associated with a reduction
in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and ventilation time for
premature neonates [32–34]. Additionally, it is possible
that infants who are corrected to near-term and con-
tinue to have late PH are a different population than
their younger counterparts, and the neonatal predictors
of pulmonary hypertension at differing points during the
postnatal hospital stay should continue to be carefully
characterized.
We acknowledge that pulmonary hypertension based
on echocardiographic parameters is challenging to define
due to difficulty in obtaining a measurable tricuspid
regurgitation jet velocity, and poor sensitivity and speci-
ficity for the detection of PH [35]. However, echocardi-
ography is widely used in neonatal intensive care units
because safety considerations prohibit the use of cardiac
catheterization as a screening tool and clinical decisions
are often made based on echocardiographic findings
[36]. Further, the definitions of PH applied in our study
are comparable to those used in other investigations,
and studies have shown strong agreement between clin-
ical and research echocardiograms for the detection of
PH [7, 8, 12, 37]. In our cohort, infants were defined as
having PH if they had a bidirectional or right-to-left
patent ductus arteriosus shunt (indicating systemic or
supra-systemic pulmonary vascular resistance), or a
mildly elevated tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity with
septal flattening, right ventricular hypertrophy or dila-
tion, or a tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity of over
45 mmHg. Although a discrete number for the tricuspid
regurgitation jet velocity may be difficult to obtain, we
were able to group infants into having a tricuspid
regurgitation jet that was “normal” (< 32 mmHg) or
“abnormal” (> 32 mmHg). In other investigations, a
measurable tricuspid jet velocity in combination with
septal flattening, right ventricular hypertrophy, or right
ventricular dilation had a positive predictive value of
89–100% [35]. Given these values, our patients who
were
classified
as
having
PH
echocardiographically
would also be likely to have PH if they underwent
catheterization. Longer-term follow-up and serial echo-
cardiography may be useful to increase the positive
prediction of echocardiogram for the development of
PH. Additionally, although the optimal echocardio-
graphic parameters for infants at risk of PH is not
known, algorithms to detect the disease in a systematic
manner are now being developed based on available
literature [36].
The strengths of our study include its evaluation of a
referral population of high-acuity neonates at particular
risk for PH. To our knowledge, this is the largest sample
of premature neonates who have received echocardio-
grams to be studied for pulmonary hypertension. Add-
itionally, we included objective clinical variables in our
models that would be readily available early in the neo-
natal hospital course, and steered away from variables
that have traditionally been associated with PH but are
present later in the neonatal course. We focused on util-
izing these variables to begin to assess if early clinical
factors can be utilized to determine infant risk for PH.
Further, we have found strong associations between ASD
and late PH and growth restriction and late PH, raising
the question of whether premature infants with these
particular risk factors should be evaluated earlier or
more frequently for pulmonary hypertension, than those
without these risks.
In summary, in this study, we have confirmed clin-
ical variables that were known to be associated with
the development of PH in premature infants, such as
intrauterine growth restriction, and we have identified
new factors that are associated with PH persistence,
such as caffeine use and atrial septal defect. Our mul-
tivariable model for persistence of PH utilizes only
readily available clinical variables, rather than solely
relying on echocardiographic or respiratory character-
istics, to establish risk for PH. Echocardiographic and
respiratory variables may vary by clinician judgement,
and utilizing these variables for prediction of PH may
prove to be challenging and difficult to generalize.
Our study utilized only fixed and demographic vari-
ables that can be validated in larger, prospective stud-
ies to define infant risk for PH during the neonatal
course. In this way, clinicians could target serial echo-
cardiography to higher-risk infants, and potentially
impact postnatal PH surveillance and management in
a timely manner.
Conclusions
The presence of an atrial septal defect and intrauterine
growth
restriction
strongly
increased
the
odds
of
pulmonary hypertension that persists at or near-term in
very low birthweight premature infants. Premature in-
fants in referral neonatal intensive care units with these
risk factors should potentially have PH evaluations
performed earlier or more frequently in their hospital
course.
