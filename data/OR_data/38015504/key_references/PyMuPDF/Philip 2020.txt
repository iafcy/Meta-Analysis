Abstract
Objectives To describe changes in hemodynamics, respiratory support, and growth associated with transcatheter PDA
closure (TCPC) in ELBW infants, stratiﬁed by postnatal age at treatment.
Study design This is an observational study of ELBW infants who underwent TCPC at ≤4 weeks (Group-1; n = 34),
4–8 weeks (Group-2; n = 33), and >8 weeks of age (Group-3; n = 33). Hemodynamic assessment was performed during
TCPC. Multivariate Cox-proportionate-hazard modeling was used to identify factors associated with respiratory severity
score (RSS) > 2 for >30 days following TCPC.
Results In comparison with Group-1, Group-3 infants had higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVRi = 3.3 vs. 1.6
WU*m2; P = 0.01), less weight gain between 4 and 8 weeks of age (16 vs. 25 g/day) and took longer to achieve RSS < 2
(median 81 vs. 20 days; P = 0.001). RSS > 2 for >30 days was associated with TCPC > 8 weeks (OR = 3.2, 95% CI:
1.75–5.8; p = 0.03) and PVRi ≥3 (OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 2.7–8.9; p < 0.01).
Conclusion ELBW infants may beneﬁt from PDA closure within the ﬁrst 4 weeks of life in order to prevent early onset
pulmonary vascular disease, promote faster growth, and for quicker weaning of ventilator and oxygen support.
Introduction
The presence of a moderate-to-large patent ductus arteriosus
(PDA) in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) preterm
infants is associated with poor respiratory outcomes and an
increased mortality [1]. However, over 40 randomized
controlled trials (RCT) using standard management strate-
gies to close these PDAs (medical therapy and surgical
ligation) have failed to demonstrate a reduction in neonatal
adverse outcomes such as IVH, NEC, BPD, or death [2–4].
When compared to standard medical therapy with ﬂuid
restriction, diuretics, and mechanical ventilation, the use of
cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors does not appear to have long-
term beneﬁts [5]. The effectiveness of drugs (indomethacin,
ibuprofen, and paracetamol) used to constrict the PDA in
less mature infants (especially ≤26 weeks) is signiﬁcantly
reduced [6, 7]. Surgical ligation provides deﬁnitive ductal
closure but leads to worse rather than better respiratory
outcomes [8, 9]. Neither method provides information on
the hemodynamics before or during PDA closure to assess
suitability for closure. Transcatheter PDA closure (TCPC)
albeit the standard of care in older children, being mini-
mally invasive, is gaining popularity in younger preterm
ELBW infants as a management therapy [10–14]. It is the
gold standard for diagnostic evaluation of the degree of
shunting and the pulmonary vascular resistance. Echo-
cardiograms and clinical assessment can provide some
indication of the hemodynamics [15, 16]. However, cardiac
catheterization alone can accurately assess the true hemo-
dynamics of the PDA. To date, no previous studies have
utilized this gold standard modality to determine the
hemodynamic consequence of a PDA in ELBW infants.
TCPC offers real-time assessment of the hemodynamics
before and after PDA closure. With the advent of per-
forming PDA closure safely [11] using transcatheter device
implantations, we deemed it critical to measure the true

hemodynamic parameters of the PDA that impact outcomes
in ELBW infants. The primary objective of this study was
to describe changes in hemodynamics, respiratory support,
and growth associated with TCPC in ELBW infants, stra-
tiﬁed by postnatal age at treatment. Secondary objectives
included describing clinical outcomes following early
(≤4 weeks of age) vs. delayed (>8 weeks) PDA closure and
identify factors associated with worse clinical outcomes.
Infants and methods
Study population
Infants born ≤27 weeks’ gestation, weighing ≤1 kg at birth
referred for cardiac catheterization and possible TCPC
between January 2016 and September 2019 from a single
center were included in this study. Approval for the study
was obtained from the University of Tennessee institutional
review board. All infants were considered to have a
hemodynamically signiﬁcant PDA (hsPDA) when referred
for TCPC based on clinical and echo parameters. Hemo-
dynamic signiﬁcance was determined by PDA size ≥2.5
mm, with diastolic ﬂow reversal in the descending aorta by
echocardiogram and the need for mechanical ventilator
support. Hemodynamic signiﬁcance was conﬁrmed by
performing a complete hemodynamic evaluation by cardiac
catheterization as part of the TCPC. The timing for referral
for catheter-based PDA closure was based solely on the
discretion of the NICU attending. Infants were retro-
spectively grouped based on the timing of PDA closure.
Those who had TCPC on or before 4 weeks of age were
grouped together (Group-1). Group-3 was categorized as
delayed TCPC, after 8 weeks of age. Those infants who had
TCPC between 4 and 8 weeks were assigned as Group-2.
Hemodynamic assessment
A complete hemodynamic cardiac catheterization was per-
formed as part of the PDA closure procedure. Those who
did not have a full hemodynamic assessment were not
included in the study. Of note, all procedures were per-
formed via a femoral venous only approach (Fig. 1) due to
the risk [17] of arterial spasm and thrombosis with femoral
arterial access in low birth weight infants. Hemodynamic
assessment included a baseline pulmonary to systemic ﬂow
ratio (Qp:Qs) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure
(PASP) expressed as a percentage of the systolic blood

pressure (SBP). The degree of shunting was calculated by
the difference in the actual and effective pulmonary blood
ﬂow. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVRi) in Wood units
(WU) indexed for body surface area (m2) was calculated
by the ratio of the transpulmonary pressure gradient and
the pulmonary blood ﬂow using the following equation:
PVR = (mean PAP −mean LAP)/Qp where mean PAP =
mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean LAP = mean left
atrial
pressure
(substituted
with
Pulmonary
Capillary
Wedge Pressure), and Qp = pulmonary blood ﬂow. Normal
PVRi values range below 3 WU*m2. In the neonatal period
and early infancy, PVRi is higher and decreases with
increasing age [18].
If the baseline PVRi was >3 WU*m2, then pulmonary
vasodilator testing using inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and
100% oxygen was performed. This was followed by
remeasurement of all the hemodynamics including Qp:Qs
ratio, PASP, and PVRi. Subsequently, the PDA was test
occluded with iNO and 100% oxygen and the same
hemodynamics were once again recorded. The Qp:Qs, and
PVRi were calculated for all three conditions i.e., baseline,
vasodilator testing, and with test occlusion of PDA. The
PDA was closed only if the PVRi was <5 WU*m2 with test
occlusion of the PDA on oxygen and iNO. Obviously, if the
baseline PVRi was normal, the PDA was closed with an
occlusion device without pulmonary vasodilator testing.
Assessment of respiratory outcomes
A respiratory severity score (RSS) was calculated and used
as the primary outcome variable.
The RSS is a product of the mean airway pressure and
the fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2).
Therefore, a lower score denotes less respiratory support
and a value of <2 was considered minimal. The pre-
procedure RSS was reported as a mean of all the RSS for
2 days prior to PDA closure. The RSS immediately post-
PDA closure (within 2 h) and the time taken for return to
pre-procedure RSS were recorded. In addition, the time
taken for the RSS to get below a score of 2 was measured.
Factors contributing to prolonged (>30 days) elevation of
RSS > 2 were identiﬁed.
Statistical methods
Categorical data are reported as a count and percentage.
Continuous data are reported as median and range to present
the minimum and maximum values for demographics and
hemodynamic data and as median and interquartile range
for
respiratory
outcome
variables.
The
hemodynamic
changes with oxygen and nitric oxide as well as with test
occlusion of the PDA, and in growth velocities are
expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Chi-square tests
were performed for categorical data. The parametric test
used to compare numeric data such as growth velocity pre-
and post-PDA closure, and Qp:Qs, PVRi, PASP pre- and
post-pulmonary vasodilation and test occlusion of the PDA
was the Student’s t test. The Mann–Whitney test was the
nonparametric test used for continuous variables.
The Kruskal–Wallis H test (one-way ANOVA on ranks)
was used to determine statistical differences between two or
more groups for independent variables on continuous and/or
for ordinal dependent variables. The initial analysis inclu-
ded all three groups together. Individual intergroup com-
parisons were then completed if an overall intergroup
difference was noted in order to illustrate which two groups
differed. The data presented in Table 1 are a comparison of
all three groups and the overall P values. This is because all
three groups were either similar or different with regards to
each other. For data presented in Tables 2 and 3, the overall
P value does not indicate which groups differ. Therefore,
only the comparison of the groups that differ is presented.
The probability of freedom from events (RSS ≥2) was
estimated according to the Kaplan–Meier method, and
estimates were then compared with the log-rank test. A Cox
proportional hazard model was used to identify factors
contributing to prolonged (more than 30 days) elevation of
RSS > 2.
Indexed growth velocity calculations (g/kg/d) between a
certain time interval were calculated by subtracting the weight

All statistical analyses were deﬁned by a two-tailed P <

Statistics (version 26.0, IBM, Armonk, NY).
Results
A total of 100 infants were included in the study, with an
almost equal distribution of the number of infants in each
group (34 in Group-1 and 33 each in Groups 2 and 3). All
except for two infants had at least one course of medical
treatment for PDA closure. These two infants, both
belonging to Group-1 had primary TCPC as there were
contraindications for medical therapy. Infants in all three
groups were similar for gestational age, birth weight, and
gender (Table 1). The median age at PDA closure was
signiﬁcantly different based on the selection criteria. Simi-
larly, the median procedure weight at the time of PDA
closure for Group-1 infants was signiﬁcantly lower com-
pared to Group-3 infants (Table 1). Infants in Group-1 had
less incidence of sepsis and NEC Stage-IIB and -III prior to
TCPC compared to Groups 2 and 3. However, the incidence
of IVH Grade-III and -IV prior to TCPC was similar in all
three groups. At the time of procedure, 48 infants were ≤1
kg, 32 infants were >1 to ≤2 kg, and 20 infants were >2 kg.
The procedure success rate was 100%. There were no
procedure-related complications.
Hemodynamic assessment
The median baseline Qp:Qs ratios were not different irre-
spective of the timing of PDA closure, with all being
>1.5:1, suggesting that the majority of PDAs that were
referred for transcatheter closure were hemodynamically
signiﬁcant (Table 2). There was a trend for a larger shunt in
younger (Group-1; median 2.5:1, range 1.6:1–4:1) infants
compared to those infants with delayed PDA closure
(Group-3; median 1.8:1, range 0.8:1–4.2:1). Despite the
relatively lower baseline shunt volume in older Group-3
infants with delayed PDA closure, the PASPs were higher
than infants in Group-1 (median PASP 50% systemic vs.
76% systemic for Group-1 vs. Group-3; P < 0.001) sec-
ondary to an increased baseline pulmonary vascular resis-
tance (median baseline PVRi = 1.6 vs. 3.3 WU*m2 for
Groups 1 and 3, respectively; P < 0.001).

All infants were on mechanical ventilator support at the
time of TCPC. Though not statistically different, the mean

baseline RSS was highest for infants in Group-3 (Table 3).
However, the RSS immediately post-TCPC was sig-
niﬁcantly higher for infants in Group-3 compared to Group-
1 (median 5.8 vs. 3.4; P = 0.015). Though the infants in
Group-1 were younger and smaller, they were able to
extubate sooner compared to Group-3 (median time to
extubate from TCPC was 16 vs. 39 days; P = 0.001). Also,
infants in Group-3 took a longer time to wean from
respiratory support as evidenced by prolonged time taken
for RSS to get to a score of <2 from the time of TCPC
as compared to infants in Group-1 (median 81 vs. 20 days;
P = 0.001).
Kaplan–Meier analysis comparing the time taken to
achieve an RSS < 2 from PDA closure based on the age at
PDA closure (Fig. 2) shows an overall P value of P = 0.026
(log-rank test = 7.26) indicating that there are group dif-
ferences. Speciﬁc comparisons reveal that infants with early
PDA closure (<4 weeks of age) reach RSS < 2 signiﬁcantly
faster than those with late PDA closure of >8 weeks (log-
rank test = 6.43, P = 0.01). The predictors of prolonged
(>30 days) elevation of RSS ≥2 were: TCPC performed at
>8 weeks of age and a PVRi ≥3 (OR = 3.2, 95% CI:
1.7–5.8, P = 0.03 and OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 2.7–8.9, P < 0.01,
respectively).
Inﬂuence of pulmonary hypertension (PHT)
Sixty-four percent of infants from the entire cohort had an
elevated PASP (deﬁned as an PASP > 50% of SBP).
However, in 44%, this was secondary to increased pul-
monary blood ﬂow from the PDA and not secondary to
pulmonary vascular disease. However, 20 infants (17 from
Group-3, three from Group-2 and none from Group-1) had
true PHT secondary to elevated baseline PVRi ≥3 WU*m2.
A comparison of the demographics and outcomes of infants
undergoing TCPC with and without PHT is outlined in
Table 4. Infants with a baseline elevated PVRi of ≥3
WU*m2 were further evaluated with vasoreactivity testing
and test occlusion of the PDA as shown in Fig. 3 (Graphs A,
B, and C). With 100% FiO2 and 20 ppm iNO, there was an
expected increase in Qp:Qs ratio (from 2 ± 0.75 at baseline
to 3 ± 1; P < 0.01) and a drop in PASP (from 75 ± 9% of
SBP at baseline to 58 ± 7% of SBP; P < 0.01) due to a
decrease in PVRi (4.8 ± 0.9 WU*m2 at baseline to 3.7 ± 0.5
WU*m2; P < 0.001), suggesting good vasoreactivity of the
pulmonary vascular bed. As expected, test occlusion of the
PDA decreased the Qp:Qs (to nearly 1:1 in all; P < 0.001)
with a further, albeit relatively minor decrease in PASP
(55 ± 8% of SBP; P = 0.67) and almost no change in PVRi
(3.7 ± 0.5 WU*m2; P = 0.89). Based on these ﬁndings all
PDAs were found to be suitable for closure.
Though the gestational age and birth weights were
similar, those with PHT were referred for PDA closure later
(median procedure age of 84 vs. 32 days; P < 0.001) and
consequently had a higher pre-procedure RSS (median 5.9
vs. 3.0; P < 0.001). This group of infants took a longer time
to return to their baseline RSS following TCPC in
comparison to infants without PHT (median of 32 vs. 6 h,

P < 0.001, OR = 3.9), making them higher risk infants to
undergo the procedure. Infants with PHT, though older than
those without PHT, took longer to extubate from the time of
PDA closure (median time to extubate—30 vs. 18 days; P <

after PDA closure compared to those without PHT (median
time to RSS < 2 from TCPC 61 vs. 23 days; P < 0.001)
indicating the need for prolonged respiratory support.
Assessment of growth velocity
The mean weight gain for infants in Group-1 in 4 weeks
immediately following PDA closure was 24.7 ± 7.9 g/day
(which was faster than the 14.3 ± 9.2 g/day in 2 weeks prior
to PDA closure (P = 0.032)). The mean indexed weight
gain for Group-1 pre-and post-PDA closure was 15.7 ± 8.6
g/kg/day and 19.9 ± 7.8 g/kg/day (P = 0.036). The mean
weight gain for infants in Group-3 in the 2 weeks prior to
(18.8 ± 8.8 g/day; 10.4 ± 6.3 g/kg/day) and the 4 weeks
post-PDA closure (20.4 ± 10.3 g/day; 9.9 ± 6.1 g/kg/day)
was not signiﬁcantly different (P = 0.358).
It is also worth noting that speciﬁcally between 4 and
8 weeks of life, the weight gain for infants in Group-1 (who
had PDAs closed before this time) was 25.0 ± 8.2 g/day
(20.8 ± 6.9 g/kg/day), which was much more rapid than
those in Group-3 (who still had the PDA during this time),
whose weight gain was 16.2 ± 6.4 (13.5 ± 5.3) during the
4–8 weeks of life (P = 0.002). The growth during the
4–8 weeks period is important for the overall outcome of
these ELBW infants. This further supports the notion that
earlier PDA closure would be beneﬁcial for ELBW infants.
Discussion
This study is distinctive in evaluating real-time hemody-
namics of PDA closure in ELBW infants. There have been
previous case series [19–21] evaluating hemodynamics with
test occlusion of the PDA in older children and adults but
none have identiﬁed the difference in hemodynamics based
on timing of closure in ELBW infants. Though this study
has multiple limitations, it clearly describes the hemody-
namic signiﬁcance of PDA in ELBW infants at various time
points. In infants born ≤27 weeks’ gestation, weighing ≤1
kg, closing a hsPDA may carry certain advantages includ-
ing, faster weaning off mechanical ventilator and oxygen
supplementation and improved weight gain.
PHT is a delayed sequela of a persistent, large left-to-
right shunt in term infants. Although this study does not
look into the late development of PHT in infants undergoing
early PDA closure, persistent ductal patency seems to lead
to accelerated pulmonary vascular disease in ELBW infants.
With the primary clinical focus on the systemic steal of a
large PDA, the risk of developing PHT is often overlooked
during decision-making for PDA closure.
The overall mortality of BPD and PHT in preterm chil-
dren is as high as 18–30% at 2 years of age [22]. 64% of
infants in this study had an elevated PASP. In the presence
of a large PDA, there can be equalization of pressures
between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Elevated PASP
per se is not analogous with PHT. The diagnosis of PHT is
truly based on elevated pulmonary vascular resistance
(PVRi), which unfortunately cannot be calculated using
clinical criteria or noninvasive testing. PHT is the product
Fig. 3 Hemodynamic assessment of 40 infants with pulmonary
hypertension (PHT), which is deﬁned as pulmonary vascular
resistance >3 WU*m2 under three differing conditions—at base-
line, with 100% oxygen (FiO2) and 20 ppm iNO and with test
occlusion of the PDA. a Change in pulmonary to systemic blood ﬂow
ratio (Qp:Qs) under the three hemodynamic conditions. Note that the
use of pulmonary vasodilator therapy using 100% FiO2 and 20 ppm
iNO is associated with increased shunting across the PDA and increase
in pulmonary blood ﬂow and decrease in systemic blood ﬂow as
evidenced by an increase in Qp:Qs ratio. With test occlusion of the
PDA, the Qp:Qs is 1:1 suggestive of no residual shunting across the
PDA. b Change in pulmonary artery systolic pressure expressed as a
percentage of the systolic blood pressure (PAP%). At baseline, all
infants with PHT have >50% systemic pulmonary artery systolic
pressure and as high as 100%. With pulmonary vasodilator therapy
using 100% FiO2 and 20 ppm iNO, there is decrease in PAP% sug-
gestive of reactive pulmonary capillary bed. With PDA occlusion,
there is further decrease in PAP% as the pulmonary blood ﬂow is
decreased. c Change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with
change in loading conditions. At baseline, all infants have PVR >
3WU*m2. With pulmonary vasodilator therapy using 100% FiO2 and
20 ppm iNO, there is decrease in PVR suggestive of reactive pul-
monary capillary bed. With PDA occlusion, there is no further
decrease in PVR as decrease in pulmonary blood ﬂow only affects the
PAP% and not the PVR (pressure = ﬂow × resistance).

of both pulmonary blood ﬂow (Qp) and PVRi (pressure =
ﬂow × resistance). Therefore, in order to efﬁciently treat
PHT, the Qp has to be controlled by closing the PDA for
pulmonary vasodilators to be adroitly functional, which
could hypothetically reduce the previously stated 2-year
mortality. The use of pulmonary vasodilator therapy in
ELBW infants with a hsPDA can worsen the hemodynamic
load on the pulmonary vasculature. As was demonstrated by
vasoreactivity testing, even for infants in Group-3, there
was a fall in the PASP suggestive of reversible PHT in the
majority. As illustrated in the hemodynamic graphs (Fig. 3)
test occlusion of the PDA, helped to decipher the con-
tribution of left-to-right shunt and PVRi to PHT and helped
assess if it was safe to close these PDAs. On the contrary,
PDAs with right-to-left shunting providing a “pop off” for
systemic perfusion should not be closed. In these infants,
vasodilator therapy can be initiated with plans for re-
evaluation of hemodynamics after providing time for vas-
cular remodeling.
The debate of, “if”, “when”, and “how” to close a hsPDA
in ELBW infants rages on [23–25]. Let’s ﬁrst tackle the
question of “when” the optimal timing of PDA closure is.
Based on this study, the beneﬁts of early closure include
rapid improvement in the respiratory status of ELBW
infants and normal growth velocity. Though the groups are
not comparable, early PDA closure was associated with
short periods of intubation, mechanical ventilation, and
oxygen supplementation as shown by a fast decrease in RSS
to <2. This study also identiﬁes PHT and delayed PDA
closure as risk factors for worse respiratory outcomes and
hence attempts to answer the relevant question as to when a
PDA should be closed. This study also endeavors to answer
the question of “how” the PDA should be closed. Medical
therapy does not ensure 100% closure of the PDA with a
variable success rate and side effect proﬁle [26, 27]. Sur-
gical ligation is too invasive and is associated with multiple
adverse effects [28, 29]. TCPC does have an initial learning
curve. However, once the operator experience improves,
such as at our center, it can be performed with good success
with no signiﬁcant adverse events [11]. Transcatheter clo-
sure also has the advantage of obtaining invaluable infor-
mation on hemodynamic signiﬁcance (Qp:Qs ratio) and
pulmonary vascular resistance, which is not possible with
either surgical ligation or medical therapy.
The only question that now remains is whether the PDA
should be closed in ELBW infants. What can be agreed
upon from previous studies is that the increased risk of
neonatal morbidities is only associated with moderate-to-
large PDAs and not with small shunts and that moderate-to-
large PDAs lower systemic blood pressure and alter pul-
monary compliance [30]. The beneﬁt of any therapy should
be to improve outcomes. In the past, a multitude of RCTs
failed to demonstrate any beneﬁt to PDA closure. The
effectiveness of drugs used to constrict the PDA (indo-
methacin, ibuprofen, and paracetamol) in less mature
infants (especially ≤26 weeks) is signiﬁcantly reduced [6].
One could argue that these RCTs included an imperfect
therapy, therefore leading to the wrong conclusions. Many
of these RCTs did not have a good deﬁnition for a hsPDA,
thereby lumping all comers. The therapy that was chosen
were either the use of COX inhibitors, which are not 100%
effective, and take too long to show effect, or surgical
ligation that was too invasive. In this study, hemodynamic
signiﬁcance was deﬁnitely assured by performing a diag-
nostic catheterization prior to PDA closure and measuring
the pulmonary blood ﬂow (Qp) and its ratio to systemic
cardiac output (Qs). This is the ﬁrst-time deﬁnitive closure
of PDAs whose hemodynamics were measured prior to
closure was shown to have beneﬁt in outcomes. The ben-
eﬁts being, early extubation, faster decline in RSS,
improved growth velocity and perhaps avoidance of
development of PHT. The converse was also measured.
Persistent patency of a hsPDA in ELBW infants was shown
to be associated with early onset PHT, prolonged elevation
of RSS and poor growth rate prior to PDA closure. Since
our experience with TCPC has grown and procedural
complications are minimal [12], our center has a lower
threshold to intervene. Since January 2016, the age at which
TCPC was performed at our center has steadily declined.
We started out with older children with BPD and PHT.
Almost all these patients belonged to Group-3. More
recently, the age at which ELBW infants are referred for
TCPC has been between the second and third week of life,
principally all belonging to Group-1. This change in clinical
practice secondary to the entire team getting comfortable
with the procedure and post-procedure care has led to
improved outcomes [31]. In fact, we do not encounter
infants with severe PHT being referred for cardiac cathe-
terization anymore.
Obviously, this is only anecdotal. However, we believe
that we are on to something propitious as an increasing
number of centers have recently started transferring patients
in for this procedure. If the results were not encouraging,
referring institutes would not take the risk of transferring
fragile ELBW infants over long distances. Therefore, the
debate of whether the hsPDA needs to be closed in the early
neonatal period in ELBW infants can only be addressed by
a properly designed RCT comparing this therapy with no
intervention on the PDA. In the meantime, TCPC does offer
an alternative for an age-old problem.
Our recommendation is a stepwise approach including
initial medical therapy. At 2–3 weeks of age, if the
moderate-to-large PDA persists with increased ventilatory
or supplemental oxygen requirements and feeding issues, it
should be considered for closure. We would recommend
TCPC as the best method to close it after failed medical

therapy as it is associated with the least adverse events, at
least in an experienced center.
This study is limited by being retrospective and not
randomized. There is also a selection bias in that possibly
the infants in Group-3 were not stable at an earlier age and
hence were referred late and had worse respiratory out-
comes. Though the groups are similar, multiple other
comorbidities and confounding factors usually associated
with ELBW infants were not factored while interpreting the
results. However, the point of this study was only to address
the hemodynamics of a persistent hsPDA and its sig-
niﬁcance and not on all co-morbidities.
Enrollees in this study did not have any worsening of
pre-existing co-morbidities after TCPC. Infants in Group-1
had less incidence of sepsis and NEC Stage-IIB and -III
prior to TCPC compared to Groups 2 and 3. There was no
recurrence of NEC post TCPC, and no infant that did not
have NEC prior to TCPC developed NEC post procedure.
Selection bias also exists in the pattern of referrals. As
TCPC proved to be feasible and associated with negligible
adverse events, the age at which ELBW infants were
referred for TCPC declined overtime. The subset of infants
that had an elevated PVRi needing hemodynamic assess-
ment gradually decreased overtime as the number of early
referrals for TCPC increased. We are in the process of
prospectively following these infants that underwent early
versus delayed closure of hsPDA for longer term neurode-
velopmental outcomes.
Other recent studies inspecting medical [32] and surgical
[33] therapies have evaluated early versus late closure of the
PDA and have demonstrated lesser incidence of BPD,
ventilator dependence, and feeding intolerance, respec-
tively, but have needed further evaluation of long-term
outcomes. In the last 30–40 years the pendulum on whether
to close or not to close has changed and hence the medical
community remains divided on this issue. However, most of
these questions have been based on medical and surgical
ligations. With advancing technology and growing experi-
ence in ELBW infants [11, 13], TCPC offers a safer [11],
more advanced diagnostic and clinically informative ther-
apeutic option to answer all of these questions. With the
recent FDA approval of a device for TCPC because it was
found to be safe and effective [34], the natural next step will
be to demonstrate beneﬁts, identify who beneﬁts the most
and at what age will these beneﬁts be most signiﬁcantly
appreciated.
Conclusions
It may be beneﬁcial to close hsPDA in the ﬁrst 4 weeks of
life and before the onset of elevated PVRi in ELBW infants.
Early PDA closure may also afford faster weaning off
ventilator and oxygen support and allows for better weight
gain. In addition to providing immediate closure of the
PDA, TCPC also provides useful hemodynamics to ascer-
tain safe closure and appropriate infant selection.
Future directions
Before adopting early, indiscriminate use of TCPC, it is
essential that we design RCTs that examine both the short-
term and long-term beneﬁts for the infant [30]. To evaluate
long-term beneﬁts of PDA closure it is essential to identify
the population that will be of most beneﬁt, the appropriate
timing of the intervention to achieve that beneﬁt and the
ﬁtting method of intervention. A well-designed RCT in
preterm infants ≤27 weeks of gestation with hsPDA in the
neonatal period is needed. The ideal study would be to
evaluate no intervention versus TCPC as early as 7–10 days
of life. Evaluation of long-term neurodevelopmental out-
comes in this cohort is most vital.
