OBJECTIVE: Assess the effect of increasing pulse oximetry targets on incidence of pulmonary hypertension in very low birthweight
premature infants.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing pulmonary hypertension incidence among three cohorts of premature
infants exposed to varying oxygen saturation targets (Cohort 1: n = 459, 1 May 2009 to 30 April 2011, 85–94%; Cohort 2: n = 474, 1
May 2011 to 31 May 2013, 88–94%; Cohort 3: n = 387, 1 June 2013 to 31 May 2015, 90–95%). Subjects had birth weight o1500 g
and gestational age 23–32 weeks. Chi-square, Kruskall–Wallis and Anderson–Darling tests were used, as well as multivariable
logistic regression.
RESULTS: Incidence of pulmonary hypertension declined with higher oxygen saturation targets (19.0% Cohort 1, 7.9% Cohort 2,
9.6% Cohort 3, Po0.001). Other parameters were largely not different between cohorts though rates of chorioamnionitis and
prenatal steroids increased and oxygen use, inhaled nitric oxide use, necrotizing enterocolitis and patent ductus arteriosus ligation
decreased over time.
CONCLUSION: Higher oxygen saturation targets for very low-birthweight premature infants were associated with reduced rates of
pulmonary hypertension in this retrospective cohort study.

INTRODUCTION
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increasingly recognized cause
of morbidity and mortality in premature infants.1–5 Both hypoxia
and hyperoxia have been implicated as potential contributors to
PH pathogenesis in infancy.6–12 Optimal oxygen saturation (SpO2)
to reduce the risk for developing PH in premature infants has not
been identiﬁed.
Indeed, the larger question of optimal oxygen SpO2 for premature
infants more generally remains an area of active inquiry and
debate.13–16 Concern for the potential of worsening retinopathy of
prematurity (ROP) from excessive oxygen exposure has led to
reduced SpO2 targets;17–19 however other research suggests SpO2
target may not signiﬁcantly impact development20 or progression of
ROP.21 In addition to the controversy over ROP, other morbidities
such as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)22 and necrotizing enter-
ocolitis (NEC)14 may also be affected by SpO2 targets. Perhaps the
most important and deﬁnitive endpoint, mortality, appears to also
be affected by SpO2 targets and, while not all studies are consistent,
the weight of evidence suggests that higher SpO2 targets are
associated with lower risk of mortality.13,14,17,23
One possible mechanism to explain the observed reduction in
mortality in babies with higher SpO2 targets is that they might
have lower rates of PH. Unfortunately, PH diagnosis was not
reported in the large saturation targeting trials14,18,23 and was an
exclusion criterion in one.20 Hypoxia is a known contributor to the
development of PH via various mechanisms6,24–27 and infants with
BPD have been shown to have a more robust pulmonary
vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia than controls.7 PH has been
shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality in BPD even
when controlling for BPD disease severity.1,4,5 We, therefore,
hypothesized that increased SpO2 targets would lead to a
reduction in PH in very low birthweight premature infants.
To investigate this hypothesis, we studied the rate of PH
diagnosis in a large population of at risk premature infants
exposed to different SpO2 target ranges. On the basis of the
results of several large oxygen saturation targeting trials, the
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Northside Hospital in
Atlanta, Georgia, a large, community-based level III NICU, has
twice increased its SpO2 targets over the last 5 years. We set out to
investigate whether rates of PH diagnosis and PH medication use
changed with increasing SpO2 targets.
METHODS
This is a retrospective cohort study comparing three sets of patients from
eras deﬁned by the unit-wide SpO2 targets. A total of 1340 premature
infants with gestational age between 23 and 32 weeks, inclusive, and birth
weight o1500 gm admitted to Northside Hospital NICU in Atlanta Georgia
between May 1 2009 and May 31 2015 were studied. Cohort 1 consisted of
459 patients born between May 1 2009 and April 30 2011. The unit-wide
SpO2 target range during that time frame was 85–94%. Cohort 2 was
comprised of 494 patients born between May 1 2011 and May 31 2013
with SpO2 target range of 88–94%. Cohort 3 included 387 patients born
between June 1 2013 and May 31 2015 with SpO2 target range of 90–95%.
The bedside SpO2 alarm limits were identical to the targeted SpO2 ranges
for the study duration, giving real-time feedback to bedside caregivers.

Also, as part of a quality assurance initiative, data from a computerized
system tracking pulse oximetry ranges over longer stretches of time
provided feedback starting in 2011.
Institutional review board approval was obtained from all participating
institutions: Northside Hospital, Pediatrix Medical Group and Children’s
Healthcare of Atlanta.
Clinical demographics
Antenatal, birth and neonatal characteristics were obtained from the
Vermont-Oxford Network database, as well as the clinical and adminis-
trative records maintained by neonatology group stafﬁng the NICU
(Babysteps, Pediatrix Medical Group). An emphasis was placed on
investigating parameters believed to be associated with PH diagnosis
such as small for gestational age (SGA, deﬁned as birthweight o10th
percentile for gestational age28), maternal chorioamnionitis and patent
ductus arteriosus (PDA).
Outcomes
The standard practice in the Northside Hospital NICU is to perform
monthly echocardiograms to assess for PH in premature infants requiring
respiratory support. A consistent group of cardiologists interpreted
echocardiograms during the timeframe of the study and all had received
instruction from the Pulmonary Hypertension Program Director (Kanaan)
on standard PH assessment and diagnostic criteria. Criteria for considera-
tion of a PH diagnosis were standardized (including elevated tricuspid
regurgitant velocity (43 m s −1, 436 mm Hg), elevated pulmonary insuf-
ﬁciency end-diastolic velocity (41.5 m s −1, 49 mm Hg), right to left atrial
shunting, right to left ventricular shunting, right to left ductal shunting,
right ventricular dilation, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular
dysfunction); however clinical judgment to account for other factors
impacting cardiovascular physiology was stressed leaving the ultimate PH
diagnosis at treating physicians’ discretion. Many subjects had more than
one echocardiogram and diagnosis of PH on any study led to assignment
to the PH group for the purposes of this study (even if PH had not been
present on prior studies or resolved in follow up). The diagnosis of PH was
made by the treating neonatologist and pediatric cardiologist based on
supporting imaging and clinical data, with the neonatologist placing the
diagnosis in the medical record. Use of medications to treat PH was at the
treating physicians’ discretion. Documentation of medication use was
obtained from the medical record and conﬁrmed with the NICU pharmacy.

outcomes potentially affected by changing oxygen saturation targets were
also compared across cohorts.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA).
Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed at the 0.05 level. Descriptive statistics
were calculated for all variables of interest and included medians and
interquartile ranges and counts and percentages, when appropriate.
Categorical variables were compared across the three eras using the Chi-
square test. Normality of continuous variables was assessed using
histograms, normal probability plots and through the Anderson–Darling
test for normality. The distribution of continuous variables was compared
across the three eras using Kruskal–Wallis tests.
Since there were differences found between the three eras (Table 1), an
adjusted analysis was performed to control for these differences and
potential confounders. This adjusted model included all variables that were
found to be different across the three eras (Table 1, Po0.20), as well as
variables that were associated with developing pulmonary hypertension
(Table 3, Po0.20) or thought to be clinically relevant and had sufﬁcient
sample size (missing o10% observations). In instances of collinearity,
collinear variables were excluded. For example, in the case of birthweight,
small for gestational age status and gestational age, only gestational age
and SGA were included as the birthweight is a function of the other two
variables. Variables that were thought to be caused by PH or part of the PH
treatment (for example, oxygen on day of life 28, oxygen at 36 weeks cGA,
use of inhalted nitric oxide and so on) were not included in the adjusted
analysis. Variables included in the adjusted model were maternal
pregnancy induced hypertension, multiple gestation, small for gestational
age, gestational age at birth, surfactant in delivery room, 5- min Apgar
score, IVH grade and invasive infection after day of life 3. Variables were
retained in the adjusted analysis regardless of signiﬁcance to estimate the
effect of cohort in the presence of these potential confounders.
To identify risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality, a multi-
variable logistic model was constructed. Univariable and multivariable
logistic regression were used to obtain estimates of association between
in-hospital mortality and each candidate predictor. Predictors that were
signiﬁcantly associated with in-hospital mortality at the univariable level
(Po0.20) and had sufﬁcient sample size (missing o10% of observations),
or were felt to be clinically relevant, were included in multivariable
modeling. Variables remained in the ﬁnal model if they were signiﬁcant at
Po0.05. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were
constructed for both univariable and multivariable models.
RESULTS
Baseline data
Table 1 summarizes patient characteristics between the three
cohorts. Prenatal characteristics were similar with respect to rates
of multiparity and pregnancy induced hypertension, however,
maternal chorioamnionitis rates (Cohort 1: 20 out of 459, 4.4%;
Cohort 2: 47 out of 494, 9.5%; Cohort 3: 39 out of 387, 10.1%;
P = 0.002) and prenatal steroid use (Cohort 1: 392 out of 459,
85.4%; Cohort 2: 442 out of 494, 89.5%; Cohort 3: 351 out of 387,
90.7%; P = 0.037) both increased over time.
Neonatal characteristics were also largely similar across cohorts.
There were statistically signiﬁcant trends in the racial makeup of
the cohorts with a reduction in the White population and increase
in the Asian population over time (P = 0.007). Important risk factors
for PH and other morbidities in premature infants such as
gestational age at birth, small for gestational age status, birth
weight, surfactant delivery in the delivery room, and 5 min Apgar
score did not trend over time.
Respiratory characteristics and comorbidities
Use of oxygen at day of life 28 was not different across cohorts,
however, oxygen use at 36 weeks corrected gestational age
decreased over time despite the more stringent SpO2 requirement
(CGA; Cohort 1: 120 out of 459, 34.2%; Cohort 2: 81 out of 494,
21.8%; Cohort 3: 72 out of 387, 24.9%; Po0.001). Post-natal
steroid use to treat chronic lung disease of prematurity increased
over time (Cohort 1: 46 out of 459, 10.2%; Cohort 2: 109 out of 494,
22.3%; Cohort 3: 79 out of 387, 20.7%; Po0.001).
Rates of PDA ligation decreased signiﬁcantly over time (Cohort
1: 36 out of 459, 8%; Cohort 2: 17 out of 494, 3.5%; Cohort 3: 8 out
of 387, 2.1%; Po0.001) though information on the size or
signiﬁcance of PDAs not referred for surgical ligation was not
reviewed. NEC rates also decreased signiﬁcantly over time (Cohort
1: 40 out of 459, 8.9%; Cohort 2: 20 out of 494, 4.1%; Cohort 3: 9
out of 387, 2.4%; Po0.001). ROP, IVH and invasive infection after
day of life three did not trend over time.
Pulmonary hypertension and other outcomes
Table 2 summarizes the measured outcomes. The primary
outcome, PH diagnosis, was signiﬁcantly lower in the higher
SpO2 target cohorts (Cohort 1: 87 out of 459, 19.0%; Cohort 2: 39
out of 494, 7.9%; Cohort 3: 37 out of 387, 9.6%; Po0.001).
Although cohort three had a slightly higher rate of PH diagnosis
compared with cohort two (9.6 vs 7.9%, P = 0.382), these were not
statistically different whereas the overall trend for decreased PH
diagnosis with increasing saturations was signiﬁcant (Po0.001).
Inhaled nitric oxide use also decreased with increasing saturation
target ranges (Cohort 1: 25 out of 459, 2.2%; Cohort 2: 14 out of
494, 2.8%; Cohort 3: 9 out of 387, 2.3%; P = 0.013). Other PH
medications were used infrequently and did not trend with
increasing saturation target ranges. In hospital mortality, weight at
initial disposition (discharge or transfer), and initial length of stay
(to ﬁrst transfer or discharge) did not trend over time.
We compared characteristics and outcomes of infants with PH
with those who did not develop PH grouping all cohorts together
(Table 3) and within cohorts (not shown, not signiﬁcantly different
from grouped data). This table was used to identify potential
confounding variables to include in our multivariable analysis
(Table 4). Consistent with published studies of risk factors for
development of PH in premature infants, we found younger
gestational age at birth (26 weeks vs 28 weeks, Po0.001), SGA

status (33.7 vs 21%, Po0.001), and lower birthweight (705 gm vs
1058 gm, Po0.001) to be more common in infants diagnosed
with PH in comparison with their non-PH counterparts. We also
found that infants with PH were more likely to have received
surfactant in the delivery room (66.3 vs 30.9%, Po0.001) or have
had a 5- min Apgar scoreso3 (8.6 vs 4.5%, P = 0.026). Infants with
PH were more likely to require oxygen on day of life 28 (93.7 vs
57%, Po0.001), at 36 weeks CGA (78.2 vs 20.2%, Po0.001), or
receive inhaled nitric oxide (31.9 vs 0.2%, Po0.001) or steroids for
chronic lung disease (51.5 vs 13.0%, Po0.001). PDA ligation (14.7
vs 3.2%, Po0.001), severe ROP (24.2 vs 3%, Po0.001), severe IVH
(23.3 vs 6%, Po0.001), and invasive infection after day of life 3
(19.2 vs 4.7%, Po0.001) were all associated with PH diagnosis
while NEC was not associated with PH in our data set. In-hospital
mortality was almost three-fold higher in infants with PH (33.1 vs
11.2%, Po0.001) in univariate modeling and this association
between PH diagnosis and mortality remained on multivariable
testing while controlling for potential confounders (OR = 3.36; 95%
CI: (2.04–5.55), Po0.001). Unsurprisingly, PH-speciﬁc medication
use was almost exclusively in the PH population. Hospital length
of stay and weight at initial disposition (discharge or transfer) were
not different between PH and no PH groups.
Our primary outcome, odds of developing PH based on cohort,
is shown in Table 4 in both unadjusted and adjusted models. In
the unadjusted model, the odds ratio (OR) for developing PH in
Cohort 2 was 0.37 (95% CI: (0.25–0.55), Po0.001) and in Cohort 3
was 0.45 (95% CI: (0.30–0.68), Po0.001) using Cohort 1 as the
reference, demonstrating a signiﬁcantly lower odds of developing
PH in the later cohorts. The effect of controlling for variables that
were different among cohorts, different between PH and no PH
groups, and those that were thought to be clinically relevant, was
to strengthen the relationship between cohort and PH diagnosis.
Variables adjusted for were maternal pregnancy induced hyper-
tension, maternal chorioamnionitis, prenatal steroid use, multiple
gestation, small for gestational age status, gestational age at birth,
mother of Hispanic origin, maternal race, surfactant in delivery
room, 5-minute Apgar score o3, steroids for CLD, PDA ligation,
necrotizing enterocolitis, IVH grade ⩾2 and invasive infection after
day of life 3. The odds of developing PH in Cohort 2 was 0.17
(0.10–0.30, Po0.001) and in Cohort 3 was 0.24 (0.13–0.42,
Po0.001), when controlling for these variables.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst publication investigating the
effect of changes in SpO2 targeting on the incidence of PH in
premature infants. In our large, community-based, tertiary NICU,

we found that incidence of PH decreased in association with
increased SpO2 target range. Our ﬁndings on PH incidence are
congruent with the observed improvement in mortality with
higher SpO2 targets described in large SpO2 targeting trials.18,23
The ﬁndings support the possibility that the reduced mortality in
these studies (excluding the Canadian Oxygen Trial20 as PH
patients were excluded at time of enrollment) may be related to
reduction in incidence of PH.
In-hospital mortality was not statistically different across our
three cohorts. As with other published reports, though, PH
diagnosis was a signiﬁcant independent risk factor for mortality
in our population increasing the odds of death by over 3-fold in
our multivariable model.1,4,5 Gestational age at birth and SGA
status have repeatedly been shown to be strong predictors of
developing PH and we also found that in our analysis (data not
shown).29 It is worth special mention that our cohorts did not vary
with respect to these important risk factors.
Other factors that may impact PH incidence were also largely
similar across the three cohorts, though there were three
differences that warrant discussion. We found increased use of
prenatal steroids and increased maternal chorioamnionitis over
time, however, on multivariable analysis, neither of these factors
was associated with PH diagnosis. In addition, there was no
difference in prenatal steroid use or chorioamnionitis diagnosis
between those with PH and those without PH. We extensively
sought out an explanation for our ﬁnding of increased chor-
ioamnionitis rates across cohorts through investigations with
obstetrics, perinatology, and pathology departments at our
hospital and could not identify an explanation. There was no
change
in
deﬁnition,
no
increase
in
placental
specimens
submitted to pathology for review, and no identiﬁable change
in practice. It is worthy of note that chorioamnionitis rates
increased while PH diagnoses fell so the likelihood of interplay for
that variable is low. Post-natal steroid use did, however, go up
over time and could be protective. It could, also, be part of a
treatment strategy. Because we did not know the timing of steroid
use with respect to PH diagnosis, we included it in our model of
potential confounders and, when adjusted for, did not weaken the
link between cohort and PH diagnosis.
Unexpectedly, we found that oxygen use at 36 weeks CGA was
lower in the higher SpO2 target range cohorts in contrast to the
SUPPORT trial.18 One possible explanation for this ﬁnding is that
reduction in intermittent hypoxic episodes in the higher satura-
tion groups may have a positive effect on lung health.6 Another
contributor could be greater efforts aimed at adherence to oxygen
saturation targets in our NICU from 2012 onward in response to
emerging awareness of the importance of SpO2 targeting.
The use of PDA ligation decreased signiﬁcantly over time. This
may reﬂect a reduction in the incidence of hemodynamically
signiﬁcant PDA due to increased oxygen saturations—a ﬁnding
suggested by Inomata et al. and consistent with oxygen’s role in
inducing ductal closure.22,30 This, in turn, might lead to a reduction
in shear stress on the pulmonary arterial endothelium and result in
lower rates of PH. Another explanation that must be considered,
though, is that clinical practice in this NICU has fallen away from
ductal ligation in most cases. We must, therefore, consider the
possibility that a reduction in PDA ligation led to a reduction in PH,
not the increase in SpO2 target range. However, when controlling
for PDA ligation (among other potential confounders) on multi-
variable testing, the odds of developing PH went down compared
to the unadjusted model so it does not appear that reduction in
PDA ligation led to the reduction in PH diagnosis.
In contrast to the experience of Manley et al.19 we experience,
we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant change in the rate of ROP diagnosis
or severity with increased SpO2 target range. This is an important
ﬁnding as concern related to risk of oxygen on ROP development
is one of the most often cited rationales for maintaining lower
saturation targets. Interestingly, PH was associated with higher
rates of more severe ROP in our study population, likely related to
shared
risk
factors
though
we
cannot
exclude
a
causal
relationship.
This retrospective cohort study is strengthened by the large
number of included patients with 1340 severely premature infants
cared for in a single center. A consistent group of neonatologists
and pediatric cardiologists cared for these patients over this time
period which serves to lessen variability in diagnostic criteria and
clinical care and help isolate the impact of the SpO2 target range.
While our population is drawn from a single center, it is similar to
previously published series with respect to risk factors for PH and
outcomes. We, therefore, feel it is a representative group and our
ﬁndings are likely to be generalizable to other centers.
A signiﬁcant limitation of this research is the absence of a strict
diagnostic criterion for PH. Cardiac catheterization, the gold
standard for PH diagnosis, is not performed in infants at Northside
Hospital and was only performed in a small subset of the patients
after transfer to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. Echocardiogra-
phy, while not the gold standard, is the modality most frequently
used for PH diagnosis in this patient population. The interpreta-
tions of echocardiography in this population is challenging and
multiple factors must be considered (post-natal age, systemic
blood pressure, cardiac function, presence, magnitude and
direction of shunts, anatomic variables such as branch pulmonary
stenosis and so on) making the use of a single parameter to rule in
or rule out PH impossible. We therefore chose to rely on the
clinical judgment of the treating physicians at the time of clinical
assessment as the most likely to be accurate gauge of whether PH
was present or not. We recognize that there was almost certainly
some misallocation of patients; however any errors are likely to be
evenly distributed across cohorts. We did not have the ability to
retrospectively review echocardiograms from all eras as those in
the earlier era are no longer available. A similar study designed
prospectively allowing for strict adherence to a research imaging
protocol and blinded review of the images and clinical data would
be an appropriate next step to avoid this pitfall.
We are limited, most importantly, by the retrospective nature of
this research, as well as the separation of the three cohorts over
time. Other aspects of neonatal care that changed over the 6 years
under review may have impacted PH diagnosis rates. Querying the
physicians involved over those years helped to identify changes in
unit policies or practice. Those that may have had an impact on
these results include use of donor breastmilk, less aggressive
medical and surgical treatment of PDA, increased feedback to
bedside nurses regarding time babies spent within intended
saturation ranges, and increasing use of non-invasive ventilation.
We must recognize that these and other changes in neonatology
practice may have led to the observed reduction of PH diagnosis,
not the change in SpO2 target range. A prospective, randomized,
blinded study would be required to isolate SpO2 target range from
other potential confounders. In the absence of a new trial, the
charts and imaging tests of the infants included in the large
saturation targeting trials could be reviewed to conﬁrm or refute
our ﬁnding.
We also recognize that subjects born near the end of the
timeframe of their cohort will largely be exposed to the oxygen
saturation target range of the subsequent cohort. As we do not
know what the critical timeframe for saturation target exposure is,
we opted a priori to include subjects based on the policy in place
on the date of birth. However, to determine if the results would
have been changed by splitting the cohorts differently, we re-ran
the analysis using cohort assignment based on discharge date
(data not shown) and found no signiﬁcant difference in the
outcomes. We also considered whether time spent outside of the
NICU at Northside Hospital could have introduced another
confounder. We, therefore, performed a separate sub-analysis
(data not shown) excluding infants who spent any time at other
institutions who may have been exposed to different SpO2 targets

(n = 35 born at other institutions who were transferred into
Northside Hospital after birth, n = 200 transferred out transiently
or permanently to other institutions mainly for surgical procedures,
and n = 9 that met both of these criteria). This sub-analysis resulted
in no meaningful change in any of the relevant outcome measures.
CONCLUSION
In our large, retrospective, single-center experience, exposure to
higher SpO2 target ranges was associated with lower rates of PH
diagnosis. Reduction in mortality with higher saturation targets
observed in other large saturation targeting studies may be
related to reduction in the incidence of PH. Further prospective
research to conﬁrm this ﬁnding is warranted.
