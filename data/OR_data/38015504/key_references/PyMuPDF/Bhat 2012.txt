Prospective Analysis of Pulmonary Hypertension in
Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Pulmonary hypertension is
associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely low
birth weight infants and contributes to morbidity and mortality.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Pulmonary hypertension affects at least
1 in 6 extremely low birth weight infants and persists to
discharge in most survivors. Routine screening of these infants
with echocardiography at 4 weeks of age identiﬁes only one-third
of those affected.
abstract
OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary hypertension is associated with bronchopulmonary
dysplasia in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants and contrib-
utes to morbidity and mortality. The objective was to determine the
prevalence of pulmonary hypertension among ELBW infants by screen-
ing echocardiography and evaluate subsequent outcomes.
METHODS: All ELBW infants admitted to a regional perinatal center
were evaluated for pulmonary hypertension with echocardiography
at 4 weeks of age and subsequently if clinical signs suggestive of
right-sided heart failure or severe lung disease were evident. Man-
agement was at discretion of the clinician, and infants were evaluated
until discharge from the hospital or pre-discharge death occurred.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-ﬁve ELBW infants (birth weight: 755 6 144
g; median gestational age: 26 weeks [interquartile range: 24–27])
were screened from December 2008 to February 2011. Overall, 26
(17.9%) were diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at any time
during
hospitalization
(birth
weight:
665
6
140
g;
median
gestational age: 26 weeks [interquartile range: 24–27]): 9 (6.2%) by
initial screening (early pulmonary hypertension) and 17 (11.7%) who
were identiﬁed later (late pulmonary hypertension). Infants with
pulmonary
hypertension
were
more
likely
to
receive
oxygen
treatment on day 28 compared with those without pulmonary
hypertension (96% vs 75%, P , .05). Of the 26 infants, 3 died (all
in the late group because of cor pulmonale) before being discharged
from the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension is relatively common, affect-
ing at least 1 in 6 ELBW infants, and persists to discharge in most sur-
vivors. Routine screening of ELBW infants with echocardiography at 4
weeks of age identiﬁes only one-third of the infants diagnosed with
pulmonary hypertension. Further research is required to determine
optimal detection and intervention strategies. Pediatrics 2012;129:

Bronchopulmonary
dysplasia
(BPD)
continues to be a major cause of mor-
bidity and late mortality in extremely
preterm infants.1 Pulmonary hyperten-
sion is a cardiovascular complication
that is associated with increased mor-
bidity and mortality in infants with BPD.2
,3 Reduction ofcross-sectional perfusion
area and abnormal muscularization of
peripheral pulmonary vessels are im-
portant in the pathogenesis of pul-
monary hypertension in BPD,4 and
abnormal vascular development also
may contribute to the development
of BPD.5,6 Previous studies from the
presurfactant era7,8 and more recent
studies9,10 have used retrospective
designs, which make it difﬁcult to de-
termine the prevalence and outcomes
of pulmonary hypertension in BPD.
There are no clear guidelines for as-
sessment and monitoring, and case
series and cross- sectional studies may
identify only infants with more severe
BPD and pulmonary hypertension,11
because pulmonary hypertension may
be silent initially and become evident
only after the onset of right-sided
heart failure. After the diagnosis of
right-sided heart failure in a series of
infants,
routine
echocardiographic
screening of extremely low birth
weight (ELBW) infants and tracking of
subsequent outcome were implemen-
ted in our neonatal intensive care unit
to determine if we could diagnose and
manage pulmonary hypertension be-
fore it became severe and possibly
irreversible. We hypothesized that
routine screening of extremely pre-
mature infants would lead to diag-
nosis of pulmonary hypertension in
infants without overt signs and
determine the prevalence of this
complication.
METHODS
Over a 2-year period (December 2008–
February 2011), ELBW infants (birth
weight #1000 g) who survived to 28
days of age at the NICU of the University
of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital
were evaluated soon thereafter (be-
fore 6 weeks of age) with echocardi-
ography to determine the presence or
absence of pulmonary hypertension.
Infants with structural heart disease
other than persistent ductus arterio-
sus or patent foramen ovale and those
with multiple congenital anomalies
were excluded. Infants who were
screened but transferred to other
hospitals before 36 weeks’ corrected
postmenstrual age (PMA) also were
excluded, because outcomes by dis-
charge were not always available.
Subsequentechocardiographywasdone
if severe lung disease or clinical signs
suggestive of right-sided heart failure
were present. Publication of this study
was approved by the University of Ala-
bama at Birmingham institutional re-
view board, with waiver of informed
consent.
Infantswerediagnosedwithpulmonary
hypertension if at least 1 of the fol-
lowing echocardiographic ﬁndingswas
present: (1) right ventricular hyper-
trophy, (2) ﬂatteningof interventricular
septum, (3) presence of tricuspid re-
gurgitationintheabsenceofpulmonary
stenosis, and (4) elevated right ventric-
ular pressures as estimated by Doppler
studies of tricuspid regurgitation jet.
Management of pulmonary hyperten-
sion was at the discretion of the clini-
cian, and infants were managed to
discharge from the hospital or death.
We deﬁned early pulmonary hyper-
tension as pulmonary hypertension
detected during the initial screening.
Late pulmonary hypertension was
deﬁned as pulmonary hypertension
diagnosed after a negative initial screen-
ing (after 6 weeks of age). All infants
diagnosed with pulmonary hyperten-
sion had a predischarge echocar-
diogram. All echocardiograms were
interpreted and reported by pediatric
cardiologists.
Patient characteristics and outcomes
werecollectedprospectivelyuntildeath
or discharge (Tables 1 and 2). BPD was
diagnosed and graded at 36 weeks’
PMA12 with the physiologic deﬁnition
used for oxygen requirement.13 Pul-
monary hypertension was considered
to be treated if supplemental oxygen
with higher oxygen targets, sildenaﬁl,
inhaled nitric oxide, bosentan, and/or
intravenous prostacyclin was used.
Pulmonary hypertension was consid-
ered to be persistent if the predis-
charge echocardiogram showed any
evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension was consid-
ered to have resolved if the last
echocardiogram before discharge
showed no evidence of pulmonary
hypertension. Baseline characteristics
and outcomes were compared between
infants who developed pulmonary hy-
pertension and those who did not.

Descriptive statistics were used to
evaluate the study population. Contin-
uousvariableswerecomparedbyusing
either the t test or the Wilcoxon rank
test/Mann–Whitney U test for normal
or skewed distributions, respectively.
Proportions were compared by x2
/Fisher’s exact test. Risk factors were
evaluated by odds ratios and conﬁ-
dence intervals by using contingency
tables. Adjusted odd ratios were deter-
mined by multiple logistic regression,
to control for possible confounding
effects of other variables. In the multi-
variable model, pulmonary hyperten-
sion at or after initial screening was
considered the dependent variable,
and risk factors signiﬁcant at an a
cutoff of P , .20 were analyzed as
independent variables. All data were
analyzed with SPSS 17.0 for Windows
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All statistical
tests were 2-tailed, and P values , .05
were considered statistically signiﬁ-
cant.
RESULTS
During the study period, 172 ELBW
infantswhosurvivedtopostnatalday28
were evaluated for echocardiographic
screening. Twenty-one infants were
excluded because of congenital heart
disease or otheranomalies, and 6 were
excludedbecauseoftransfertoanother
facility (Fig 1). The remaining 145 in-
fants had an echocardiogram at 4 to 6
weeks of age. The characteristics of this
study population are shown in Table 1.
Overall,26(17.9%)werediagnosedwith
pulmonary hypertension by at least 1
echocardiogram at any time during
hospitalization: 9 (6.2%) were identiﬁed
by initial screening (early pulmonary
hypertension), and 17 (11.7%) were
identiﬁed later (late pulmonary hyper-
tension) (Fig 1). The differences in
characteristics between the infants
with and without pulmonary hyper-
tension are shown in Table 2. In brief,
infants with pulmonary hypertension
had lower birth weight but similar
gestational age, which was consistent
with the observation that more infants
with pulmonary hypertension were
identiﬁed as “small for gestational
age.” Infants with pulmonary hyper-
tension received higher concentrations
of oxygen (P , .01) and were more
frequently (P = .06) on mechanical
ventilation on postnatal day 28 (Table 2).
One of 31 infants on room air at post-
natal day 28 was diagnosed with
early pulmonary hypertension. None of
the infants on room air on day 28 were
later diagnosed with pulmonary hy-
pertension. Of 75 infants who were
receiving neither continuous positive
airway pressure nor intermittent man-
datory ventilation (IMV) on postnatal
day 28, 10 infants (13.3%) developed
pulmonary hypertension. At 36 weeks’
PMA, infants with pulmonary hyper-
tension were more likely to be on ox-
ygen supplementation or mechanical
ventilation and to be diagnosed with
moderate or severe BPD. Four of 9
infants with early pulmonary hyper-
tension and 12 of 17 infants with late
pulmonary hypertension were classi-
ﬁed as having severe BPD. Mortality
and length of stay also were increased
in infants with pulmonary hyperten-
sion (Table 2). The multivariable logis-
tic regression model identiﬁed lower
birth weight as being associated with
pulmonary hypertension after adjust-
ment for the other variables (gesta-
tional age, male gender, fraction of
inspired oxygen on day 28, and IMV on
day 28) included in the model (Table 3).

on postnatal day 28 was similar
between early and late pulmonary
hypertension groups (Table 4). No sig-
niﬁcant difference was noted between
management of early or late pulmonary
hypertension, although the limitations
of small sample size and low power
must be considered. Clinical practice
generally involvedsequentialoradditive
use of higher oxygen saturation limits
(91%–95% vs 85%–95%), inhaled
nitric oxide, sildenaﬁl, bosentan, and
epoprostenol (prostacyclin or Flolan)
(Tables 4 and 5). Eight of the 9 infants
diagnosed with early pulmonary hyper-
tension were managed with supple-
mental oxygen: 1 infant with pulse
oximeter oxygen saturation.90% on
room air did not receive any additional
therapy, and pulmonary hypertension
had resolved by the time this infant was
discharged from the hospital. Of the 26
infants with pulmonary hypertension, 3
died in the late pulmonary hyperten-
sion group because of right ventricular
failure (cor pulmonale). The median
age at pulmonary hypertension di-
agnosis was 31 days (interquartile
range: 29–41) in the early pulmonary
hypertension group and 112 days
(interquartile range: 93–122) in the
late pulmonary hypertension group
(P , .01). Fifteen infants had persis-
tence of pulmonary hypertension at
time of discharge (5 of 9 with early
pulmonary hypertension, 10 of 17 with
late pulmonary hypertension). Three of
the 5 infants with persistent pulmonary
hypertension in the early pulmonary
hypertension group and 8 of the 10
infants with persistent pulmonary hy-
pertension in the late pulmonary hy-
pertension group were discharged
from the hospital on oxygen therapy.
Ten infants also received home medi-
cation at the discretion of the treating
clinician, mainly from the late pulmo-
nary hypertension group (8 of 10). Two
of 4 infants with resolved pulmonary
hypertension in the early pulmonary
hypertension group and 2 of 4 infants
with resolved pulmonary hypertension
in the late group were discharged on
supplemental oxygen therapy for BPD.
DISCUSSION
The major ﬁndings of our study are that
18% or ∼1 in 6 extremely premature
infants develop pulmonary hyperten-
sion. Preterm infants with growth re-
strictionandhigheroxygenrequirements
at 4 weeks of age and those with se-
vere BPD were at higher risk for the
development of pulmonary hyperten-
sion. Prospective screening by echo-
cardiography at 4 to 6 weeks of age
identiﬁed only one-third of the ELBW
infants
who
developed

hypertension, because the remaining
two-thirds of infants were diagnosed
with pulmonary hypertension at ∼3 to
4 months of age.
The strengths of this study are its
prospective nature, with well-deﬁned
echocardiographic criteria and clini-
cal variables, in a reasonably large
recent cohort from atertiary care NICU.
It has been noted by other investigators
that the prevalence of pulmonary hyper-
tension complicating chronic neonatal
lung disease is unknown because it is
not routinely assessed,11 and case se-
ries and retrospective analyses may
be biased toward identiﬁcation of pul-
monary hypertension in more severe
BPD.11 Limitations of our study include
that although the initial echocardio-
gram was performed as a screening
test,
subsequent
echocardiography
was done only at the discretion of the
clinician, which may underestimate the
true incidence of pulmonary hyper-
tension because mild forms of late-
onset pulmonary hypertension may
have been missed. We also excluded 6
infants who were transferred from our
institution before 36 weeks’ PMA. Al-
though these infants did not have early
pulmonary
hypertension
on
initial
screening, it is possible they may have
had late pulmonary hypertension. In-
clusion of these 6 infants in the analy-
sis does not noticeably change the
incidence of early pulmonary hyper-
tension (from 6.2% to 6.0%). Another
limitation is that it may be difﬁcult to
extrapolate ﬁndings from a single-
center study to other neonatal inten-
sive care units, because clinical prac-
tices (eg, mechanical ventilation
management, oxygen saturation tar-
gets, and resuscitation practices of
infants at the borderline of viability)
may alter the incidence of pulmonary
hypertension. A more subtle limitation
is that although echocardiographic
estimates of systolic pulmonary artery
pressure are relatively sensitive in
identiﬁcation of pulmonary hyperten-
sion, the severity of pulmonary hyper-
tension is difﬁcult to determine, and
qualitative echocardiographic ﬁndings
may be even less accurate.14 Because
this study was observational, there
was no attempt to regulate therapeu-
tic interventions in infants diagnosed
with pulmonary hypertension, and the
sample size is too small to permit de-
termination of therapeutic effective-
ness of the different interventions.

design of a randomized controlled trial
for the management of pulmonary hy-
pertension in ELBW infants, however.
We observed that 18% of ELBW infants
developed
pulmonary
hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension persisted to
timeofdischargeinmostinfants(58%of
those with pulmonary hypertension),
andthe3infantswhodieddidsowithcor
pulmonale. The relatively high incidence
ofpulmonaryhypertensionisconcerning,
because this condition is more common
than other well-known morbidities in
this population, such as early-onset
sepsis, periventricular leukomalacia,
and necrotizing enterocolitis.1 An et al,9
in a retrospective analysis of 116 pre-
term infants with BPD, observed that
25% had pulmonary hypertension (9.5%
and 58.0% of infants with moderate and
severe BPD, respectively) at a median
postnatal age of 65 days, and that it was
improved in 76% of infants after a me-
dian of 85 days, whereas 14% of infants
died. Slaughteret al,10 in a retrospective
cohort study of 1156 ELBW infants,
identiﬁed 216 infants with BPD who re-
quired IMV, CPAP, or nasal cannula (ﬂow
.2 liters per minute (LPM)) at the
postnatal age of 28 days. Forty-one
percent of these infants were evalu-
ated with echocardiography, with 37%
having evidence of pulmonary hyper-
tension.10 Thirty-eight percent of the 29
infants with pulmonary hypertension
died, as compared with 14% of the 49
infants without pulmonary hyperten-
sion.10Khemani etal15studied42infants
with BPD and pulmonary hypertension
ata median age of 4.8 months andnoted
that 38% of these infants died during
follow-up. Multivariate analysis indi-
cated that severe pulmonary hyper-
tension and being small for gestational
age were associated with higher mor-
tality15; however, it is difﬁcult to com-
pare the results from these studies with
our results, because they deal with se-
lected populations of infants with BPD,
only some of whom were evaluated by
using echocardiography. Our results
indicate that although a substantial
number of infants who will develop pul-
monary hypertension are identiﬁed by 4
to 6 weeks of age, many infants who go
ontodeveloppulmonaryhypertensiondo
so at 3 to 4 months of age, and repeat-
ed evaluation with echocardiography
may be necessary in infants at higher
risk (higher oxygen requirement or
severe BPD). The later detection of
pulmonary hypertension in these
infants may possibly be secondary to
ongoing deterioration of lung function
and vascular remodeling associated
with intermittent or persistent episodes
of hypoxemia.16–18 It is possible that in-
tercurrent infections, such as urinary
tract infections, may exacerbate or
present as pulmonary hypertension in
such infants, but because many sick
infants in the intensive care unit have
a ﬂuctuating course, it is difﬁcult to
assign causality to changes over time
in the clinical course. Alternatively, it is
possible that infants with absence of
a tricuspid regurgitation jet may not
have had detection of elevated pulmo-
nary pressures on the initial echocar-
diogram.14 This pilot observational study
does not have the statistical power to
demonstrate that earlier detection of
pulmonary hypertension (and earlier
therapy) is associated with better out-
comes, although it must be noted that
all the infants who died were in the late
pulmonary hypertension group.

Preterm infants who were growth-
restricted at birth were at greater
risk for development of pulmonary hy-
pertension. The increased risk may be
possibly secondary to in utero inhibition
of lung development caused by nutri-
tional or placental insufﬁciency, with
a reduction in cross-sectional vascular
area, resulting in elevated pulmonary
pressures and a greater probability of
severe BPD due to pre-existing impaired
development. It must be noted that al-
mostone-fourthofourevaluated infants
were small for gestational age (SGA),
which may have inﬂuenced the preva-
lence of pulmonary hypertension. Acute
episodes of pulmonary hypertension
also have been reported in growth-
restricted preterm infants soon after
birth.19 As expected, infants with pul-
monary hypertension were more likely
to receive higher fraction of inspired
oxygen at 4 weeks of age and have se-
vere BPD at 36 weeks’ PMA. Although
these variables identiﬁed infants at
higher risk, use of these risk factors
as sole screening criteria would have
led to a missed diagnosis in several
infants.
The optimal management of premature
infants with pulmonary hypertension is
not clear. Multiple therapies, including
inhalednitricoxide,20sildenaﬁl,21,22and
endothelin blockers such as bosen-
tan22 and epoprostenol23 have been
evaluated only in retrospective studies
that indicate preliminary efﬁcacy and
possible safety for the management of
pulmonary hypertension in premature
infants with chronic lung disease. In
our center, if pulmonary hypertension
appeared to be resolved on subse-
quent echocardiograms, we attempted
to wean and discontinue the therapy
before discharge. Our study provides
data for the calculation of sample size
and design of prospective randomized
controlled trials to rigorously evalu-
ate these unproven and sometimes
expensive therapies for which the
risk-beneﬁt ratio has not yet been
determined.
CONCLUSIONS
Pulmonary hypertension is a relatively
common problem, affecting ∼1 in 6
ELBW infants, and it persists to dis-
charge in most affected infants. Rou-
tine screening of ELBW infants with
echocardiography at 4 to 6 weeks of
age identiﬁes only one-third of these
infants, so frequent follow-up evalua-
tions may be required to determine
later onset of pulmonary hyperten-
sion. Further research is required to
determine optimal detection and inter-
vention strategies (eg, higher oxygen
saturation targets, inhaled nitric oxide,
and sildenaﬁl) and timing of treatment.
The longer-term beneﬁts and risks of
medications such as sildenaﬁl and
bosentan in this population need to be
evaluated.
