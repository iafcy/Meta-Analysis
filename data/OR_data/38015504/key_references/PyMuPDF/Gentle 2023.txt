Abstract
Rationale: Extremely preterm infants with evolving
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at risk for development
of BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH). A patent
ductus arteriosus (PDA) shunt may be a modifiable risk factor for
BPD-PH development.
Objective: To determine whether the presence and duration of
ductus arteriosus patency differs between extremely preterm
infants with and without BPD-PH.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study
among preterm infants of gestational age 22 weeks, 0 days, to
28 weeks, 6 days, who remained on respiratory support on
postnatal day 28 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
from 2017 to 2020. Infants who were diagnosed with PH (cases)
by echocardiography were compared with infants without PH
(control subjects). Data from echocardiograms performed during
the hospitalization after postnatal day 28 were included. Logistic
regression adjusted for covariates that differed significantly
between groups. A probit analysis related the duration of ductal
patency to the development of BPD-PH.
Measurements and Main Results: A total of 138 infants
developed BPD alone, and 82 infants developed BPD-PH. After
adjustment for differing covariates between groups, both PDA
(adjusted odds ratio, 4.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.89–9.77)
and moderate to large PDA (adjusted odds ratio, 4.15; 95%
confidence interval, 1.78–9.64) remained significantly related to
BPD-PH at discharge. By probit analysis, each additional month
of PDA and hemodynamically significant PDA exposure was
associated with an increased probability for the composite
outcome of BPD-PH at discharge or death with coefficients of
0.40 (P , 0.001) and 0.45 (P , 0.001), respectively.
Conclusions: In extremely preterm infants on respiratory
support on postnatal day 28, both the presence of and a longer
duration of ductus arteriosus patency were associated with the
development of BPD-PH.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one
of the most common morbidities of
prematurity, occurring in 40% of infants
born at less than 28 weeks’ gestation (1).
Rather than a monomorphic disease,
multiple endotypes have been described
(2), including BPD associated with
pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH), which
occurs in 17% of infants with BPD (3).
Infants who develop BPD-PH are at higher
risk for long-term neurodevelopmental
impairment (4) and mortality (3). Given
the severity of adverse outcomes associated
with BPD-PH, identiﬁcation of speciﬁc
risk factors for BPD-PH development is
needed.
Demographic characteristics reported to
be associated with the development of BPD-
PH include lower gestational age and lower
birth weight (3). Although the presence (5)
and hemodynamic signiﬁcance (6) of a

patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) have been
associated with the development of BPD,
there is limited evidence for whether the
presence and persistence of a PDA may be
uniquely associated with the BPD-PH
phenotype (4, 7). Moreover, few of these
studies analyzed the duration of ductal
patency and risk for BPD-PH (8). Because
ductal patency varies over time, with up to
85% of PDAs closing by hospital discharge
in very low birth weight infants (9),
characterization of the duration of ductal
patency may further deﬁne the potential
association between a PDA and BPD-PH.
We conducted a retrospective, case-
control study in infants with (cases) and
without (control subjects) BPD-PH born
between 22 0/7 weeks’ and 28 6/7 weeks’
gestation on respiratory support on postnatal
day 28. We hypothesized that among infants
with evolving BPD, the presence and
duration of ductus arteriosus patency would
be associated with the development of BPD-
PH after adjusting for differences in baseline
characteristics.
Methods
Study Design
This was a retrospective case-control study
of prospectively collected data in preterm
infants born at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham between 2017 and 2020.
Institutional review board approval was
obtained before the investigation. Infants
were included if born between 22 0/7 and
28 6/7 weeks’ gestation, if they were
receiving respiratory support on postnatal
day 28, if they had at least one
echocardiogram performed after postnatal
day 28, and if they remained on respiratory
support at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age
(PMA). Infants who died before postnatal
day 28, did not have an echocardiogram
performed, or had major congenital
anomalies (including hemodynamically
signiﬁcant cardiac lesions) were excluded.
Cases were deﬁned as infants with evidence
of PH diagnosed by cardiology-reviewed
echocardiograms at any time during
hospitalization after postnatal day 28,
whereas infants with echocardiograms but
without evidence of PH were deﬁned as
control subjects.
At the University of Alabama at
Birmingham, all preterm infants receiving
respiratory support on postnatal day 28 are
assessed for PH by echocardiogram, after
which monthly echocardiographic
assessment is performed until discharge.
Infants are not systematically screened for a
PDA before this postnatal time point, with
35% of infants being pharmacologically
treated upon PDA diagnosis during the study
period. Infants both with and without BPD-
PH may receive a trial of inhaled nitric oxide
if they develop refractory hypoxemia while
receiving 100% FIO2 through invasive
ventilation.
Covariate Definitions
Demographic and birth characteristics
compared between cases and control subjects
included gestational age, birth weight, small
for gestational age, race, sex, preterm
premature rupture of membranes (.24 h
before delivery), and histologic
chorioamnionitis by placental pathology.
Small for gestational age was deﬁned as birth
weight below the 10th percentile for
gestational age (10). Clinical exposures
compared between cases and control subjects
included respiratory support (at postnatal
day 28 and 36 weeks’ PMA) and
pharmacologic exposures (corticosteroids for
BPD and inhaled nitric oxide). Morbidities
of comparison included BPD at 36 weeks’
PMA using Jensen criteria (11), grades 3 to 4
intracranial hemorrhage (12), and
necrotizing enterocolitis stage >2 using
modiﬁed Bell’s criteria (13, 14).
For characterization of PDAs that
persisted beyond 28 days, all
echocardiograms performed on or after
postnatal day 28 were included for the
analysis. Echocardiographic diagnoses
(e.g., PDA) derived from echocardiograms
performed before postnatal day 28 were not
included. A PDA was further characterized
as moderate to large if the ductal diameter
was >1.5 mm with any of the following:
At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: Few studies have
systematically detailed the
association between the presence and
duration of ductus arteriosus patency
and the development of pulmonary
hypertension in preterm infants.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: In this case-control study, we
report that the presence of a patent
ductus arteriosus may be one of the
strongest risk factors for pulmonary
hypertension development.
Figure 1. Timing of echocardiographic bronchopulmonary dysplasia–associated pulmonary
hypertension (BPD-PH) diagnosis and subsequent disease trajectory for included patients.
Infants were stratified into the following dynamic groups: 1) new diagnosis of BPD-PH
(postmenstrual age [PMA] at which BPD-PH was first diagnosed), 2) resolved BPD-PH
(previously present on prior echocardiogram without evidence at indicated PMA), 3) persistent
BPD-PH (noted on a previous and indicated PMA echocardiogram), and 4) no BPD-PH (with
no evidence at indicated PMA echocardiogram and either any prior echocardiogram or, in
infants with previous evidence of BPD-PH, the echocardiogram is subsequent to a prior study
indicating BPD-PH resolution). The median postnatal age at BPD-PH diagnosis in cases was
38 weeks’ PMA (interquartile range, 33–41). Infants with BPD with and without PH had a similar
number of echocardiograms performed between PMAs of 28 and 40 weeks.

1) ductal systolic ﬂow velocity <2.8 m/s,
2) reverse diastolic ﬂow in the descending
aorta, or 3) ratio of left atrium to aortic root
>1.6. The time of ductal closure was deﬁned
as the postnatal age at which ductal patency
was last identiﬁed by echocardiogram.
Outcome Definitions
Infants were diagnosed with BPD-PH if any
of the following echocardiographic ﬁndings
(15) were present: 1) elevated right
ventricular pressures as estimated by
tricuspid jet velocity measurement (with
right ventricular systolic pressure estimate
of >35 mm Hg), 2) bidirectional ﬂow
through the patent foramen ovale or PDA, or
3) interventricular septum ﬂattening based
on end-systolic eccentricity index .1.0.
An additional exploratory analysis was
performed in infants with BPD-PH to
further deﬁne the longitudinal relationship
between a PDA and BPD-PH persistence
and resolution. Infants with BPD-PH were
stratiﬁed into infants with resolution of BPD-
PH, infants with persistence of BPD-PH, and
infants who died. Infants were characterized
as having resolved or persistent BPD-PH
based on the presence or absence of PH on
the last echocardiogram performed during
the hospitalization.
Statistical Analysis
To determine an adequate sample size, we
used a two-sided conﬁdence interval (CI) of
95%, 80% power, an expected ratio of control
subjects to cases of 2:1, and preliminary
estimates for the rates of PDA within control
subjects (20%) and cases (40%). Using these
calculations, we estimated that 58 infants
with BPD-PH and 115 infants with BPD
would be needed for this analysis.
For comparisons of PDAs that persisted
beyond 28 days between cases and control
subjects, the following three classiﬁcations
were used: 1) PDA as a binary outcome,
2) moderate or large PDA as a binary
outcome, and 3) the PMA in weeks at which
a PDA was last identiﬁed. To further examine
the relationship between the duration of PDA
exposure and BPD-PH development, parallel
analyses were performed by PDA status,
PDA hemodynamic signiﬁcance, and strata
of PDA exposure days for the outcomes of
BPD-PH at 28 postnatal days, subsequent
BPD-PH development, persistent BPD-PH at
discharge, and death.
A probit regression was conducted to
calculate the probability for persistent BPD-
PH or death using months of 1) any or
2) hemodynamically signiﬁcant ductus
arteriosus patency exposure as the dose
variable. This regression was performed to
identify whether an increase in the number
of months of PDA exposure (the predictor
variable) was associated with a higher
probability of BPD-PH development or
death. However, to assess for nonlinear
associations between categorical ranges of
PDA exposure and BPD-PH–related
outcomes, additional analyses by
logistic regression were employed as next
described.
Additional bivariate analyses were
conducted comparing baseline demographic
and clinical characteristics between cases and
control subjects. After tests of normality,
continuous data were analyzed using a t test
or Mann-Whitney test. A chi-square test was
used for categorical variables. The Box-
Tidwell procedure was used to determine the
linearity of continuous covariates from
which the appropriate regression model was
selected. In considering the most appropriate
regression model, separate logistic regression
models were employed for the outcomes of
1) BPD-PH at discharge, 2) BPD-PH at
discharge or death, and 3) prespeciﬁed strata
of PDA exposure duration (,4 wk, 4–7 wk,
8–11 wk, and >12 wk). Models incorporated
both categorical and continuous
demographic characteristics that differed
between cases and control subjects (P, 0.10)
after calculation of bivariate correlation and
variance inﬂation factor testing for
multicollinearity.

Results were summarized using odds
ratios, 95% CIs, and P values deﬁning
signiﬁcance as ,0.05. Analyses were
conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 26 for
Windows, GraphPad Prism, and MedCalc.
Given the collinearity between
demographic characteristics and both
spontaneous ductal closure and PH,
a mediation analysis was performed between
a PDA and BPD-PH using birth weight as
the mediator variable. This assessed whether
the association between PDA persistence
beyond 28 days and BPD-PH resulted from
indirect effects between a PDA and birth
weight or birth weight and BPD-PH.
Results
Of the 398 infants born during the inclusion
period, 82 infants met case criteria for BPD-
PH, 138 infants met control criteria for BPD
alone, and 178 infants did not develop BPD.
A total of 463 echocardiograms from cases
were reviewed (median of 5 echocardiograms
per patient) and 461 echocardiograms from
control subjects were reviewed (median of 3
echocardiograms per patient). The median
postnatal age at BPD-PH diagnosis in cases
was 38 weeks’ PMA (interquartile range,
33–41), with the distribution of postnatal age
at BPD-PH diagnosis, resolution, and
persistence further depicted in Figure 1.
The median intervals between patients’
echocardiograms in infants with BPD and
BPD-PH were 30 and 29 days, respectively.
The mean gestational age differed
between cases (256 2) and control subjects
(266 2; P, 0.001), and cases were born
at a lower birth weight (6556 169 g vs.
8066 209 g; P, 0.001) (Table 1). Regarding
clinical exposures, cases were more
frequently exposed to invasive ventilation
(59% vs. 30%) and had a higher FIO2 (0.59 vs.
0.44) on postnatal day 28. More cases had a
PDA (44% vs. 21%) and a moderate to large
PDA (39% vs. 14%). The PDA was more
frequently treated with pharmacotherapy in
cases than in control subjects (24% vs. 14%)
(Table 1).
For analyses by PDA status, the
presence of a PDA persistent beyond 28
postnatal days was associated with a higher
frequency of subsequent BPD-PH
development (49% vs. 28%; P= 0.003),
persistence of BPD-PH at discharge (34% vs.
14%; P, 0.001), and death or BPD-PH at
discharge (39% vs. 17%; P, 0.001)
compared with infants without a PDA.

Similarly, a hemodynamically signiﬁcant
PDA was associated with persistence of
BPD-PH at discharge (37% vs. 14%;
P, 0.001) and death or BPD-PH at
discharge (41% vs. 18%; P, 0.001)
compared with infants without a
hemodynamically signiﬁcant PDA. There
was an associated increase in BPD-PH at
discharge and death in infants with BPD-PH
with longer durations of PDA or
hemodynamically signiﬁcant PDA exposures
(Table 2).
Tests for multicollinearity in covariates
differing between cases and control subjects
were nonsigniﬁcant, for which all variates
were retained. Logistic regression models
adjusted for birth weight, gestational age,
White race, male sex, FIO2, and invasive
ventilation on postnatal day 28 between cases
and control subjects (Table 3). Invasive
ventilation and FIO2 exposure on postnatal
day 28 were included to discriminate
whether the presence of a persistent PDA
reﬂected pulmonary disease independent of
PH status. The following covariates remained
signiﬁcantly associated with the BPD-PH at
discharge: PDA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],
4.29; 95% CI, 1.89–9.77), a moderate to large
PDA (aOR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.78–9.64), birth
weight (aOR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59–0.95), and
FIO2 at postnatal day 28 (aOR, 1.29; 95% CI,
1.07–1.55). The same covariates were
signiﬁcant for the outcome of BPD-PH at
discharge or death. Regression analyses by
PDA exposure duration were most
signiﬁcant for exposure >12 weeks for both
PDA and moderate to large PDA duration
(Table 3). Covariate coefﬁcients for
regression models for moderate to large PDA
and strata of PDA exposure duration can be
found in Tables E1–E3 in the online
supplement.
By probit analysis, the duration of PDA
and hemodynamically signiﬁcant PDA
exposure increased the probability of BPD-
PH at discharge or death with coefﬁcients of
0.40 (P, 0.001) and 0.45 (P, 0.001),
respectively (Figure 2). As coefﬁcients were
positive, this translates to each additional
month of PDA exposure increases the
probability of BPD-PH at discharge or death;
however, this does not provide a magnitude
of effect, given the nonlinearity of probit
analysis (e.g., the change in predicted
probability of BPD-PH at discharge or death
is not constant between months of PDA
exposure).
In characterizing the trajectory of BPD-
PH in cases, BPD-PH resolved in 39 infants
(48%) and persisted in 43 infants (52%), of
whom 19 (23%) infants died. Among infants
with BPD-PH, those with a moderate to large
PDA that persisted beyond 28 days were
more likely to die (12 of 32; 38%) than those
without a moderate to large PDA (7 of 46;
15%; P=0.01) (Table 2).
For the mediation analysis, indirect
effects were assessed between a PDA and
birth weight and between birth weight and

BPD-PH with correlation coefﬁcients of 232
and 20.004, respectively, which were not
signiﬁcant (b, 0.14; 95% CI, 20.12 to 0.44),
because the CI was inclusive of zero. This
indicates that the association between a PDA
and BPD-PH is not, in part, the result of the
mediating variable of birth weight.
Conversely, the direct effect of PDA
exposure on BPD-PH, excluding the
mediator variable of birth weight, was
signiﬁcant (b, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.47–1.76).
Discussion
In this case-control study of infants born
between 22 0/7 and 28 6/7 weeks’ gestation
with an echocardiogram performed after
postnatal day 28, infants with BPD-PH
(cases) more frequently had a PDA that
persisted beyond 28 days than did infants
with BPD alone (control subjects). The
association between both a persistent PDA
and a persistent moderate to large PDA and
BPD-PH remained signiﬁcant after
adjustment for baseline characteristics by
logistic regression. We also determined that
the duration of PDA persistence was
associated with BPD-PH. In further analyses
stratifying cases to infants with resolution,
persistence, or death associated with BPD-
PH, a PDA was associated with both
persistence of BPD-PH and death.
Several identiﬁed baseline
characteristics that differed between cases
and control subjects in the present study
have been reported previously. Compared
with control subjects, cases were more likely
to be born at a lower birth weight and
gestational age. In our previous cohort study
of extremely low birth weight infants in
which an echocardiogram was performed to
screen for BPD-PH, infants with BPD-PH
were born at a lower birth weight (P, 0.001)
and small for gestational age (P, 0.01)
compared with infants without BPD-PH
(16). Other cohort studies have reported that
infants with BPD-PH are more frequently
born small for gestational age (15) and/or are
born at a lower birth weight (8, 17, 18). In
contrast, few studies (19) have reported
female sex more commonly in infants with
BPD-PH; most cohort studies have reported
similar rates of BPD-PH by sex (8, 16, 17).
Previous investigators have reported an
association between a PDA and BPD-PH.
A systematic review and meta-analysis
identiﬁed PDA as a characteristic associated
with an increased risk ratio of BPD-PH of
1.2 (95% CI, 1.0–1.5) in infants with BPD (3).
However, there was signiﬁcant variation
regarding the association between a PDA
and BPD-PH in those studies that were
included. Mourani and colleagues (8)
prospectively screened preterm infants
(n= 277) born between 500 and 1,250 g for
the presence of PH, of whom 39 infants
(14%) had BPD-PH at 36 weeks’ PMA.
Comparing infants with and without BPD-
PH, a PDA was identiﬁed on postnatal day 7
in 47% of infants who developed BPD-PH
and in 40% of infants who did not develop
BPD-PH (P=0.41). A PDA at this postnatal
time point was not associated with BPD-PH
at 36 weeks’ PMA. A single-center study of
116 preterm infants with BPD reported a
higher prevalence of surgical PDA closure in
infants with BPD-PH (48% vs. 27%;
P=0.025) (20). In the present study,
compared with infants with BPD alone,
preterm infants who developed BPD-PH had
a higher rate of a PDA that persisted beyond
28 days (43% vs. 22%) and a higher rate of a
persistent moderate to large PDA (29% vs.
11%). Moreover, infants with longer
durations of ductus arteriosus patency were
more likely to have a persistent BPD-PH and
BPD-PH–associated mortality.
The duration of ductus arteriosus
patency and risk for BPD alone has also been
reported in preterm infants, which remains
relevant to the present analysis because
BPD-PH is a common endotype in infants
with moderate to severe BPD (3). In a study
of infants born at ,28 weeks’ gestation that
stratiﬁed PDA exposure to ,7 days, 7 to
13 days, and >14 days, infants with a
moderate to large PDA for 7 to 13 days had
an increased odds ratio for BPD or death
compared with infants with a PDA for
,7 days; however, exposure for >14 days

was not associated with worse outcomes (21).
Another study of preterm infants born at
,29 weeks’ gestation stratiﬁed infants’
exposure by ,1 week, 1–2 weeks, and .2
weeks and by logistic regression reported an
association between a PDA duration and
death or BPD (aOR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.03–1.82)
(22). Because other postnatal exposures may
further compound infants’ BPD risk,
additional data from this investigatory group
have identiﬁed prolonged invasive
ventilation .10 days as a critical coexposure
to prolonged PDA exposure that may
mediate infants’ risk for BPD (23, 24). In the
present study, the duration of PDA exposure
was associated with BPD-PH after
adjustment for baseline characteristics,
suggesting that prolonged PDA exposure
may be speciﬁcally associated with the
BPD-PH phenotype.
In a recent investigation of 28 infants
with BPD-PH characterizing survival and
resolution, Arjaans and colleagues reported
that suprasystemic pulmonary artery
pressures were associated with death. The
proportion of infants with a PDA did not
differ between infants who died (10 of 11;
91%) and survived 11 of 17 (73%; P=0.36)
(25); however, the postnatal age at diagnosis
was not reported. In an observational
investigation of the clinical impact between
early and late PDA closure, infants with late
closure were more likely to develop BPD-PH
(52% vs. 0%) with a later median procedural
age at closure (84 vs. 32 d; P, 0.001) (26). In
the present study, infants with BPD-PH at
discharge or death more frequently had a
PDA that persisted beyond 28 days after
adjusting for baseline differences. Moreover,
the risk of BPD-PH at discharge or death was
higher among infants exposed to a PDA for
>12 weeks, but not among those with
shorter durations of exposure. Probit
regression modeling further substantiated
the association between longer durations of
PDA exposure and risk for BPD-PH.
Therefore, longitudinal monitoring of ductal
patency may provide an additional and
potentially earlier marker for BPD-PH
persistence and death.
The primary limitation of this study is
that conclusions are limited to
associations. It is unknown whether latent
patency of a ductus arteriosus in infants
with BPD-PH contributes to disease
severity whereby ductal ligation would
mitigate BPD-PH persistence, severity, or
death. The presence and persistence of a
PDA may only implicate underlying BPD-
PH with ductal patency maintained by
elevated right ventricular pressures. The
therapeutic utility of early PDA closure has
not been shown to reduce BPD after early
prophylactic treatment (27) or selective use
in infants with a hemodynamically
signiﬁcant PDA (28). However, a
conservative approach to a PDA persistent
beyond 28 postnatal days may increase
risk for the development of BPD-PH
based on the present study ﬁndings.
In addition, the months’ duration between
echocardiograms limited the precision
to which duration of PDA exposure
could be associated with BPD-PH
development.
In this case-control investigation of
extremely preterm infants, the presence of a
PDA beyond 28 postnatal days was
associated with BPD-PH but also with the
persistence of BPD-PH and death in infants
with BPD-PH. Longitudinal monitoring of a
PDA may provide an additional
echocardiographic marker for BPD-PH
development. Because these inferences are
limited to association, further study of PDA
closure in infants at .28 postnatal days’ age
would be needed to determine whether a
reduction in PDA exposure may prevent
both BPD-PH and death in infants with
established BPD-PH. 
