Abstract
Background: Approximately 8–23%of premature infants develop pulmonary hypertension(PH), and this diagnosis
confers a higher possibility of mortality. As a result, professional societies recommend PHscreening inpremature
infants. However, the risk factors for and the outcomes of PHmay differ dependingon thetimingof itsdiagnosis,
and little evidence is available to determine at-risk infants in thereferral neonatal population. The objective ofthis
study was to define clinical and echocardiographic characteristics ofinfants withpulmonaryhypertension during
theneonatalhospital course and ator near-term.
Methods: Infants who had the following billing codes:< 32 weeks, birth weight < 1500 g, neonatal unit, and
echocardiograph had records abstracted from a data warehouse atChildren’sHealthcare of Atlanta. The outcome
was defined as late PHon the final echocardiogram for all patients, and, separately, for patients with multiple
studies. Descriptive statistics, univariable, and multivariable models were evaluated, and odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals are expressed below as (OR, CI).
Results: 556infants were included in theoverallstudy, 59 had PH ontheirfinal echocardiogram (11%). In
multivariable analyses, atrial septal defect (2.9,1.4–6.1), and intrauterine growth restriction (2.7,1.2–6.3) increased
theodds oflate PH, whereas caffeine therapy decreased PH (0.4, 0.2–0.8). When the analyses were restrictedto 32
infants who had multiple echocardiograms during theirhospitalization, theassociation between atrial septaldefect
(5.9, 2.0–16.5) and growth restriction (3.7, 1.3–10.7) and late PH was strengthened, but the effect of caffeine therapy
was nolonger significant. In this smaller subgroup, infants with late PHhad their final echocardiogram ata median
of116 days of life, and 42–74% of them had right ventricular pathology.
Conclusions: Early clinical variables are associated with PHpersistence in areferral neonatal population.
Identification of early clinical factors mayhelpguide theascertainmentof infant risk for late PH, and may aid in
targeting sub-groups that are most likely to benefit from PHscreening.
