to determine the utility of serial N-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NTproBNP) levels in the screening of BPD
associated PH (BPD-PH) in preterm infants.
Study design Infants with birth weight <1500g and <30 week corrected gestational age (CGA) were followed with serial
NTproBNP levels and echocardiograms (ECHO). They were divided into control, BPD and BPD-PH groups. Statistical
analyses included repeated measures analysis of variance and receiver operator curve (ROC) generation.
Results Infants in the BPD-PH and BPD group had significantly elevated NTproBNP levels as compared to the control
group. ROC curves for NTproBNP at 28 weeks CGA provided a cut-point of 2329pg/ml and 578.1pg/ml for detection of
BPD-PH and BPD, respectively.
