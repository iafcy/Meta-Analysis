OBJECTIVE:Determineprevalence and associations with pulmonary hypertension(PH) inpreterm infants.
STUDY DESIGN:Prospective institutional echocardiographic PH screening at36to 38weeks’corrected gestational age(GA)for

RESULTS:Twohundredandfourinfantswerescreened(GA25.9±2weeks,BW831±286g).ThePHprevalenceingroupBPDwas
higherthan ingroupNoBPD (44/159(28%)vs 5/45(11%); P=0.028). IngroupBPD, BW andGA werelowerininfants with PH
