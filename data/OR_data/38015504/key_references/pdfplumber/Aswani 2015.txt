Abstract Background: Many extremely low birth weight infants develop pulmonary hypertension late in their
clinical course, and over 60% go undetected by early screening echocardiography. At present, no standardised
screening protocol exists for detecting late pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants. We
assessed the utility of oxygen supplementation as a predictor of late pulmonary hypertension. Methods: A retro-

Although the sensitivity of 63% and specificity of
69% are modest numbers, this test is useful in iden-
tifying a sub-group of infants who would be at high
risk of developing pulmonary hypertension later on
during their hospital course. This readily available
and cost-effective tool has better clinical utility than
previously tested screening tools of monthly echo-
