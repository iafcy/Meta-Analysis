Abstract
Background: Although bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-associated pulmonary
hypertension (PH) is a well-known complication of prematurity, the additional impact of left-
T
to-right interatrial shunt on this condition remains poorly understood. The aim of the present
P
I
study was to identify the significance of atrial left-to-right shunt lesions in PH infants with
R
moderate or severe BPD.
C
Materials and Methods: The medical records of 383 preterm infants (<32 weeks’ gestational
S
age) diagnosed with BPD between 2005 and 2013 were retrospUectively reviewed. Baseline
characteristics, including interatrial shunts and outcomes, Nwere compared between the infants
who developed PH (n = 50) and those who did not (n A= 144). Infants with hemodynamically
M
significant residual PDAs were excluded. Among the infants diagnosed with PH (n = 50), the
outcomes were compared between the subjec ts with (n = 21) and without atrial shunts (n =
D
29) at 36 weeks’ corrected postmenstrual age (PMA).
E
Results: Fifty infants (15%) of the preterm infants with BPD were diagnosed with PH. The
T
number of infants with a history of atrial shunt lesions was significantly higher in the PH
P
group compared to the nonE-PH group (42% vs. 15.3%, respectively). The adjusted odds ratio
C
for PH in the atrial shunt group was 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 8.0) compared to
C
PH-BPD infants without atrial shunt.
A
Conclusion: The presence of an atrial left-to-right shunt was associated with PH in preterm
infants with moderate or severe BPD. Close follow-up is needed for infants with interatrial
shunts, and more tailored prognostic evaluation and treatment are recommended.

1. Introduction
Despite advances in critical care management, chronic pulmonary morbidity is a common
T
adverse outcome in preterm neonates, particularly in preterm infants who develop
P
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).1 Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a major cause of late
I
R
mortality in preterm infants with BPD.2 Previous retrospective studies have reported PH-
C
associated mortality rates ranging between 14 and 38% in preterm infants with BPD. The
S
only currently published prospective study has reported a prevalence of 18% and a mortality
U
rate of 11.5% for extremely low-birth-weight infants. Survivors are at an increased risk of
N
long-term morbidity, including long hospitalization durations and oxygen therapy.3-5
A
The pathogenesis of PH in infants with BPD is multifactorial, and infants with BPD may
M
develop PH due to early damage to pulmonary angiogenesis, which could be exacerbated by
inflammation,6 lung and airway injuries,7 cD ardiac shunts, diastolic cardiac dysfunction and
pulmonary vein stenosis.8 The previouE s studies have reported that infants with PH frequently
T
had a history of minor cardiac anomalies, and it was suggested that infants with chronic lung
P
disease (CLD) and shunt lesions might be at an increased risk for PH.9,10 It was suggested
E
that even minor increases in left-to-right shunting of the blood through atrial defects might
C
induce a significant hemodynamic injury and aggravate PH because of the reduced vascular
C
surface area in the lungs of infants with BPD.11 However, the exact significance of this minor
A
cardiac anomaly is unknown.12
The present study was conducted to investigate the clinical impact of atrial left-to-right
shunts on PH prevalence in preterm infants with severe or moderate BPD.

1.1. Patients and definitions R
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of preterm infants whCo were born at <32
weeks’ gestational age and admitted to the neonatal intensive careS unit (NICU) at Seoul
U
National University Children’s Hospital between January 2005 and March 2013. Overall, 383
N
preterm infants were diagnosed with BPD during the study period. Infants with major
A
congenital heart diseases (except for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), patent foramen ovale,
M
and atrial septal defect (ASD)), chromosomal abnormalities, congenital diaphragmatic hernia,
and persistent pulmonary hypertension werDe excluded. Infants who were transferred to our
hospital after 36 weeks’ corrected postEmenstrual age (PMA) or who died before 36 weeks’
T
PMA were also excluded (n=49).
P
The clinical data collected included birth weight, gestational age, prenatal steroids
E
(administration of any dose of corticosteroids during the concurrent pregnancy), histological
C
chorioamnionitis (based on the pathological findings from the microscopic examination of
C
the placenta), PDA and its treatment, BPD and its grade, and culture proven-sepsis. PDA

ventilation (PPV). Mild BPD was defined as breathing room air; moderate BPD was defined
as FiO2 < 0.30, and severe BPD was defined as FiO2 ≥ 0.30 or PPV at 36 weeks’ PMA.
Serial echocardiographic data for all preterm infants with moderate to severe BPD were
reviewed, including evaluations with 2-dimensional, M-mode, and color-coded Doppler by a
T
pediatric cardiologist at Seoul National University Children’s Hospital. Infants were
P
I
diagnosed with PH if an echocardiogram performed when they were older than 2 months of
R
age demonstrated elevated pulmonary artery pressure based on the presence of at least one of
C
the following criteria: 1) velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) ≥ 3 m/s in the absence
S
of pulmonary stenosis or 2) flat or left-deviated interventriculaUr septal configuration and right
ventricular hypertrophy with chamber dilation.13,14 Data oNn the infants’ interatrial shunts at 36
weeks’ PMA were collected and followed-up using ecAhocardiography. We recorded the final
M
diagnoses of the atrial shunts (ASD or PFO), which were still open at the corrected postnatal
age of 2 months.15

Pulmonary hypertension with moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia
A
Among the 334 infants with BPD, 50 infants (15%) were diagnosed with PH. PH was
M
diagnosed in 54% (45/83) of the infants with severe BPD, 4% (5/111) of the infants with
D
moderate BPD, and 0% (0/140) of the infants with mild BPD. Except for the infants with
E
mild BPD, the clinical characteristics and outcomes for the infants with (n = 50) and without
T
PH (n = 144) are presented in Table 1. According to the PH diagnostic criteria, systolic PAP
P
could be estimated in 64% of infants (n = 32) by measurable TR. The median measurable TR
E
in PH infants was 3.4 m/sec (range, 3.0-4.2 m/sec). We used the modified Bernoulli equation
C
to convert Doppler-derived velocity to pressure (pressure gradient between the right ventricle
C
and right atrium = 4 x [TR max2]) (median, 46.2 mm Hg; range, 36.0-70.6 mm Hg). For the
A
other 36% of the infants (n = 18) with PH, qualitative echocardiographic measures of PH in
the absence of measureable TR, such as septal flattening, right atrial enlargement, right
ventricular hypertrophy, and right ventricular dilatation, were used as diagnostic tools. Only 2
infants in the PH group and 1 infant in the non-PH group had small residual PDAs at 36

weeks’ PMA; however, these small residual PDAs were hemodynamically insignificant and
were immediately closed before discharge.
The infants with PH spent more days on a mechanical ventilator (p < 0.001), including high
frequency ventilators (HFV), but fewer days on nasal continuous positive airway pressure
T
(nCPAP) (p < 0.001) compared to infants in the non-PH group. Three infants in the PH group
P
I
died during hospitalization, but there were no deaths in the non-PH group (p = 0.016). The
R
causes of death for the three infants were respiratory failure despite mechanical ventilation
C
and a high fraction of O2. The median duration of hospitalization was longer in the PH group
S
compared to the non-PH group (p = 0.04). The majority of infaUnts in the PH group required
prolonged oxygen therapy at discharge compared with theN non-PH group (80% vs. 35.4%,
respectively) (p < 0.001). A

Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the risk factors for PH. The results after

the significant risk factors for PH were proven sepsis (adjusted OR 3.5; 95% CI, 1.7-7.2; p =

Comparison of PH-BPD iEnfants with and without atrial left-to-right shunt

We obtained a median 968 days (range, 64-2,875 days) of follow-up data after the diagnosis

of PH. The median postnatal age at the initial diagnosis of PH was 87.5 days (range, 7-882
A
days) in the PH group. The median age at the PH diagnosis in the atrial shunt group was
significantly earlier than that in the non-atrial shunt group (62 days vs. 103 days, p = 0.004).
Major morbidities and outcomes were compared between infants with (n = 21) and without
atrial shunts (n = 29) (Table 3). The hospitalization duration (p = 1.000), O2 therapy (p =
0.567), mechanical ventilation (p = 0.589) and nCPAP (p = 0.252) did not differ significantly

between the two groups. However, the mortality rate of the PH-BPD infants with atrial shunts
was significantly higher than that of the PH-BPD infants without atrial shunts (14.3% vs. 0%,
respectively, p = 0.026). During the follow-up period, 4 infants in the atrial shunt group died,
including 3 infants who died during hospitalization and 1 infant who died suddenly at home
T
two days after being discharged without any improvement in PH.
P

In our hospital, management for PH in BPD infants includes inhaled NO, sildenafil,
R
bosentan, and inhaled iloprost. Eighteen infants (85.7%) in the atrial shunt group received at
C
least one of these pulmonary vasodilator therapies during the follow-up period, while only 17
S
infants (58.6%) in the non-atrial shunt group received these thUerapies (p = 0.038). Sildenafil
was administered most often. In each group, the followingN drugs were administered: atrial
shunt group, inhaled NO, 7 (33.3%), sildenafil, 17 (81A.0%), bosentan, 3 (14.2%), and iloprost
M
6 (28.6%); in the non-atrial shunt group, inhaled NO, 9 (31.0%), sildenafil, 16 (55.2%),
bosentan, 1 (3.4%), and iloprost 1 (3.4%). Se venty-four percent of infants in the atrial shunt
D
group and 90% of infants in the non-atrial shunt group ceased oxygen supplementation 1 year
E
after the initial diagnosis of PH; however, these data were not statistically significant (p =

0.327).

Among the PH-BPD infanEts with interatrial shunts, 62% (n = 13) were finally diagnosed
C
with ASDs and 24% (n = 5) with PFOs after a corrected postnatal age of 2 months. At the

final follow-up assessment, 67% of these defects (n = 14) had spontaneously closed, and 14%

Discussion
To our knowledge, this report is the first to directly investigate the association between
atrial left-to-right shunts and PH in premature infants with BPD. Mourani et al.9 reviewed the
T
medical charts of the children diagnosed with CLD and who underwent cardiac
P
I
catheterization for PH evaluation. Specifically, the authors reported that 68% of the patients
R
had a history of shunt lesions, primarily atrial shunts, which were detected in 58% of this
C
subgroup of patients. The authors also noted the impact of left-to-right shunt lesions in
S
children with CLD and suggested early treatment consideratioUns for pulmonary
overcirculation. The incidence of atrial left-to-right shunt Nwas 42% at 36 weeks’ PMA among
the BPD-PH infants in our institution; and 67% of theAse defects were found to have
M
spontaneously closed by the last follow-up. A total of 3 infants with left-to-right shunts
through moderate-sized ASD underwent prim ary closure operations, with positive results.
D
The sizes of each ASD at 36 weeks’ PMA were 4 mm, 4.67 mm, and 5.5 mm, respectively.
E
These infants showed improved respiratory functions after the shunts were closed; however,
T
severe PH persisted, despite the administration of PH-specific drugs. We demonstrated that
P
the presence of a left-right Eshunt flow over the atrial septum in moderate or severe BPD
C
infants was associated with development of PH compared to infants without atrial shunt.
C
In general, patients with large and complex defects are at the greatest risk for PH compared
A
to pre-tricuspid shunt patients (i.e., ASD), who generally never develop PH.16,17 Atrial left-to-
right shunts are frequently detected during routine cardiac screening in BPD infants in
neonatal intensive care units,15 and the high rate of spontaneous closure or decrease in the
size of the atrial defect in the first months of life is frequently observed.18 For this reason, it is
unusual to require closure of an ASD in infants without associated lung disease.19 However,
9
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
poorer lung compliance in premature infants could prevent or delay closure of the interatrial
septum due to greater phasic respiratory changes in intrathoracic, left atrial and right atrial
pressures.20 If there are persistent left-to-right cardiac shunts in BPD lungs, small shunts can
have a greater impact on pulmonary blood flow and aggravate PH because the lungs have an
T
overall reduction in alveolar-capillary surface area with vascular remodeling.10,12 Moreover,
P
I
PH might be exaggerated by vascular abnormalities, such as pulmonary vein stenosis, which
R
often occur in association with left-to-right cardiac shunts.21,22 Based on the findings from our
C
study and previously published reports describing success in closing ASD in patients with
S
CLD,22-25 we suggest that early management, including closurUe of the ASDs, should be
considered as an optional treatment in infants with moderaNte or large atrial shunt lesions who
are unresponsive to traditional PH therapies. Close folAlow-up is needed to evaluate the
M
severity of PH by echocardiography, and diuretics, which reduce pulmonary overflow, can be
considered to relieve acute respiratory sympt oms. The addition of biomarkers, such as brain
D
natriuretic peptide levels, would also be useful for serial follow-ups. Cardiac catheterization
E
is needed for infants with a history of atrial left-to-right shunts and persistent signs of severe
T
cardiorespiratory disease, and it is important to select infants with BPD who would benefit
P
from closing the left-to-rigEht shunts.26 Early assessment and intervention of anatomic cardiac
lesion can decrease
theC
incidence of adverse outcomes, including heart failure.
C
In the current study, culture proven sepsis was a specific risk factor for PH in preterm
A
infants with moderate or severe BPD. Forty-six percent of preterm infants with PH had a
history of proven sepsis, which was significantly greater than the number of infants with
moderate or severe BPD without PH. This result closely aligns with those of earlier studies
that reported that infectious respiratory illnesses were triggers for PH, particularly if the
infant was oxygen-dependent.13,27

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Our study is limited by its retrospective design. The time of diagnosis may not be accurate
because the evaluation interval was determined based on the infant’s condition.
Echocardiography is not the gold standard for assessing pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).
The assessment of atrial shunt was a quantitative one, and we did not have data on the quality
T
of the shunt lesions to assess the patient-specific hemodynamics of each defect.
P
I
Echocardiography alone could not accurately determine the hemodynamic impact of small
R
atrial defects. Although a significant difference was noted between the mortality rates of PH-
C
BPD infants with and without atrial left-to-right shunt, careful interpretation of the data was
S
required because of our small sample size to assess this outcomUe; thus, additional larger
studies are needed. N
In conclusion, this study confirms that preterm infaAnts with PH-BPD have higher rates of
M
death and serious morbidities compared to infants without PH. We found that preterm infants
with a history of atrial left-to-right shunts at 36 weeks’ PMA had an increased likelihood of
D
developing PH compared to infants without any cardiac shunts. Given the high incidence of
E
small atrial left-to-right shunts in preterm infants, we propose a more tailored prognostic
T
evaluation of and diagnostic intervention for BPD infants with cardiac shunt lesions.
P
Additional prospective studEies of the impact of cardiac shunt lesions in infants with BPD are
C
needed to determine the risk factors for PH development in preterm infants with BPD.
