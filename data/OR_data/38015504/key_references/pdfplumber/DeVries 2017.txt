hypertension

OBJECTIVE:To assess whether mortality inpatients withevolvingbronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, definedas⩾28daysof
oxygenexposure with lungdisease) isindependentlyassociated withpulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)and surgery.
STUDYDESIGN:Singleinstitutionretrospectivebirthcohortofpreterminfantswithgestationalage(GA)230/7to366/7weeks,and
evolvingBPDdeliveredbetween 2001and 2014.Surgerywas classified asminorormajor using publishedcriteria. Mortality was
analyzedby stepwiselogistic regression analysis.
RESULTS:Among577patientswithevolvingBPD,33(6%)diedpriortodischarge.MortalitydecreasedwithGA(adjustedoddsratio
(aOR):0.69;95%confidenceinterval(CI):0.55,0.87),birthweightZ-score(aOR:0.69,95%CI:0.47,0.996)andincreasedwithPAH
(aOR:30, 95%CI: 2.1, 415),major surgery (aOR; 2.8,95% CI: 1.3,6.3), andPAH andsurgery (aOR: 10.3,95% CI:2.5, 42.1).
CONCLUSION:Amongpreterm patients with evolvingBPD,PAHand surgery areindependently associated withmortality.
