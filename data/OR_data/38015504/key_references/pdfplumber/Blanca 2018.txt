Abstract
Premature birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are risk factors for the development of echocardiographic signs of
pulmonary hypertension (PH) and are associated with changes in cardiac structure and function. It is unclear whether this
association persists beyond early infancy. The aims of this study are to prospectively investigate the prevalence of PH in children
with severe BPD and to investigate the effect of BPD and PH on myocardial structure and function at six months corrected age.
Preterm infants (gestational age(cid:2)32 weeks) with severe BPD were included. Echocardiography was used to define PH and to
measurespeckletrackingderivedlongitudinalandcircumferentialstrainoftheleftventricle(LV)andrightventricle(RV).Sixty-nine
infants with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) gestational age of 25.6 (24.9–26.4) weeks and a median birthweight of 770
(645–945) gram were included. Eight (12%) infants had signs of PH at six months corrected age. RV fractional area change was
lower in infants with severe BPD and PH at six months compared to infants without PH (35%(cid:3)9% vs. 43%(cid:3)9%, P¼0.03).

or without PH were similar. Signs of PH were found in 12% of infants with severe BPD at six months corrected age and the
presence of PH is associated with reduced RV systolic function.
