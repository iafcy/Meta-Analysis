The characteristics of the infants with

the primary criteria are shown in Table 1.
Patients with PH had lower birthweights
(P=0.03) but there were no differences
in gestational age at birth between groups.
Infants with late PH were more likely to
be from a multiple gestation birth than
infants without late PH (P=0.01). Infants
with PH were more likely to have received
positive pressure ventilation support at
36 weeks PMA, had increased mechanical
ventilation days and oxygen days,
were more likely to be discharged on
supplemental oxygen, and had increased
