Abstract
Hypothesis Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at increased risk of secondary pulmonary hyper-
tension (BPD-PH). Prior studies yielded mixed results on the utility of echocardiographic screening at 36 weeks post-men-
strual age (PMA). We present our experience using echocardiographic screening at the time of BPD diagnosis to identify
infants at highest risk of BPD-PH at discharge.
Materials and Methods Retrospective cohort analysis of clinical/ demographic data and screening echocardiograms in
patients with BPD. Discharge echocardiograms identified infants with or without BPD-PH at discharge. 36 weeks PMA
screening echocardiograms and clinical data were then reviewed to identify which factors were associated with increased
odds of BPD-PH at discharge. Associations between echocardiographic findings were evaluated with 2- and 3-variable
models to predict increased risk of BPD-PH at discharge.
Results In our cohort of 64 infants with severe BPD, BPD-PH was present in 22/64 (34%) infants at discharge. There were
no clinical differences at time of 36 weeks PMA screening evaluation (mean PMA 36.6 ± 2.9 weeks). PH at screening was
poorly predictive of PH at discharge as PH at screening resolved in 49% of patients. However, having an ASD, RV dilation,
hypertrophy, or reduced function on screening, especially in combination, were associated with BPD-PH at discharge.
Conclusion In our cohort of premature infants with BPD, 36 weeks PMA screening echocardiogram identified patients at
increased risk for BPD-PH at discharge when ASD, RVH, or impaired RV function were present. Larger prospective studies
are indicated to validate these findings.
