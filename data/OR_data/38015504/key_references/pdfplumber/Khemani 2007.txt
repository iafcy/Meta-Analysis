pulmonaryarteryhypertension.Inmultivariateanalyses,severepulmonaryartery
hypertension and small birth weight for gestational age were associated with
worse survival rates. Among 26 survivors (median follow-up period: 9.8 months),

CONCLUSION.Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and severe pulmo-

may not reflect the characteristics and treatment of pa-

with BPD who had PAH at (cid:3)4 months of life. In 2
