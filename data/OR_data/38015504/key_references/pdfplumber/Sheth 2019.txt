Abstract
Objective Toinvestigatefactorsassociatedwithdevelopmentofearlyandlatepulmonaryhypertension(E/LPH)inpreterm
infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
Study design A retrospective case-control observational study of preterm infants with BPD admitted to a level IV referral
neonatal intensive care unit over 5 years. We compared pre- and postnatal characteristics between infants with or without
BPD-associated EPH and LPH.
Results Fifty-nineoutof220infants(26.8%)hadLPH,while85outof193neonates(44%)hadEPH.Onmultiplelogistic
regression, novel factors associated with development of BPD–LPH included presence of maternal diabetes, EPH, tra-
cheostomy,tracheitis,intraventricularhemorrhage(IVH,grade≥3)andsystemicsteroiduse.ForEPH,thesewerematernal
diabetes, IVH grade ≥3, high frequency ventilator use, and absence of maternal antibiotics use.
Conclusion We identified novel factors and confirmed previously established factors with development of LPH and EPH,
which can help develop a screening strategy in BPD patients.
