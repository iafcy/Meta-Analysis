RESULTS:Onehundredforty-fiveELBWinfants(birthweight:7556144
g; median gestational age: 26 weeks [interquartile range: 24–27])
were screened from December 2008 to February 2011. Overall, 26
(17.9%) were diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at any time
during hospitalization (birth weight: 665 6 140 g; median
gestational age: 26 weeks [interquartile range: 24–27]): 9 (6.2%) by
initial screening (early pulmonary hypertension) and 17 (11.7%) who
were identified later (late pulmonary hypertension). Infants with
pulmonary hypertension were more likely to receive oxygen
treatment on day 28 compared with those without pulmonary
hypertension (96% vs 75%, P , .05). Of the 26 infants, 3 died (all
inthe lategroupbecause ofcorpulmonale)beforebeingdischarged
from the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension is relatively common, affect-

vivors. Routine screening of ELBW infantswith echocardiography at 4
weeks of age identifies only one-third of the infants diagnosed with
pulmonary hypertension. Further research is required to determine
optimal detection and intervention strategies. Pediatrics 2012;129:
