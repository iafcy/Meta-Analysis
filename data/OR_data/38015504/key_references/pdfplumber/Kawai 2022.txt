Abstract Background: The incidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
has not been investigated in regional cohorts. The aim of this study was to clarify the incidence of PH associated
with BPD in all very low birthweight infants (VLBWIs) born during the study period in Aichi Prefecture, Japan.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of all VLBWIs born in Aichi Prefecture. The
inclusion criteria were VLB, birth between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2015, and admission to any neonatal
intensive care unit in Aichi Prefecture. BPD28d and BPD36w were defined as the need for supplemental oxygen or
any respiratory support at 28 days of age or 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA). The primary outcome was the
incidence of PH after 36 weeks’ PMA (PH36w) in VLBWIs with BPD28d and BPD36w. The secondary outcomes
were the clinical factors related to PH36w in BPD36w patients. Mann–Whitney U-test and Fisher’s exact test were
used for univariate analysis. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. Risk ratio (RR) and
95% confidence interval (CI) were also evaluated.
Results: A total of 441 patients were analyzed. A total of 217 and 131 patients met the definition of BPD28d and
BPD36w, respectively. Nine patients were diagnosed with PH36w (4.2% and 6.9% of the BPD28d and BPD36w
patients, respectively). The presence of oligohydramnios (RR, 2.71; 95% CI: 1.55–4.73, P = 0.014) and sepsis (RR,
3.62; 95% CI: 1.51–8.63, P = 0.025) was significant in the PH36w patients.
Conclusions: The incidence of PH36w was 4.2% and 6.9% in the BPD28d and BPD36w patients, respectively.
Oligohydramnios and sepsis were significantly associated with PH36w in VLBWIs.

With regard to the clinical factors associated with PH36w
in BPD36w patients, oligohydramnios and sepsis were found
to be significant in the present study. Oligohydramnios has
been reported as a significant risk factor for PH associated References
