Abstract
Objectives To describe changes in hemodynamics, respiratory support, and growth associated with transcatheter PDA
closure (TCPC) in ELBW infants, stratified by postnatal age at treatment.
Study design This is an observational study of ELBW infants who underwent TCPC at ≤4 weeks (Group-1; n=34),
4–8 weeks (Group-2; n=33), and >8 weeks of age (Group-3; n=33). Hemodynamic assessment was performed during
TCPC. Multivariate Cox-proportionate-hazard modeling was used to identify factors associated with respiratory severity
score (RSS)>2 for >30 days following TCPC.
Results In comparison with Group-1, Group-3 infants had higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVRi=3.3 vs. 1.6
WU*m2; P=0.01), less weight gain between 4 and 8 weeks of age (16 vs. 25g/day) and took longer to achieve RSS<2
(median 81 vs. 20 days; P=0.001). RSS>2 for >30 days was associated with TCPC>8 weeks (OR=3.2, 95% CI:
1.75–5.8; p=0.03) and PVRi≥3 (OR=4.5, 95% CI: 2.7–8.9; p<0.01).
Conclusion ELBW infants may benefit from PDA closure within the first 4 weeks of life in order to prevent early onset
pulmonary vascular disease, promote faster growth, and for quicker weaning of ventilator and oxygen support.
