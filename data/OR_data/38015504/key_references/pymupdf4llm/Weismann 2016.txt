STUDY DESIGN: Prospective institutional echocardiographic PH screening at 36 to 38 weeks’ corrected gestational age (GA) for infants born o32 weeks' GA who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; group BPD), and infants without BPD who had a birth weight (BW) o750 g, or clinical suspicion for PH (group NoBPD). RESULTS: Two hundred and four infants were screened (GA 25.9 ± 2 weeks, BW 831 ± 286 g). The PH prevalence in group BPD was higher than in group NoBPD (44/159 (28%) vs 5/45 (11%); P = 0.028).

INTRODUCTION
Over the past few decades, survival of premature infants has
significantly increased. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one
of the most common morbidities associated with prematurity and
with the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH in this
population is thought to be due to abnormal microvascular
development and pulmonary vascular remodeling, resulting in
reduced cross-sectional area of pulmonary vasculature.[1] In
addition, pulmonary vascular reactivity is increased rendering
these infants more sensitive to periods of hypoxemia.[2] PH has
been reported in 23 to 37% of premature infants in multiple
retrospective studies with variable inclusion criteria, definitions for
PH, and echocardiographic interpretation.[3][–][6] However, recent
prospective studies suggest that the incidence of ‘late’ PH, at
~ 36 weeks’ corrected gestational age (CGA), may actually be
lower (4 to 14%).[7][–][9] Both prenatal and postnatal risk factors have
been associated with PH in infants with BPD, including
oligohydraminios, low 5-min APGAR score, lower birth weight
(BW), small for GA, severe BPD, infection and patent ductus
arteriosus (PDA). Outcomes associated with PH in infants with BPD
include prolonged mechanical ventilation and need for prolonged
supplemental oxygen therapy, increased length of hospital stay
and, most importantly, increased mortality.[3][–][7,10][–][12] To date, there
are no published guidelines for PH screening in infants with BPD.
In 2010, we instituted a screening program in the Yale-New
Haven Children’s Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for
infants at perceived risk for PH (Figure 1). The aim of this study


was to determine the prevalence of PH as well as associated risk
factors for PH in a cohort of infants o 32 weeks’ gestation.

METHODS
At Yale-New Haven Children’s Hospital, we established an echocardiographic screening protocol for PH in preterm infants. We report data
collected prospectively between April 2010 and November 2014. Screening echocardiograms were performed at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA. Inclusion
criteria were (1) born o32 weeks’ GA and diagnosed with BPD at
36 weeks’ CGA (group BPD) or 2) born o32 weeks' GA and o 750 g BW
but without BPD (group NoBPD). In addition, screening was also performed
at the request of the medical team for any infant o32 weeks’ GA with
pulmonary disease that did not meet criteria for BPD at 36 weeks’ CGA but
had a clinical suspicion for PH (group NoBPD).
We collected data on maternal and perinatal factors, neonatal
demographics, major neonatal morbidities and outcomes for inclusion in
our analyses. Maternal factors included the presence of chorioamnionitis,
maternal hypertension and administration of antenatal steroids. Neonatal
factors included gender, GA, BW and small for GA status. Neonatal
morbidity data included BPD, early- and late-onset sepsis, necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and presence of a
PDA. BPD was graded by severity as mild, moderate or severe using the
consensus definition by National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development (2000).[13] Early-onset sepsis was defined as a positive blood
culture(s) obtained at ⩽ 72 h of life, which yielded a traditional neonatal
pathogen (e.g. Escherichia coli, Group B streptococcus). Late-onset sepsis
was defined as a positive blood culture(s) obtained at 472 h of life
which yielded a traditional neonatal pathogen or a commensal
species (e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis).[14] Blood cultures that yielded

coagulase-negative staphylococci were reviewed using specific criteria
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[15] NEC was defined
according to the modified Bell’s staging and included only those ⩾ stage
IIA.[16] Surgical NEC included only those cases that went on to require
surgical intervention. IVH was graded based on the classification system
developed by Papile et al.[17] with severe IVH including only those of grade
III or IV. PDA included only those deemed to be hemodynamically
significant and was diagnosed via echocardiogram as reviewed by a
pediatric cardiologist. Last, outcome data included death, cumulative time
(in days) requiring mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube,
length of hospital stay, CGA at the time of discharge and whether or not an
infant was discharged from the NICU on supplemental oxygen.
A screening echocardiogram was conducted at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA
using the Philips IE33 (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA) or
Siemens Sequoia SC2000 (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Mountain View,
CA, USA) equipment. All echocardiograms were performed by a pediatric

echocardiography technician using our institutional PH protocol. Echocardiograms were interpreted by a single pediatric echocardiographer
(CGW) who was blinded to the clinical status of the patient. PH was defined
as a tricuspid regurgitation jet gradient of 436 mm Hg or presence of
septal flattening in systole. We also documented presence of a small or
greater atrial septal defect (ASD) or PDA. A patent foramen ovale was
defined as the space between a well-developed septum primum and a
normally formed septum secundum, and was considered normal.[18] A
secundum ASD was defined by the presence of deficiency of the septum
primum.
Infants with evidence of PH underwent follow-up echocardiograms at
individualized intervals. We documented the presence or absence of PH at
the time of last follow-up but no later than 1 year of age. Infants who had a
normal PH screening echocardiogram at 36 weeks’ CGA and who were
under the care of the Pediatric Respiratory Medicine service underwent
repeat echocardiography at ~ 1 year of age.
For statistical analyses continuous variables were expressed as mean
(s.d.), unless otherwise indicated. Categorical variables were expressed as
numbers (frequencies). For comparisons between groups, the t-test for
independent samples was used for continuous data. Fisher's exact or χ[2]

tests were used as appropriate for comparison of categorical variables
between groups. Binary logistic regression was used to correct for
differences in BW and GA between the groups and adjusted odds ratios
(ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. Receiver
operating characteristics curves were created. The set significance level
was Po 0.05. For multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was used
(e.g. NEC vs surgical NEC, Po0.025 was considered significant). Statistical
analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences,
version 21 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

RESULTS
Three hundred and ninety-eight infants born at o 32 weeks' GA
and still in our NICU at 36 weeks' CGA were eligible for inclusion
(Figure 2). One hundred and eighty-nine infants were excluded
because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (i.e. they were
o32 weeks’ GA, ⩾ 750 g BW but without BPD or clinical suspicion
for PH). We excluded an additional two infants with congenital
heart disease and associated elevated right heart pressure. Three
infants with BPD never had a screening echocardiogram before
discharge (Figure 2). Two hundred and four infants o 32 weeks’

gestation who met the inclusion criteria and underwent a PH
screening echocardiogram at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA at Yale-New
Haven Children’s Hospital were included in this study. Group BPD
included 159 infants diagnosed with BPD at 36 weeks’ CGA.[13]

Group NoBPD included 45 infants born at o32 weeks’ GA. These
included 15 infants screening strictly for BW o750 g as well as 30
infants with non-BPD pulmonary disease and a clinical suspicion
for PH (n = 30).

Group BPD
In group BPD, 44 of 159 infants (27.7%) had echocardiographic
evidence of PH at the time of the screening echocardiogram. Of
those, 35 had systolic septal flattening only, 1 had a tricuspid
regurgitation jet gradient 436 mm Hg only and 8 met both the
criteria. Infants with PH were of lower birth BW and GA, and were
more likely to have early-onset sepsis, severe IVH and NEC
(medical and surgical) as compared with those without PH
(Table 1). At the time of the PH screening echocardiogram, infants
with PH were also more likely to have an ASD (Table 1). Left–right


interatrial shunting was present in all but of the two infants. The
presence of an ASD was strongly associated with right ventricular
hypertrophy (ASD 16/32 (50%) vs no ASD 21/127 (17%), P o 0.001)
and dilation (ASD 16/32 (50%) vs no ASD 8/127 (6%), P o0.001).
No association between the severity of BPD and the prevalence of
PH was determined. Following correction for GA and BW in a
logistic regression model, all NEC, surgical NEC, severe IVH and the
presence of an ASD remained independent predictors of PH in the
cohort with BPD (Table 2). Early-onset sepsis occurred only in
infants with PH and therefore could not be used in the logistic
regression model. PH was also determined to be an independent
predictor for death before discharge from the NICU (Tables 1
and 2). In infants with BPD, length of stay, duration of mechanical
ventilation and discharge/transfer on oxygen did not differ
between infants with and without PH (Table 1).
Two infants in group BPD underwent a diagnostic cardiac
catheterization, 5 infants were placed on PH-specific oral agents,
10 received inhaled nitric oxide (NO), and 3 received both oral and
inhaled treatment. Thirty-five of 44 (80%) infants in the PH
subgroup underwent follow-up echocardiograms. At the time of

their most recent follow-up, only six (17%) still had evidence of PH
(Table 1). Fifty-nine of 115 infants with BPD but without initial
evidence of PH had follow-up echocardiograms. Only one infant
had newly developed PH at the time of a clinical deterioration. The
infant died secondary to NEC totalis.

Group NoBPD
In the NoBPD group, 5 of 45 (11%) infants had echocardiographic
evidence of PH. There were no significant differences in select
maternal factors, gender, BW or GA between infants with or
without PH in this group. The only postnatal factor associated with
PH in the NoBPD group was NEC (Table 1). There were no
differences in echocardiographic and/or outcome variables
between infants with or without PH in this cohort, and no infants
in this group died before NICU discharge (Table 1). Of note, there
was no difference in the prevalence of PH at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA
when comparing the subgroup of infants with BW o 750 g with
those with BW ⩾ 750 g (2/15 (13%) vs 3/30 (10%); P = 1). At the
time of the most recent follow-up, none of the 25 infants with
available echocardiographic data had evidence of PH (Table 1).

Group BPD and NoBPD combined
In both groups BPD and NoBPD alike, NEC was the most significant
factor associated with PH, with 57% (16/28) having echocardiographic evidence of PH at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA. The prevalence of
PH for infants who did not have a history of NEC was 22% (31/138)
for group BPD compared with 5% (2/38) for group NoBPD
(P = 0.018). In a subgroup analysis of group BPD without NEC,
lower BW (area under the curve 0.619, 95% CI: 0.504 to 0.734,
P = 0.044) was associated with PH, whereas GA (area under the
curve 0.568, 95% CI: 0.0.456 to 0.679, P = 0.253) and severe IVH (PH
in severe IVH 5/13 (38%) vs 26/125 (21%) if no severe IVH;
P = 0.167) were not. Based on these results, a BW o840 g as a
predictor of PH was associated with a 80% sensitivity and 41%
specificity in this subgroup (PH for BW o 840 g 25/88 (28%) vs
6/50 (12%) for BW ⩾ 840 g; P = 0.033).
Therefore, if we limited PH screen to only those infants with
NEC, and to those with BPD who also had a BW o840 g, the
sensitivity for detecting PH would have been 84%. This approach
would have missed eight infants with echocardiographic evidence
of PH. However, by applying these more restrictive criteria for PH
screening, we would have reduced the number of echocardiograms performed by 88 (i.e. by 43%).


DISCUSSION
This is the first investigation of PH in infants o32 weeks’ GA with
BPD that prospectively identified NEC (both medical and surgical),
surgical NEC, severe IVH, the presence of an ASD and mortality as
factors independently associated with PH at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA.
In infants o 32 weeks’ GA and without BPD, NEC was the only
identifiable factor associated with PH.
The prevalence of PH in our study is within the previously
reported range for PH in prematurity of up to 36%.[3][–][6] However,
two recent prospective studies suggest that the incidence of ‘late’
PH, at ~ 36 weeks' CGA, may actually be lower (4 to 14%).[8,9] This
wide range may be attributed to the retrospective design of most
studies, lack of prospective screening protocols, variability in
inclusion criteria, time points when the echocardiograms were
performed, classification of PH based on the clinical interpretation
of echocardiograms by different readers and variable echocardiographic definitions for PH.
The gold standard for diagnosing PH is a mean pulmonary
arterial pressure of 425 mm Hg via cardiac catheterization.[19]

Interestingly, this definition applies to adults, children and infants
alike, even though there are significant differences in systemic
arterial blood pressure from infancy to adulthood. Using
echocardiography as a screening tool for PH, an estimated systolic
pulmonary arterial pressure ⩾ 35 to 40 mm Hg or the presence of
end-systolic septal flattening are considered abnormal.[9,20,21]

Echocardiographic presence of end-systolic septal flattening is
generally thought to indicate more than half systemic right
ventricular systolic pressure. This was first described over 30 years
ago in a study of 26 children who underwent cardiac catheterization and echocardiography simultaneously.[20] Assessment of septal
flattening, however, has significant interobserver variability.[22]

Quantitative estimates of septal flattening may therefore be
useful in the absence of enough tricuspid regurgitation to
estimate right ventricular systolic pressure.[22][–][25] The left ventricular
end-systolic eccentricity index (SEI) quantifies the degree of septal
flattening. A SEI of 1 would be considered normal, septal
flattening is recognized by a single observer at an SEI ⩾ 1.15,
but greater than half systemic right ventricular pressure estimates
was only noted at SEI ⩾ 1.3.[22] In our patient cohort, changing the
definition of PH to SEI ⩾ 1.3 would decrease the prevalence of PH
from 27 to 10%. Although SEI as a quantitative measure of septal
flattening may increase reproducibility, correlation to actual
hemodynamic data will remain challenging until simultaneous
cardiac catheterization is performed as part of a larger
multicenter study.
BPD has been previously reported to be a major independent
risk factor for PH, especially if severe.[3,5,8,9] While BPD was
associated with PH in our study, severity was not. This discrepancy
may be due to variable definitions of BPD. While we used NIH
criteria, we did not perform physiologic testing.[7,9]

In our study, NEC (medical and surgical NEC combined as well
as surgical NEC alone) and severe IVH remained independently
associated factors for PH in infant with BPD after controlling for GA
and BW. In prior investigations, sepsis, inflammation and
hypoxemia have all been associated with acute and/or chronic
development of PH.[26,27] Diminished endothelial NO production by
endothelial NO synthase can lead to PH in those clinical settings,
which has also been described in infants with NEC.[28] In addition,
there is some evidence linking insufficient supply of endogenous
NO in premature infants to BPD and IVH.[29] This may explain why
NEC and severe IVH were identified as PH-associated factors in our
cohort of preterm infants.
Risk stratification of preterm infants may enable us to reduce
the number of screening echocardiograms performed. Biochemical markers may complement echocardiographic PH screening.
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is a potential biochemical marker that is used clinically for monitoring patients with PH.

Recently, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was found to
be consistently elevated 41000 pg ml [−] [1] in preterm infants with
BPD and PH at 36 to 38 weeks' CGA, when compared with
controls.[30] If those results are validated in a larger study,
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide may replace echocardiography as the primary screening method for infants deemed to be
at low risk for PH.
Prematurely born infants have a higher prevalence of congenital heart disease.[31] In our investigation, infants with BPD and
PH at the time of the screening echocardiogram were significantly
more likely to have an ASD. It has been suggested that increased
pulmonary blood flow may further enhance the pulmonary
vascular remodeling already induced by other factors and result
in pulmonary vascular disease.[32] Early ASD closure during infancy
with symptomatic improvement has been reported, and should be
considered in preterm infants with BPD and PH.[33]

Our overall mortality rate for infants with PH was 12%, which is
at the lower end of published associated mortality rates of 10 to
38%.[3,5,9,10,21] Length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation
and discharge or transfer on oxygen did not differ between infants
with and without PH in our cohort. Prior investigations have
reported conflicting data regarding differences in these outcomes
between infants with and without PH.[3,5,9,21] In our NICU, once
PH was identified medical management was altered to avoid
hypercarbia and to allow for higher oxygen saturations. If PH
remained significant and persistent, we considered diagnostic
cardiac catheterization before starting anti-pulmonary hypertensive agents. In those infants too unstable to undergo cardiac
catheterization, inhaled NO and/or Sildenafil were empirically
initiated. Overall, only a small number of infants received PHspecific therapy. Prospective screening for PH in at-risk infants
allowed us to adjust medical management in an effort to optimize
cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. We speculate that early recognition of PH may improve outcome.
The strengths of this study are the prospective design of our
screening program, and the interpretation of echocardiograms by
a single reader (CGW) who was blinded to the patient’s clinical
status. This study also has several limitations, including the
possibility of a type II error given the relatively small number of
infants with PH, especially in the NoBPD group. Infants without
BPD who had a BW 4750 g were only screened for PH at 36 to
38 weeks' CGA if there was a clinical concern allowing for selection
bias. Further, follow-up echocardiograms to evaluate for new or
persistent PH beyond 36 weeks’ PMA were performed at variable
time points, but usually at ~ 1 year of age if no clinical concerns
existed to warrant sooner evaluation. EKG as a screening test was
not part of this screening algorithm. Additionally, the gold
standard for diagnosing PH is cardiac catheterization, an invasive
test that was only performed in selected patients with echocardiograms suggesting significant PH at more than one time point.
Last, given the highly variable prevalence of prematurity-related
comorbidities and respiratory management, our findings may
not be generalizable and should be evaluated in a larger
multicenter study.

CONCLUSION
In a cohort of premature infants with BPD and after controlling for
GA and BW, NEC, severe IVH, the presence of an ASD and mortality
were identified as independent factors associated with PH at 36 to
38 weeks' CGA. NEC was the only factor associated with PH in
preterm infants without BPD. The variability in reported risk factors
for PH in premature infants underscores the complexity of this
disease process in this population. Our results need to be
validated in a larger multicenter study to suggest an echocardiographic PH screening algorithm for preterm infants that can be
applied across multiple institutions. A better understanding of
demographic and risk factors associated with PH may reduce the


total number of screening echocardiograms performed and, with
it, the associated costs.
