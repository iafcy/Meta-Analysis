## Abstract Objective Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) increases the risk for developing pul### monary hypertension (PH). However, the risk factors associated with BPD-associated PH remain unclear. Our primary aim was to determine perinatal risk factors associated with the development of PH in infants with BPD. Study Design We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 303 infants born at 28 � weeks’ gestation. Infants were categorized as having no, mild, moderate, or severe BPD. PH was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test, two- sample t-test, and multivariable logistic regression. Results The incidence of PH in our cohort was 12%. Infants with PH had lower birth weights and gestational ages (p < 0.001). After controlling for confounding variables,

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease
of infancy, impacts the pulmonary and overall health and
development of thousands of infants each year.[1] It is one of
the most common complications of extreme preterm birth
and results in significant morbidity and mortality in
extremely low birth weight infants.[2][–][5] Risk factors

associated with the development of severe BPD includes
lower gestational ages (GAs) and birth weights.[6] Previous
studies have suggested that infants with BPD are at
increased risk for developing cardiovascular complications
including pulmonary hypertension (PH), cor pulmonale,
and death.[7][–][10]

There is a paucity of information about the risk factors,
pathogenesis, and natural history of BPD-associated PH.
Although vascular remodeling, increased vasomotor tone,
and reduced alveolar capillary coupling have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of PH, the precise mechanism by which
BPD-associated PH develops remains poorly elucidated.[8,9,11,12] Infants with severe BPD appear to be at highest
risk for developing PH suggesting that higher inspired oxygen
concentrations and inflammation may play a role in its
pathogenesis.[1,13][–][15] Other proposed mechanisms for BPDassociated PH include growth restriction, exposure to certain
drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
genetic predisposition, and cardiovascular shunts.[11,16,17] Recently, elevated maternal α-fetoprotein (AFP) and human
chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), as well as decreased unconjugated estriol (uE3) have been shown to be associated with an
increased risk of developing BPD suggesting that a prenatal
predisposition for BPD may exist.[18]

At present, there is no consensus on the definition, screening, or management of clinically significant PH in extremely
preterm infants.[19] Although cardiac catheterization is the gold
standard for diagnosing PH,[10] it is often avoided in fragile
premature infants as it is an invasive procedure. PH definitions
range widely from the isolated right ventricular hypertrophy
(RVH) to more stringent criteria of elevated tricuspid regurgitation jet and ventricular septal flattening in addition to
RVH.[11,20,21] Routine screening for BPD-associated PH has not
been universally adopted because of questions regarding the
optimal timing for screening. In a recent study of extremely
low birth weight infants, BPD-associated PH was seen in 6% of
infants at 4 weeks of life; an additional 12% of patients were
diagnosed with PH beyond 4 weeks of life.[22]

In this study, we examined the maternal and neonatal
characteristics of infants born at � 28 weeks’ GA admitted to
the intensive care nursery at the Children’s Hospital at
Montefiore, Weiler Division, between 2006 and 2012, who
developed BPD-associated PH. Our objective was to identify
maternal and neonatal risk factors associated with the development of PH in extremely premature infants. In this study of
infants born at � 28 weeks’ gestation with a screening
echocardiogram obtained at or after 36 weeks’ corrected
GA, we hypothesized that infants with severe BPD were at
the highest risk for developing PH and that certain targeted
neonatal characteristics would help to better identify preterm infants with evolving chronic lung disease who would
benefit from routine, and possibly earlier, screening for PH.

## Patients and Methods


(4) presence of any congenital conditions that would predispose the infant to developing PH or worsen preexisting
PH such as congenital heart disease and diaphragmatic
hernia. During the study period, screening echocardiograms to diagnose BPD-associated PH were performed at
the discretion of the attending neonatologist. Therefore, all
infants born at less than 28 weeks’ gestation did not have
PH screening.
Baseline maternal and neonatal demographic information
were obtained from our database and chart review. Maternal
characteristics analyzed included age, quad screen results
(AFP, HCG, estriol, and inhibin), antenatal steroid administration, and the presence or absence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, preterm premature
rupture of membranes (PPROM), depression requiring medication, and toxic habits (tobacco, alcohol, and/or illicit drug
use). Neonatal characteristics recorded included GA, birth
weight (BW), gender, race, small for GA (SGA) status, and
Apgar score � 5 at 5 minutes of life. Additional neonatal
characteristics analyzed were Clinical Risk Index for Babies
(CRIB) scores as an indicator of illness severity in the first 12
hours of life; the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
with or without the need for surgical ligation, retinopathy of
prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and gastrointestinal perforation; severity of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH); and average fluid intake over the first 2 weeks of
life. For each patient, the presence or absence of BPD was
noted. Each infant was then categorized by severity of BPD
based on validated NICHD criteria. The four groups included
no BPD, mild BPD (oxygen requirement at 28 days of life),
moderate BPD (FIO2 of < 30% at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual
age), and severe BPD (FIO2 � 30% or need for continuous
positive airway pressure, high flow nasal cannula, or ventilator support at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age).[23]

The primary outcome measure was development of PH in
preterm infants born at � 28 weeks’ gestation. The definition
of PH was met if a patient had elevated right ventricular
pressures on echocardiogram, defined as the presence of two
or more of the following criteria: RV pressure greater than
25 mm Hg in the presence of a tricuspid regurgitation jet,
right ventricular hypertrophy, and intraventricular septal
flattening.[24][–][26] Patients were included only if an echocardiogram was obtained at 36 weeks’ corrected GA or greater, at
which time physiologic postnatal PH should no longer be
evident and moderate or severe BPD can be diagnosed.

## Data Analysis


This is an observational, retrospective cohort study of all
the infants with GA � 28 weeks’ who were admitted to the
neonatal intensive care unit at the Children’s Hospital at
Montefiore, Weiler Division, from 2006 to 2012. Eligible
infants were identified from our comprehensive neonatal
database. Infants were excluded from the study if they met
the following criteria: (1) death within 28 days of birth, (2)
transfer to an outside hospital within the first week of life,
(3) echo not obtained at or after 36 weeks’ corrected GA, or


The p values for comparison across PH and non-PH patients
were tabulated by Fisher exact test for categorical variables
and by two-sample t-test for continuous variables. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess the independent
effects of the various risk factors for PH and to control for
potential confounders. The predictor variables included in the
model were severity of BPD, CRIB scores, PDA, PDA ligation,
severity of ROP, GA, BW, and maternal age. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

## Results

The Children’s Hospital at Montefiore treats patients in a large
urban area with a diverse population. A total of 351 infants
were screened for the study of which 303 infants met inclusion criteria. Overall, 48 infants (14%) were excluded—6
infants (2%) secondary to death before 28 days of life and
42 infants (12%) because of lack of echocardiogram results at
or after 36 weeks’ corrected GA (►Fig. 1). Of the 303 infants
studied, the incidence of PH was 12% (►Table 1). The overall
incidence of BPD of any severity was 89% (270/303) with 37%
(112/303) of infants categorized as having severe BPD. Infants
with PH had lower BW (p < 0.001) and lower GA (p < 0.001)
(►Table 1). Although there was a trend toward an increase in
PH in SGA infants, this was not statistically significant
(p ¼ 0.09; ►Table 1).
To understand how maternal health may impact the
development of PH in extremely preterm infants, we examined the presence of maternal comorbidities and the subsequent development of PH in preterm infants. Maternal
morbidities such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
preeclampsia, and chorioamnionitis were not associated with
PH development as indicated in ►Table 2. Of note, unlike
previous reports, we did not observe an association between
maternal use of SSRI’s for depression and the development of
PH in our cohort of patients. However, only four patients in


our cohort reported a history of taking SSRIs for depression
(►Table 2). No relationship was demonstrated between quad
screen results and the development of BPD or PH.
Because pulmonary disease is associated with the development of PH, we evaluated the relationship between BPD
severity and PH. Severe BPD was positively associated with
the development of PH (►Table 3). BPD-associated PH was
diagnosed at a median age of 96 days (range, 66–179 days). To
better understand the relationship between illness severity
and the development of PH, we assessed the relationship
between CRIB scores, a marker of illness severity within the
first 12 hours of life,[27] and PH. Elevated CRIB scores were
noted to be significantly associated with the subsequent
development of PH (p < 0.001; ►Table 3). There was no
association between the degree of elevation of CRIB scores
and the timing of the diagnosis of PH. Interestingly, other
neonatal morbidities including NEC, gastrointestinal perforation, and severity of IVH were not associated with the
development of PH in our cohort.
A multivariable logistic regression model was used to
assess the independent effects of the various risk factors for
PH and to control for potential confounders. In this model,
severe BPD and higher CRIB scores remained significantly
associated with PH development (►Table 4). The odds of
developing PH were 4.7-fold higher in infants with severe BPD
compared with those without (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 4.74; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.68–13.4).

## Discussion


Fig. 1 Flow diagram of infant categorization.


In this single center, retrospective review of extremely preterm infants, we observed that the development of PH was
associated with severe BPD and neonatal disease severity as
measured by CRIB scores. Previously published studies of
infants with BPD describes an incidence of PH ranging from
17.9 to 43%.[13,28] In comparison, we found a PH incidence of
12% in our study cohort. This lower incidence may be related,
at least in part, to our more stringent criteria for diagnosing
PH in the study patients. In this study, infants had to meet two
or more echocardiographic criteria to be diagnosed with PH
whereas other studies required only one echocardiographic
finding.[13,22] The median age at diagnosis of PH was 96 days of
life (range, 66–179 days) suggesting that it may take a few
weeks to months for echocardiographic evidence of PH to
manifest in the presence of significant lung disease.
Infants with severe BPD were at higher risk for developing
PH than infants with no BPD or BPD of lesser severity.
Although 26% of patients with severe BPD developed PH, a
few patients with mild and moderate BPD also developed PH
(6 and 3%, respectively). This is likely related to the fact that
the development of PH is a multifactorial process. Infants with
the most significant lung disease may be impacted for several
reasons. Impaired lung development may coincide with
impaired development of the pulmonary vasculature, as
premature infants are born at early developmental stages.[29]

Altered pulmonary and vascular development may lead to an
inability of both the respiratory and cardiovascular systems to
adequately support the infant’s needs during growth. This

may be further impaired by the severity of the infant’s illness
and comorbid conditions.[12] Alternatively, more severe postnatal lung disease may lead to PH. Abnormal gas exchange
and increased pulmonary arterial pressure in the lungs may


lead to pulmonary artery hypertrophy, increased right-sided
heart pressures, and ultimately PH.[11,30]

Higher illness severity, as estimated by CRIB scores, was
associated with an increased likelihood of PH development.

This is the first study to demonstrate a relationship between
early illness severity as characterized by CRIB scores and the
development of PH in extremely premature neonates
(►Table 4; 1.2-fold increased risk of developing PH in infants
with higher CRIB scores; p ¼ 0.04). CRIB scores are used as
indicators of early illness severity and risk of mortality. They
are compiled based on GA, BW, gender, admission temperature, and greatest base deficit in the first 12 hours of life. One
may hypothesize that, in addition to GA and BW, initial
temperature abnormalities/instability and acidosis may contribute significantly to long-term infant morbidity and mortality. A score of < 10 is generally considered to indicate a less
sick infant, whereas scores > 15 are associated with increased mortality.[31] As our non-PH group had a mean score
of 10.7 versus the PH group with an average score of 13.3, one
can envision how a CRIB score of greater than 11 may be used
as an indicator for a higher likelihood of developing PH. CRIB
scores have recently been shown to be superior to other
illness severity scores including the Score for Neonatal Acute
Physiology (SNAP)[32]; they have demonstrated a greater
ability to discriminate illness severity, possess good predictive value, and are less time intensive to compile.[33,34] SNAP
scores have recently been reported to be associated with BPD
or death. However, as CRIB scores are based on 5 parameters
versus 28 parameters used in calculating SNAP scores, CRIB
scores are more likely to be utilized in the clinical arena
because of the ease of calculation.[35]

On the basis of our findings of a positive correlation
between CRIB scores and PH development, we propose that
CRIB scores may be used as an early screening tool for
future PH development as they can be calculated on the first
day of life. Currently, BPD is diagnosed after a chronological
age of 28 days for mild BPD and 36 weeks’ postconceptual
age for moderate-to-severe BPD. With the early identification of preterm infants at the greatest risk of developing PH,
targeted interventions can be provided earlier to the “at
risk” population, thus improving short- and long-term
health outcomes.


Infants with growth restriction have previously been
reported to be at risk for the development of both BPD and
PH. Mechanisms for this association may be related to poor
overall growth in these infants leading to incomplete alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development. African
American mothers, even after controlling for risk status, are
2.6 times more likely to give birth to SGA infants compared
with their White counterparts.[16] Overall, 49% of our cohort
was African American. However, we did not observe a significant association between growth restriction and the development of PH (►Table 1; p ¼ 0.09). This may be related to the
relatively small numbers of SGA infants in the study (49 SGA
subjects, 22/49 African American); however, these findings
warrant further exploration in a larger cohort.
There are several limitations to our study. The retrospective nature of this study may predispose our findings to being
impacted by various confounders and bias. As this is a single
center study, our patient population, primarily underserved
and racially diverse, may not reflect the patient characteristics seen elsewhere. Although our sample size of 303 infants
is robust, some of the trends that we observed may have
achieved significance if the sample size was larger. In addition, the absence of a correlation between various prematurity-related comorbidities and BPD-associated PH may be
related to the fact that the study was not powered to detect
differences for these variables. Finally, during the study
period, all infants born at less than 28 weeks’ gestation did
not have screening echocardiograms to evaluate for BPDassociated PH. However, the eligible infants who did not have
screening echocardiograms at 36 weeks’ corrected GA were
low-risk infants with low CRIB scores for whom the attending
neonatologist deemed screening for PH not of high utility.
Thus, the exclusion of these infants should not affect the
predictive value of the high CRIB score. At the conclusion of
this study, we have since instituted standardized PH screening guidelines in our unit. Our screening guidelines are
indicated for infants born at < 30 weeks’ gestation or those
infants diagnosed with BPD at 28 days of life. These infants


-----

have a screening echocardiogram at 6 weeks’ chronological
age and if PH is diagnosed at this time, therapeutic measures
such as adjusting respiratory support or oxygen saturation
targets when appropriate, and institution of diuretic therapy
are undertaken. Patients with diagnosed PH at 28 days of life
are routinely screened with echocardiograms every 2 weeks,
or earlier if clinically indicated. If PH is not diagnosed, then
routine screening echocardiograms are obtained every
4 weeks until the infant is in room air and PH is not present.
In conclusion, after controlling for potential confounding
factors, severe BPD and higher CRIB scores were associated
with an increased likelihood of development of PH. We
speculate that CRIB scores may represent a reliable and
quantifiable screening tool for early identification of infants
most at risk of developing PH that may allow for possible
interventions to prevent its development or progression.
