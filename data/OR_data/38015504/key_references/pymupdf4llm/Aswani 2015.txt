Abstract Background: Many extremely low birth weight infants develop pulmonary hypertension late in their
clinical course, and over 60% go undetected by early screening echocardiography. At present, no standardised
screening protocol exists for detecting late pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants. We
assessed the utility of oxygen supplementation as a predictor of late pulmonary hypertension. Methods: A retrospective single-centre review of extremely low birth weight infants with no evidence of CHD and those surviving
for >30 days was performed. The association between oxygen ⩾30% at day of life 30 and diagnosis of late
pulmonary hypertension was estimated with an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval using logistic regression.
Doppler echocardiography was used to diagnose pulmonary hypertension in the infants. Results: A total of 230
infants met the study criteria. The incidence of late pulmonary hypertension was 8.3% (19/230). Infants with late
pulmonary hypertension were more likely to have a lower mean birth weight (667.1 ± 144 versus 799.3 ± 140 g,
p = 0.001) and more likely to be small for gestational age (47.4 versus 14.2%, p = 0.004). Oxygen requirement
⩾30% at day of life 30 was associated with increased risk of late pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio = 3.77, 95%
confidence interval = 1.42–10.00, p = 0.008) in univariate analysis and after adjusting for birth weight (odds
ratio = 2.47, 95% confidence interval = 0.89–6.84, p = 0.08). Conclusions: The need of oxygen supplementation
⩾30% at day of life 30 may be a good screening tool for detecting late pulmonary hypertension in extremely low
birth weight infants.

Advances in medical technology in the last 2 decades
have improved survival of extremely low birth weight
infants in the industrialised world, but have created a
cohort of patients who are at risk of chronic lung
disease due to underdevelopment of the lungs.
Previous studies have reported mortality ranging
from 14 to 38% in premature infants with chronic
lung disease.[1][–][4] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
remains the most common form of chronic lung
disease in premature infants, characterised by arrested
lung development affecting both alveologenesis
and the pulmonary vasculature.[5] According to the


-----

Tracking Outcomes and Practice in the Paediatric
Pulmonary Hypertension registry, bronchopulmonary dysplasia was the most frequent disorder
associated with pulmonary hypertension due to
respiratory disorders or hypoxaemia in infants.[6] The
incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is inversely
proportional to the degree of prematurity, and the
incidence of pulmonary hypertension continues to
increase as these patients have improved survival.[7,8]
A recent prospective study examined 145 extremely
low birth weight infants and found that 77% had
some form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and that
one in every six (18%) of extremely low birth weight
infants developed pulmonary hypertension.[8]
Although early diagnosis can lead to improved
prognosis, the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension
can be difficult because the clinical symptoms are
subtle, such as increased oxygen requirement,
tachypnoea, and failure to thrive, in this patient
population and can be masked by the bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At present, there is no universally accepted standard screening test for
pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth
weight infants. Cardiac catheterisation is the gold
standard for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension by
direct measurement of pulmonary arterial pressure in
infants, children, and adults. Unfortunately, it has
limited utility in extremely low birth weight infants
due to the risk of vascular injury associated with this
invasive procedure in these small patients.
Non-invasive techniques using Doppler echocardiography can estimate the right ventricular pressure
and have been validated with reasonably good
correlation against pressures obtained at cardiac
catheterisation.[9,10] At present, echocardiography is
the most common modality used to screen and
diagnose pulmonary hypertension in premature
infants.[3,4] Current management protocols vary by
institution, and they utilise screening echocardiography for screening or when there is clinical suspicion of pulmonary hypertension, particularly when
supplementation with high levels of oxygen is
required. Recently, Bhat et al[8] performed a prospective study using early screening echocardiography in extremely low birth weight infants at
1 month of age. They found that screening echocardiograms at 1 month of age may miss as many as
66% of those infants who will develop late pulmonary hypertension (⩾4 weeks of age) in their clinical
course.[8] Therefore, there is a clinical need for a better
screening tool for the early detection of late pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth weight
infants. We hypothesise that the amount of oxygen
required on day of life 30 may be used as a surrogate
or screening tool for the detection of late pulmonary
hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants.


### Materials and methods

After institutional review board approval, we performed a single-centre retrospective study. We
included all infants with birth weight ⩽1000 g who
were admitted to All Children’s Hospital between
January, 2008 and December, 2011. Infants were
excluded if they had haemodynamically significant
CHD or they did not survive for >30 days of life.
Demographic data, birth history, and clinical findings,
including the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension on
the discharge summary, echocardiographic evidence of
pulmonary hypertension at >30 days of life, amount of
supplemental oxygen at day of life 30, co-morbidities,
and mortality, were recorded from the electronic
medical record. Infants were classified as having
pulmonary hypertension if a discharge diagnosis was
recorded on the discharge summary and an echocardiogram demonstrated clinical evidence of late
pulmonary hypertension.
In 2000, the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development/National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute Workshop developed a severity-based
definition for infants under 32 weeks of gestation to
grade the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.[5]
This scoring system includes assessment of the fraction
of inspired oxygen or positive pressure ventilation at
36 weeks post-menstrual age. The grades define mild
bronchopulmonary dysplasia as the need for supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days but not at
36 weeks post-menstrual age or discharge, moderate
bronchopulmonary dysplasia as the need for supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days and treatment with
<30% oxygen at 36 weeks post-menstrual age, and
severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia as the need for
supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days requiring at
least 30% oxygen and/or positive pressure ventilation
at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. The other clinical
characteristics that were studied included presence of
severe intra-ventricular haemorrhage (grade III or
IV), ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus, diagnosis
of necrotising enterocolitis, and the need for surgery
for retinopathy of prematurity.

### Diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension
The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is traditionally made by cardiac catheterisation with a mean
pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg in children
and adults. In this retrospective study of neonates, we
used echocardiography to estimate the right ventricular pressure to diagnose pulmonary artery
hypertension. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was
estimated by measuring the peak systolic pressure
gradient from the right ventricle to the right atrium,
calculated using the Bernoulli equation = 4 ×
maximum velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet


-----

measured by continuous wave Doppler, and adding
the estimated right atrial pressure of 5 mmHg. No
national or institutional guidelines exist to determine
when a neonate gets an echocardiogram to screen for
pulmonary artery hypertension. The echocardiograms
performed in this study were carried out at the clinician’s discretion to screen for pulmonary artery
hypertension. All echocardiograms were reviewed
during the clinical course of these patients. A diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was made if the
tricuspid regurgitation jet was >3 m/s, right ventricular pressure was estimated to be >50% of the
systemic blood pressure, or septal flattening. Late
pulmonary hypertension was defined as any pulmonary hypertension diagnosed by echocardiography
in an infant after 4 weeks of life. Infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension that resolved before
4 weeks were not included in the category of late
pulmonary hypertension.

### Statistical analysis

Demographic and clinical characteristics were summarised by pulmonary hypertension status using
counts, with percentages, for categorical variables and
means, with standard deviation, or medians, with
range, for continuous variables. Comparison between
groups was performed using χ[2] test or Fisher’s exact
test for categorical variables and Student’s t-tests or
Wilcoxon Mann–Whitney test for continuous
variables. The association of late pulmonary hypertension was tested with different oxygen supplementation levels of 30, 35, and 40% at day of life 30.
The 30% oxygen supplementation was found to be
the best cut-off. The association between oxygen
supplementation of 30% or higher at day of life 30
and the diagnosis of late pulmonary hypertension was
estimated with an odds ratio and 95% confidence
interval using logistic regression. Receiver operating
characteristic curve analyses, computing the area
under the curve and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals, were performed to compare the requirement of oxygen supplementation of 30% or higher in
predicting pulmonary hypertension. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina, United States of America). All
statistical tests were two-sided with the threshold for
statistical significance set at p < 0.05.

### Results

A total of 290 extremely low birth weight infants
were admitted over a 4-year period to the neonatal
intensive care unit at All Children’s Hospital; 60
infants were excluded before day of life 30 due to
early neonatal death (n = 56) or the presence of


haemodynamically significant CHD (n = 4). Among
all, 230 infants who survived beyond day of life 30
were included in the study (Fig 1). At day of life 30,
78 of the 230 infants (34%) required oxygen supplementation at 30% or higher and 12 of the 78 had a
diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. In comparison,
152 infants out of the 230 infants had a supplemental
oxygen requirement of <30%. Of the 152 requiring
oxygen supplementation, seven (4.6%) patients
had a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. A total of
19 out of 230 infants in both the groups (8.3%) met
the criteria for the diagnosis of late pulmonary
hypertension.

### Patient characteristics
The demographic characteristics for infants with late
pulmonary hypertension and without late pulmonary
hypertension are shown in Table 1. No differences
existed in relation to gender (p = 1.0) or gestational
age (p = 0.62) between the two groups. Infants with
late pulmonary hypertension were more likely to have
a lower mean weight at birth (667.1 ± 144 versus
799.3 ± 140 g, p = 0.0001), to be small for gestational age defined as birth weight <10th percentile
for age (47.4 versus 14.2%, p = 0.004). These findings suggest that extremely low birth weight infants
with pulmonary hypertension are more likely to be
small for gestational age and have had some form of
intra-uterine growth restriction.

### Chronic lung disease characteristics
Clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Infants
with pulmonary hypertension were more likely to
need at least 30% oxygen supplementation at 30 days
of life (63.5 versus 31.3%, p = 0.005), moderateto-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (89.4 versus
65.4%, p = 0.04), and longer median duration of
mechanical ventilation (53 versus 26 days, p = 0.0007).
These data suggest that extremely low birth weight
infants with pulmonary hypertension have more significant lung disease compared with their counterparts
without pulmonary hypertension.

### Co-morbidities and mortality
Extremely low birth weight infants with pulmonary
hypertension were more likely to require a patent
ductus arteriosus ligation (52.6 versus 19.9%,
p < 0.001), had longer median length of stay (134
versus 100 days, p = 0.002), and had increased
mortality (15.8 versus 3.3%, p = 0.04) compared
with infants with no pulmonary hypertension. No
statistically significant changes were seen in relationship to the incidence of severe intra-ventricular

haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, or retinopathy of prematurity requiring surgery (see Table 1).
The increased length of stay and mortality suggest
that extremely low birth weight infants have significant morbidity and mortality associated with this
disease process.

### Oxygen requirement as a predictor of late pulmonary hypertension
Assessments of oxygen requirement in all the infants
at day of life 30 were recorded, and logistic regression
analysis determined that 30% oxygen supplementation was the most sensitive point for screening for
pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth
weight infants. We found that 33.9% (78/230)
required supplemental oxygen at 30% or higher.


Infants requiring supplemental oxygen at 30% or
more had an increased risk of developing pulmonary
hypertension (odds ratio = 3.77, 95% confidence
interval = 1.42–10.00, p = 0.008) compared with
those requiring supplemental oxygen under 30%.
This increased risk persisted, although attenuated
and of borderline significance, after adjusting for
birth weight (odds ratio = 2.47, 95% confidence
interval = 0.89–6.84, p value = 0.08). Receiver
operating characteristic curve analysis showed an area
under the curve of 0.69 (95% confidence interval =
0.58–0.79, p = 0.0006) for oxygen supplementation
in predicting late pulmonary hypertension (Fig 2)
and revealed that oxygen requirement at 30% or
higher at day of life 30 as a screening tool for the
diagnosis of late pulmonary hypertension in an extremely low birth weight infant was 63.2% sensitive

### Discussion

All clinicians including neonatologists, cardiologists,
pulmonologists, general paediatricians, mid-level
providers, and bedside nurses, who care for extremely low birth weight infants, need to be aware of the
inherent risks that pulmonary hypertension can have
on their patients and how to detect those patients at
risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. The
detection of pulmonary hypertension may be difficult
due to the lack of physical exam findings and may be


commonly missed by routine echocardiography
screening in extremely low birth weight infants.
Although the sensitivity of 63% and specificity of
69% are modest numbers, this test is useful in identifying a sub-group of infants who would be at high
risk of developing pulmonary hypertension later on
during their hospital course. This readily available
and cost-effective tool has better clinical utility than
previously tested screening tools of monthly echocardiography, which can miss as many as 66% of
extremely low birth weight infants at risk of developing late pulmonary hypertension.[8] This would
avoid the use of excessive screening echocardiograms
for all extremely low birth weight infants and focus
echocardiography resources on those most likely to
have clinical disease.
Our study demonstrated that both small for
gestational age and lower mean birth weight were
risk factors for the development of pulmonary
hypertension. This is consistent with the Barker
hypothesis that an abnormal foetal environment leads
to end-organ changes that can then predispose to
multiple chronic adult medical conditions including
pulmonary artery hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, systemic hypertension, and early coronary
artery disease.[11] Small for gestational age is a measure
of foetal growth restriction. This may be due to
constitutional issues (genetics) within the foetus or
due to abnormalities within the foetal environment
such as maternal health issue, environmental toxin/
medication, placental insufficiency, or umbilical cord
abnormality.[11] Small for gestational age is a wellknown risk factor for increased mortality in infants
including those with cardiovascular disease.[11,12]
In our cohort, we also saw a high incidence of late


-----

pulmonary hypertension in small-for-gestational-age
infants with almost 50% developing the disease. The
findings in this study are similar to previous studies
that reported high incidence of late pulmonary
hypertension in infants who are small for gestational
age, have more severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia,
increased length of mechanical ventilation, more days
of ventilation, and require patent ductus arteriosus
ligation during their hospital course.[13]
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia exists as a continuum
of disease within extremely low birth weight infants
and can be graded as mild, moderate, or severe in nature.
The pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension in a
premature neonate with bronchopulmonary dysplasia
includes abnormal muscularisation of pulmonary
vessels and reduction of the alveolar–capillary surface
area.[14] This abnormal pulmonary vasculature remodelling process leads to impairment of gas exchange
and a need for a prolonged oxygen requirement.[15] As
this process may take several months, most extremely
low birth weight infants will not develop significant
pulmonary hypertension until the 3rd or 4th
month of life. This makes early echocardiographic
screening in the first few months of life difficult.[16][–][18]
Therefore, the requirement of high oxygen supplementation early in the clinical course of preterm
infants at day of life 30, irrespective of the severity of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, may be a better screening
tool than echocardiography. At present, in our institution, any extremely low birth weight infant requiring
>30% oxygen at day of life 30 is screened for pulmonary hypertension with a complete echocardiogram.
The echocardiography is repeated every month, if there
is persistent high oxygen requirement.
Very recently, two prospective studies on preterm
infants have found a positive association between
early pulmonary hypertension, diagnosed between
7 and 14 days, and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia;[19,20] one of these studies by
Mourani et al,[19] which prospectively studied 277
premature infants ⩽1250 g, reported 14% prevalence
of late pulmonary hypertension. In their cohort,
screening echocardiography was performed at 7 day
of life (early) and then at corrected gestational age of
36 weeks (late). Of all the infants who were diagnosed
with late pulmonary hypertension at 36 weeks,
around 40% did not show any evidence of pulmonary
vascular disease in the early echocardiography. In the
other study by Mirza et al,[20] which included a cohort
of 120 premature infants of <28 weeks of gestation, the
prevalence of late pulmonary hypertension was
reported as 4%. Interestingly, late pulmonary
hypertension in this cohort was found only in onetenth (10%) of the infants presenting with early
pulmonary hypertension. Although the findings of
both the studies support the hypothesis of early


pulmonary vascular disease contributing to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, their results also demonstrate the
limitations of early echocardiography screening for the
diagnosis of late pulmonary hypertension.
We report a prevalence of 8.3% of late pulmonary
hypertension in this cohort of 230 extremely low
birth weight infants, which is close to the 11.7%
reported by Bhat et al[8] in a previous prospective
study with 140 infants. Although this study is limited by its retrospective design, the hourly recording
of oxygen requirement in an electronic medical
record makes it possible to accurately identify the
average amount of oxygen required on any day and
minimises recall bias. In addition, echocardiography
was only performed when clinically indicated by the
managing neonatal intensive care team; therefore, it
is possible that the overall incidence could have been
higher than that reported in our study, as milder cases
may have been missed and self-resolved.
Although echocardiography is the most commonly
used diagnostic modality to detect pulmonary
hypertension in infants, it has a limited role in the
risk stratification of extremely low birth weight
infants early in their clinical course and has significant cost associated with its utility. We have
shown that the need for oxygen supplementation of
30% or higher on day of life 30 can be used to screen
extremely low birth weight infants at risk of developing late pulmonary hypertension. Identification of
this high-risk sub-group will allow application of
echocardiographic screening to subsequently detect
pulmonary hypertension during the hospital course.
In addition, screening based on supplemental oxygen
requirement is the point-of-care testing, which is
more readily available and is much more cost effective
than echocardiography. We conclude that adjunctive
use of oxygen requirement screening at 30 days of life
will improve the rate of detecting late pulmonary
hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants.
Small for gestational age may further impact the risk
of developing late pulmonary hypertension in these
infants. Further prospective studies are recommended
to further validate this screening tool, in the hopes
that it will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of
infants with pulmonary hypertension.
