||OBJECTIVES: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and the associated complication of pulmonary hypertension (PH) leads to increased mortality and a longer length of stay among survivors. Placental histopathology may give early clues of subsequent events. The objective was to evaluate the relationship of maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU) changes on placental histopathology with subsequent development of BPD-associated PH in a cohort of extremely premature infants. STUDY DESIGN: In a cohort of preterm infants ‘ ⩽28 weeks’ gestational age (GA) and with ‘severe’ BPD, this retrospective study evaluated specific placental histopathological changes and assessed the relationship with subsequent development of PH. ‘Severe’ BPD was defined as the need for ⩾30% oxygen and/or positive pressure ventilation at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Placental and echocardiographic assessments were done by investigators masked to the grouping and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty six infants with severe BPD formed the cohort; PH was noted in 22 (39.3%) infants. The GA of the infants with and without PH was comparable (25.8 ± 1.6 vs 25.8 ± 1.3 weeks, P = 0.9). On placental histopathological examination, 13 (23%) had features of MVU. On univariate logistic regression, the presence of changes consistent with MVU increased the relative risk of subsequent BPD-associated PH by 2.75 (95% confidence interval 1.56 to 4.85, P = 0.004). The significance persisted after adjustment for GA. Stratification by the presence or absence of fetal growth restriction, yielded nonsignificant associations (P = 0.17).

INTRODUCTION
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic
respiratory morbidity in surviving preterm infants, with a reported
incidence of ~ 45% in infants between 22 and 28 weeks
gestational age (GA).[1] In the NICHD Neonatal Research Network,
the incidence is ~ 68% in infants o 29 weeks GA and birthweight
(BW) between 400 and 1500 g.[2] Recent data from Australia and
New Zealand Neonatal Network has noted this to be 54% in
extremely preterm infants (⩽25 weeks GA).[3] Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a known complication of BPD, the incidence increasing
with the severity of BPD and noted in 450% cases.[4,5] This
association also increased the mortality in infants, who had PH for
44 months.[6] Our own data have noted that among infants born
⩽ 28 weeks GA and having ‘severe’ BPD, PH complicated ~ 40% of
them.[7] Early clinical predictors of BPD per se include male gender,
infection, greater ventilator requirements and its association with
patent ductus arteriosus. B-type natriuretic peptide or NT-pro-Btype natriuretic peptide is being increasingly used for evaluation
of PH in BPD.[8] However, B-type natriuretic peptide could be
elevated in the absence of echocardiographic (ECHO) signs of PH
or vice versa, is more a marker of ventricular strain (not specific to
the right ventricle (RV)) and may be elevated in infants with patent
ductus arteriosus. Placental pathologic findings related to
maternal preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction may be early
predictors as chronic placental malperfusion during fetal
development may induce pulmonary vascular remodelling, an
important marker of PH. Maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU)


detrimentally affects the fetus.[9][–][11] Given not all cases of MVU are
accompanied by clinically apparent preeclampsia or extremely
preterm birth may occur before maternal signs are manifest, it is
worth investigating whether MVU could serve as an independent
earlier predictor of BPD and PH. The reduced vessel density and
abnormal vaso-reactivity of the pulmonary vasculature in infants
with BPD provides clues for the development of PH.[12]

BPD is considered a multifactorial disease with involvement of
both antenatal and postnatal risk factors.[13,14] The role of chronic
placental insufficiency as a contributor to BPD pathogenesis is a
relatively understudied pathway.[11] Severe chronic placental
insufficiency in fetal sheep resulted in pulmonary artery endothelial dysfunction, a recognized pathophysiology behind PH.[13]

Mestan et al.[15] noted that placental changes of MVU may identify
BPD infants with increased risk for developing PH. In a 5-year
retrospective study on premature infants ⩽ 28 weeks GA who
developed BPD (a cohort similar to our study), they showed that
placental MVU may identify BPD infants who were exposed to
intrauterine hypoxia ischaemia, which increases their risk for
development of PH disease subsequently. This clinically relevant
information identifies a subset of infants (among a high risk
cohort) who may benefit from individualized management.
This study evaluated the relationship of MVU changes on
placental histopathology with subsequent development of severe
BPD-associated PH in a cohort of extremely premature infants. We
hypothesized that in keeping with the recent literature, a
significant association between placental histopathology and

subsequent development of ‘severe’ BPD-associated PH may be
noticed.

METHODS
This retrospective study was conducted at Monash Children’s Hospital, a
quaternary centre for premature infants from 23 weeks GA onwards.
Annually, ~ 175 infants with BW o1500 g are admitted to the Unit.
Obstetric and neonatal data were collected from the Unit electronic
database. Preterm infant’s ⩽ 28 weeks GA and having ‘severe’ BPD during
the period January 2014 to May 2015 were identified from the Unit’s
electronic database. In infants born o32 weeks GA, Australia and New
Zealand Neonatal Network defines BPD as lung disease with ongoing
requirement for supplemental oxygen therapy or ventilation support
(high-flow oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical
ventilation) at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. Included infants belonged to
the ‘severe’ BPD’ category (need for ⩾ 30% oxygen and/or positive
pressure ventilation at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.[16] Infants with
syndromic associations, surgical thoracic conditions such as congenital
diaphragmatic hernia and congenital heart diseases patent ductus
arteriosus were excluded. Archived ECHO images were evaluated by a
single investigator, masked to the placental changes or grouping. The
infants were divided into two groups; with PH and without PH based on a
priori previously published criteria on ECHO done at 36 weeks’ corrected
GA.[7] Briefly, the parameters studied included tricuspid regurgitation (TR)
jet maximum velocity, patent ductus arteriosus right to left shunt,
pulmonary artery Doppler time velocity relationship, interventricular
septum configuration, TR/velocity time integral (VTI) ratio and left
ventricular systolic eccentricity index (LVsEI).[17][–][22] Presence of any of the
above criteria indicated PH. Placental histopathology examination was
then performed by a histopathologist, masked to the grouping or clinical
outcomes of the infants. Although a descriptive histopathology evaluation
of all the preterm placentas is performed at the Institution, for this
particular cohort, the histopathologist re-examined them, blinded to the
case identity. For the characterization of MVU in this cohort, the criteria
defined by Redline et al.[23] was utilized. The study was approved by the
Institutional Ethics Review Committee.

Statistics
Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t-test and categorical
variables were compared using χ[2]- or Fisher’s exact tests. Univariate
regression analysis was used to determine relative risk and 95% confidence
intervals. Regression model was adjusted for GA. All analyses were
performed using Stata software version 13.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX, USA). Significance was set at two-tailed Po 0.05.

RESULTS
During the study period, 122 infants’ ⩽ 28 weeks GA at birth were
admitted to the Unit. Fifty-six (44%) infants developed ‘severe’
BPD and were included in the study cohort. Table 1 depicts salient
demographics. The GA of infants with and without PH was
comparable. Eleven (19%) of the cohort weighed o 10th centile
and were classified as having fetal growth restriction. Table 2
compares the clinical and demographic features of those with and
without PH. The incidence of maternal preeclampsia trended
higher in the BPD with PH group (P = 0.07). The total duration of
respiratory support in the BPD with PH group was significantly
longer compared with those without (224 ± 130 vs 132 ± 82 days,
P = 0.001). Scans for the assessment of PH were performed in the
infants at 36.7 ± 2 weeks GA. At least one parameter indicative of
PH was noted in 22 infants (multiple in 14/22); the incidence of
BPD-associated PH in the cohort being 22/56 (39.3%). Among the
16 infants with a measurable TR jet, the ratio of TR/VTI from the
right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) was noted to be 0.28 ± 0.03.
Table 3 depicts the distribution of ECHO parameters.
In the 22 infants with ECHO evidence of PH, the GA distribution
was fairly even: ((23to 24 weeks; 7/15 = 46.6%), 25 to 26 weeks;
8/24 = 33.3%) and 27 to 28 weeks; 7/17 (41%)). On placental
histopathological examination masked to the grouping and
clinical outcomes, 13 (23%) had features of MVU (Figure 1). These


included mural fibrinoid necrosis/atherosis, muscularized basal
plate arteries, mural hypertrophy of membrane arterioles,
immature intermediate trophoblast and increased placental site
giant cells. In logistic regression analysis, the presence of changes
consistent with MVU increased the relative risk of subsequent
BPD-associated PH by 2.75 (95% confidence intervals 1.56 to 4.85,
P = 0.004). After adjustment for GA, the association still remained
significant (2.45 (95% confidence intervals 1.43, 5.01), P = 0.002).
Stratification by the presence (7/11) or absence (4/11) of fetal
growth restriction yielded nonsignificant associations (P = 0.17).

DISCUSSION
Information from placental histopathology and biomarkers has
recently been noted as the key to a better understanding of
perinatal diseases pathophysiology. This includes the commonest
respiratory morbidity affecting premature infants, namely BPD. PH
as a complication of ‘severe’ BPD has gained recent recognition,
with implications for survival, duration of stay and overall health
care resources. BPD associated PH is associated with significantly
higher death rates compared with those without PH.[4,5,24,25] This
study noted that specific placental histopathology changes may
hold early clues to the subsequent development of BPDassociated PH in preterm infants. Our findings support the role
of placental histopathology markers as early indicators of BPD

associated PH. Along with providing salient information to the
clinician for postnatal management of these premature infants,
this adds to the growing evidence of the relevance of chronic
placental hypoxia-ischaemia in BPD-associated PH pathogenesis.
Whether the premature infant will develop BPD or not, the
severity of BPD and the association with PH, is not apparent until
several weeks to months after birth. This has guided the search for
tangible histopathological and/or receptor level markers, which
may provide early indications and potentially be helpful in guiding
the medical management principles with the ultimate objective of
minimizing (or preventing) BPD.
The pulmonary outcomes associated with MVU in extremely
preterm infants are poorly understood and/or under-reported. The
characterization of placental lesions seems useful as it has been
previously noted that chronic placental vascular mal-perfusion
may lead to pulmonary vascular remodelling, the hallmark of
subsequent PH disease.[15] Although Redline et al.[23] previously
reported the association between BPD and placental changes
such as fibrinoid necrosis and acute atherosis, the distinction
between BPD with and without PH disease was not made. Role of
placental histopathology in BPD pathophysiology has been
studied in sheep previously. In the presence of chronic fetal
hypoxia, it was shown that utero-placental insufficiency leads to
the classic histologic lung findings of BPD including pulmonary
vascular remodelling.[13] The pathologic vessels were noted to have
small lumens (low capacitance) and thick walls (high resistance).


The pulmonary vascular components of this model closely
resemble the placental histologic description of MVU in human
placenta, indicating the role of fetal stressors in adversely affecting
pulmonary vascular growth. In a recent longitudinal cohort study
on preterm infants, cord blood markers associated with placental
MVU as predictors of BPD-associated PH have been studied.
Reduced cord blood angiogenic factors (especially placental
growth factors and vascular endothelial growth factor-A) were
noted as important predictors of BPD-associated PH. Decreased
levels of these growth factors correlated with increased MVU
severity, indicating the role of delayed feto-placental angiogenesis
in the pathophysiology of BPD-associated PH.[26]

Interestingly, it is possible that the vascular architectural
changes noted on placental histopathology persist during the
post-natal period. Our group has recently examined arterial
structure and biomechanical function in a cohort of preterm
infants with severe BPD, using a cohort of preterm infants without
BPD and a cohort of term infants for comparison. This cohort was
born at ⩽ 28 weeks GA and was evaluated with vascular
ultrasound techniques at 36 weeks corrected GA. The arterial wall
was found to be significantly thicker and stiffer and with reduced
compliance in the infants with BPD, the significance persisting
after adjustment for GA and BW separately as well as combined.[27]

This is very similar to pulmonary arterial stiffness, which has
immense prognostic value in those affected by PH.[28,29] A key
implication of these observations is that information from the

vasculature, when used as a measure of cardiovascular risk, may
possibly identify novel therapeutic approaches, which may be
useful to prevent the onset or progression of PH.[30]

We assessed multiple, pre-defined and previously well studied
objective ECHO criteria. Two of them are more recent and merit
further discussion. The lack of standardization assigned to ECHO
definitions, subjectivity of some parameters such as right heart
dilatation, the lack of universal presence of TR on ECHO and a
rotated heart affect the sensitivity and identification of PH.
Investigators have suggested that a TR jet maximal velocity
⩽ 2.8 m s [−] [1] in the absence of an additional variable would
indicate an unlikely diagnosis of PH.[17] The ratio of TR to VTI-RVOT
has been a well-studied parameter in the paediatric population.
Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is calculated invasively by the
ratio of trans-pulmonary pressure gradient (Δ p) to transpulmonary flow (Qp).[31] Thus, TR jet velocity and VTI-RVOT have
been proposed as correlates of Δ p and Qp, respectively.[32,33] As
the PVR increases, changes in VTI-RVOT and TR jet velocity tend to
occur in the opposite direction.[32,34] Multiple studies have noted a
strong correlation between ECHO-derived TR/VTI-RVOT and
catheter-measured PVR. Among paediatric patients, Ajami
et al.[35] noted a good correlation with catheter measured PVR
(r[2] = 0.53, P = 0.008) with sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 90%
for PVR 46 Woods Units. Vlahos et al.[36] also noted a similar
significant correlation (r[2] = 0.71), indicating its usefulness in
longitudinal tracking these cohorts. In a prospective observational
study on children with mean age of 9.7 years, this ECHO-derived
ratio correlated well with catheter measured PVR (r = 0.89,
confidence intervals 0.81 to 0.94, P o 0.001). For a PVR of 6 WU,
a TR/VTI-RVOT value of 0.14 provided a sensitivity of 96.6% and
specificity of 92.8%.[22] We used this cut-off for our study purpose.
The LVsEI is measured in two dimensions from the parasternal
short axis view at the mid-papillary muscle level. A ratio of D1/D2
is calculated where D1 is the diameter of the ventricle parallel to
the inter-ventricular septum, whereas D2 is the diameter
perpendicular to and bisecting septum. It basically measures
septal displacement. Normally, the left ventricle is circular; the
increased RV pressure shifts the septum to the left, giving the left
ventricle a characteristic D-shape. A pressure-loaded RV will
deviate the septum in systole, reducing the denominator.[37]

Normal LVsEI is 1; it increases in PH, allowing for quantification
of a more subjective parameter of septal flattening/bowing. In
neonates, systolic septal flattening is recognized at LVsEI ⩾ 1.15,
whereas greater than half-systemic RV pressure becomes apparent
at LVsEI ⩾ 1.3. Unlike qualitative assessment of septal flattening,
this has a high inter-observer agreement.[21]

Important limitations of this study include its retrospective
nature and relatively small numbers. Masked review of placental
slides and review by a single perinatal pathologist are among its
strengths. This is a single-centre study, and a multicentre study
with larger numbers is better placed to further add to this growing
body of literature.
We demonstrated a significant association between MVU
placental changes and subsequent BPD-associated PH. Given the
vascular pathophysiology seems to persist as noted on postnatal
vascular ultrasound studies, this seems an important mechanistic
link leading to cardiopulmonary disease in early childhood. Early
disease predictors may aid preventive strategies in selected
populations. These may take the shape of clinical features,
radiological findings or laboratory-based test markers that may
be useful for early diagnosis, predicting disease severity and aid in
the monitoring of disease processes and/or response to therapy.
Early initiation of therapies during ‘windows of opportunity’ or a
non-detection of risk may enable the avoidance of therapies and
their potential hazards.[38] Hence, the real potential of this work lies
in the exciting possibility of identifying subsets of infants at
increased risk of BPD-associated PH. Whether this early identification will inform individualized management strategies or use of


specific agents such as pulmonary vasodilatory and vascular
growth agents needs to be studied prospectively.
