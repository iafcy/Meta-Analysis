||OBJECTIVE: To assess whether mortality in patients with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, defined as ⩾28 days of oxygen exposure with lung disease) is independently associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Single institution retrospective birth cohort of preterm infants with gestational age (GA) 230/7 to 366/7 weeks, and evolving BPD delivered between 2001 and 2014.

INTRODUCTION
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) contributes to significant
morbidity and mortality in preterm infants, impacting ~ 10 000–
15 000 infants annually in the United States alone.[1] Pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH), a cardiovascular complication of
abnormal vascular growth, occurs in 25–38%[2][–][6] of preterm infants
with BPD and is associated with a four- to fivefold increase in odds
of mortality.[3,7]

There are relatively few studies describing outcomes in patients
with PAH who undergo surgery. In adults undergoing major joint
replacement surgery, PAH is associated with a fourfold increase in
mortality.[8] For patients with PAH, there must be careful titration of
anesthetic medications and maintenance of hemodynamic
stability to prevent worsening of PAH in the perioperative
period.[9][–][12] A referral pulmonary hypertension program reported
that among pediatric patients undergoing non-cardiac surgical
procedures, the odds of major perioperative complications
increased by a factor of 8 in association with baseline
suprasystemic PAH.[13]

Preterm infants are at increased risk of poor outcomes when
major surgery is performed. Morriss et al. classified surgery into
major surgery (presumed general anesthesia) and minor surgery
(presumed non general anesthesia) in a cohort of very low birth
weight infants in the National Institutes of Child Health and
Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network. They


found increased adjusted odds of death or neurodevelopmental
impairment in all surgery patients and in the subgroup of major
surgery patients, but not in the subgroup of minor surgery.[14]

However, a retrospective series of 22 infants with severe BPD
undergoing anti-gastroesophageal reflux surgery in a single center
described that all of the patients survived the procedure; 18 of
these patients had PAH.[15]

Owing to the scarcity of data on mortality after surgery in
preterm patients with BPD and PAH, we sought to assess whether
mortality in patients with evolving BPD is independently
associated with PAH and with surgery.

METHODS
Design
This was a retrospective birth cohort study of preterm infants with
gestational age (GA) 23[0/7] to 36[6/7] weeks and evolving BPD (defined as
⩾ 28 days of oxygen exposure with lung disease) delivered between 1 May
2001 and 31 December 2014 at Parkland Memorial Hospital (PMH) in
Dallas, TX, USA. We chose 1 May, 2001 as a starting date for this study,
because 30 April, 2001 was our latest day of recruitment for the NICHD
Preemie Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study, a trial that examined the effectiveness
of inhaled nitric oxide as a therapy for severe respiratory failure in
premature infants.[16] This trial increased awareness of PAH and utilization
of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment modality. The study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board at University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center and a waiver of consent was granted.

Study population
The study population included all preterm infants with gestational age
(GA) 23[0/7] to 36[6/7] weeks and evolving BPD. Exclusion criteria were: critical
congenital heart disease,[17] pulmonary vein stenosis diagnosed prior to the
first surgery, severe congenital anomalies and persistent pulmonary
hypertension (PPHN). Patients with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),
ventricular septal defect or atrial septal defect were not excluded from
the study. Potential patients for this study were identified by searching the
PMH prospective neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) database.

Classification
Infants were classified into three groups on the basis of surgery after
28 days: no surgery, minor surgery and major surgery, based on the most
severe surgery, according to criteria published by Morriss et al.[14]

Presence of PAH was assessed after 28 days of life for patients who did
not have surgery, or within a perioperative window of 1 month prior to or
2 weeks post surgery. To confirm the diagnosis of PAH, available
echocardiograms or echocardiogram reports were reviewed by a pediatric
cardiologist (CR), who was unaware of the clinical condition. Patients were
classified as:

1) Confirmed PAH, based on one or more of the following:

(a) Echocardiogram diagnosis based on the classification defined by
Mourani et al.,[18] in which PAH is defined by any of the following:
estimated right ventricular systolic pressure 440 mm Hg; ratio of
right ventricular systolic pressure to systemic systolic blood
pressure 40.5; any cardiac shunt with bidirectional or right-to-left
flow; any degree of ventricular septal wall flattening;
(b) Improvement of oxygen saturation by at least 30% with treatment
(increased oxygen administration, inhaled nitric oxide, or
vasodilators such as Sildenafil or Bosentan).

2) Comparison Group (without confirmed PAH):

(a) Patients with clinical diagnosis or suspicion of PAH but not
confirmed by echocardiogram or response to treatment as
described above;
(b) Patients with no documented clinical diagnosis or suspicion
of PAH.

Variables
The primary outcome variable was death prior to discharge from the initial
hospitalization, irrespective of whether the infant was discharged from
PMH or from the adjacent referral children’s hospital, Children’s Medical
Center Dallas.


Variables collected from the NICU database included: PAH, GA, birth
weight, ethnicity, gender, 5-min Apgar score, administration of antenatal
steroids before delivery, congestive heart failure, administration of
indomethacin for PDA, administration of postnatal systemic steroids for
treatment of BPD, culture proven sepsis, culture proven meningitis,
necrotizing enterocolitis stage II or greater (NEC), seizures confirmed by
electroencephalogram, type and dates of surgical interventions and
congenital malformations.
Medical records were reviewed for all patients suspected of having PAH
from the NICU database, to collect information on timing of diagnosis, to
determine if temporal variables (that is, sepsis, meningitis, NEC, seizures)
were present in the perioperative window described above, and to
determine the type of anesthesia used for surgery. In addition, medical
records were reviewed in all infants for whom malformation severity was
not clearly defined.

Statistical analysis
The primary outcome was assessed by stepwise logistic regression to
adjust for confounding variables that were present at 28 days. To avoid
collinearity with GA, birth weight was converted to birth weight Z-score for
GA and gender (using tables from Olsen et al.[19]). Other analyses included
χ[2] analysis, Fisher’s exact test, Student’s t-test, Mann–Whitney test, and
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. We used SPSS version 23 (IBM Corporation)
and considered two-tailed tests with P-values o0.05 as statistically
significant.

Sample size analysis
Sample size was calculated based on 10% surgical mortality among
preterm infants[20] and an estimated PAH-associated odds ratio (OR) of
mortality of 4–5 compared with preterm infants without PAH.[3,7] We
estimated that we would require a sample size of at 144 patients
(assuming that 20% of the patients would have PAH), or 240 patients
(assuming that 10% would have PAH), to have a two-sided alpha of 0.05
and 80% power to detect an OR of 5, and 214 and 350 patients,
respectively, to detect an OR of 4.
On the basis of preliminary data from the NICU database, we estimated
we would need to collect data over 10–15 years. For multivariate analysis
we limited the number of variables in the final model to one per 10
patients who died before discharge; as 33 patients died, only three
variables were included. Stepwise logistic regression was used to select the
most significant variables among all variables that were present at 28 days.
Interaction was tested using an additive model comparing patients with
PAH who underwent major surgery, those without PAH who underwent
surgery and those with PAH who did not undergo surgery with the
controls, who had no PAH and did not undergo surgery.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
The NICU database identified 604 patients with evolving BPD
(Figure 1). Twenty-seven patients were excluded: one with
pulmonary vein stenosis prior to surgery, sixteen with severe
congenital malformations and ten with PPHN. Thus, the study
population included 577 preterm infants with evolving BPD, of
whom 227 had major surgery, 83 had minor surgery and 267 had
no surgery (Figure 1). Among 577 patients with evolving BPD, 33
(6%) died prior to discharge. Mortality was higher (Po 0.05) in
those with major surgery (9.7%), but not in those with minor
surgery (0%), in comparison with those who did not have surgery
(4.1%). Therefore, we combined those with no surgery and those
with minor surgery in further analyses. Supplementary Table 2
describes the frequency of surgical procedures in the population.
Table 1 shows the neonatal characteristics of BPD patients.
Eighteen patients had confirmed PAH. Patients with confirmed
PAH were less likely to be Hispanics, had lower birth weight Zscores, and had longer duration of mechanical ventilation and
higher frequency of postnatal steroids for BPD and of surgery than
controls (Table 1). Confirmed PAH was more frequent in patients
born at 33–36 weeks (2/9, 22%) than in those born at 23–28 weeks
GA (13/481, 3%), and those born at 29–32 weeks (3/87, 3%)
(P o 0.05). The majority (15/18) of patients were diagnosed using
echocardiographic criteria, though three patients were diagnosed
based on a significant response to PAH treatment. The result of
the echocardiogram review was consistent with chart review for
diagnosis of PAH, with the exception of one patient with whom
there was subjective difference in interpretation of septal
flattening, who was nonetheless treated clinically as PAH based
on real time echocardiogram interpretation and therefore
classified as confirmed PAH.
Among patients who underwent major surgery, mortality was
4/14 (29%) among those with PAH and 18/213 (8%) among those
without PAH (Figure 1). Among those who had no surgery or
minor surgery, mortality was 1/4 (25%) among those with PAH
and 10/346 (3%) among those without PAH. Mortality decreased
with gestational age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.69; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 0.55, 0.87), birth weight Z-score (aOR:
0.69, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.996) and increased with PAH (aOR: 30, 95% CI:


2.1, 415), major surgery (aOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 6.3) and both PAH
and major surgery (aOR: 10.3, 95% CI: 2.5, 42.1).

DISCUSSION
The major finding of our study is that mortality in patients with
evolving BPD, adjusted for GA and birth weight Z-score, is
associated with PAH and with major surgery. We found no
evidence for interaction between PAH and surgery. Mortality of
patients undergoing minor surgery was not significantly different
from those who did not undergo surgery.
Our results are consistent with several recent publications that
demonstrate an increased mortality in association either with
major surgery[14] or with PAH in this population.[2][–][4,7,21,22]

Strengths of our study include a birth cohort design; the use of
a prospective, validated database; well-defined echocardiographic
criteria for PAH, confirmed by study cardiologist for most patients
and chart review in all those with PAH. The latter was essential to
differentiate PPHN from PAH that develops with chronic lung
disease; patients with PPHN were excluded from the study. As the
pathogenesis of PPHN differs from that of PAH,[23] we felt that it
was important to separate these two entities and focus specifically
on PAH that develops with chronic lung disease.
Limitations of this study include retrospective design, single site
study, small sample size and lack of a prospective protocol to
diagnose PAH in BPD patients. Small sample size prevented
adjustment for all possible confounding variables (including
maternal pre-eclampsia, asthma or smoking and severity of
BPD). It is possible that the difference in mortality between the
PAH and comparison groups could be in part related to increased
BPD severity in patients with PAH, suggested by the longer
duration of mechanical ventilation and higher percentage of those
who received systemic steroids for BPD. We were unable to
classify BPD by severity because the study started in 2001, before
implementation of the physiologic definition of BPD and of the
NIH consensus definition of BPD. Our NICU has never used welldefined criteria for diagnosis of PAH, nor a systematic protocol of
serial echocardiograms to detect PAH in patients with BPD.
Application of strict echocardiographic criteria for PAH for this
study was limited to interpretation of previously interpreted
echocardiogram reports. When images were available, clarification
was provided from a pediatric cardiologist (CR), however, the only

patients that were reviewed were those suspected of PAH
from the NICU database; therefore, it is possible that we have
missed patients with PAH or details about patients in the
comparison group.
A recent report from the American Heart Association and
American Thoracic Society recommends screening infants with
established BPD for PAH as well as serial echocardiograms to
monitor response to PAH-targeted therapy.[24] Both Nagiub et al.,[25]

and Mourani et al.,[18] describe algorithms for diagnosing PAH noninvasively via echocardiograms that would be worthy of further
study. Furthermore, the Mourani study[18] and a recent study by
Bhat et al.,[21] prospectively studied PAH in preterm infants, yet
neither of these studies address the common issue of surgery in
this population.
We conclude that mortality in patients with evolving BPD,
adjusted for GA and birth weight Z-score, is associated with PAH
and with major surgery. Larger, prospective studies with a
systematic protocol for serial echocardiograms and a rigorous
definition of PAH are needed to further elucidate whether
mortality among preterm infants with BPD is affected by an
interaction between surgery and PAH.
