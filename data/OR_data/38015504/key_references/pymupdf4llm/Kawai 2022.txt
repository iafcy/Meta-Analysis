Abstract Background: The incidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
has not been investigated in regional cohorts. The aim of this study was to clarify the incidence of PH associated
with BPD in all very low birthweight infants (VLBWIs) born during the study period in Aichi Prefecture, Japan.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of all VLBWIs born in Aichi Prefecture. The
inclusion criteria were VLB, birth between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2015, and admission to any neonatal
intensive care unit in Aichi Prefecture. BPD28d and BPD36w were defined as the need for supplemental oxygen or
any respiratory support at 28 days of age or 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA). The primary outcome was the
incidence of PH after 36 weeks’ PMA (PH36w) in VLBWIs with BPD28d and BPD36w. The secondary outcomes
were the clinical factors related to PH36w in BPD36w patients. Mann–Whitney U-test and Fisher’s exact test were
used for univariate analysis. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. Risk ratio (RR) and
95% confidence interval (CI) were also evaluated.
Results: A total of 441 patients were analyzed. A total of 217 and 131 patients met the definition of BPD28d and
BPD36w, respectively. Nine patients were diagnosed with PH36w (4.2% and 6.9% of the BPD28d and BPD36w
patients, respectively). The presence of oligohydramnios (RR, 2.71; 95% CI: 1.55–4.73, P = 0.014) and sepsis (RR,
3.62; 95% CI: 1.51–8.63, P = 0.025) was significant in the PH36w patients.
Conclusions: The incidence of PH36w was 4.2% and 6.9% in the BPD28d and BPD36w patients, respectively.
Oligohydramnios and sepsis were significantly associated with PH36w in VLBWIs.

The mortality of very low birthweight infants (VLBWIs) has
recently improved with the recent advances in intensive
neonatal management.[1,2] However, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains one of the most severe problems for
VLBWIs because it is associated with high mortality and neurodevelopmental impairment.[3][–][5] According to the Neonatal
Research Network of Japan (NRNJ) database, the incidence of


-----

BPD at 28 days of age in VLBWIs increased from 27.7% in
2005 to 41.6% in 2014.[6] In addition, pulmonary hypertension
(PH) associated with BPD is considered important, because
more severe preterm newborns have been saved by the recent
advanced intensive neonatal management.[7][–][9] There have been
some studies about PH associated with BPD, but they were
based on patient data from a single or small number of institutions.[4,10][–][15] To determine the actual incidence of PH associated with BPD in VLBWIs, a cohort survey is needed.
In Aichi Prefecture, Japan, there are approximately 65 000
births each year. Almost all VLBWIs born in Aichi Prefecture
are hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of
the Tokai Neo Forum, which includes all hospitals with
NICUs in Aichi Prefecture. A cohort survey of VLBWIs with
BPD admitted to NICUs in the Tokai Neo Forum might contribute to our knowledge of the incidence of PH associated
with BPD in more detail. By understanding the background of
PH associated with BPD in detail, an appropriate management
strategy to prevent it might be established. Thus, we conducted this study to clarify the incidence of PH associated
with BPD in all VLBWIs born during the study period in
Aichi Prefecture.

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of all
VLBWIs born in Aichi Prefecture. The inclusion criteria of
this study consisted of VLB, birth between 1 January 2015
and 31 December 2015, and admission to NICUs of the Tokai
Neo Forum. To exclude factors other than BPD that could
affect PH, we excluded VLBWIs with obvious chromosomal
or other congenital anomalies.
In the survey we investigated gestational age (GA) in
weeks and days, birthweight (BW) in grams, sex, small for
gestational age (SGA; defined as birthweight below the 10th
percentile for GA in the Japanese population),[16] oligohydramnios, preterm rupture of membranes (PROM), prenatal maternal steroids, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), IVH grade
≥3,[17] periventricular leukomalacia (PVL),[18] retinopathy of
prematurity (ROP) stage ≥3,[19] auditory screening test failure,
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),[20] survival at 28 days of age,
and BPD28d (defined as the requirement of oxygen or respiratory supportive therapy, including nasal high-flow therapy

[NHF], at 28 days of age), for each VLBWI. If BPD28d was
present we investigated serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M level
(mg/dL) at admission, clinical or histological chorioamnionitis
(cCAM or hCAM), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS),
pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage, sepsis, Japanese BPD
classification based on the presence or absence of RDS,
intrauterine infection/inflammation, and chest X-ray findings
(Table 1),[21,22] postmenstrual age (PMA) at termination of
mechanical ventilation (MV) in weeks, PMA at termination of
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or NHF in
weeks, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) use up to 7 days after birth,
use of indomethacin for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),

surgical treatment for PDA, BPD36w (defined as oxygen use
or any respiratory supportive therapy, including NHF, at
36 weeks’ PMA), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at
36 weeks’ PMA, steroid therapy for BPD28d, respiratory care
after discharge or at the investigation, and PH36w (defined as
PH after 36 weeks’ PMA). We also queried which parameter
was used for the echocardiographic diagnosis of PH. The
queried parameters included tricuspid regurgitation (TR)
velocity, systolic flattening of interventricular septum (IVS),
ratio of acceleration time to ejection time (AT/ET) of pulmonary artery (PA) flow, right ventricular (RV) wall thickness
and PH score. The PH score consists of seven items: ratio of
the diameter of the aortic valve to the diameter of the PA
valve, ratio of the diameter of the mitral valve to the diameter
of the tricuspid valve, thickness of the RV anterior wall at
end-diastole and at end-systole, ratio of the length of the left
ventricular major axis to minor axis at end-systole on left
ventricular short axis view, RV systolic time interval, and
AT/ET of PA flow. Each item was scored from 0 to 2 and
the total score of all items was evaluated. A total score of 0–
1 was defined as no PH, a total score of 2–4 was defined as
mild PH, a total score of 5–8 was defined as moderate PH,
and a total score of ≥9 was defined as severe PH.[23] Additionally, respiratory therapy and vasodilation agents used for
PH36w were investigated. Oxygen therapy, MV and NIPPV
or NHF were included as types of respiratory therapy. As
vasodilation agents, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil), endothelin antagonists (bosentan,
ambrisentan and macitentan), prostacyclin derivatives (epoprostenol, beraprost and treprostinil), and iNO were investigated.
The primary outcome measure of this study was the incidence of PH36w in VLBWIs with BPD28d and BPD36w. The
secondary outcome measures were the clinical factors related
to PH36w in BPD36w patients. To identify clinical factors
predicting PH36w in BPD36w patients, we compared clinical
factors in the PH36w and non-PH36w patients. All statistical
analyses were performed with EZR version 1.31. Mann–Whitney U-test and Fisher’s exact test were used for univariate
analysis. Logistic regression analysis was planned for multivariate analysis. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI) were also evaluated. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.

### Results


Survey responses were obtained from all 20 facilities in the
Tokai Neo Forum. One institution had no admission of
VLBWIs. From the 19 other institutions, 468 VLBWIs were
included and 27 were excluded. The excluded patients consisted of one patient with atrial septal defect, one patient with
ventricular septal defect, four patients lost to follow-up due to
transfer to hospitals outside of Aichi Prefecture, and 21
patients who died before the age of 28 days. Of the 441
patients included in the analysis, 217 met the definition of
BPD28d (49.2%: 95% CI: 44.4–54.0%). Of the 217 BPDd28
patients, one died before 36 weeks’ PMA and 131 patients
were classified as having BPD36w. Of the 131 BPD36w
patients, nine patients were further classified as having
PH36w. There were no PH36w patients in the group of 85
patients who did not have BPD36w (Fig. 1). The characteristics of all included VLBWIs, BPD28d, non-BPD28d and
BPD36w patients are listed in Table 2.

patients


8.634, P = 0.025) between the PH36w and non-PH36w
patients. Multivariate analysis was not possible because of the
small number of PH36w patients (Table 3).

Comparison of characteristics between PH36w and nonPH36w patients


The PMA at termination of MV was not significantly different
between PH36w and non-PH36w patients, but the PMA at termination of NIPPV or NHF was significantly longer in
PH36w patients. The frequency of any grade of IVH, IVH
grade ≥3, PVL and ROP stage ≥3 was not significantly different between the two groups of patients. The composite outcome of respiratory care at the investigation or death after
36 weeks’ PMA was significantly more common in the
PH36w patients (Table 3, P < 0.001).

Characteristics of PH36w patients


The incidence of PH36w in VLBWIs, BPD28d patients (excluding one patient who died before 36 weeks’ PMA), and
BPD36w patients was 0.020 (95% CI: 0.009–0.038), 0.042
(95% CI: 0.019–0.078) and 0.069 (95% CI: 0.032–0.126),
respectively.

Perinatal factors related to PH36w in BPD36w patients


PH36w patients were reported from five institutes. PH was
diagnosed on echocardiography in all cases (Table 4). The
findings of TR velocity, systolic flattening of IVS and PH
score were used in five of the nine PH36w patients for PH
diagnosis. All patients with systolic flattening of IVS were
given a pulmonary vasodilator. At the time of investigation,
two patients died, four patients were receiving home oxygen
therapy, one patient discharged without any home care and
two patients continued hospitalization with NIPPV.

### Discussion


On univariate analysis a significant difference was seen in the
presence of oligohydramnios (RR 2.711; 95% CI: 1.554–
4.731, P = 0.014) and sepsis (RR 3.615; 95% CI: 1.513–


This cohort survey is the first regional survey to include all
VLBWIs during the survey period, allowing for estimation of
the incidence of PH36w in VLBWIs with BPD28d and
BPD36w. During the survey period, there were 65 615 births
in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, of which 492 involved VLBWIs
according to the vital statistics records of Aichi Prefecture.[24]

By contrast, this survey included 468 VLBWIs before exclusion criteria were applied. The discrepancy between the prefectural vital statistics records and the number of VLBWIs in
our survey might reflect the number of VLBWIs whose
address was given as being in Aichi Prefecture but who were
born in other prefectures, or whose address was given as being
in other prefectures but who were born in Aichi Prefecture.
This study has some limitations. First, there was no standardized protocol for screening echocardiography to identify
PH associated with BPD, due to the retrospective nature of the
study. The pediatric PH guidelines endorsed by the American
Heart Association and American Thoracic Society recommending screening echocardiography for PH in premature
infants with moderate to severe BPD were published in 2015.
Almost all institutions included in this study did not have


protocols to perform screening echocardiography for PH in
BPD36w patients. Thus, mild PH in BPD36w patients might
have been missed, leading to an underestimation of the incidence of PH36w in BPD36w patients. Altit et al. reported that
only 38% of institutions had screening protocols for PH associated with BPD according to an electronic survey conducted
in 2017.[25] However, circulatory management strategies that
included echocardiographic assessment were found to be commonly used by Japanese neonatologists in a national survey
about circulatory management for extremely low birthweight
infants in 2011. That study showed that echocardiography was
performed by neonatologist in all NICUs.[26] Thus, because
echocardiographic assessment has been shown to be common
in the NICUs, we assumed that evaluation for PH was performed in all units in this study when physicians in the

institutions considered that a close examination of PH was
necessary.
Second, there was no standardized protocol to clarify BPD
severity in this survey, such as the oxygen reduction test.[27,28]

The definition of BPD36w in this study included any respiratory supportive therapy at 36 weeks’ PMA. Respiratory therapy decisions were based on the judgment of each attending
physician. However, changes in neonatal respiratory support
such as mild respiratory care with NHF made many infants
unclassifiable based on current BPD definitions.[2,29,30] With
that in mind, we believe that this study was able to evaluate
the incidence of BPD as of 2015.
Regarding the incidence of BPD28d and BPD36w in
VLBWIs in this study, the incidence of BPD28d was slightly
higher in this survey than that according to the NRNJ database


in 2014[6] (49.2% vs 41.6%), but the incidence of BPD36w was
similar (29.5% vs 29.6%). This means that the BPD severity
in the present survey was similar to the BPD severity in the
patients included in the NRNJ database. This survey may
show the relationship between severe BPD and PH secondary
to BPD in Japan.
By contrast, the incidence of PH36w with BPD28d in this
cohort of VLBWIs, 4.2%, was lower than the 21.7% reported by
Sun et al. in a single-institution study with almost the same
inclusion criteria.[13] Similarly, Sheth et al. reported that the incidence of PH associated with BPD was 26.8% in patients with
GA <32 weeks at birth and BW <1,500 g in a single-institution
study.[8] The definition of BPD36w in the present study was
almost the same as the definition of moderate to severe BPD
used by the National Institute of Child Health and Human

Development in 2001.[31] The incidence of PH36w associated
with BPD36w, defined as moderate to severe BPD in the present
cohort, was 6.9% and lower than the previously reported


incidence from several single-institution studies (22.0%,[14]

27.6%[10] and 28.3%[7]) in which inclusion criteria included GA
<28 weeks, <32 weeks, and <29 weeks, respectively. If the


-----

present patients were limited to those with GA <28 weeks, there
would have been 88 BPD36w patients and eight PH36w
patients, and the incidence of PH associated with moderate to
severe BPD would still have been low, at 9.1% in this setting.
One of the factors that led to a low incidence of PH36w
with BPD36w in this study is the Japanese respiratory strategy, which tolerates relatively high oxygen saturation (SpO2)
levels. A 2015 national survey of BPD management in Japan
found that 54% of units set the upper SpO2 limit at 95% or
more after BPD is diagnosed.[6] This might have been due to
the fact that low SpO2 levels have been shown to be associated with high mortality rates and respiratory complications
such as PH.[30,31] As already noted, there was no standardized
protocol to screen for PH associated with BPD with echocardiography in this study. Thus, our study might have overlooked mild PH and included only moderate to severe
symptomatic PH associated with BPD in the estimation. Du
et al. reported that the number of patients with mild PH was
threefold higher than the number of patients with moderate to
severe PH in their study.[12] They also noted that patients with
moderate to severe PH accounted for an estimated 5.9% of all
patients, similar to the present results.
With regard to the clinical factors associated with PH36w
in BPD36w patients, oligohydramnios and sepsis were found
to be significant in the present study. Oligohydramnios has
been reported as a significant risk factor for PH associated
with BPD because of its inhibitive effect on lung development.[32] It is considered that the hypoplastic lung may have
elevated pulmonary vascular resistance due to maldevelopment
including a decrease in the cross-sectional area and abnormal
muscularization of the pulmonary vasculature.[33][–][35] In contrast,
An et al. reported that infection during hospitalization is
related to PH associated with BPD.[4] In BPD, structural abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature might cause vessel narrowing and decreased vascular compliance. Decreased
angiogenesis as a consequence of BPD might contribute to the
smaller vascular cross-sectional area. These factors contribute
to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. In addition, pulmonary vasculogenesis has been shown to be disturbed in a
postnatal sepsis model.[36][–][41] Although SGA has been found to
be related to PH associated with BPD[32], a significant association with SGA was not found in the present study. As mentioned earlier, it is possible that cases of mild PH might have
been overlooked in the present study. In addition, we were not
able to perform multivariate analysis because there were too
few PH36w patients.
In conclusion, the incidence of PH36w was 4.2% and 6.9%
in VLBWIs with BPD28d and BPD36w, respectively, and the
presence of oligohydramnios and sepsis was significant in
BPD36w patients with PH36w. This study evaluated the
prevalence of PH36w associated with BPD36w in a regional
birth cohort without a definitive PH screening protocol. The
prevalence of PH36w associated with BPD36w in this study
might reflect the prevalence of moderate to severe PH.
Although additional studies with more subjects and an


established protocol for PH screening are warranted, the present findings imply that VLBWIs with BPD36w, especially
when combined with oligohydramnios and sepsis, might need
screening for PH.
