### Abstract


**Background: To determine whether prolonged exposure to a moderate/large patent ductus**
arteriosus left-to-right shunt (PDA) increases the risk of late (beyond 36 weeks) pulmonary
hypertension (BPD-PH) and pulmonary vascular disease (BPD-PVD) during the neonatal
hospitalization in preterm infants (<28 weeks’ gestation) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(BPD).

**Methods: All infants requiring respiratory support ≥36 weeks had systematic echocardiographic**
evaluations for BPD-PH at planned intervals. Infants were classified as having either flowassociated BPD-PH (BPD-flow-PH) or BPD-PVD.


**Results: 256 infants survived ≥36 weeks: 105 had NO BPD (were off respiratory support by 36**
weeks); 151 had BPD. 22/151 had BPD-PH (12/22 had BPD-flow-PH from a PDA that persisted
beyond 36 weeks; 10/22 had BPD-PVD). Moderate/large PDA shunts that persisted beyond 36
weeks were significantly associated with an increased incidence of BPD-PH due to BPD-flow-PH.
We found no association between the duration of PDA exposure and the incidence of BPD-PVD.


**Conclusion: Moderate/large PDA shunts increase the risk of flow-associated BPD-PH when**
present beyond 36 weeks. Although term infants with PDA-congenital heart disease can

develop pulmonary vascular remodeling and PVD after months of PDA exposure, we found
no echocardiographic evidence in preterm infants that prolonged PDA exposure increases the
incidence of BPD-PVD during the neonatal hospitalization.


### Introduction:

Preterm infants delivered at <28 weeks’ gestation have a high incidence of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), defined by the amount of respiratory support they
need beyond 36 weeks’ post menstrual age (PMA) [(1-4)]. In addition to the alterations in
respiratory compliance and airway resistance that accompany BPD, a subset of infants
will develop pulmonary artery hypertension (PH) as a comorbidity that persists beyond 36
weeks. Infants with BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) have a substantially
increased risk of morbidity and mortality [(5, 6)].


The factors responsible for the elevated pulmonary vascular pressures in infants with
BPD-PH are usually unknown. Since pulmonary blood pressure is related to blood flow
and vascular resistance through the equation Pressure = Flow x Resistance, most cases of
BPD-PH can be grouped into two broad categories: 1) increased pulmonary blood flow
(Flow-associated PH) (e.g., left-to-right flow through shunts like the patent ductus arteriosus
(PDA) or ventricular septal defect (VSD)), and 2) increased pulmonary vascular resistance
or obstruction (e.g., pulmonary vascular diseases/disorders (PVD) like altered vasoreactivity,
vascular injury, remodeling, maldevelopment, or pulmonary venous obstruction).

Distinguishing between the two broad categories is important since flow-associated PH
can usually be eliminated when the shunt is closed, whereas PVD and abnormal vascular
growth appear to be more persistent and may contribute to impaired alveolar development
and parenchymal lung disease. Although the development of PVD was initially attributed
to the severity of an infant’s lung disease [(7)], there is increasing evidence to suggest that
additional risk factors, including those that predate birth, contribute to the development of
BPD-associated PVD [(8-10)].


Several risk factors for BPD-PH have been consistently identified in observational studies
and their meta-analyses [(11-13)]. BPD-PH is most frequently seen in infants with the
most severe grades of BPD and those who are small for gestational age (SGA). Other
consistently observed postnatal risk factors include the duration of invasive ventilation,
severe retinopathy of prematurity (sROP), and the presence of a persistent PDA [(13)].

We were particularly interested in examining how prolonged exposure to a persistent PDA
might be associated with the development of BPD-PH in preterm infants. A moderate/large
PDA L-R shunt can produce both flow-associated PH and PVD. The initial increased L-R
flow through the PDA shunt causes an acute hydraulic increase in pulmonary blood pressure
(14, 15). In addition, direct transmission of systemic blood pressures through the shunt to
the pulmonary circulation adds to the flow associated PH. Over time prolonged exposure
of the pulmonary circulation to the shunt’s high pressures and flow will cause pulmonary
vascular remodeling and the development of PVD of varying severity. In term infants with
PDA-congenital heart disease months of prolonged PDA exposure can cause irreversible

PVD and right-to-left ductal shunting (with Eisenmenger physiology being the most extreme
end of the spectrum) [(16, 17)].

We hypothesized that extremely preterm infants might be particularly vulnerable to the
effects of a persistent left-to-right PDA shunt on pulmonary vascular remodeling. We
designed the following observational study to examine the relationship between different
durations of exposure to moderate/large, left-to-right PDA shunts and the outcomes BPDPH, flow-associated PH, and BPD-associated PVD (BPD-PVD) beyond 36 weeks’ PMA.
We hypothesized that increasing durations of exposure to a moderate/large PDA shunt would
accelerate the rate of PVD development and increase the rate of BPD-PVD beyond 36
weeks’ PMA in infants born before 28 weeks’ gestation.


### Methods:

**Patient Population:**


The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California
San Francisco. The requirement for individual Research HIPAA Authorization was waived
by the Institutional Review Board. Infants were included in the study population if they
delivered before 28[0/7] weeks’ gestation, were admitted to the intensive care nursery within
24 hours of birth between January 2012 and September 2022 and survived beyond 36
weeks’ PMA. A single neonatologist (RIC) recorded all the demographic factors and
outcome measures prospectively and reviewed the PDA-focused echocardiograms with
the attending cardiologists. A single echo-cardiologist (HN) reviewed the PH focused
echocardiograms. Detailed descriptions of our approach to respiratory and hemodynamic
support have been previously published [(18)].


**Evaluation and treatment of moderate/large left-to-right PDA shunts:**

All infants had an echocardiogram performed on postnatal day 7. The echocardiographic
studies included two-dimensional imaging, M-mode, color flow mapping, and Doppler
interrogation as previously described [(19, 20)]. A moderate/large PDA with left-to-right shunt
(PDA L-R shunt) was defined by continuous left-to-right flow across the PDA, a ductus
diameter ≥1.5mm (or PDA:left pulmonary artery diameter ratio ≥0.5), plus one or more
of the following criteria: a) left atrium-to-aortic root ratio ≥1.5; b) ductus flow velocity
≤2.5m/sec or mean pressure gradient across the ductus ≤8 mm Hg,; and/or c) reversed
diastolic flow in the descending aorta [(19, 20)]. Ductus that did not meet these criteria were
considered “constricted” (small or closed).


Infants who had a moderate/large PDA on the echocardiogram performed on day 7 were
followed with echocardiograms every 7 days for the next 2-3 weeks, then at least every 2-3
weeks until the PDA was no longer moderate/large. Infants with a “constricted” (small or
closed) ductus on day 7 were examined daily for a change in clinical symptoms indicative
of a reopened moderate/large PDA (systolic murmur or hyperdynamic precordium). If either
of these occurred, an echocardiogram was performed within 24 hours. When a reopened
moderate/large PDA was detected, echocardiograms were performed every 7-10 days for
the next 2-3 weeks, and then at least every 2-3 weeks until the PDA was no longer

-----

moderate/large. Infants with a “constricted” ductus that never developed clinical signs of
reopening had routine echocardiograms performed at least every 3-4 weeks to confirm
ductus constriction until ductus closure or hospital discharge. Infants whose PDAs had
not closed before hospital discharge were followed at 2-to-6 months intervals until ductus
closure occurred either spontaneously or by device closure.

The duration of exposure to a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt that persisted beyond the
first week was calculated and expressed in days. Infants with small or closed ductus at
postnatal day 7 were assumed to have been unexposed to a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt
during the first 7 days. Infants with moderate/large PDA L-R shunts at postnatal day 7 were
assumed to have been exposed to a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt for the entire 7 days.
The time of ductus constriction was assigned as the halfway point between the last exam
with a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt and the first exam with a constricted ductus. If infants
died before an exam showed ductus constriction, the ductus was assumed to be moderate/
large at the time of death. When late reopening of the PDA occurred after documented
ductus constriction, the additional exposure to the reopened moderate/large PDA L-R shunt
(calculated as the number of days from the echocardiogram demonstrating the reopened
moderate/large shunt to the time of ductus constriction (i.e., the halfway point between
the last exam with a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt and the first exam with a constricted
ductus)) was added to the duration of any prior moderate/large PDA L-R shunt exposure.


During the study period, two different protocols for PDA treatment were used. During
epoch 1, January 2012 - June 2017, no PDAs were treated during the first 7 days to
allow for spontaneous PDA closure [(21)]. During epoch 2, July 2017 - September 2022, a
targeted prophylactic indomethacin treatment approach was used: all infants <25 weeks’
gestation as well as infants ≥25 weeks’ gestation who still were intubated beyond 24
hours were given prophylactic indomethacin during the first 72 hours. In both epochs,
infants with moderate/large PDA L-R shunts could receive pharmacologic treatment with
indomethacin or acetaminophen after 8 days if they met prespecified “Rescue” criteria
previously described by Clyman et al. [(22)]. Sixty-nine percent of infants with moderate/
large PDA-L-R shunts received pharmacologic PDA treatment. Infants with moderate/large
PDA L-R shunts that failed to close after pharmacologic treatment were ligated or had
a percutaneous device closure only if the infants’ ventilatory support was escalating for
more than a week or failed to improve after 36 weeks’ PMA. PDAs that did not meet the
definition of moderate/large PDA L-R shunt were considered to be “constricted” (small or
closed) and were never treated.

During the no-prophylactic indomethacin epoch, 56% of the infants received pharmacologic
treatment (either indomethacin-alone (24%) or acetaminophen with indomethacin backup (32%)) for a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt after the first week. During the
targeted prophylactic indomethacin epoch, 50% of the infants received either prophylactic
indomethacin (35%) or pharmacologic treatment (15%) of a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt.


**Evaluation of echocardiograms for evidence of PH and PVD:**

All infants requiring respiratory support ≥36 weeks’ PMA had systematic regular screening
echocardiographic assessments for PH as part of the nursery’s standards of care protocol

(23, 24). Beginning at 36 weeks’ PMA infants received monthly echocardiograms as long as
they were still hospitalized and continued to need some form of respiratory support; after
hospital discharge, less frequent echocardiographic examinations (every 2-3 months) were
performed until they no longer were receiving respiratory support. If PH-targeted therapy
was being considered, infants underwent cardiac catheterization before starting therapy to
confirm the diagnosis, assess disease severity, and exclude any other potentially treatable
diagnoses [(23-26)]. Infants who had stopped needing any respiratory support before 36 weeks’
PMA were assumed to have little chance of developing PH [(23, 24)], and therefore did not
receive routine screening echocardiograms for PH.

Our echocardiographic criteria for determining PH and PVD have been previously published
(27). An echocardiogram was considered positive for PH if the tricuspid regurgitant
jet velocity was >2.9 m/sec, the PDA systolic flow velocity estimated a peak systolic
pulmonary artery pressure >35 mm Hg, or if systolic septal flattening was present (based
on end-systolic eccentricity index >1.0). The PH was considered to be flow-associated PH,
due to the presence of a left-to-right PDA shunt (in the absence of a VSD), if there was
left-to-right flow through the PDA in both systole and diastole and the echocardiographic
signs of PH disappeared following ductus closure.


**Outcomes:**


An echocardiogram was classified as positive for PVD if it met the above criteria for PH
in the absence of a PDA or VSD shunts [(27)]. If a PDA or VSD shunt was present, the
echocardiogram was only classified as positive for PVD if it met the above criteria for PH
and there was bidirectional or right-to-left flow through the PDA or VSD, or left-to-right
flow through a moderate/large PDA without holodiastolic flow reversal in the abdominal
aorta.

Our goal was to examine the relationship between different durations of moderate/large
PDA L-R shunts and the outcomes BPD-PH and BPD-PVD (defined as the incidence of
PVD after 36 weeks in infants who also continued to require respiratory support beyond
36 weeks). Our primary outcome was BPD-PVD. Infants who were breathing room air
spontaneously and no longer needed respiratory support before they reached 36 weeks were
assumed to have no risk of PH and were not evaluated for PH (see above).


We used several different definitions of BPD (BPD-RS, BPD grades 1-3, and BPD 2,3) to
examine the association between the duration of PDA L-R shunt exposure and the outcomes
BPD-PH and BPD-PVD after 36 weeks’ PMA. BPD-RS was defined as needing respiratory
support (cannula, nasal positive pressure, or invasive ventilation) beyond 36 weeks’ PMA;
BPD grades 1-3, was defined as needing respiratory support on the day an infant turned
36[0/7] weeks as described by Jensen et al. [(4)]; and, BPD grades 2,3, was defined as needing
either nasal cannula flow rates >2 L/min, nasal positive pressure, or invasive mechanical
ventilation on the day an infant turned 36[0/7] weeks as described by Jensen et al. [(4)]. In
addition, all infants (except those who required CPAP with ≥30% oxygen or mechanical
ventilation) had a modified room air challenge test performed between 36[0/7] and 36[6/7] weeks
(2). Those who failed the test (or who required CPAP with ≥30% oxygen or mechanical
ventilation) were classified as “Failed Room Air Challenge test”.

**Risk Factors:**

Gestational age was determined by the date of last menstrual period and early ultrasounds
performed before 24 weeks’ gestation. Small for gestational age (SGA) infants had
birthweight-for-gestational age z scores <−1.29 using the growth curves from Fenton
and Kim [(28)]. Serious intraventricular hemorrhages (sIVH) were defined as grades 3
or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (using the four-level grading system) [(29)]. Necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC) was defined as Bell's classification II or greater (this included NEC
that was treated medically or surgically) [(30)]. Spontaneous intestinal perforations (SIP) were
diagnosed by either the presence of a pneumoperitoneum on abdominal X-ray without signs
of NEC or by the surgeon at the time of laparotomy. Serious pulmonary hemorrhages were
defined by the presence of frank blood in the tracheal secretions, a sudden need for increased
respiratory support, and chest X-ray changes. Severe retinopathy of prematurity (sROP) was
defined as retinopathy requiring laser or bevacizumab treatment.


**Statistical analysis**

Stata software (Release 17.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) was used for all
statistical analyses. Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U Test and Student’s t-tests were used to
compare groups for categorical and parametric variables, respectively. We used an analysis
of variance (ANOVA), a Kruskal-Wallis equality of populations rank test, and a Cochran–
Armitage test for trend to determine if any of the demographic characteristics (Table 1)
or outcomes listed in Table 2 were unevenly distributed among the infants with different
lengths of PDA exposure. We created multivariable models to adjust for the possible
confounding effects of unevenly distributed demographic characteristics on the relationship
between our variable of interest (duration of PDA L-R shunt) and our primary outcome
(BPD-PVD). These analyses were conducted with logistic regression using generalized
estimating equations (GEE) techniques to account for clustering of infants within mothers.
Our results were considered exploratory and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.


### Results:


Three hundred and ten infants <28 weeks’ gestation were admitted during the study period.
The study population was composed of the 256 infants who survived beyond 36 weeks’
PMA (Figure); 151/256 were classified as BPD-RS because they needed respiratory support
beyond 36 weeks’ PMA; 105/256 were classified as No BPD-RS because they no longer
needed respiratory support at 36 weeks. Although our nursery guidelines stated that routine
screening echocardiograms to evaluate PH were not needed if infants were not receiving
respiratory support beyond 36 weeks, 42/105 of the No BPD-RS infants continued to
have echocardiograms performed for PDA follow-up beyond 36 weeks (until final PDA
closure). None of the infants with No BPD-RS who were evaluated after 36 weeks had
echocardiographic evidence of PH.

Routine screening echocardiograms to evaluate PH were performed in all 151 of the infants
with BPD-RS as long as they were receiving respiratory support. The median (IQR) number
of echocardiograms performed after 36 weeks was 2 (1, 4). The median (IQR) age of the

last echocardiogram was 48 weeks (IQR: 37-70). Among the infants with BPD-RS, 22/151
(15%) had echocardiographic evidence of BPD-PH beyond 36 weeks.

The 22 infants with BPD-PH differed from those without BPD-PH in several demographic
characteristics: birthweight, SGA, duration of intubation, need for dopamine and colloid
resuscitation, sROP, duration of PDA L-R shunt exposure, and death (Table 1). It is worth
noting that although the 22 infants with BPD-PH were classified as having BPD-RS because
they required respiratory support beyond 36 weeks, two of the infants would not have been
classified as having BPD if we used either the Jensen definition (BPD grades 1-3) or the
Room Air Challenge test definition of BPD (one infant with PH beyond 36 weeks required
no respiratory support on the day the infant turned 36[0/7] weeks but needed support again
starting after 36[6/7] weeks; one infant passed the Room Air Challenge test despite needing
support for longer periods than the test’s conditions). Other studies have similarly observed
that while late PH, beyond 36 weeks, usually occurs in infants with moderate/severe BPD,
PH may even occur in infants with no or mild BPD [(13)].


Among the 22 infants with BPD-PH, 13 had moderate/large PDA L-R shunts that persisted
beyond 36 weeks (Table 1): the moderate/large PDA L-R shunts were associated with flowassociated PH in 12/13 infants; in one of the 13 infants, a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt
and flow-associated PH was initially observed at 36 weeks but subsequent echocardiograms
and a cardiac catheterization during the interval between 36 weeks and the infant’s death
at 62 weeks were consistent with the diagnosis of PVD. The 9/22 remaining infants had a
closed ductus with their BPD-PH and were considered to have BPD-PVD beyond 36 weeks
(Table 1).

Among the 10 infants with evidence of BPD-PVD, 6/10 had cardiac catheterizations in
addition to their echocardiograms to evaluate their PH; 2/10 developed pulmonary vein
stenosis (≤2 vessels) in addition to PH during the neonatal hospitalization; 5/10 received
PH directed pharmacotherapy (bosentan with or without sildenafil); and 3/10 died after 36
weeks’ PMA.


The 10 infants with BPD-PVD differed from those without BPD-PVD in all the
characteristics observed above for BPD-PH except for not having an increased incidence
of PDA L-R shunt beyond 36 weeks’ PMA (Table 1). The main goal of our study was
to examine the associations between increasing durations of exposure to a moderate/large
PDA L-R shunt and the development of BPD-PVD. Although increasing durations of
moderate/large PDA L-R shunt were associated with an increased incidence of BPD (no
matter what definition of BPD was used (Table 2)), we found no association between
increasing durations of exposure to a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt and BPD-PVD after 36
weeks in either the total population of infants, with and without BPD-RS (n=256), or in a
subpopulation composed only of infants with BPD-RS (n=151) (Table 2).

While most demographic characteristics were similarly distributed among infants with
different lengths of PDA L-R shunt exposure, a few characteristics appeared to be
unevenly distributed among the PDA exposure groups (Table 2). Therefore, we created
multivariable models to examine the potential confounding effects of these characteristics

on the association, or lack of association, between the duration of PDA L-R shunt exposure
and the presence of BPD-PVD after 36 weeks (Table 3). After adjusting for the potentially
confounding characteristics listed in Table 3, we still did not find an association between the
duration of PDA L-R shunt exposure and the presence of BPD-PVD after 36 weeks’ PMA.

Among the 10 infants with BPD-PVD, 9/10 had evidence of PVD in the first
echocardiographic study performed at 7 days after birth (3 had evidence of PH in the
absence of a PDA shunt; 6 had evidence of PH with a PDA bidirectional or right-to-left
shunt). Eight of the 10 infants with BPD-PVD had echocardiograms performed between the
first week and 36weeks’ PMA; 5/8 continued to show evidence of PVD.


### Discussion:

We defined late BPD-PH as the presence of PH beyond 36 weeks’ PMA in infants diagnosed
with BPD-RS. We found the same risk factors for BPD-PH that have been seen in other
observational studies that have examined the incidence of BPD-PH [(13)]: low birthweight,
SGA, BPD severity, duration of ventilation, ROP severity, and persistence of a PDA L-R
shunt (Tables 1 and 2). In our study, the association between a PDA L-R shunt and BPD-PH
appeared to be due to an increased incidence of flow-associated PH from the moderate/large
PDA L-R shunts that persisted beyond 36 weeks’ PMA. Fifty-nine percent of the infants
who still had a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt after 36 weeks’ PMA had evidence of
flow-associated BPD-PH that disappeared once the PDA was closed.


Prolonged exposure to a PDA’s high flow and pressure ultimately induces pulmonary
vascular remodeling and PVD in term infants with PDA-congenital heart disease [(16, 17)].
We hypothesized that the presence of a moderate/large PDA L-R shunt in extremely preterm
infants would accelerate the rate of developing PVD during the neonatal hospitalization.
However, we found no association between the duration of exposure to a moderate/large
PDA L-R shunt and the presence of BPD-PVD in either our univariate analysis (Table 2) or
our adjusted multivariable analyses (Table 3). We failed to detect an increased incidence of
BPD-PVD even in infants with PDA exposures ≥50 days (median (IQR)=70 (60-79) days)
(Table 2). However, this does not mean that longer exposures to a PDA L-R shunt, beyond
the nursery hospitalization, might not ultimately lead to PVD if left unchecked. Infants cared
for at higher elevations than sea level may also be at increased risk for earlier development
of BPD-PVD in the presence of a PDA L-R shunt.

It is interesting to note that 9 of the 10 infants with BPD-PVD had evidence of PVD
during the first week after birth and the majority had evidence of PVD on repeated
echocardiograms performed before 36weeks’ PMA. This is consistent with the hypothesis
that late PVD may be a manifestation of events that occur in utero or shortly after birth,
rather than a consequence of prolonged exposure to PDA flow during the first few months of
life.


There are several limitations to our study. Prior studies have both questioned [(31)] and
supported [(32)] the ability of echocardiography to evaluate BPD-PH. Echocardiography does
not measure pulmonary pressures directly but rather uses blood flow velocities to estimate

-----

pulmonary artery pressures and PH [(33, 34)]. Since pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary
vascular resistance (PVR) are related to each other (Pressure = Flow x Resistance), elevated
PVR is inferred from the estimated elevated pulmonary artery pressures when pulmonary
blood flow is not increased. We previously showed that echocardiography can perform
well as a screening tool for elevated PVR and BPD-PVD when post-tricuspid valve shunts
are absent (accuracy, sensitivity, and PPV = 93%, 91.7%, and 100%, respectively) [(27)].
Since post-tricuspid valve shunts transmit the systemic pressure to the pulmonary circulation
regardless of the presence or absence of PVD, the presence of a purely left to right shunt
does not necessarily exclude PVD from being present. Although we classified infants with
pure PDA L-R shunts and PH in our study as having flow-associated PH, we feel that this
is the most likely diagnosis since in each case the PH disappeared as soon as the PDA
was closed. Similarly, even though bidirectional PDA shunts do not always imply elevated
PVR, the one infant in our study with a bidirectional PDA shunt beyond 36 weeks that we
classified as having PVD also had PVD at cardiac catheterization.

Our study cannot address the incidence of brief transient periods of PH that appear and
disappear prior to 36 weeks’ PMA since routine echocardiographic screening evaluations
for PH were not started until a diagnosis of BPD-RS was made at 36 weeks. In addition,
since routine echocardiographic evaluations for BPD-PH were performed only in infants
who required respiratory support beyond 36 weeks, infants who did not have BPD-RS were
not routinely evaluated for PH and were assumed to have normal pulmonary artery pressures
beyond 36 weeks. It is possible that some of the infants who never developed BPD, and
never were evaluated for late PH, may have had PH that was missed. However, 42 infants
without a diagnosis of BPD-RS had echocardiograms performed beyond 36 weeks (because
they needed PDA follow-up) and none of them had any evidence of PH on their follow-up
echocardiograms. In addition, we found the same relationships between PDA exposure and
the outcomes BPD-PH and BPD-PVD in the subpopulation of infants with BPD-RS, where
every infant had echocardiographic evaluations for PH performed beyond 36 weeks, as we
did in the total population.


We used data from a single center. Since the incidence of moderate/large PDA and neonatal
morbidities differ by center, our results may not be generalizable to centers where the rates
differ from ours. Our study was not a randomized controlled trial. As an observational study,
it cannot distinguish between causation and association and should be used primarily for
hypothesis generation. Even though our analyses were adjusted for potential confounding
variables, there may have been unmeasured changes in practice that could have affected our
results. In addition, the relatively small size of our study may have made it difficult to detect
significant differences for some of our study outcomes. We cannot exclude the possibility
that our findings were due to insufficient power. However, our study size was necessarily
limited by the small number of infants who develop BPD-PH and BPD-PVD in our nursery.

In conclusion we found that persistent moderate/large PDA L-R shunts can increase the risk
of flow-associated BPD-PH when they are present beyond 36 weeks’ PMA. On the other
hand, persistent moderate/large PDA L-R shunts do not appear to increase the incidence of
BPD-PVD found by echocardiography during the neonatal hospitalization.
