CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension is relatively common, affecting at least 1 in 6 ELBW infants, and persists to discharge in most survivors. Routine screening of ELBW infants with echocardiography at 4
weeks of age identifies only one-third of the infants diagnosed with
pulmonary hypertension. Further research is required to determine
optimal detection and intervention strategies. Pediatrics 2012;129:

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
continues to be a major cause of morbidity and late mortality in extremely
preterm infants.[1] Pulmonary hypertension is a cardiovascular complication
that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in infants with BPD.[2]

,3 Reduction ofcross-sectional perfusion
area and abnormal muscularization of
peripheral pulmonary vessels are important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension in BPD,[4] and
abnormal vascular development also
may contribute to the development
of BPD.[5,6] Previous studies from the
presurfactant era[7,8] and more recent
studies[9,10] have used retrospective
designs, which make it difficult to determine the prevalence and outcomes
of pulmonary hypertension in BPD.
There are no clear guidelines for assessment and monitoring, and case
series and cross- sectional studies may
identify only infants with more severe
BPD and pulmonary hypertension,[11]
because pulmonary hypertension may
be silent initially and become evident
only after the onset of right-sided
heart failure. After the diagnosis of
right-sided heart failure in a series of
infants, routine echocardiographic
screening of extremely low birth
weight (ELBW) infants and tracking of
subsequent outcome were implemented in our neonatal intensive care unit
to determine if we could diagnose and
manage pulmonary hypertension before it became severe and possibly
irreversible. We hypothesized that
routine screening of extremely premature infants would lead to diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in
infants without overt signs and
determine the prevalence of this
complication.

## METHODS

Over a 2-year period (December 2008–
February 2011), ELBW infants (birth
weight #1000 g) who survived to 28


days of age at the NICU of the University
of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital
were evaluated soon thereafter (before 6 weeks of age) with echocardiography to determine the presence or
absence of pulmonary hypertension.
Infants with structural heart disease
other than persistent ductus arteriosus or patent foramen ovale and those
with multiple congenital anomalies
were excluded. Infants who were
screened but transferred to other
hospitals before 36 weeks’ corrected
postmenstrual age (PMA) also were
excluded, because outcomes by discharge were not always available.
Subsequentechocardiographywasdone
if severe lung disease or clinical signs
suggestive of right-sided heart failure
were present. Publication of this study
was approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham institutional review board, with waiver of informed
consent.

Infantswerediagnosedwithpulmonary
hypertension if at least 1 of the following echocardiographic findingswas
present: (1) right ventricular hypertrophy, (2) flatteningof interventricular
septum, (3) presence of tricuspid regurgitationintheabsenceofpulmonary
stenosis, and (4) elevated right ventricular pressures as estimated by Doppler
studies of tricuspid regurgitation jet.
Management of pulmonary hypertension was at the discretion of the clinician, and infants were managed to
discharge from the hospital or death.
We defined early pulmonary hypertension as pulmonary hypertension
detected during the initial screening.
Late pulmonary hypertension was
defined as pulmonary hypertension
diagnosed after a negative initial screening (after 6 weeks of age). All infants
diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension had a predischarge echocardiogram. All echocardiograms were
interpreted and reported by pediatric
cardiologists.


Patient characteristics and outcomes
werecollectedprospectivelyuntildeath
or discharge (Tables 1 and 2). BPD was
diagnosed and graded at 36 weeks’
PMA[12] with the physiologic definition
used for oxygen requirement.[13] Pulmonary hypertension was considered
to be treated if supplemental oxygen
with higher oxygen targets, sildenafil,
inhaled nitric oxide, bosentan, and/or
intravenous prostacyclin was used.
Pulmonary hypertension was considered to be persistent if the predischarge echocardiogram showed any
evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension was considered to have resolved if the last
echocardiogram before discharge
showed no evidence of pulmonary
hypertension. Baseline characteristics
and outcomes were compared between
infants who developed pulmonary hypertension and those who did not.

hypertension), and 17 (11.7%) were
identified later (late pulmonary hypertension) (Fig 1). The differences in
characteristics between the infants
with and without pulmonary hypertension are shown in Table 2. In brief,
infants with pulmonary hypertension
had lower birth weight but similar
gestational age, which was consistent
with the observation that more infants
with pulmonary hypertension were
identified as “small for gestational
age.” Infants with pulmonary hypertension received higher concentrations
of oxygen (P, .01) and were more
frequently (P = .06) on mechanical
ventilation on postnatal day 28 (Table 2).
One of 31 infants on room air at postnatal day 28 was diagnosed with
early pulmonary hypertension. None of
the infants on room air on day 28 were
later diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. Of 75 infants who were
receiving neither continuous positive
airway pressure nor intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) on postnatal
day 28, 10 infants (13.3%) developed
pulmonary hypertension. At 36 weeks’
PMA, infants with pulmonary hypertension were more likely to be on oxygen supplementation or mechanical
ventilation and to be diagnosed with
moderate or severe BPD. Four of 9
infants with early pulmonary hypertension and 12 of 17 infants with late
pulmonary hypertension were classified as having severe BPD. Mortality
and length of stay also were increased
in infants with pulmonary hypertension (Table 2). The multivariable logistic regression model identified lower
birth weight as being associated with
pulmonary hypertension after adjustment for the other variables (gestational age, male gender, fraction of
inspired oxygen on day 28, and IMV on
day 28) included in the model (Table 3).

Descriptive statistics were used to
evaluate the study population. Continuousvariableswerecomparedbyusing
either the t test or the Wilcoxon rank
test/Mann–Whitney U test for normal
or skewed distributions, respectively.
Proportions were compared by x[2]

/Fisher’s exact test. Risk factors were
evaluated by odds ratios and confidence intervals by using contingency
tables. Adjusted odd ratios were determined by multiple logistic regression,
to control for possible confounding
effects of other variables. In the multivariable model, pulmonary hypertension at or after initial screening was
considered the dependent variable,
and risk factors significant at an a
cutoff of P, .20 were analyzed as
independent variables. All data were
analyzed with SPSS 17.0 for Windows
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All statistical


tests were 2-tailed, and P values, .05
were considered statistically significant.

## RESULTS

During the study period, 172 ELBW
infantswhosurvivedtopostnatalday28
were evaluated for echocardiographic
screening. Twenty-one infants were
excluded because of congenital heart
disease or otheranomalies, and 6 were
excludedbecauseoftransfertoanother
facility (Fig 1). The remaining 145 infants had an echocardiogram at 4 to 6
weeks of age. The characteristics of this
study population are shown in Table 1.

on postnatal day 28 was similar
between early and late pulmonary
hypertension groups (Table 4). No significant difference was noted between
management of early or late pulmonary
hypertension, although the limitations
of small sample size and low power
must be considered. Clinical practice
generally involvedsequentialoradditive
use of higher oxygen saturation limits
(91%–95% vs 85%–95%), inhaled
nitric oxide, sildenafil, bosentan, and
epoprostenol (prostacyclin or Flolan)
(Tables 4 and 5). Eight of the 9 infants
diagnosed with early pulmonary hypertension were managed with supplemental oxygen: 1 infant with pulse
oximeter oxygen saturation.90% on
room air did not receive any additional
therapy, and pulmonary hypertension
had resolved by the time this infant was
discharged from the hospital. Of the 26
infants with pulmonary hypertension, 3


died in the late pulmonary hypertension group because of right ventricular
failure (cor pulmonale). The median
age at pulmonary hypertension diagnosis was 31 days (interquartile
range: 29–41) in the early pulmonary
hypertension group and 112 days
(interquartile range: 93–122) in the
late pulmonary hypertension group
(P, .01). Fifteen infants had persistence of pulmonary hypertension at
time of discharge (5 of 9 with early
pulmonary hypertension, 10 of 17 with
late pulmonary hypertension). Three of
the 5 infants with persistent pulmonary
hypertension in the early pulmonary
hypertension group and 8 of the 10
infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension in the late pulmonary hypertension group were discharged
from the hospital on oxygen therapy.
Ten infants also received home medication at the discretion of the treating


clinician, mainly from the late pulmonary hypertension group (8 of 10). Two
of 4 infants with resolved pulmonary
hypertension in the early pulmonary
hypertension group and 2 of 4 infants
with resolved pulmonary hypertension
in the late group were discharged on
supplemental oxygen therapy for BPD.

## DISCUSSION

The major findings of our study are that
18% or ∼1 in 6 extremely premature
infants develop pulmonary hypertension. Preterm infants with growth restrictionandhigheroxygenrequirements
at 4 weeks of age and those with severe BPD were at higher risk for the
development of pulmonary hypertension. Prospective screening by echocardiography at 4 to 6 weeks of age
identified only one-third of the ELBW
infants who developed pulmonary

The strengths of this study are its
prospective nature, with well-defined


echocardiographic criteria and clinical variables, in a reasonably large
recent cohort from atertiary care NICU.
It has been noted by other investigators
that the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension complicating chronic neonatal

Management, and Outcomes Between Early and Late Pulmonary Hypertension Groups


lung disease is unknown because it is
not routinely assessed,[11] and case series and retrospective analyses may
be biased toward identification of pulmonary hypertension in more severe
BPD.[11] Limitations of our study include
that although the initial echocardiogram was performed as a screening
test, subsequent echocardiography
was done only at the discretion of the
clinician, which may underestimate the
true incidence of pulmonary hypertension because mild forms of lateonset pulmonary hypertension may
have been missed. We also excluded 6
infants who were transferred from our
institution before 36 weeks’ PMA. Although these infants did not have early
pulmonary hypertension on initial
screening, it is possible they may have
had late pulmonary hypertension. Inclusion of these 6 infants in the analysis does not noticeably change the
incidence of early pulmonary hypertension (from 6.2% to 6.0%). Another
limitation is that it may be difficult to
extrapolate findings from a singlecenter study to other neonatal intensive care units, because clinical practices (eg, mechanical ventilation
management, oxygen saturation targets, and resuscitation practices of
infants at the borderline of viability)
may alter the incidence of pulmonary
hypertension. A more subtle limitation
is that although echocardiographic
estimates of systolic pulmonary artery
pressure are relatively sensitive in
identification of pulmonary hypertension, the severity of pulmonary hypertension is difficult to determine, and
qualitative echocardiographic findings
may be even less accurate.[14] Because
this study was observational, there
was no attempt to regulate therapeutic interventions in infants diagnosed
with pulmonary hypertension, and the
sample size is too small to permit determination of therapeutic effectiveness of the different interventions.

ofpulmonaryhypertensionisconcerning,
because this condition is more common
than other well-known morbidities in
this population, such as early-onset
sepsis, periventricular leukomalacia,
and necrotizing enterocolitis.[1] An et al,[9]
in a retrospective analysis of 116 preterm infants with BPD, observed that
25% had pulmonary hypertension (9.5%
and 58.0% of infants with moderate and
severe BPD, respectively) at a median
postnatal age of 65 days, and that it was
improved in 76% of infants after a median of 85 days, whereas 14% of infants
died. Slaughteret al,[10] in a retrospective
cohort study of 1156 ELBW infants,
identified 216 infants with BPD who required IMV, CPAP, or nasal cannula (flow
.2 liters per minute (LPM)) at the


postnatal age of 28 days. Forty-one
percent of these infants were evaluated with echocardiography, with 37%
having evidence of pulmonary hypertension.[10] Thirty-eight percent of the 29
infants with pulmonary hypertension
died, as compared with 14% of the 49
infants without pulmonary hypertension.[10] Khemani etal[15] studied42infants
with BPD and pulmonary hypertension
ata median age of 4.8 months andnoted
that 38% of these infants died during
follow-up. Multivariate analysis indicated that severe pulmonary hypertension and being small for gestational
age were associated with higher mortality[15]; however, it is difficult to compare the results from these studies with
our results, because they deal with selected populations of infants with BPD,
only some of whom were evaluated by
using echocardiography. Our results
indicate that although a substantial
number of infants who will develop pulmonary hypertension are identified by 4
to 6 weeks of age, many infants who go
ontodeveloppulmonaryhypertensiondo
so at 3 to 4 months of age, and repeated evaluation with echocardiography


may be necessary in infants at higher
risk (higher oxygen requirement or
severe BPD). The later detection of
pulmonary hypertension in these
infants may possibly be secondary to
ongoing deterioration of lung function
and vascular remodeling associated
with intermittent or persistent episodes
of hypoxemia.[16][–][18] It is possible that intercurrent infections, such as urinary
tract infections, may exacerbate or
present as pulmonary hypertension in
such infants, but because many sick
infants in the intensive care unit have
a fluctuating course, it is difficult to
assign causality to changes over time
in the clinical course. Alternatively, it is
possible that infants with absence of
a tricuspid regurgitation jet may not
have had detection of elevated pulmonary pressures on the initial echocardiogram.[14] This pilot observational study
does not have the statistical power to
demonstrate that earlier detection of
pulmonary hypertension (and earlier
therapy) is associated with better outcomes, although it must be noted that
all the infants who died were in the late
pulmonary hypertension group.

Preterm infants who were growthrestricted at birth were at greater
risk for development of pulmonary hypertension. The increased risk may be
possibly secondary to in utero inhibition
of lung development caused by nutritional or placental insufficiency, with
a reduction in cross-sectional vascular
area, resulting in elevated pulmonary
pressures and a greater probability of
severe BPD due to pre-existing impaired
development. It must be noted that almostone-fourthofourevaluated infants
were small for gestational age (SGA),
which may have influenced the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension. Acute
episodes of pulmonary hypertension
also have been reported in growthrestricted preterm infants soon after
birth.[19] As expected, infants with pulmonary hypertension were more likely
to receive higher fraction of inspired
oxygen at 4 weeks of age and have severe BPD at 36 weeks’ PMA. Although
these variables identified infants at

The optimal management of premature
infants with pulmonary hypertension is
not clear. Multiple therapies, including
inhalednitricoxide,[20] sildenafil,[21,22] and
endothelin blockers such as bosentan[22] and epoprostenol[23] have been
evaluated only in retrospective studies
that indicate preliminary efficacy and
possible safety for the management of
pulmonary hypertension in premature
infants with chronic lung disease. In
our center, if pulmonary hypertension
appeared to be resolved on subsequent echocardiograms, we attempted
to wean and discontinue the therapy

## CONCLUSIONS

Pulmonary hypertension is a relatively
common problem, affecting ∼1 in 6
ELBW infants, and it persists to discharge in most affected infants. Routine screening of ELBW infants with
echocardiography at 4 to 6 weeks of
age identifies only one-third of these
infants, so frequent follow-up evaluations may be required to determine
later onset of pulmonary hypertension. Further research is required to
determine optimal detection and intervention strategies (eg, higher oxygen
saturation targets, inhaled nitric oxide,
and sildenafil) and timing of treatment.
The longer-term benefits and risks of
medications such as sildenafil and
bosentan in this population need to be
evaluated.
