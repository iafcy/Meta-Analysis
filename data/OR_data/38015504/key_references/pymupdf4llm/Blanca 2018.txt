Abstract
Premature birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are risk factors for the development of echocardiographic signs of
pulmonary hypertension (PH) and are associated with changes in cardiac structure and function. It is unclear whether this
association persists beyond early infancy. The aims of this study are to prospectively investigate the prevalence of PH in children
with severe BPD and to investigate the effect of BPD and PH on myocardial structure and function at six months corrected age.
Preterm infants (gestational age � 32 weeks) with severe BPD were included. Echocardiography was used to define PH and to
measure speckle tracking derived longitudinal and circumferential strain of the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). Sixty-nine
infants with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) gestational age of 25.6 (24.9–26.4) weeks and a median birthweight of 770
(645–945) gram were included. Eight (12%) infants had signs of PH at six months corrected age. RV fractional area change was
lower in infants with severe BPD and PH at six months compared to infants without PH (35% � 9% vs. 43% � 9%, P ¼ 0.03).
RV mean longitudinal systolic strain was lower in infants with severe BPD and PH compared to infants without PH (17.6% [�19.5%/
�16.1%] vs. �20.9% [�25.9%/�17.9%], P ¼ 0.04). RV size and LV longitudinal and circumferential strain in children with BPD with
or without PH were similar. Signs of PH were found in 12% of infants with severe BPD at six months corrected age and the
presence of PH is associated with reduced RV systolic function.

The incidence of PH in infants and neonates with BPD is in
the range of 2–53%, depending on BPD severity, PH definition, type of study design, and age of assessment.[9,11–18] The
exact pathophysiological pathways that link PH towards
unfavorable outcome in infants with BPD are incompletely
understood, but changes in the pulmonary vasculature and
the increased afterload that is imposed upon the RV might
play an important role. Pulmonary vascular disease and
increased RV afterload might lead to maladaptation of the
RV myocardium and ultimately RV failure.[19,20] Cardiac
catheterization is the gold standard for assessing the presence
or absence of PH, but this invasive procedure is unsuitable
for screening.[21] Echocardiography is a widely available and
commonly used tool to assess the presence of PH. However,
there are no published guidelines for the echocardiographic
assessment of PH in the pediatric population and correlation
with invasively measured PAP is not optimal.[22] For this
reason other methods should be considered to assess PH
and its effect on the RV. A potential useful tool to
assess the RV and left ventricular (LV) function includes
new echocardiographic methods such as myocardial deformation imaging (speckle tracking echocardiography

[STE]).[23] Because long-term prospective follow-up studies
of children with BPD are scarce, data on the impact of PH
on cardiovascular function later in life in children with BPD
are limited.[8,11,12,15,24]

Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of PH in a prospective non-selected cohort of children with severe BPD. Furthermore, we wanted to
investigate the effect of BPD and echocardiographic estimated PH on myocardial structure and function at six
months corrected age, using standard echocardiograph imaging and STE. We hypothesize that children with BPD have
a high risk of developing PH and changes in RV size and
function.

## Methods Patient selection

This is a prospective cohort study. From April 2012 to April
2017, we enrolled preterm neonates born at GA < 32 weeks
with severe BPD who were born in the Erasmus Medical
Center/Sophia Children Hospital or who were referred to
us by other hospitals. Severe BPD was defined as oxygen
supplementation for �28 days and need for either >30%
oxygen, >1 L/min flow, continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) or ventilator support at 36 weeks post menstrual
age (PMA).[15] In our hospital, all patients with severe
BPD are assessed by a multidisciplinary team (cardiologist,
pulmonologist, general pediatrician, psychologist, and physiotherapist) according to a predefined follow-up scheme.
A clinical assessment was scheduled at the age of �6
months corrected age. In addition, we included 12 healthy
infants who were born at term at the Leiden University
Medical Center who participated in a different study on


echocardiographic pediatric normal values (online supplementary table).[25]

Infants were included in this study if they were diagnosed
with severe BPD at 36 weeks PMA and had a cardiac ultrasound at approximately the age of six months (corrected for
term date). Exclusion criteria were: (1) hemodynamically
significant congenital heart lesion, except patent foramen
ovale (<5 mm) and a small patent arterial duct (<1 mm)
without volume overload; and (2) overall poor quality of
the echocardiograph images. Written informed consent to
use these data for research purposes was obtained from
both parents of the infants. The study was approved by
the medical ethical committee of the Erasmus MC,
Rotterdam, The Netherlands (METC-2015-694).

## Data collection

Clinical data were collected using the patients’ medical
records on usage of prenatal steroids, pre-eclampsia of the
mother during pregnancy, gender, GA, birthweight, Apgar
score at 1, 5, and 10 min, medication during infancy, duration of mechanical support and invasive oxygen demand;
presence and treatment of patent arterial duct; perinatal
infections; use of nitric oxide; and neonatal mortality.
General data were collected from the patients’ medical
records on height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate
at the time of echocardiographic assessment.

## Conventional echocardiographic measurements

An extensive echocardiogram was performed at the age
of approximately six months corrected age to exclude
congenital or acquired heart disease using an EPIQ 7C
(Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) or
Vivid E9 (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) ultrasound system. Apical four-chamber, parasternal long-axis
and short-axis views were acquired and stored. M-mode,
two-dimensional (2D), color Doppler, and pulsed wave
Doppler images were acquired to collect data on tricuspid
regurgitant jet, pulmonic valve insufficiency, pulmonary
artery acceleration time (PAAT), RV and LV dimensions
and mass, shortening fraction of the LV, and fractional area
change (FAC) of the RV. Right ventricular systolic pressure
(RVSP) was estimated by using the modified Bernoulli
equation (tricuspid regurgitant jet[2] � 4), with no allowance
for the right atrial pressure.[16] All measurements were performed off-line using Xcelera (version R4.1, Philips, Best,
The Netherlands). Z-scores were calculated for LV and RV
dimensions and wall thickness.[26] The average of three measurements was used.
The presence of PH was assessed using the following
criteria[12,18]: (1) presence of tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity
�2.8 m/s in the absence of pulmonary stenosis; and (2) flat
or leftward deviated interventricular septal configuration.
Children with one or both of these findings were characterized as having PH.

## Two-dimensional speckle tracking

Two-dimensional echocardiographic images were stored
for off-line analysis of myocardial deformation patterns
(circumferential systolic strain and longitudinal systolic
strain) of the LV and RV using dedicated speckle tracking
software (Cardiac Performance analysis, version 4.6,
Tomtec, Unterschleisheim, Germany) as previously
described.[27] The images were stored as Digital Imaging
and Communications in Medicine format with a default
setting of 30 frames/s. Longitudinal systolic strain of the
LV and RV were measured using apical four-chamber
views. Circumferential systolic strain of the LV was measured using short-axis views at the level of the papillary
muscles. The endocardial border was manually traced at
end-systole (minimal volume). Tracking of the endocardial
border was visually inspected and manually adjusted if
necessary. After obtaining satisfactory endocardial tracking,
the epicardial border was added to incorporate the entire
myocardial wall (except for RV strain, were only the endocardial wall was tracked). Tracking was re-inspected
throughout the cardiac cycle and adjusted as necessary.
The cardiac cycle with the best tracking and visually most
credible strain curves was selected for analysis. If a segment
was not tracking appropriately, this segment was excluded
from the analysis. The software divides the myocardium into
six segments (circumferential strain and longitudinal strain
of the LV) or one segment (lateral wall of the RV). For LV
longitudinal systolic strain, the segments are: basal septum;
mid-septum; apical septum; apical lateral; mid-lateral;
and basal lateral. For LV circumferential systolic strain,
the segments are: mid-anterior; mid-lateral; mid-posterior;
mid-inferior; and mid-septal. Mean strain values were calculated from the individual segmental strain values. At least 4/6
segments were necessary to calculate mean strain values;
images with >2 missing segments were excluded from analysis.

## Statistical analysis

All statistical analyzes were preformed using SPSS software,
version 21,0 (IBM SPSS Statistic, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,
USA). A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Continuous data were tested for normality using the
Shapiro Wilk test. Continuous data were described as mean
(�SD) if normally distributed or as median (interquartile
range [IQR]), if non-normally distributed. Categorical data
were described as frequencies and percentages. Baseline differences in categorical variables between infants were analyzed using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous
variables were analyzed using independent student-test or
ANOVA if normally distributed. Non-normally distributed
data were analyzed using Mann–Whitney U test.

## Inter- and intra-observer variability

Inter- and intra-observer was tested using a Coefficients of
Variation (CoV) and Bland–Altman analysis. To describe

intra-observer variability of the strain parameters, 15
patients were analyzed by the same investigator (AB) on
two separate occasions, with at least one week of time
apart. To describe inter-observer variability, the same 15
patients were analyzed by a second investigator (LK).

## Results

 Patient selection

In the study period, a total of 93 patients were diagnosed
with severe BPD. We excluded 24 patients (Fig. 1). Three
died before the age of six months: one died of respiratory
failure caused by BPD; one died of therapy refractory PH;
and one died as the consequences of a complex congenital
syndrome. Of the remaining 21 excluded infants, three had a
hemodynamically significant congenital heart defect, 17
were unable to attend the follow-up clinic at six months of
age, and one had an echocardiogram with poor quality. All
general characteristics were similar in excluded versus
included children except for GA (26.3 [IQR ¼ 25.3–27.2]
vs. 25.6 [IQR ¼ 24.6–26.5 weeks], P ¼ 0.02), prevalence of
maternal pre-eclampsia (42% vs. 15%, P ¼ 0.01), 5-min
Apgar score (8 [IQR ¼ 7–9] vs. 7 [IQR ¼ 6–8], P ¼ 0.04)
and prevalence of prenatal steroid treatment (78% vs.
96%, P ¼ 0.03).
Of the 69 included patients the median (IQR) corrected
age at echocardiographic follow-up was six months (5–7
months).

the age of six months. The majority of children (n ¼ 63) with
severe BPD were born at a GA < 28 weeks. Only six children
were born at 28–32 weeks. All children underwent invasive
mechanical ventilation during hospital admission, except
one child who received CPAP only and one child who
received non-invasive mechanical ventilatory support only.
Duration of mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks of age was
statistically significantly longer in infants with PH compared
to infants without PH at six months (40 � 16 vs. 24 � 16
days, P ¼ 0.02). PH was based on TI-jet �2.8 in five cases
and flat intraventricular septum in seven cases (overlap of
inclusion criteria in four children). Detailed information of
the children with PH is provided in Table 2. One child was
treated with sildenafil for 2.5 years, one child was treated
with sildenafil (4 mg/kg/day) and nitric oxide, and one child
was treated with nitric oxide only (during the neonatal
phase). Five out of eight children were still on oxygen therapy at six months of corrected age at the echocardiographic
assessment.


## Echocardiographic measurements

Table 3 summarizes the anthropometric and standard echocardiographic measurements at the age of six months corrected for GA. Anthropometric parameters were similar in
infants with and without PH. The presence of tricuspid
regurgitation was higher in infants with severe BPD and
PH compared to infants with severe BPD without PH
(63% vs. 20%, P ¼ 0.02). RV FAC was statistically significantly lower in infants with PH compared to infants without
PH (35.4 � 9.2% vs. 43.1 � 9.4%, P ¼ 0.03). No differences
between the groups were observed in RV dimensions
and PAAT. The results of the myocardial strain parameters
are presented in Table 4. RV global longitudinal strain
was statistically significantly lower (less negative) in BPD
infants with PH compared to BPD infants without PH
(�17.6% [�19.5/�16.1] vs. �20.9% [�25.9/�17.9],
P ¼ 0.04). No differences were observed in LV strain
values between infants with severe BPD with or without

signs of PH. Comparisons of echocardiographic parameters
with age-matched at-term born-healthy controls are shown
in the online supplementary table. No differences in echocardiographic parameters were seen between term-born
healthy children and infants with severe BPD without PH.

## Feasibility and inter- and intra-observer variability

The majority of the echocardiographic images were of
sufficient quality for analysis. Feasibility for RV global longitudinal strain was 93%. Feasibility for measuring LV
global longitudinal strain was 96%, whereas the feasibility
for the LV global circumferential strain was 86%. The
reproducibility for myocardial strain measurements are
shown in the online supplement.

## Discussion

We found in a prospective cohort of children with severe
BPD that approximately 12% of the infants had echocardiographic sign of PH at the age of six months. We found
echocardiographic signs of RV systolic dysfunction in children with PH compared to children without PH as indicated
by lower RV global longitudinal strain and RV FAC in the


absence of changes in RV size. We also found that preterm
infants with severe BPD and PH at the age of six months
required a longer period of mechanical ventilation than
infants with severe BPD who did not develop PH.

## Prevalence of pulmonary hypertension

The prevalence of PH in infants and neonates with BPD
described in the literature is in the range of <1% to
53%.[11–18,24] The differences in PH prevalence described in
various studies probably reflect differences in study design
(retrospective versus prospective), timing of echocardiographic assessment, study population (differences in BPD
severity), neonatal ventilation, and other treatment strategies and, to some extent, differences in PH definition. The
majority of studies that describe PH in children with BPD
perform the echocardiographic assessment at or before two
months of corrected age.[11–13,15–18,24] At this young age, neonates are within or close to the time window in which the
physiological transition from high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) intra-uterine to low vascular PVR after birth
takes place. In addition, the arterial duct is patent in many
neonates close to birth, which potentially interferes with the
diagnosis of PH. We therefore chose to assess PH at six

months of corrected age and found a prevalence of 12%.
The only prospective study in older preterm children we are
aware of is the multicenter study by Levy et al.[14] The study
population consisted of 239 children born at <29 weeks of


gestation, of which 164 were assessed at 36 weeks PMA and
81 were assessed at one year of corrected age.[14] Of these
children, 52% developed BPD in various degrees of severity.
Echocardiographic defined PH was found in 10% of


-----

children with moderate to severe BPD at 36 weeks PMA and
in 1% at the age of one year.[14] However, recent studies have
shown that school-aged children and adolescents who were
born prematurely (and especially those children with BPD)
have a greater peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity assessed
by echocardiography and higher mean PAP assessed by
cardiac catheterization compared to term controls.[2,3]

These findings, together with the findings of ours and
other studies, suggest that PH prevalence in prematurely
born children decreases over time but that these children
remain at risk for the development and persistence of pulmonary vascular disease, especially those children with
severe BPD. The determination of the true prevalence of
PH is hampered by the limitations of echocardiography,
since the velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet and the
position of the intraventricular septum are at best surrogate
markers of increased PAPs.[22] Recently, the PAAT has been
suggested as a reliable estimation of PAP and PVR in children.[28] Pediatric reference values for PAAT have been published;[29] a recent study by Levy et al. found a decreased
PAAT in preterm born children compared to term-born
controls and lower values in children with BPD compared
to children without BPD at the age of one year.[30] We found
a median PAAT of 80 ms in our total population, compared
to 73 ms in preterm-born infants in the study by Levy et al.
at the age of one year.[30] We found similar PAAT in children
with and without PH, which suggests that PAAT is not a
sensitive marker to detect PH at the age of six months of
corrected age. We believe that the results published by Levy
et al. should be interpreted with caution, since most of the
children in their study had a PAAT within the normal range
(64–116 ms for girls and 62–114 ms for boys).[29] In addition,
PAAT has been validated against invasively assessed pulmonary hemodynamics in children with a median age of
6–8 years and no children aged <1 year were included in
this validation study.[28]

We found that infants with severe BPD and PH at the age
of six months had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks PMA compared to infants with severe BPD
without PH. In a large retrospective study by An et al., it
was found that severity of BPD, long-term ventilator care,
oxygen supplementation, and a high ventilator setting, were
associated with PH beyond two months of age based on
univariate analysis.[11] Ali et al. performed a study in preterm
neonates on predictors of BPD and PH and found that the
duration of invasive oxygen use was significantly longer in
neonates with BPD and PH at 36 weeks PMA.[31] Our results
are in accordance with these studies.

## RV function and adaptation

We found that in children with severe BPD the RV FAC
and RV global longitudinal strain values were lower in
infants with PH compared to infants without PH at six
months of corrected age. Levy et al. investigated the maturational (age- and weight-related) changes of RV FAC in

preterm and term children.[32] They found that preterm
infants, independent of the presence of PH, with moderate
to severe BPD had a lower RV FAC at 36 weeks PMA
compared to preterm infants without BPD. Levy et al. performed another prospective multicenter cohort study on
changes in systolic ventricular strain mechanics and found
that preterm infants (mean GA ¼ 27 weeks) with PH as
assessed at the age of 36 weeks PMA had significant lower
RV free wall longitudinal strain at the age of one year compared to infants who did not have PH at 36 weeks PMA.[14]

In addition, they found that at the age of 32 weeks PMA,
36 weeks PMA, and one year, children with BPD had lower
RV global longitudinal strain values compared to children
without BPD.[14,30] Even after adjusting for the presence of
BPD, the RV free wall strain at the age of one year remained
lower in infants with PH compared to infants without PH
defined at the age of 36 weeks PMA.[14]

RV FAC is reduced in older children and adults with
idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and is
a strong predictor of mortality.[33] In addition, the RV is
dilated in adult patients with IPAH and increased RV
volume strongly predicts mortality in these patients.[34]

In contrast, increased afterload of the RV in the setting of
congenital pulmonary valve stenosis is associated with
normal systolic function as assessed by RV FAC, possibly
because in early infancy the RV is used to the physiological
high PVR and high PAP and can therefore maintain adequate RV function.[35,36] Interestingly, in our study, RV size
as assessed by tricuspid valve annulus size or RV dimension
in diastole were similar between children with and without
PH. Our data, together with the data by Levy et al.,[14,32]

suggest that adaptation of the RV in extremely prematureborn children with BPD and PH is fundamentally different
as compared to older children or adults with IPAH
(decreased RV function and RV dilatation) as well as infants
and children with pulmonary valve stenosis (relatively wellpreserved RV function). Levy et al. also found that a small
group of premature infants without BPD can develop echocardiographic signs of PH at the age of 36 weeks and that
these infants also show lower RV global longitudinal strain
values.[14] These observations suggest that a primary pulmonary vascular injury coupled with RV dysfunction may occur
in some preterm-born infants irrespective of the underlying
lung disease.[14] Lower RV global longitudinal strain values
are also found in other studies comparing children with
BPD to children without BPD.[37–39] However, these studies
were performed earlier in life, mostly around birth, and
included children with BPD ranging from mild to severe.
In our study, we found no differences in RV global longitudinal strain between infants with severe BPD without PH
and healthy infants. This suggests that later in life the influence of BPD on RV function is less important and the presence of PH becomes more important. Further studies
are needed to provide more insight in these time-related
and disease-related differences in RV adaptation, preferably
in a larger multicenter prospective cohort where all

prematurely born children are routinely screened according
to a standard protocol. These data are important to design
prevention and treatment strategies for infants born extremely premature.
The LV strain parameters did not differ between infants
with or without PH. This is in line with current literature.[14,37,39]

In young adults born premature, it has been shown that LV
mass is increased, and systolic and diastolic LV function are
decreased compared to healthy controls born at term, although
in this study the presence of BPD is not mentioned.[40]

## Strengths and limitations

The main strengths of this study are the prospective study
design, the echocardiographic assessment at an older age
compared to previously published studies, and the use of
new echocardiographic techniques.
To determine PH, we used echocardiography. Although
this is the safest and most commonly used method to assess
PH in preterm infants, the gold standard is right heart catheterization (RHC). There are no standardized methods to
detect PH in infants using echocardiography and agreement
with PH assessed by catheterization is, at most, moderate.[22]

It is therefore possible that by using ultrasound instead of
RHC we may have missed or over-diagnosed infants with
PH. However, RHC is an invasive procedure and, due to
ethical reasons, not suitable for screening.
Although we included a relatively large number of
patients compared to other studies on this topic, the
sample size was too small to perform multiple logistic
regression analysis in a meaningful way. Larger studies are
needed to investigate the association between PH and RV
function and its potential confounders.
In the initial study design, we did not include a term
control group. Instead, we used echocardiographic studies
of children who had participated in a different study on
normal values for myocardial deformation. We acknowledge that this approach is sub-optimal; however, since the
main echocardiographic parameters were similar between
the infants with BPD without PH and the term control
group, we believe that our findings in infants with BPD
and PH are of considerable value.
All echocardiographic images were stored as Digital
Imaging and Communications in Medicine format with a
default setting of 30 frames/s. We decided not to include
strain rate parameters in our study, since higher frame
rates are needed to quantify strain rate reliably. For this
reason, no data on diastolic cardiac function were obtained.
Lastly, we only included infants with severe BPD. As we
only screen infants with severe BPD, we cannot make any
statements regarding infants with mild to moderate BPD
and preterm infants without BPD. More research on PH
and the cardiac consequences later in life for prematurely
born children with and without BPD and healthy controls
born at term is needed to determine prevention and treatment strategies.


In conclusion, the prevalence of echocardiographic signs
of PH in preterm infants with severe BPD was 12% at the
median corrected age of six months. Although the clinical
and echocardiographic features in these infants with PH
seems relatively mild, they show signs of decreased RV function assessed by RV fractional area change and RV global
longitudinal strain compared to infants with severe BPD
without PH and compared to term healthy controls. Our
study suggests that BPD-associated PH might leave a negative impact on the RV function, and that the mechanisms of
RV adaptation in these premature born infants are different
from RV adaptation in children and adults with increased
RV afterload caused by IPAH or pulmonary valve stenosis.
