Objective: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a severe cardiovascular
complication of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that contributes to
the high mortality rates for preterm infants. The objective of this study is to
establish a prediction model of BPD-associated PH (BPD-PH) by integrating
multiple predictive factors for infants with BPD.

Method: A retrospective investigation of the perinatal clinical records
and data of echocardiography in all the preterm infants with BPD was
performed from January 2012 to December 2019. A prediction model of
BPD-PH was established based on the univariate and multivariate logistic
regression analysis of the clinical data and evaluated by using the area
under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), combined
with the Hosmer–Lemeshow (HL) test. Internal validation was performed with
bootstrap resampling.

Result: A total of 268 infants with BPD were divided into the BPD-PH group
and the no-PH group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that
the independent predictive factors of BPD-PH were moderate to severe BPD,
small for gestational age, duration of hemodynamically significant patent
ductus arteriosus ≥ 28 days, and early PH. A prediction model was established
based on the β coefficients of the four predictors. The area under the
ROC curve of the prediction model was 0.930. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test
(p = 0.976) and the calibration curve showed good calibration.

Conclusion: The prediction model based on the four risk factors predicts the
development of BPD-PH with high sensitivity and specificity and might help
clinicians to make individualized interventions to minimize the disease risk.

## Introduction

During the past three decades, since great progress in
perinatal-neonatal medicine has been made in China, the
survival of extremely premature infants has markedly increased.
However, the developing lungs are susceptible to various
injuries, which cause a rising incidence of bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (BPD) (1). In China, based on previously published
studies, the incidence of BPD in extremely premature infants
with a gestational age of less than 28 weeks has increased from
19.3% in 2011 to 51.7% in 2019 (2, 3).
Survivors with BPD are at risk of cardiovascular
complications because of the disruption of vascular growth
and signaling (4, 5). Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common
in infants with moderate or severe BPD, with the reported
incidence ranging from 8 to 38% (6–9). PH contributes
significantly to high mortality and is associated with dependency
on respiratory support, prolonged hospitalization, impaired
neurodevelopment, and significant medical costs in infants with
BPD (10, 11). In our previously published data, the mortality of
BPD infants complicated with PH was 40.5% (12).
The pathogenesis of BPD-associated PH (BPD-PH) is
complicated, including multiple factors, such as perinatal
stress, abnormal lung development, and postnatal conditions.
Therefore, identification of the risk factors is important for
early prevention. However, a single predictive factor is difficult
to apply in clinical practice due to its inconsistent standards,
low sensitivity, and specificity. A prediction model developed
by integrating multiple predictive factors may improve the
accuracy of prediction. To test the hypothesis, we performed this
retrospective study.

## Materials and methods

### Study population and data collection

Preterm infants admitted to the Level III neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU) at Children’s Hospital of Zhejiang University
School of Medicine between January 2012 and December 2019
who were diagnosed with BPD were eligible for this study. We
excluded infants with congenital heart diseases [except patent
ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrial septal defect, or patent foramen
ovale], other major congenital anomalies, incomplete data, or
death before 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age (PMA). This study was
approved by the Ethics Committees of our hospital with a waiver
of parental consent.
Clinical data were collected retrospectively from the
electronic NICU database. Prenatal data included maternal
demographics, oligohydramnios (defined as amniotic fluid
index ≤ 5), prolonged rupture of membrane, pregnancyrelated complications, antenatal corticosteroids use, and mode


of delivery. Neonatal data included gestational age (GA), birth
weight (BW), sex, the Apgar score at 1 and 5 min, small
for gestational age (SGA) status, cumulative days of invasive
mechanical ventilation (IMV) before 36 weeks’ PMA, and comorbidity about respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with
surfactant use, hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA),
pneumonia with positive respiratory culture, culture proven
sepsis, PDA ligation, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH),
and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

### Definitions

Pulmonary hypertension was evaluated non-invasively with
echocardiography by a board-certified pediatric sonographer
in cardiology and diagnosed based on either of the following
criteria (7, 13, 14), including the estimated systolic pulmonary
arterial pressure (sPAP) > 50% of the systemic arterial pressure,
end-systolic flattened or left-deviated of the interventricular
septum (IVS) with or without right ventricular dilatation,
bidirectional or right-to-left shunt at the patent foramen ovale,
or ductus arteriosus. When there was a tricuspid regurgitation
(TR), sPAP was calculated by adding right atrial pressure
(5 mmHg) to the right ventricle pressure gradient, which
was estimated by the Bernoulli equation. In the absence of a
measurable TR, we relied upon a PDA/patent foramen ovale
gradient to estimate sPAP. Early PH was defined as having
evidence of PH based on the assessment of echocardiography
between 72 h and 14 days (15), while BPD-PH was defined
as having evidence of PH beyond 36 weeks’ PMA in preterm
infants with BPD (7).
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed based on the
2019 criteria proposed by Jensen (16). BPD severity was
categorized according to the following modes of respiratory
support administered at 36 weeks PMA, grade 1, nasal cannula
at flow rates ≤ 2 L/min; grade 2, nasal cannula at flow
rates > 2 L/min or non-invasive positive airway pressure;
and grade 3, IMV.
Hemodynamically significant PDA was defined as the PDA
diameter exceeding 1.5 mm combined with diastolic flow
reversal in the descending aorta and the ratio of the left atrium
to aorta greater than 1.5, as well as the clinical findings of
pulmonary overcirculation, left heart overload, and/or poor
systemic perfusion (17). SGA was defined as a birth weight
less than the 10th percentile for gestational age (18). NEC
was defined as modified Bells’ stage II criteria or greater (19).
Pneumonia includes both congenital and hospital acquired
pneumonia, which is defined as having chest X-ray findings with
positive tracheal aspirate culture. Sepsis was defined as infants
with a positive blood culture who were treated with antibiotics
for at least 5 days. Severe IVH was defined as Papile’s Grade III
or greater (20).


-----

### Echocardiography screening protocol for hemodynamically significant PDA and pulmonary hypertension

All the preterm infants who were admitted before 2 weeks
of life were evaluated by an echocardiogram 2–3 times a week
for the hemodynamic status of PDA, pulmonary hypertension,
and cardiac function. After 2 weeks of age, the frequency of
echocardiogram was changed to 1–2 times a week. For all the
preterm infants who developed increasing oxygen or respiratory
support requirements in the late stage of life (usually after
4 weeks of life), PH was screened by an echocardiogram.
When PH was confirmed, a series of echocardiograms were
repeated every 1 or 2 weeks to monitor the dynamic change
of PH and the response to interventions. If PH resolved,
the echocardiogram was repeated monthly until weaning off
respiratory support for 6 months.

### Statistical analyses

Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD),
median [interquartile range (IQR)], or number (percentage)
where appropriate. Univariate analyses were performed using
an independent t-test or non-parametric tests for continuous
variables, and the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for
categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was
performed to identify the risk factors associated with BPD-PH.
A prediction model and nomogram were established based on
the multivariate logistic regression analysis of BPD-PH.


The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve (AUC) was measured to assess the discriminative
performance of the prediction model. A calibration curve was
generated for the evaluation of calibration, combined with the
Hosmer–Lemeshow (HL) test. An insignificant HL test statistic
implies good calibration. In addition, the prediction model was
subjected to 1,000 bootstrap resamples for internal validation to
assess their predictive accuracies.
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics
for Windows, version 20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY,
United States). The graphics of the nomogram and calibration
curve were performed with R 4.0.4 (The R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with the rms
statistical packages.

## Results

During the study period, 336 preterm infants were
diagnosed with BPD based on the 2019 criteria. In this study,
68 cases were excluded because of major congenital anomalies
or incomplete data. A total of 268 preterm infants with BPD
were enrolled, with 59 (22.0%) infants who developed BPD-PH
beyond 36 weeks’ PMA in the BPD-PH group and 209 (78%)
infants without PH in the no-PH group (Figure 1). The median
age at admission was 21 days of life in the BPD-PH group and
4 days of life in the no-PH group. The incidences of PH in grade
1, grade 2, and grade 3 BPD infants were 5.0% (7/139), 20.9%
(19/91), and 86.8% (33/38), respectively.

incidences of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), grade 3
BPD, early PH, SGA, RDS with surfactant use, pneumonia,
severe IVH, and PDA ligation were significantly higher in the
BPD-PH group (p < 0.05). The duration of hsPDA and IMV
before 36 weeks’ PMA was much longer in infants with BPD-PH
than in those without PH (p < 0.05).

After univariable analysis, the variables of GA, BW, SGA,
PIH, BPD, RDS with surfactant use, early PH, severe IVH, the
duration of hsPDA, PDA ligation, pneumonia, and the duration
of IMV before 36 weeks’ PMA were entered into the multivariate
logistic regression analysis.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the
independent predictive factors of BPD-PH were SGA, early PH,
moderate to severe BPD (Grade 2 and 3 BPD), and the duration
of hsPDA ≥ 28 days (Table 2).

3. The predictive nomogram for the probability of BPD-PH
On the basis of the final regression analysis, a prediction
model was established that incorporated the β coefficients of the
predictors,

_p_
logit �p� = ln
1 − _p_ [= −][4][.][617][+][1][.][594][ ×][ SGA][+][1][.][205][ ×]

Early PH+1.201 × Grade 2 BPD+4.792 ×

Grade 3 BPD+2.068 × duration of hsPDA

where, p represented the probability of developing BPD-PH.
Other values of the predictors are as follows, SGA (no = 0,
yes = 1), early PH (no = 0, yes = 1), Grade 2 BPD (no = 0, yes = 1),
Grade 3 BPD (no = 0, yes = 1), and the duration of hsPDA
(< 28 days = 0, ≥ 28 days = 1). A nomogram was developed
based on the prediction model to improve the convenience of
the model in clinical practice (Figure 2).
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the prediction
model was 0.930 (95% CI, 0.895–0.965) (Figure 3). The
Hosmer–Lemeshow test revealed no statistical significance
(p = 0.976), suggesting a good fitting of the model. The
calibration curve of the prediction model (Figure **4)**
demonstrated good calibration. The cutoff probability in
this model is 0.173, with a sensitivity of 89.8% and a specificity
of 79.4%, respectively.

## Discussion

Since PH is serious comorbidity of BPD with high
mortality (31) and a lack of evidence-based therapies, it is of


-----

great importance to identify the risk factors and start early
interventions to improve the long-term outcome. In this study,
we established and assessed a prediction model for individually


predicting patients with BPD who are likely to develop BPD-PH.
The prediction model incorporated demographic and clinical
characteristics and showed good discrimination and calibration
performance. We further developed a nomogram, thus making
it a convenient and valuable tool for clinical practice.
Several published studies have examined a wide variety of
risk factors for the development of pulmonary hypertension in
infants with BPD (6, 8, 21). Nagiub et al. (22) performed a
meta-analysis to further analyze the effect size of risk factors
for BPD-PH and showed that the duration of mechanical
ventilation, prolonged NICU stay, oligohydramnios, the use of
high frequency ventilation, SGA, sepsis, and severity of BPD
were significant risk factors; while birth weight and gestational
age were inversely related.
However, it is difficult to quantify the risk of developing
BPD-PH according to one single predictive factor due to
its low sensitivity and specificity. More importantly, PH
that complicates BPD is frequently multifactorial, including
perinatal stress, abnormal lung development, and postnatal
diseases. Thus, how to transform these risk factors into a riskbased scoring system could help develop an evidence-based
screening strategy for infants at high risk.
Prediction models by integrating multiple predictive factors
have been used frequently in other conditions, whereas, there
are few studies about prediction models for developing PH
in infants with BPD. In the study by Trittmann et al. (23),
they created a predictive model by combining both clinical and


-----

genetic data to predict the development of PH in patients with
BPD. An ROC analysis showed the AUC of the prediction model
of clinical data only, clinical and genetic data combined were
0.65 and 0.73, respectively. Due to the small cohort size of 20
cases of BPD-PH and 59 cases of BPD, the application of their
model is limited and further validation in a larger independent
prospective BPD cohort is needed. Compared with this study,
our prediction model has relatively higher discrimination, with
an AUC of 0.930.
In our prediction model, grade 3 BPD is the greatest
contributor to the risk of BPD-PH, followed by the duration
of hsPDA exposure, SGA, and early PH. The impact of the
severity of BPD on BPD-PH was variable in previous studies.
A few studies could not find an association between PH and the
severity of BPD (24). In contrast, Arjaans et al. (25) revealed
that infants with severe BPD were most at risk of developing
PH, with a relative risk (RR) doubled (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7, 4.2).
Our study reconfirms severe BPD as a strong risk factor for the
development of PH, compared with mild or moderate BPD.
As a provincial referral center, all the cases were transferred
from the maternal hospital or local hospital. Prolonged
mechanical ventilation requirement and hsPDA unresponsive
to pharmacologic therapy were common reasons for transport.
The longer duration of hsPDA exposure is associated with
the increasing risk of BPD in extremely preterm infants (26),
which elucidates that hsPDA may delay lung disease recovery.


Whether continued hsPDA exposure in infants with severe BPD
may exacerbate BPD-PH is uncertain. Some studies reported
no relationship between hsPDA and the development of BPDPH (8, 9). However, in these reports, hsPDA was considered a
categorical variable (present or absent) with no consideration
of its duration. In our study, we found infants in the BPD-PH
group were transferred to our unit much later than infants in
the no-PH group, which means infants with BPD-PH had longer
exposure to hsPDA. This also explained why univariable analysis
showed the PDA ligation rate was much higher in the BPD-PH
group than in the no-PH group because 76.3% of infants in the
BPD-PH group had hsPDA exposure for ≥ 28 days.
Small for gestational age (SGA) has been identified to
be a significant risk factor across some studies. Check et al.
(21) further evaluated the associations between birth weight
percentile and pulmonary hypertension at 36 weeks PMA in
infants with moderate or severe BPD. In this study, infants with
birth weights below the 25th percentile cutoff were at a higher
risk of developing BPD-PH.
An early injury to the developing lung can impair
angiogenesis and alveolarization, which results in the
simplification of distal lung airspace and the clinical
manifestations of BPD and PH. Previous prospective and
retrospective studies in preterm infants have revealed that early
PH is strongly associated with a high risk for the subsequent
development of BPD at 36 weeks PMA (7, 27), but the results


-----

were conflicting on the association between early PH and
the development of late PH (15, 28). However, evidence
about the relationship between early PH and late BPD-PH
is limited. In our cohort, early PH within 14 days of life is
identified to be the independent risk factor of BPD-PH, which
might improve the earlier detection and management of
patients with BPD-PH.
Antenatal corticosteroids are well-known interventions that
decrease the severity of RDS; however, the recent metaanalysis of the Cochrane Database shows that it is unclear if
antenatal corticosteroids have any effect on the risk of BPD
compared with placebo or no treatment (29). Neither of the
two meta-analyses by Nagiub et al. (22) and Arjaans et al.
(25) showed any effect of antenatal corticosteroids on BPD-PH.
In our study, though infants with BPD-PH had received less
antenatal corticosteroids, the p-value was above 0.05, we did
not apply antenatal corticosteroids to the multivariate logistic
regression analysis.
Presentations of BPD-PH are usually non-specific and easy
to be neglected. Hence, active screening and treatment are
recommended to minimize morbidity and mortality. Consensus
recommendations for PH screening in infants with BPD have
been developed by the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension
Network (PPHNet), a multidisciplinary panel of PH experts
(30). However, with the prediction model, it is possible to
estimate the risk of BPD-PH precisely and optimize the
utilization of medical resources. For patients with high risk, early
and frequent screenings for PH may be considered individually.
In addition, risk factors should be controlled more actively,
such as the prompt treatment of hsPDA and optimization of
respiratory support for those infants.
There are several limitations to our study. First, there
might be selection bias in this retrospective study because
we excluded infants without complete data or died before
36 weeks’ PMA. Echocardiograms were performed to evaluate
the hemodynamic status of PDA every 2 or 3 days for
very premature infants until PDA became hemodynamically
insignificant. HsPDA exposure is a continuous variable,
but we had to divide the cohort into four subgroups
because of our inability to precisely calculate the duration of
hsPDA (days). Second, only internal validation was performed
because of the single-center study, in which the differences
in epidemiology and clinical behavior that exist between
different centers were not considered. Furthermore, genomic
characteristics were not considered in our study. Genetic data
combining clinical characteristics may improve the prediction
model performance.
In conclusion, the prediction model based on the four
risk factors predicts the development of BPD-PH with
high sensitivity and specificity. External validation through
multicenter prospective studies is necessary to further assess the
generalizability of the prediction model.
