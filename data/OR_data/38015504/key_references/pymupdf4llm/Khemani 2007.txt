**ABSTRACT**


BACKGROUND. Although abnormal pulmonary vascular structure and function in
preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia may predispose infants to pulmonary artery hypertension, little is known about the characteristics and outcomes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary artery hypertension
in the surfactant era.

METHODS. We studied 42 premature infants (�32 weeks of gestation) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who were diagnosed as having pulmonary artery hypertension �2 months after birth, between 1998 and 2006, at a median age of 4.8
months. Pulmonary artery hypertension was graded through echocardiography
for all patients; 13 patients also underwent cardiac catheterization.

RESULTS. Eighteen (43%) of 42 patients had severe pulmonary artery hypertension
(systemic or suprasystemic right ventricular pressure). Among 13 patients who
underwent catheterization, the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 43 � 8
mm Hg and the pulmonary vascular resistance index was 9.9 � 2.8 Wood units. In
12 patients, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance improved with 100% oxygen and 80 ppm inhaled nitric oxide but remained elevated.
The pulmonary vascular resistance index decreased to 7.9 � 3.8 Wood units in
100% oxygen and to 6.4 � 3.1 Wood units with the addition of nitric oxide.
Sixteen patients (38%) died during the follow-up period. Estimated survival rates
were 64% � 8% at 6 months and 53% � 11% at 2 years after diagnosis of
pulmonary artery hypertension. In multivariate analyses, severe pulmonary artery
hypertension and small birth weight for gestational age were associated with
worse survival rates. Among 26 survivors (median follow-up period: 9.8 months),
pulmonary artery hypertension was improved, relative to its most severe level, in 24
patients (89%).

CONCLUSION. Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and severe pulmonary artery hypertension are at high risk of death, particularly during the first 6
months after diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension.

HE ADVENT OF exogenous surfactant therapy and
advances in critical care management have led to
# T
increased survival rates for premature infants but also
have changed the pathologic features and clinical course
of chronic lung disease of prematurity, known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Historically, oxygen
toxicity and ventilator-induced injury characterized
chronic lung disease in premature infants.[1,2] In the surfactant era, infants who are much less mature are surviving, and the normal sequence of lung development is
disrupted.[3] There are substantial histologic differences in
this “new” BPD, compared with the “old” BPD, including
reductions in the size and number of alveoli.[1,2,4–6] Respiratory morbidity is common in patients with BPD, who
often present with recurrent respiratory infections, airway hyperresponsiveness, and exercise intolerance.[7–10]

The pulmonary vasculature is also abnormal in infants with BPD. In conjunction with the abnormally
small size and number of gas exchange units in the lungs
of infants with BPD, there are deficiencies in the number
and size of intraacinar pulmonary arteries (PAs), which
are responsible for a significantly reduced total crosssectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed.[3,11,12] Although a wide range of vascular abnormalities may be
found in these patients, it is generally thought that the
reduction of the vascular cross-sectional area and alveolar hypoxia result in structural remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature.[3,6] Evidence also suggests increased
pulmonary vascular tone and heightened vasoreactivity
well beyond infancy in patients with BPD.[6]

Changes in neonatal intensive care practices have
contributed additional factors that predispose premature
infants to increased pulmonary vasoconstriction. With
recognition of the role of supplemental oxygen in retinopathy of prematurity, target oxygen saturations for
premature infants have decreased.[13,14] Premature infants
with BPD, and even those without, are known to experience significant severe hypoxemia.[15–17] Most of these
episodes occur with sleep and feeding and remain undetected with the usual methods modern NICUs use to
determine the need for supplemental oxygen therapy at
home.[18] These episodes of intermittent severe hypoxia
likely lead to increased pulmonary vascular tone, compounding the structural vascular abnormalities described
above.
Although the mechanisms responsible for elevated
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and altered reactivity remain incompletely understood, the development
of PA hypertension (PAH) is a recognized and sometimes
serious complication of BPD that can contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality rates for preterm
infants.[19,20] Despite the potential importance of PAH in
this patient population, relatively little is known about
the prevalence of and risk factors for PAH in formerly
premature infants with BPD. Several small reports concerning the clinical features and outcomes of patients


with PAH and BPD were published in the 1980s,[19,21–24]

before the routine use of surfactant, alternative modes of
mechanical ventilatory support, and adjunctive agents
such as inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and widespread concerns about oxygen toxicity.[3] Therefore, these series may
not reflect the population of patients surviving after
extremely premature birth today. The purpose of this
report is to describe the spectrum and outcomes of PAH
in formerly preterm infants with BPD in the current era.

**METHODS**

**Patients**
We ascertained patients who were born at an estimated
gestational age of �32 weeks, had BPD, and were diagnosed as having PAH between 1998 and 2006 at Children’s Hospital Boston or affiliated delivery hospitals
covered by the cardiology consultation service of Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. BPD was defined
as neonatal respiratory distress treated with mechanical
ventilation during the newborn period, with the characteristic radiographic findings of pulmonary hyperexpansion with scattered areas of atelectasis and focal emphysema and with a requirement for supplemental
oxygen therapy beyond 30 days of age.[2] BPD severity
was graded according to the summary recommendations
of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop as mild, moderate, or severe.[2]

PAH was diagnosed on the basis of elevated PA pressure
measured directly at the time of cardiac catheterization or
echocardiograms demonstrating elevated right ventricle
(RV) pressure. We included only patients with one or both
of these findings beyond the postnatal age of 2 months.
Electrocardiographic evidence of RV hypertrophy alone
was not sufficient for the diagnosis of PAH. Patients with
known structural airway or lung anomalies, congenital
anomalies of the PAs or pulmonary veins, major systemic
vessel-to-PA collateral vessels, congenital heart disease (except those with a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal
defect), severe liver disease, or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn were excluded. Patients were
also excluded if RV hypertension was diagnosed with echocardiography but a contemporaneous catheterization revealed normal RV pressure or if the diagnosis of elevated
RV pressure was made before the age of 2 months but
there was no subsequent echocardiogram or catheterization confirming persistently elevated RV pressure at �2
months of age.

**Echocardiography**
Standard cross-sectional and Doppler echocardiography
was performed for all patients. A full anatomic survey
was performed to evaluate cardiac and pulmonary vascular anatomic features. RV pressure was estimated
through continuous wave interrogation of the tricuspid


-----

regurgitant jet, if present, and calculation of a systolic
RV-to-right atrium pressure gradient by using the modified Bernoulli equation (pressure gradient � 4 � jet
velocity[2]). If no tricuspid regurgitation was present or if
the regurgitant jet could not be interrogated adequately,
then RV pressure was estimated on the basis of ventricular septal position and was related to systolic systemic
arterial pressure measured noninvasively or through direct arterial pressure monitoring if an arterial line was in
place. RV pressure assessed on the basis of septal position
was graded as �50% of the systemic pressure if the
interventricular septum was round at end-systole,
�50% but �100% of the systemic pressure if there was
end-systolic flattening of the interventricular septum,
and �100% of the systemic pressure if the interventricular septum bowed into the left ventricle at end-systole.[25] All echocardiograms were reviewed offline by a
single echocardiographer.

**Cardiac Catheterization and Vasoreactivity Testing**
For a subset of patients with specific clinical indications,
such as those with severe respiratory disease and severe
PAH on echocardiograms or with known or suspected
cardiovascular anomalies requiring further evaluation,
cardiac catheterization was performed with conscious
sedation or general anesthesia. Right heart and systemic
arterial pressures and saturations were measured directly. Pulmonary and systemic blood flows were estimated either with the Fick equation, by using assumed
oxygen consumption, or through thermodilution and
were indexed to body surface area. PVR indexed to body
surface area was calculated as PVR index (in Wood units

[WUs]) � (mean PA pressure � mean left atrial or PA
wedge pressure [in millimeters of mercury])/indexed
pulmonary blood flow (in liters per minute per meter[2]).
Pulmonary vascular reactivity was tested first by administering 100% oxygen and then by adding inhaled NO
(typically 80 ppm), repeating measurements, and recalculating cardiac index, pulmonary blood flow, and PVR.
Each condition was maintained for �10 minutes before
data acquisition.

**Pulmonary Artery Hypertension**
To allow for common categorization of PAH severity in
patients who underwent echocardiography alone and
those who underwent catheterization as well, PAH was
graded for all patients according to the scale of RV pressure estimated on the basis of septal position, that is,
normal, elevated but �50% of systemic pressure, �50%
but �100% of systemic pressure, or �100% of systemic
pressure. A patient was reported to have an improvement in the severity of PAH only if the estimated or
directly measured RV pressure decreased to a lower
grade. Similarly, a patient was reported to have progression of PAH only if the grade increased during the study
period.


**Data Analyses**
Outcomes assessed included survival, progression or improvement in severity of PAH, and reactivity to inhaled
pulmonary vasodilators. Independent variables assessed
included gestational age at birth, birth weight, small
birth weight for gestational age (�3rd percentile), duration of mechanical ventilation, use of high-frequency
ventilation, tracheostomy, patent ductus arteriosus
treated with indomethacin or surgery, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrostomy tube placement, grade III or IV
intraventricular hemorrhage, method of delivery, maternal hypertension, maternal age, multiple-gestation
pregnancy, and oligohydramnios. Independent variables
were also analyzed for association with severe PAH. In
survival analyses, severity of PAH was treated as an
independent variable. For comparison of continuous and
categorical variables between groups, the independentsamples t test and Fisher’s exact test, respectively, were
used. For comparison of hemodynamic data before and
after vasoreactivity testing during cardiac catheterization,
paired t test analysis was performed, with adjustment for
multiple comparisons. Time-dependent outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis, with comparisons between factors using the log-rank test, and with multivariate
Cox regression analysis. Data are presented as mean � SD,
median and range, or frequency. Odds ratios are presented
with 95% confidence intervals.
The study was approved by the Children’s Hospital
Committee on Clinical Investigation. We had full access
to the data and take full responsibility for its integrity.

**RESULTS**

**Patients**
A total of 42 premature infants (21 male and 21 female)
with BPD were diagnosed as having PAH between 1998
and 2006 and met the inclusion criteria for this study. The
median gestational age at birth was 26 weeks (range:
23–32 weeks), and the median birth weight was 701 g
(range: 355–1320 g). Eleven patients (26%) were small for
gestational age (SGA) at birth, defined as weight of �3rd
percentile for the estimated gestational age. The majority of
patients were born at other hospitals and transported to
Children’s Hospital for additional treatment (Table 1). Demographic and diagnostic characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1.

**Pulmonary Artery Hypertension**
PAH was diagnosed at a median postnatal age of 4.8
months (range: 2.6–79 months), with all except 4 patients (2 with severe PAH and 2 with mild PAH) being

pertrophy. At the time of diagnosis, RV systolic pressure
was systemic or suprasystemic for 15 patients (36%),
�50% but �100% of systemic pressure for 23 (55%),
and elevated but �50% of systemic pressure for 4 (9%).
For 8 patients, the severity of PAH progressed at some
point during the study period; for 28 patients, a decrease
in the grade of PAH was observed and was sustained at
the most recent follow-up evaluation. Of the 42 patients,
18 (43%) were observed to have systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure at some point during the study period.
Patients who were SGA at birth were significantly more
likely to have systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure
than were patients with birth weights above the 3rd
percentile for age (8 of 11 patients [73%] vs 10 of 31
patients [32%]; odds ratio: 5.6; 95% confidence interval:
1.2–25.7; P � .03).

**Pulmonary Vascular Reactivity**
Hemodynamic data obtained during catheterization are
summarized in Table 2. For all 13 patients who underwent catheterization, pulmonary vascular reactivity testing was performed with 100% oxygen (n � 12) and/or
80 ppm inhaled NO (n � 13). At baseline, the average
mean PA pressure was 43 � 8 mm Hg, the average PVR
index was 9.9 � 2.8 WUs, and the average PVR/systemic
vascular resistance ratio was 0.51 � 0.18. For 12 of 13
patients, PA pressure and PVR decreased with vasodilator testing but remained elevated (Table 2). When indexed PVR decreased, the majority of the change (to


7.9 � 3.8 WUs; 29% � 28% decrease from baseline) was
observed with administration of 100% oxygen, with an
additional small decrease (to 6.4 � 3.1 WUs) after the
addition of inhaled NO (Fig 1). In 1 case, PVR did not
change with hyperoxia but decreased �30% after the
addition of inhaled NO. Overall, there was a significant
decrease in PVR in response to 100% oxygen, compared
with baseline values. With the addition of 80 ppm of
inhaled NO, the mean PA pressure, RV systolic pressure,
and PVR/systemic vascular resistance ratio also decreased to levels significantly lower than at baseline.
With a single exception, the only patients for whom
PVR normalized (�4 WUs) with vasodilator testing were
3 patients with secundum atrial septal defects, in whom
PA pressure remained elevated but left-right shunting
and pulmonary blood flow increased. For these 3 patients, the pulmonary/systemic blood flow ratio increased from 1.1 to 1.3 at baseline to 1.7 to 2.1 with
100% oxygen and 80 ppm inhaled NO.
Among patients diagnosed as having PAH through
echocardiography alone, 4 had �1 study during which
serial evaluation was performed before and after addition of inhaled NO, in the cardiac ICU. Two of those
patients had lower RV pressure while receiving inhaled
NO than before the addition of NO.

of PAH, at a median age of 10.9 months (range: 5.1–101
months). Sixteen patients (38%) died during the follow-up period, 13 within 2 months after diagnosis. For
14 of those patients, PAH was determined to be a proximate contributing factor to death, often in concert with
respiratory failure; the other 2 patients had relatively
mild PAH (�50% of systemic pressure) and died as a
result of respiratory failure (n � 1) or sepsis (n � 1).
By Kaplan-Meier analysis, survival rates after diagnosis
were 85% � 6% at 1 month, 70% � 7% at 2 months,
64% � 8% at 6 months, 61% � 8% at 1 year, and 52% �
11% at 2 and 3 years (Fig 2A). Independent variables that
were associated significantly with or approached significance for association with shorter survival times in logrank testing included severe PAH (systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure) at any time during the study period (P
� .003), SGA status (birth weight of �3rd percentile for
age) (P � .03), previous support with high-frequency ventilation at any time (P � .05), and systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure at the time of PAH diagnosis (P � .065).
Of note, severe BPD was not associated with worse survival
rates. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, severe PAH
(systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure) at any time during
the study period (P � .003) was the only independent
predictor of shorter survival times, although SGA status
approached significance (P � .07). The multivariate Cox
regression models were also performed while controlling
for gestational age, SGA, and severity of BPD, and the


presence of systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure at any
time during the study period remained a significant independent predictor of shorter survival times. As depicted in
Fig 2B, survival rates determined through Kaplan-Meier
analysis for patients with systemic or suprasystemic RV
pressure were 65% � 12% at 1 month, 44% � 12% at 6
months, 37% � 12% at 1 year, and 25% � 13% at 2 and
3 years; for patients with less-than-severe PAH, survival
rates were 100% at 1 month and 78% � 9% at �6
months.

**Follow-up Findings and Management**
Among 26 surviving patients, the median duration of
follow-up monitoring was 9.8 months (range: 1–98
months) after the diagnosis of PAH. RV pressure was
normal in 5 of those patients (19%), �50% of systemic pressure in 16 (62%), �50% but �100% of
systemic pressure in 3 (12%), and �100% of systemic
pressure in 2 (8%). The severity of PAH was improved
for 24 of those patients (89%), compared with the
most-severe level of PAH. Seven patients with severe
PAH at any time during the study period were alive at
the most recent follow-up evaluation. Two of those
patients continued to have RV pressure �100% of
systemic pressure, 1 had RV pressure �50% but
�100% of systemic pressure, and 4 had RV pressure
�50% of systemic pressure, 2 of whom had atrial
septal defects that had been closed.

**DISCUSSION**

**Spectrum and Outcomes of PAH in Infants and Children**
**With BPD**
The prevalence of PAH in formerly premature infants
with BPD is not known.[4,26,27] In this study, we reviewed
our experience from 1998 to 2006 with 42 infants with
BPD for whom a diagnosis of PAH was confirmed
through echocardiography and/or cardiac catheterization at �2 months of age. The spectrum of PAH in these
patients was wide; almost one half had severe PAH, with
systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure, whereas 4 had
only mild PAH, with RV pressure �50% of systemic
pressure, and the remainder had RV pressure between
50% and 100% of systemic pressure. The mortality rate
was high, with only 64% � 8% surviving 6 months after
the diagnosis of PAH. As might be expected, the survival
rate was significantly worse among patients with severe
PAH, and there was a trend toward worse outcomes
among infants who were SGA at birth. Among surviving


patients, most demonstrated some degree of improvement in PAH during the follow-up period.
Little is known about risk factors for PAH among
formerly premature infants with BPD, but there are
several published reports concerning the clinical features
and outcomes of such patients. Most of those were small
series that included primarily infants born in the 1980s,
before the routine use of surfactant and alternative
modes of mechanical ventilation and widespread concerns about oxygen toxicity. Therefore, these reports
may not reflect the characteristics and treatment of patients surviving after extremely premature birth in the
current era. A study published by Fouron et al[22] in 1980,
for example, showed a mortality rate of 50% in infants
with BPD who had PAH at �4 months of life. In 2
separate reports of patients with BPD evaluated with
cardiac catheterization, Berman et al[23] reported mean PA
pressures as high as 89 mm Hg at 10 to 28 months of age
and persistently elevated PA pressures at a mean age of
5.8 years.[4] Abman et al[21] reported an average mean PA
pressure of 48 mm Hg in a series of 6 young children
with BPD who underwent cardiac catheterization. These
reports, published �2 decades ago, demonstrated that
elevated PA pressure may be a long-term and significant
problem in preterm infants with BPD. More recently,
Subhedar and Shaw[28] demonstrated that premature infants with BPD had higher echocardiographically derived PA pressures than did premature infants without
BPD.
Patients with BPD and PAH in the setting of an atrial
septal defect are a clinically distinct subgroup. Of 3 such
patients in this series, 2 had severe PAH but were highly
reactive to 100% oxygen and inhaled NO and had RV
pressure �50% of systemic pressure after closure of the
atrial septal defect.

**Anatomic and Functional Factors Contributing to PAH in**
**Infants With BPD**
Intrinsic and secondary abnormalities of the pulmonary
circulation in premature infants with BPD may predispose the infants to PAH. BPD associated with prematurity in the surfactant era is characterized by inhibition of
lung development, with altered structure, growth, and
function of the distal airspaces and vasculature. Although intrinsic abnormalities of lung growth and function have been characterized, the vasculature of the
immature lung is also susceptible to the injury that is
seen in BPD.[3,12,29] For example, endothelial cells are especially vulnerable to injury via hyperoxia and inflammation, which may contribute to smooth muscle cell
proliferation and incorporation of myofibroblasts into
the vessel wall.[11,12] Structural abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature lead to narrowing of vessel diameters and decreased vascular compliance. Decreased angiogenesis is another consequence of BPD and may


-----

contribute to reduced vascular cross-sectional area.[3]

Functionally, these factors contribute to elevated PVR.
The pulmonary circulation in patients with BPD is
abnormally responsive to oxygen and other pulmonary
vasodilators and may remain so long beyond infancy.[3,6,21,23] In 1985, Abman et al[21] demonstrated significant
decreases in PA pressure in response to high concentrations of inspired oxygen, with similar benefits conferred
by lower levels of supplemental oxygen. A study by
Mourani et al,[6] however, indicated that a subset of this
population receiving oxygen therapy would continue to
have elevated baseline PA pressure, as well as the clinical
symptoms associated with PAH. With the addition of
inhaled NO to 100% oxygen, their patients experienced
additional improvement in PA pressure and PVR, in
many cases to normal or nearly normal levels.[6] In the
present study, we found that 100% inspired oxygen
significantly decreased PVR but not mean PA pressure
and the addition of inhaled NO led to additional improvement. Other investigators demonstrated improvement in PVR in patients with BPD and PAH in response
to prostacyclin[12,20] and variable responsiveness to calcium channel blockers.[6,30]

**Evaluation of PAH in Infants With BPD**
The prevalence of and risk factors for PAH in infants
with BPD are not known, which complicates the development of an effective screening strategy. In the present
study, almost one half of the 18 patients with systemic or
suprasystemic RV pressure were SGA, which suggests
that SGA infants may be at increased risk for severe PAH.
There was also an association between severe PAH and
severe lung disease, on the basis of the fact that previous
high-frequency ventilation, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and tracheostomy were more prevalent among
patients with severe PAH than among those without
severe PAH. However, it is not clear whether this association is an indication of increased PAH among patients
with severe BPD or vice versa.
Appropriate screening guidelines for PAH in premature infants do not currently exist, which may have
important clinical implications, such as missed or delayed diagnoses. In this study, for example, 4 patients
were diagnosed as having PAH at �1 year of age, including 2 with severe PAH. Development of a suitable
screening strategy is complicated by a lack of information about the true prevalence of PAH in patients with
BPD and uncertainty about the optimal methods of and
criteria for screening. Electrocardiography may reveal
evidence of RV hypertrophy in many patients with RV
hypertension. However, a recent study found that electrocardiography had a sensitivity of only 67% and a
positive predictive value of 69% for detecting echocardiographically documented RV hypertrophy in children
undergoing evaluation for PAH.[31] These findings mirror
our own clinical experience and suggest that electrocar

diography alone is insufficient to screen for PAH in
infants with BPD. Echocardiography also has limitations
as a screening strategy for PAH in this population. In the
absence of tricuspid regurgitation, a subjective estimation of septal flattening is the only method of determining RV pressure elevation. Unsedated imaging of active
infants may limit the extent and validity of data that can
be acquired, whereas sedation of infants with underlying
BPD has attendant risks (albeit small).
Indications to screen for PAH in infants with BPD may
include evaluation before attempted weaning from oxygen supplementation or assessment of the need for
additional prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus. Many premature infants do not qualify for a second
season of palivizumab in the absence of associated cardiac disease.[32,33] Among all forms of congenital cardiovascular disease, PAH is associated with the most significant risk of morbidity resulting from respiratory
syncytial virus infection.[33–35]

Our current approach is to recommend echocardiographic screening for PAH in premature infants with
BPD who meet any of the following criteria: (1) extreme
prematurity (gestational age at birth of �25 weeks or
birth weight of �600 g), (2) SGA, (3) requirement for
prolonged mechanical ventilatory support (duration depends on age), (4) oxygen requirement out of proportion to the severity of lung disease, or (5) persistent poor
growth despite adequate caloric intake. For patients born
at �28 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight of
�1000 g, for whom we estimate the risk of severe PAH
to be lower, a screening electrocardiogram may be more
cost-effective, despite the limitations described earlier.
Cardiac catheterization is typically reserved for patients
with severe respiratory disease and severe PAH on echocardiograms or for patients with known or suspected
cardiovascular anomalies that may require additional
evaluation. Prospective studies to determine risk factors
for PAH among infants with BPD are needed to develop
more-sensitive and more-specific screening guidelines.

**Treatment of PAH in Infants and Children With BPD**
The goal of therapy for PAH in children with BPD depends on the severity of the disease. For patients with
severe PAH, acute treatment is aimed at increasing the
chances of survival and must work in concert with respiratory support. The objectives of therapy for patients
with less-severe PAH and those who are recovering from
severe disease include minimizing exacerbation and
morbidity while supporting pulmonary growth and development of the child. Ultimately, pulmonary growth
may be the definitive remedy for BPD-associated PAH.
Appropriate therapy includes excluding causes of prolonged or intermittent hypoxemia other than underlying
BPD in this population. Overnight oximetry studies may
help diagnose hypoxic episodes, and a sleep study or
pneumogram can determine whether hypoxia is attrib

-----

utable to central, obstructive, or mixed apnea, which
may be treated by means other than supplemental oxygen therapy.
Long-term supplemental oxygen therapy is considered the standard treatment for PAH associated with
BPD.[3] Concerns about the adverse effects of supplemental oxygen treatment have complicated the issue and
may prompt accelerated removal of oxygen therapy.
Target systemic arterial oxygen saturations in premature
infants remain controversial, but we recommend saturations of �93% for all premature infants and �95% for
infants with documented PAH. Data showing persistent
elevation of PA pressure beyond infancy and early childhood in formerly premature infants with BPD,[6,24] along
with pulmonary vascular responsiveness to low doses of
oxygen, support maintaining supplemental oxygen therapy for infants and children with BPD and PAH. For
patients with a history of PAH, removal of oxygen
should be gradual and should be completed only after an
overnight oximetry study confirms that saturations can
be maintained above target levels. RV pressure should be
monitored with serial echocardiography until it has normalized and remained so for several months after supplemental oxygen therapy has been removed and until
the patient has demonstrated an ability to maintain normal oxygen saturation without supplemental oxygen.
Reactivity to inhaled NO in this and previous studies
suggests the use of NO in an acute setting, a recommendation that may be supported by recent studies suggesting a beneficial effect of NO on neurodevelopmental
outcomes for premature infants.[36] Improved pulmonary
hemodynamic features in response to inhaled NO also
provide an impetus to study the utility of mechanistically
similar enteral agents, such as sildenafil.

**Limitations**
This study is limited by its retrospective design. All patients with BPD at our institution did not undergo echocardiography during the study period, and it is likely that
patients with milder elevations in RV pressure did not
receive diagnoses, particularly patients whose primary
follow-up care was outside our system. Because premature infants with severe lung disease are at risk for death
resulting from a variety of conditions, it is possible that
patients with severe PAH and severe lung disease were
not ascertained if they died as a result of respiratory
disease, infection, and/or other factors. Similarly, the
frequent association between severe lung disease and
severe PAH complicates the assessment of the relationship between PAH severity and survival rates, and our
cohort might not have been sufficiently powered to
identify independent survival effects of these 2 factors.

**CONCLUSIONS**
The mortality rate associated with PAH in formerly premature infants with BPD is high. Although risk factors


for PAH among infants with BPD are not well defined,
premature infants who were SGA at birth were disproportionately represented among our cohort of patients
with severe PAH, which supports the hypothesis that
SGA status may predispose infants with BPD to PAH.
Similarly, there seemed to be an association between
severe PAH and more-severe lung disease, although severe PAH was associated with worse survival rates even
when analyses were controlled for the severity of BPD.
Additional studies are needed to determine risk factors
for PAH among infants with BPD and to formulate effective screening strategies and treatment protocols.

“Van Jones is a rare bird. He’s a black social activist in Oakland, CA, and as
green an environmentalist as they come. He really gets passionate, and funny,
when he talks about what it’s like to be black and green: ‘Try this experiment.
Go knock on someone’s door in West Oakland, Watts or Newark and say:
“We gotta really big problem!” They say: “We do? We do?” “Yeah, we gotta
really big problem!” “We do? We do?” “Yeah, we gotta save the polar bears!
You may not make it out of this neighborhood alive, but we gotta save the
polar bears!”’ Mr. Jones then just shakes his head. You try that approach on
people without jobs who live in neighborhoods where they’ve got a lot better
chance of getting killed by a passing shooter than a melting glacier, you’re
going to get nowhere—and without bringing America’s underclass into the
green movement, it’s going to get nowhere, too. ‘We need a different onramp’ for people from disadvantaged communities, says Mr. Jones.”
