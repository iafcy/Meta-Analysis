**Abstract**
**Hypothesis Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at increased risk of secondary pulmonary hyper-**
tension (BPD-PH). Prior studies yielded mixed results on the utility of echocardiographic screening at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). We present our experience using echocardiographic screening at the time of BPD diagnosis to identify
infants at highest risk of BPD-PH at discharge.
**Materials and Methods Retrospective cohort analysis of clinical/ demographic data and screening echocardiograms in**
patients with BPD. Discharge echocardiograms identified infants with or without BPD-PH at discharge. 36 weeks PMA
screening echocardiograms and clinical data were then reviewed to identify which factors were associated with increased
odds of BPD-PH at discharge. Associations between echocardiographic findings were evaluated with 2- and 3-variable
models to predict increased risk of BPD-PH at discharge.
**Results In our cohort of 64 infants with severe BPD, BPD-PH was present in 22/64 (34%) infants at discharge. There were**
no clinical differences at time of 36 weeks PMA screening evaluation (mean PMA 36.6 ± 2.9 weeks). PH at screening was
poorly predictive of PH at discharge as PH at screening resolved in 49% of patients. However, having an ASD, RV dilation,
hypertrophy, or reduced function on screening, especially in combination, were associated with BPD-PH at discharge.
**Conclusion In our cohort of premature infants with BPD, 36 weeks PMA screening echocardiogram identified patients at**
increased risk for BPD-PH at discharge when ASD, RVH, or impaired RV function were present. Larger prospective studies
are indicated to validate these findings.

Neonatal care and outcomes have steadily improved over
recent decades, with average survival-to-discharge rates
improving to 62% for infants born at 24 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) and to 92% at 28 weeks PMA [1].

Concurrently, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has risen, with up to 68% of infants born before
29 weeks PMA diagnosed with BPD prior to discharge from
the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [1]. Of particular
concern in patients with BPD is the development of secondary pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH), which has been
described in 18–30% in recent reports [2–6] and associated
with a 16% in-NICU and 40% 2-year mortality rate in a
recent meta-analysis [7]. Furthermore, recent studies have
demonstrated worse neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature infants with BPD-PH compared to their peers with
BPD but no PH [8, 9].
Recent screening guidelines of premature infants with
BPD for PH have been published by the American Heart
Association/American Thoracic Society (AHA/ATS)
and Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet). The predominant recommendations are to obtain

echocardiograms focused on evidence of PH and related
dysfunction at 36 weeks PMA when BPD is diagnosed, or
sooner in patients with prolonged ventilator need or recurrent hypoxia [10, 11]. Echocardiographic assessment of
RV function in premature infants with BPD has identified
several measures, including tricuspid annular plane systolic
excursion (TAPSE), right ventricular fractional area change
(RV FAC), and left ventricular eccentricity index in systole,
which correlate with worse outcomes in premature infants
with BPD and PH [12–15]. Despite these guidelines, regimented screening has not been widely implemented; a survey of neonatologists in 2017 found only 38% had routine
institutional screening protocols for PH in premature infants
with BPD [16].
While multiple studies have examined the BPD population for predictive risk factors for BPD-PH, it is not entirely
clear what besides severity of BPD predisposes patients to
BPD-PH [3, 17–20]. We evaluated our institution’s experience with screening premature infants with BPD. Given
varied findings in scientific literature, we evaluated whether
clinical factors or echocardiographic data present at BPD
diagnosis could identify patients at the highest risk of BPDPH at time of death or NICU discharge.

### Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted
to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the University of Virginia Health System Women’s and Children’s Hospital, a
level IV nursery, in Charlottesville, Virginia. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University
of Virginia. As a retrospective cohort study posing minimal
risk, consent was waived.

#### Population

Premature infants < 36 weeks PMA discharged from the University of Virginia Health System NICU between January 1,
2016 and September 1, 2019 with a discharge diagnosis in
the medical record of BPD or Chronic Lung Disease (CLD)
were considered for study inclusion. BPD was defined using
the NIH consensus criteria [20]. Patients were excluded
if they did not have both a screening echocardiogram at
36 weeks PMA and a pre-discharge echocardiogram; if they
had genetic syndromes potentially contributing to lung disease severity; congenital heart disease beyond atrial septal
defect (ASD), small ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent
ductus arteriosus (PDA), or single-vein partial anomalous
pulmonary venous return (PAPVR); or if they were transferred to another NICU prior to discharge home; as PH status at discharge could not be verified.

Our institutional protocol was to screen infants diagnosed with BPD who had need for supplemental O2 or
positive pressure ventilation (moderate or severe BPD by
NIH criteria) at 36 weeks PMA. Screening was generally
delayed by the NICU team if patients were actively ill,
such as during a pneumonia or sepsis requiring antibiotics so as to assess their risk for PH at their baseline. Follow-up screening was planned in protocol-based intervals
determined by the results of the initial screening echocardiogram and clinical status. Infants without BPD-PH
on 36 weeks PMA screening echocardiogram who were
otherwise doing well had repeat screening in 2 months.
These patients were generally ready for discharge before
that point and were usually discharged without a followup echocardiogram with close follow-up. Those with evidence of elevated RV pressures but without signs of RV
dysfunction had repeat echocardiograms within a month.
If PH and RV dysfunction were present, lung disease was
optimized, and pulmonary vasodilators were started with
follow-up echocardiogram within a week. Patients with
more significant lung disease or who stayed more than
4 weeks after initial screening echocardiogram routinely
had a discharge echocardiogram.

#### Diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension

PH was defined as an RV systolic pressure (RVSp) greater
than half the systemic systolic pressure (SSp), as determined by a full Doppler envelope of shunting across a
PDA or VSD, or by a full Doppler envelope of tricuspid
regurgitation, if no shunting could be measured. Patients
with right-to-left or bidirectional shunting at any level
(ASD, VSD, or PDA) or interventricular septal flattening
in systole were also considered to have PH. These definitions were chosen based on prior studies using the same
diagnostic criteria [3, 15].

#### Data Collection

**Clinical Data**

Antenatal and perinatal data, as well as outcomes of the
NICU stay were collected from the University of Virginia
Health System electronic medical record and are demonstrated in Table 1 below. BNP levels were obtained at
closest planned lab draw to screening echocardiogram.
Included in the NICU clinical data were admission temperature and highest base deficit in the first 24 h to calculate a CRIB II score, a standardized risk assessment of
mortality for premature infants [21].

All 36 weeks PMA screening and discharge echocardiograms were reviewed. Echocardiograms were obtained following a specific protocol to assess for pulmonary hypertension. All echocardiographic measures were obtained
from the official echocardiographic interpretation by BM.
Echocardiograms were obtained on the Philips Epiq platform and stored on a Philips’ Xcelera server. Patients were
identified based on the discharge diagnosis of BPD. Screening and final echocardiograms were reviewed prior to any
medical record data to blind the reviewer to their clinical
outcomes. Qualitative assessment of any shunts and right
heart appearance and function were included. Quantitative
assessment of right ventricular function consistently undertaken included measurement of tricuspid valve regurgitant
jets, PDA or VSD shunting, RV FAC, and eccentricity indices in systole and diastole. Pulmonary vein assessment for
pulmonary vein stenosis was performed. The data collected
within the pulmonary hypertension echocardiogram protocol used changed midway through the study to include
several additional validated measures of right ventricular
function including tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and right ventricular free wall tissue doppler imaging (RV TDI), which was also used to calculate


myocardial performance index (MPI). Pulmonary artery
acceleration time was a late addition to the protocol and as
such, was not collected in this study. As 30–60% of patients
had these measurements recorded, these were felt to be inadequately powered in this study and are not included in the
data presented.

#### Statistical Analysis

Demographic, perinatal, NICU, and echocardiographic
parameters on 36 weeks PMA screening echocardiogram
were compared between those with and without PH at discharge. A power calculation using a conservative assumed
BPD-PH incidence of approximately 30% in premature
infants with BPD yielded a necessary sample size of n = 46
patients for α = 0.05 and 80% power. Categorical values were
compared with Chi-squared tests. Continuous variables were
compared with the Kruskal–Wallis test. Odds ratios were
estimated from univariate logistic regression using Firth’s
method. Multivariate logistic regression was used to build
models of variables from screening echocardiograms that
could be used to identify patients with the highest risk
of having PH at discharge. Based on the common rule of
thumb, 2- and 3-variable models were created so as not to
overfit the data [22, 23]. Models were limited to variables

reliably obtained in most studies, with all included variables
observed in at least 62 of 64 cases. A c-index was calculated
for each model, with c-indices > 0.8 being considered excellent for discrimination. A p-value of < 0.05 was used for
statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

### Results

Chart review using the discharge diagnoses of BPD or
CLD yielded 256 patients, of whom 85 had both screening and discharge echocardiograms. Twenty-one patients
were excluded for transfer from the NICU prior to discharge
(n = 3) or significant congenital heart disease (n = 18) (pulmonary valve stenosis (7), tetralogy of Fallot (3), atrioventricular canal defect (2), aortic stenosis (2), coarctation (2),
and a large VSD requiring PA banding (2)). In total, 25 of 64
(39%) patients had a PDA or VSD at some point in our study,
of which 5 PDAs and one VSD closed, and 3 PDAs were
closed percutaneously. Our study population was ultimately
comprised sixty-four patients with BPD who had both a
screening echocardiogram for BPD-PH at approximately
36 weeks PMA and a separate discharge echocardiogram.
Figure 1 describes the breakdown of these 64 patients by
their pulmonary hypertension status both at their screening
echocardiogram and NICU discharge. Thirty-five patients
had PH at screening; in 17 (49%) of them it resolved by
discharge. Another 4 patients had no BPD-PH on screening
echocardiogram but had it at discharge. The small sizes of
individual groups unfortunately precluded significant subgroup analysis due to inadequate power. The diagnosis of PH
was made on 59 studies based on PDA in 25, VSD shunting

in 4, right-to-left shunting in 4, TR jet in 10, and interventricular septal flattening alone in 16 patients.
Table 1 demonstrates clinical and perinatal data for the
entire study population and a comparison between infants
with and without PH at discharge. There were no statistically significant differences between the cohorts. The overall study population was extremely premature and approximately 25% were deemed to have SGA and IUGR status. All
patients included in the study had severe BPD at the time of
their screening echocardiogram by NIH consensus criteria
(all had > 30% FiO2 or positive pressure ventilation). The
study population required nearly 3 months of invasive positive pressure ventilation and 7 weeks of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, more than half experienced episodes of culture-positive sepsis, 20% experienced an episode
of necrotizing enterocolitis, and a third (34%) had a PDA
treated with medication or catheterization-based closure. In
total, 4 patients underwent PDA closure and 1 patient underwent ASD closure after their screening echocardiogram. The
patient with percutaneous ASD closure and 3 patients with
percutaneous PDA closure had BPD-PH at screening; all 4
of these patients had hemodynamic PH prior to shunt closure. The final PDA closure patient had RV systolic pressures approximately 40% of the recorded systemic systolic
pressure. BPD-PH resolved prior to discharge in the patient
with ASD closure and two patients with PDA closure.
Table 2 is a comparison of outcomes between the groups
with and without BPD-PH at discharge. Though infants with
BPD-PH at discharge were significantly more likely to be
discharged with diuretic therapy, there was no difference
in tracheostomy or supplemental oxygen use at discharge.
LOS between the two groups was not significantly different
when mortalities were excluded (159 ± 79 vs 153 ± 54 days,

with a PDA or VSD at discharge needed diuretics. Those
who died while in the NICU were more likely to have BPDPH at time of death (5 (23%) vs 2 (5%), p = 0.029).
Our institutional practice was to optimize lung disease as
much as possible and initiate pulmonary vasodilators only in
the setting of RV dysfunction causing secondary end-organ
dysfunction. Ten total patients were initiated on pulmonary
vasodilators in the NICU, including the three patients who
improved after ASD or PDA closure. All three of these
patients were weaned off pulmonary vasodilators prior to
discharge, as was one other patient. Six of the ten patients
were discharged on pulmonary vasodilators, all of whom had


evidence of PH at discharge. Four patients were on sildenafil monotherapy (2 mg/kg/dose every 6 h; max dose 10 mg
every 6 h). Two additional patients were on sildenafil at the
above dose and bosentan (2 mg/kg/dose twice daily).
Table 3 demonstrates data from the screening echocardiograms, which were performed at a mean PMA of
36.6 ± 2.9 weeks (range 34 + 5 days–38 + 3 days). Two
patients were echoed before 35 weeks PMA, at which time
both were over 8 weeks old, receiving invasive positive
pressure ventilation and demonstrated acute clinical worsening. As these patients already met NIH criteria for BPD
diagnosis, they were included in our cohort. Discharge
echocardiograms were undertaken at a median of 5 days
(range 1–41 days) prior to discharge. On 36 weeks PMA

echocardiogram, 55% of patients had evidence of BPD-PH.
Of those who continued to have PH at discharge, screening
echocardiograms demonstrated a higher RV systolic pressure (RVSp; 55.6 vs 42.9 mmHg, p = 0.017) and RV systolic to systemic pressure ratio (RVSp:SSp; 0.75 ± 0.25 vs
0.56 ± 0.14, p = 0.017). They were also more likely to have a
small or moderate secundum ASD (64% vs 29%, p = 0.007)
and receive qualitative descriptions of RV hypertrophy (63%
vs 26%, p = 0.012), RV dilation (59% vs 31%, p = 0.009) and
impaired RV function (63% vs 26%, p = 0.03). None of our
cohort demonstrated spectral Doppler evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis.
There was more quantitative evidence of RV dysfunction as evidenced by a lower RV fractional area change
(27% ± 8% vs 36% ± 8%, _p = < 0.001) in patients with_
BPD-PH at discharge. While main pulmonary artery (MPA)
measurements were not significantly different, Z-scores were
higher in patients with BPD-PH at discharge (+ 0.9 ± 1.21
vs + 0.16 ± 0.95, z = 0.048). BNP levels at 36 weeks PMA
screening were higher in those with PH at discharge
(171.1 ± 208.4 vs 68.8 ± 73 pg/mL, p = 0.035).
As anticipated, (see Supplemental Table 1) the presence
of an ASD was associated with RV dilation (35% RV dilation with ASD vs 24% RV dilation without ASD, p = 0.001).
The presence of an ASD was also associated with higher
eccentricity index in diastole (1.30 vs 1.12, _p < 0.001)._
However, there was no association between BNP levels and
the presence or absence of an ASD (114 ± 166 vs 94 ± 118,
_p = 0.76)._
Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed on
screening echocardiogram measurements and are displayed
in Table 4. Qualitative screening echocardiogram evidence
of RV hypertrophy (OR 4.6, CI (1.6–14.0)), RV dilation (OR
3.1, (CI 1.1–9.0)), qualitatively impaired RV function (OR
6.4, (CI 1.2–33.3)) or the presence of an ASD (OR 4.2 (CI
1.4–12.4)) were associated with increased odds of PH at
discharge. Any 1% decrease in right ventricular fractional
area change was associated with a 1.18 (95% CI 1.08, 1.28,
_p < 0.001) increase in the odds of BPD-PH at discharge. This_
was true across the RV FAC spectrum. A receiver-operator
curve was constructed for RV fractional area change with an
AUROC of 0.79. A best-fit point of 30.4% yielded a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.82, which is in keeping
with previously published data on RV FAC in premature
infants [12].
Multivariate logistic regression modeling utilizing
impaired RV FAC and presence of an ASD was the strongest 2-variable model predicting BPD-PH at NICU discharge (RV FAC odds ratios 1.17 (CI 1.08–1.28) and ASD
odds ratio 4.21 (CI 1.13–15.6); c-index = 0.859). In this
model, for every decrease in RV FAC by 1% the odds of PH
increased by 1.17. The strongest 3-variable model added
the qualitative presence of RVH to RV FAC and ASD (RV

### Discussion

Our retrospective cohort study of premature infants with
severe BPD demonstrated that guideline-recommended PH
screening protocols can help identify those patients with
BPD at greatest risk for PH at discharge. Although neither
the perinatal nor clinical courses differed between groups
at the time of their 36 weeks PMA evaluations, echocardiographic determinations of pulmonary hypertension, right
ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy or the presence of
an ASD were associated with BPD-PH at NICU discharge,
which itself was associated with higher use of diuretic
medications and higher in-NICU mortality. Using this data,
we were able to construct novel models that suggest these
factors as particularly high risk for BPD-PH at discharge
when in combination. Interestingly, a subset of patients with
normal screening echocardiograms later demonstrated PH
on their pre-discharge echocardiograms, which is in keeping with a previous natural history study showing a median
PMA at diagnosis of 42 weeks [6].
The highly variable clinical progression from BPD to
BPD-PH and its associated morbidity and mortality rates
underscore the need for ongoing PH screening in premature infants with BPD. Several perinatal risk factors such as


-----

pre-eclampsia, premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, SGA, prolonged mechanical ventilation, NEC, and
sepsis have been associated with the development of PH in
premature infants [3, 5, 15], but when focusing on patients
with severe BPD (as all our cohort were), none of these
factors identified those at greater risk for PH at discharge,
consistent with other studies [4, 24]. Further representing the
unpredictable nature of BPD-PH was the fact that 18% of
our cohort with BPD-PH at discharge had normal 36 weeks
PMA screening echocardiograms and that 49% of those with
PH at screening had demonstrated resolution by discharge
(17/35), which was consistent with previously reported data

[6]. These data emphasize the need for regimented, longitudinal PH screening for infants with BPD.
Our analyses of 36 weeks PMA screening echocardiograms identified several findings associated with increased
risk of PH at discharge. Qualitative evidence of RV hypertrophy, dilation, or impaired function, the presence of a
secundum ASD, or objective data demonstrating higher
BNP, larger MPA Z-scores, higher RV to systemic systolic
pressure ratio, and lower RV fractional area change on initial screening echocardiogram were each associated with
increased odds of PH at discharge in univariate analyses.
Multivariate logistic regression analyses similarly supported these findings with multiple highly discriminatory
models. (See supplemental Tables 1–4.) Collectively, these
data suggest that regardless of RV pressure, any evidence of
RV hypertrophy or dysfunction on a screening echocardiogram may identify which premature infants with BPD are at
increased risk for PH at discharge. As previously described
by Altit et al. [12], we found RV FAC, readily obtainable
on a standard echocardiogram, to be particularly helpful in
identifying those at increased odds of PH at discharge. We
believe these findings further support the application of a
regimented screening protocol for this patient population.
They also raise the question whether the presence of an ASD
at time of screening should prompt early referral for closure,
particularly in patients with severe BPD who have other
findings suggestive of RV dysfunction as described above.
This small, single-center study has several limitations. Its
retrospective nature limited our ability to obtain all data in
some patients. A subset of patients did not have PA acceleration time, TAPSE, or RVFW TDI data, also used to calculate MPI, and this prevented adequate power for statistical
significance, but had they been adequately powered, may
have demonstrated further useful measurements to evaluate
likelihood of BPD-PH at discharge. Further, our practice
does not include routine screening of premature infants prior
to the diagnosis of BPD, which precludes any assessment of
‘early’ PH. Some of the measurements which were significantly associated with PH at discharge were closely associated, such as the presence of an ASD with higher EI in diastole and RV dilation. However, this study was inadequately


powered to specifically explore the differences between the
17-patient subgroup in whom PH resolved at discharge and
the 18 patients in whom PH persisted to discharge. Due to
selection bias, our sample of patients was not representative
of the full spectrum of BPD patients, as many patients with
milder lung disease either did not have BPD as a discharge
diagnosis or had mild enough disease to be discharged without repeat echocardiograms. Furthermore, a significant number of patients were excluded because they had more mild
disease and did not have a discharge echocardiogram, which
may skew results as only the most ill patients who stayed
in the NICU long enough for a discharge echocardiogram
were included. This selection bias and the fact that we only
included screening and discharge echocardiograms limit our
ability to draw more robust conclusions about the natural
history of BPD-PH. Finally, the small sub-groups of those
with PH at discharge limited our ability to identify factors
associated with late development of PH. A multicenter prospective study of patients with BPD and regimented screening would be helpful to explore the roles BPD severity plays
in risk of BPD-PH at discharge and the natural history of
development and resolution of BPD-PH.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that at the time of severe
BPD diagnosis in premature infants, neither perinatal nor
clinical data were helpful in differentiating between those
with or without BPD-PH at the time of NICU discharge, but
that concurrent 36 weeks PMA echocardiographic evaluation may help identify those at highest risk based on certain
echocardiogram findings. In particular, qualitative evidence
of RV dysfunction, hypertrophy, or dilation, the presence of
an ASD, or impaired RV FAC were strongly associated with
BPD-PH at NICU discharge. These findings support recently
published guidelines promoting the use of regimented, longitudinal echocardiographic screening protocols in premature infants with BPD, which is further supported by our
findings that nearly 20% of those with BPD-PH at discharge
had normal screening studies.
