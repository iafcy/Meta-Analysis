**Abstract**

**Background: Although bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-associated pulmonary**

hypertension (PH) is a well-known complication of prematurity, the additional impact of left

to-right interatrial shunt on this condition remains poorly understood. The aim of the present

study was to identify the significance of atrial left-to-right shunt lesions in PH infants with

moderate or severe BPD.

**Materials and Methods: The medical records of 383 preterm infants (<32 weeks’ gestational**

age) diagnosed with BPD between 2005 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline

characteristics, including interatrial shunts and outcomes, were compared between the infants

who developed PH (n = 50) and those who did not (n = 144). Infants with hemodynamically

significant residual PDAs were excluded. Among the infants diagnosed with PH (n = 50), the

outcomes were compared between the subjects with (n = 21) and without atrial shunts (n =

29) at 36 weeks’ corrected postmenstrual age (PMA).

**Results: Fifty infants (15%) of the preterm infants with BPD were diagnosed with PH. The**

number of infants with a history of atrial shunt lesions was significantly higher in the PH

group compared to the non-PH group (42% vs. 15.3%, respectively). The adjusted odds ratio

for PH in the atrial shunt group was 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 8.0) compared to

PH-BPD infants without atrial shunt.

**Conclusion: The presence of an atrial left-to-right shunt was associated with PH in preterm**

infants with moderate or severe BPD. Close follow-up is needed for infants with interatrial

shunts, and more tailored prognostic evaluation and treatment are recommended.

**1.** **Introduction**

Despite advances in critical care management, chronic pulmonary morbidity is a common

adverse outcome in preterm neonates, particularly in preterm infants who develop


bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).[1] Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a major cause of late

mortality in preterm infants with BPD.[2] Previous retrospective studies have reported PH
associated mortality rates ranging between 14 and 38% in preterm infants with BPD. The

only currently published prospective study has reported a prevalence of 18% and a mortality

rate of 11.5% for extremely low-birth-weight infants. Survivors are at an increased risk of

long-term morbidity, including long hospitalization durations and oxygen therapy.[3-5 ]

The pathogenesis of PH in infants with BPD is multifactorial, and infants with BPD may

develop PH due to early damage to pulmonary angiogenesis, which could be exacerbated by

inflammation,[6] lung and airway injuries,[7] cardiac shunts, diastolic cardiac dysfunction and

pulmonary vein stenosis.[8] The previous studies have reported that infants with PH frequently

had a history of minor cardiac anomalies, and it was suggested that infants with chronic lung

disease (CLD) and shunt lesions might be at an increased risk for PH.[9,10] It was suggested

that even minor increases in left-to-right shunting of the blood through atrial defects might

induce a significant hemodynamic injury and aggravate PH because of the reduced vascular

surface area in the lungs of infants with BPD.[11 ]However, the exact significance of this minor

cardiac anomaly is unknown.[12 ]

The present study was conducted to investigate the clinical impact of atrial left-to-right

shunts on PH prevalence in preterm infants with severe or moderate BPD.

**Materials and Methods**

This study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee at Seoul National

University Hospital.


1.1. Patients and definitions

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of preterm infants who were born at <32

weeks’ gestational age and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Seoul

National University Children’s Hospital between January 2005 and March 2013. Overall, 383

preterm infants were diagnosed with BPD during the study period. Infants with major

congenital heart diseases (except for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), patent foramen ovale,

and atrial septal defect (ASD)), chromosomal abnormalities, congenital diaphragmatic hernia,

and persistent pulmonary hypertension were excluded. Infants who were transferred to our

hospital after 36 weeks’ corrected postmenstrual age (PMA) or who died before 36 weeks’

PMA were also excluded (n=49).

The clinical data collected included birth weight, gestational age, prenatal steroids

(administration of any dose of corticosteroids during the concurrent pregnancy), histological

chorioamnionitis (based on the pathological findings from the microscopic examination of

the placenta), PDA and its treatment, BPD and its grade, and culture proven-sepsis. PDA

cases that were treated with cyclooxygenase inhibitors or surgical ligation and

hemodynamically significant residual PDAs after 36 weeks’ PMA were excluded. BPD was

defined using the National Institute of Child Health criteria for BPD and graded as mild,

moderate, or severe, according to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) or positive pressure

ventilation (PPV). Mild BPD was defined as breathing room air; moderate BPD was defined

as FiO2 < 0.30, and severe BPD was defined as FiO2 ≥ 0.30 or PPV at 36 weeks’ PMA.


Serial echocardiographic data for all preterm infants with moderate to severe BPD were

reviewed, including evaluations with 2-dimensional, M-mode, and color-coded Doppler by a

pediatric cardiologist at Seoul National University Children’s Hospital. Infants were

diagnosed with PH if an echocardiogram performed when they were older than 2 months of

age demonstrated elevated pulmonary artery pressure based on the presence of at least one of

the following criteria: 1) velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) ≥ 3 m/s in the absence

of pulmonary stenosis or 2) flat or left-deviated interventricular septal configuration and right

ventricular hypertrophy with chamber dilation.[13,14] Data on the infants’ interatrial shunts at 36

weeks’ PMA were collected and followed-up using echocardiography. We recorded the final

diagnoses of the atrial shunts (ASD or PFO), which were still open at the corrected postnatal

age of 2 months.[15 ]

1.2. Statistical analysis

All data analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,

USA). Continuous variables were analyzed using either the t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test

for normal or skewed distributions, respectively. Proportions were tested using the chi
squared test and the Fisher exact test, and p values of < 0.05 were considered to be significant.

The significant variables identified by univariate analysis were further assessed with

multivariable logistic regression analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± SD, median and

range, or rate. Odds ratios are presented with 95% confidence intervals.

**Results**

**Patients**

Of the total 383 preterm infants with BPD who were born at <32 weeks’ gestational age, 5


infants were excluded because of death prior to 36 weeks’ PMA; 29 infants were excluded

due to major congenital malformation, and 15 infants were excluded because of incomplete

follow-up data. The remaining 334 preterm infants with BPD fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A

flow diagram is presented in Figure 1.

**Pulmonary hypertension with moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia**

Among the 334 infants with BPD, 50 infants (15%) were diagnosed with PH. PH was

diagnosed in 54% (45/83) of the infants with severe BPD, 4% (5/111) of the infants with

moderate BPD, and 0% (0/140) of the infants with mild BPD. Except for the infants with

mild BPD, the clinical characteristics and outcomes for the infants with (n = 50) and without

PH (n = 144) are presented in Table 1. According to the PH diagnostic criteria, systolic PAP

could be estimated in 64% of infants (n = 32) by measurable TR. The median measurable TR

in PH infants was 3.4 m/sec (range, 3.0-4.2 m/sec). We used the modified Bernoulli equation

to convert Doppler-derived velocity to pressure (pressure gradient between the right ventricle

and right atrium = 4 x [TR max[2]]) (median, 46.2 mm Hg; range, 36.0-70.6 mm Hg). For the

other 36% of the infants (n = 18) with PH, qualitative echocardiographic measures of PH in

the absence of measureable TR, such as septal flattening, right atrial enlargement, right

ventricular hypertrophy, and right ventricular dilatation, were used as diagnostic tools. Only 2

infants in the PH group and 1 infant in the non-PH group had small residual PDAs at 36

weeks’ PMA; however, these small residual PDAs were hemodynamically insignificant and

were immediately closed before discharge.


The infants with PH spent more days on a mechanical ventilator (p < 0.001), including high

frequency ventilators (HFV), but fewer days on nasal continuous positive airway pressure

(nCPAP) (p < 0.001) compared to infants in the non-PH group. Three infants in the PH group

died during hospitalization, but there were no deaths in the non-PH group (p = 0.016). The

causes of death for the three infants were respiratory failure despite mechanical ventilation

and a high fraction of O2. The median duration of hospitalization was longer in the PH group

compared to the non-PH group (p = 0.04). The majority of infants in the PH group required

prolonged oxygen therapy at discharge compared with the non-PH group (80% vs. 35.4%,

respectively) (p < 0.001).

Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the risk factors for PH. The results after

adjusting for variables that were significant in the previous univariate analysis revealed that

the significant risk factors for PH were proven sepsis (adjusted OR 3.5; 95% CI, 1.7-7.2; p =

0.001) and interatrial shunts (adjusted OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.8-8.0; p < 0.001) (Table 2).

**Comparison of PH-BPD infants with and without atrial left-to-right shunt**

We obtained a median 968 days (range, 64-2,875 days) of follow-up data after the diagnosis

of PH. The median postnatal age at the initial diagnosis of PH was 87.5 days (range, 7-882

days) in the PH group. The median age at the PH diagnosis in the atrial shunt group was

significantly earlier than that in the non-atrial shunt group (62 days vs. 103 days, p = 0.004).

Major morbidities and outcomes were compared between infants with (n = 21) and without

atrial shunts (n = 29) (Table 3). The hospitalization duration (p = 1.000), O2 therapy (p =

0.567), mechanical ventilation (p = 0.589) and nCPAP (p = 0.252) did not differ significantly

between the two groups. However, the mortality rate of the PH-BPD infants with atrial shunts

was significantly higher than that of the PH-BPD infants without atrial shunts (14.3% vs. 0%,


respectively, p = 0.026). During the follow-up period, 4 infants in the atrial shunt group died,

including 3 infants who died during hospitalization and 1 infant who died suddenly at home

two days after being discharged without any improvement in PH.

In our hospital, management for PH in BPD infants includes inhaled NO, sildenafil,

bosentan, and inhaled iloprost. Eighteen infants (85.7%) in the atrial shunt group received at

least one of these pulmonary vasodilator therapies during the follow-up period, while only 17

infants (58.6%) in the non-atrial shunt group received these therapies (p = 0.038). Sildenafil

was administered most often. In each group, the following drugs were administered: atrial

shunt group, inhaled NO, 7 (33.3%), sildenafil, 17 (81.0%), bosentan, 3 (14.2%), and iloprost

6 (28.6%); in the non-atrial shunt group, inhaled NO, 9 (31.0%), sildenafil, 16 (55.2%),

bosentan, 1 (3.4%), and iloprost 1 (3.4%). Seventy-four percent of infants in the atrial shunt

group and 90% of infants in the non-atrial shunt group ceased oxygen supplementation 1 year

after the initial diagnosis of PH; however, these data were not statistically significant (p =

0.327).

Among the PH-BPD infants with interatrial shunts, 62% (n = 13) were finally diagnosed

with ASDs and 24% (n = 5) with PFOs after a corrected postnatal age of 2 months. At the

final follow-up assessment, 67% of these defects (n = 14) had spontaneously closed, and 14%

of the infants (n = 3) underwent a primary closure operation for ASD.

**Discussion**

To our knowledge, this report is the first to directly investigate the association between

atrial left-to-right shunts and PH in premature infants with BPD. Mourani et al.[9] reviewed the


medical charts of the children diagnosed with CLD and who underwent cardiac

catheterization for PH evaluation. Specifically, the authors reported that 68% of the patients

had a history of shunt lesions, primarily atrial shunts, which were detected in 58% of this

subgroup of patients. The authors also noted the impact of left-to-right shunt lesions in

children with CLD and suggested early treatment considerations for pulmonary

overcirculation. The incidence of atrial left-to-right shunt was 42% at 36 weeks’ PMA among

the BPD-PH infants in our institution; and 67% of these defects were found to have

spontaneously closed by the last follow-up. A total of 3 infants with left-to-right shunts

through moderate-sized ASD underwent primary closure operations, with positive results.

The sizes of each ASD at 36 weeks’ PMA were 4 mm, 4.67 mm, and 5.5 mm, respectively.

These infants showed improved respiratory functions after the shunts were closed; however,

severe PH persisted, despite the administration of PH-specific drugs. We demonstrated that

the presence of a left-right shunt flow over the atrial septum in moderate or severe BPD

infants was associated with development of PH compared to infants without atrial shunt.

In general, patients with large and complex defects are at the greatest risk for PH compared

to pre-tricuspid shunt patients (i.e., ASD), who generally never develop PH.[16,17 ]Atrial left-to
right shunts are frequently detected during routine cardiac screening in BPD infants in

neonatal intensive care units,[15] and the high rate of spontaneous closure or decrease in the

size of the atrial defect in the first months of life is frequently observed.[18 ]For this reason, it is

unusual to require closure of an ASD in infants without associated lung disease.[19] However,

9

poorer lung compliance in premature infants could prevent or delay closure of the interatrial

septum due to greater phasic respiratory changes in intrathoracic, left atrial and right atrial


pressures.[20] If there are persistent left-to-right cardiac shunts in BPD lungs, small shunts can

have a greater impact on pulmonary blood flow and aggravate PH because the lungs have an

overall reduction in alveolar-capillary surface area with vascular remodeling.[10,12] Moreover,

PH might be exaggerated by vascular abnormalities, such as pulmonary vein stenosis, which

often occur in association with left-to-right cardiac shunts.[21,22] Based on the findings from our

study and previously published reports describing success in closing ASD in patients with

CLD,[22-25] we suggest that early management, including closure of the ASDs, should be

considered as an optional treatment in infants with moderate or large atrial shunt lesions who

are unresponsive to traditional PH therapies. Close follow-up is needed to evaluate the

severity of PH by echocardiography, and diuretics, which reduce pulmonary overflow, can be

considered to relieve acute respiratory symptoms. The addition of biomarkers, such as brain

natriuretic peptide levels, would also be useful for serial follow-ups. Cardiac catheterization

is needed for infants with a history of atrial left-to-right shunts and persistent signs of severe

cardiorespiratory disease, and it is important to select infants with BPD who would benefit

from closing the left-to-right shunts.[26] Early assessment and intervention of anatomic cardiac

lesion can decrease the incidence of adverse outcomes, including heart failure.

In the current study, culture proven sepsis was a specific risk factor for PH in preterm

infants with moderate or severe BPD. Forty-six percent of preterm infants with PH had a

history of proven sepsis, which was significantly greater than the number of infants with

moderate or severe BPD without PH. This result closely aligns with those of earlier studies

that reported that infectious respiratory illnesses were triggers for PH, particularly if the

infant was oxygen-dependent.[13,27 ]

Our study is limited by its retrospective design. The time of diagnosis may not be accurate

because the evaluation interval was determined based on the infant’s condition.


Echocardiography is not the gold standard for assessing pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).

The assessment of atrial shunt was a quantitative one, and we did not have data on the quality

of the shunt lesions to assess the patient-specific hemodynamics of each defect.

Echocardiography alone could not accurately determine the hemodynamic impact of small

atrial defects. Although a significant difference was noted between the mortality rates of PH
BPD infants with and without atrial left-to-right shunt, careful interpretation of the data was

required because of our small sample size to assess this outcome; thus, additional larger

studies are needed.

In conclusion, this study confirms that preterm infants with PH-BPD have higher rates of

death and serious morbidities compared to infants without PH. We found that preterm infants

with a history of atrial left-to-right shunts at 36 weeks’ PMA had an increased likelihood of

developing PH compared to infants without any cardiac shunts. Given the high incidence of

small atrial left-to-right shunts in preterm infants, we propose a more tailored prognostic

evaluation of and diagnostic intervention for BPD infants with cardiac shunt lesions.

Additional prospective studies of the impact of cardiac shunt lesions in infants with BPD are

needed to determine the risk factors for PH development in preterm infants with BPD.
