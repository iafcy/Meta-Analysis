Advances in perinatal medicine have
dramatically increased survival of extremely
premature newborns over the past few
decades (1). However, preterm infants
remain at high risk for late respiratory
morbidity and mortality caused by
the development of bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease
of infancy that generally occurs in preterm
infants who have required respiratory
support and oxygen therapy at birth (2–5).
Early injury to the developing lung can
impair angiogenesis and alveolarization,
which results in simplification of
the distal lung airspace and clinical
manifestations of BPD. BPD is the most
common complication of preterm birth,
occurring in 68% of infants born less than
29 weeks gestation and weighing between
400 and 1,500 g as determined by the
National Institutes of Health Workshop
severity-based diagnostic criteria (1).
BPD is characterized by persistent
respiratory disease with a prolonged
need for supplemental oxygen, recurrent
respiratory exacerbations with frequent
hospitalizations and emergency room visits
(6, 7), exercise intolerance, and related
respiratory problems that can extend
into adulthood (8). As recently highlighted
in a recent NHLBI workshop, insights
into early factors that contribute to
the pathogenesis of BPD are needed to
develop better strategies for the prevention
and treatment of at-risk premature
newborns (9).
The pulmonary circulation in BPD
is characterized by abnormal growth,
including decreased vascular branching,
an altered pattern of vascular distribution
within the interstitium, and persistent
precapillary arteriovenous anastomotic
vessels (3, 10–14). Although the
pathogenesis of BPD is complex and
multifactorial (15), preclinical studies
have shown that early disruption of
angiogenesis in the developing lung impairs
alveolarization and causes sustained
abnormalities of lung structure that mimic
clinical BPD (16–18). Autopsy studies
examining lung tissue from infants who
died with severe BPD provide further
evidence that BPD is characterized by
disruption of angiogenic factor expression
(19, 20). Reduction of the alveolar-capillary
surface area has been identified in preterm
infants with BPD (21), which likely
impairs gas exchange and increases the
need for prolonged oxygen and ventilator


therapy, worsens hypoxemia with acute
respiratory infections and exercise, and may
increase the risk for developing pulmonary
hypertension (PH). Since the original
description of BPD over 45 years ago (2),
late PH has been associated with decreased
survival in infants with BPD (22, 23).
However, the actual incidence of PH in
preterm infants with BPD is unknown
and prospective studies that have
systematically examined the incidence
of PH in BPD are limited (24).
Therefore, to determine whether early
pulmonary vascular disease contributes to
the development and severity of BPD or
increases the risk for late PH, we performed
a prospective study designed to define
the role of pulmonary vascular disease in
the evolution of BPD. We hypothesized
that early pulmonary vascular disease, as
reflected by echocardiographic signs of PH,
is associated with an increased risk for the
subsequent development of BPD and its
severity and late PH. To test this hypothesis,
we performed a prospective study of
preterm infants with echocardiographic
evaluations at 7 days of age and at 36 weeks
post-menstrual age (PMA) to evaluate early
signs of pulmonary vascular disease, the
incidence of PH at 36 weeks PMA, and its
relationship to BPD status. We also sought
to prospectively determine the incidence
of PH in preterm infants with and without
BPD and to compare the impact of different
echocardiogram-derived PH criteria on
the incidence of PH. Some of the results of
these studies have been previously reported
in the form of an abstract (25, 26).

##### Methods

Study Population
All data were prospectively obtained as
part of an observational research study
that included subjects who were enrolled
between July 2006 and March 2012 at
hospitals affiliated with two academic
institutions (the University of Colorado
School of Medicine, Anschutz Campus and
Indiana University School of Medicine). The
protocol was approved by the institutional
review boards at each of the participating
sites, and written informed consent was
received from the parents or guardians of
all participants.
Criteria for enrollment included
gestational age less than 34 weeks and
birthweight between 500 and 1,250 g.


#### ORIGINAL ARTICLE

Exclusion criteria included clinical evidence
of congenital heart disease (except patent
ductus arteriosus [PDA], patent foramen
ovale or atrial septal defect,1 cm, or
ventricular septal defect,2 mm if known
before enrollment); lethal congenital
abnormality; and futile cases (anticipated
death before hospital discharge). Subjects
were required to be enrolled within
7 days of age. Infants who died (n = 20),
withdrew (n = 2), or were transferred or
discharged (n = 17) without undergoing
echocardiogram and/or BPD assessment at
36 weeks PMA were excluded from analysis
(see Table E1 in the online supplement).
Birthweight z scores were calculated
using data from Oken and colleagues (27).
BPD status and severity was assessed at
36 weeks PMA using a modification of
the National Institutes of Health workshop
definition (3) with application of the
oxygen reduction test as described by
Walsh and coworkers (28). Additional
detail on the method for assigning BPD
status is provided in the online supplement.
Morbidities occurring during the birth
hospitalization and length of oxygen use
and mortality in the first year of life were
systematically collected.

Echocardiogram Screening
Research echocardiograms were
standardized at both sites before initiation
of the study and were performed at 7 days
of age and at 36 weeks PMA (see online
supplement). All echocardiograms were
interpreted by a single cardiologist who
remained masked to subjects’ clinical
status to provide consistent evaluation of
findings. To more rigorously define PH in
this study population, evaluations of each
echocardiogram included assessments of
three categories of criteria for making
the diagnosis of PH (see Table E2). The
primary criteria for PH were met by any of
the following findings: an estimated right
ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) greater
than 40 mm Hg, RVSP/systemic systolic
blood pressure greater than 0.5, any cardiac
shunt with bidirectional or right-to-left
flow, or any degree of ventricular septal
wall flattening. Because of uncertainty
regarding echocardiogram-derived
definitions of PH and subjectivity of
septal wall flattening (29), we evaluated
two other definitions for PH: included
only moderate or severe septal flattening
(alternate PH criteria-1) and excluded
septal flattening from the criteria altogether


-----

#### ORIGINAL ARTICLE

(alternate PH criteria-2; see online supplement
for details). Echocardiograms at 7 days of
age were used to assess “early PH,” and at
36 weeks PMA to assess “late PH.”
All research echocardiograms were also
separately interpreted by each institution’s
clinical cardiologists to provide real-time
results to the attending physicians.
However, these clinical interpretations
were not used for research data analyses.
Management decisions based on the clinical
echocardiogram results and the timing of
additional clinical echocardiograms were
at the discretion of the attending
neonatologist.

Statistical Analysis
All data were prospectively collected
and managed using REDCap (Research
Electronic Data Capture) (30) database


hosted at the University of Colorado
Denver Development and Informatics
Service Center. Chi-square tests were used
to assess the association between categorical
variables. Distributions of continuous
variables were assessed using the ShapiroWilk test. All outcome variables with
nonnormal distributions were analyzed
in simple comparisons using Wilcoxon
rank sum tests or Kruskal-Wallis one-way
analysis of variance for tests with more than
two independent groups.
A generalized logistic regression model
was developed to identify risk factors for
PH at 36 weeks PMA and an ordinal
logistic regression model was developed
to identify risk factors for BPD at 36 weeks
PMA using stepwise variable selection
(see online supplement). Multiple linear
regression analyses were used to assess


the relationship between durations of
oxygen use, PH, and BPD severity. Days
of oxygen use were log transformed
to correct for a nonnormal distribution.
P values of less than 0.05 were accepted
to indicate statistical significance. All
statistics were computed using SAS v 9.4
(Cary, NC).

##### Results

During the study period, 277 of the enrolled
infants survived and received a “late”
echocardiogram at 36 weeks PMA
(Figure 1). An “early” echocardiogram at
7 days of age was performed in all but 3 of
the 277 infants. Characteristics of the study
population are listed in Table 1. For the
entire cohort, the median (interquartile

birthweight of the infants were 27
weeks (25–28) and 909 g (750–1,075),
respectively. Two hundred twenty-seven
(82%) infants developed BPD, which
included mild (n = 100; 36%), moderate
(n = 62; 22%), and severe (n = 65; 23%)
disease.
At the time of the 7-day echocardiogram,
108 (39%) neonates were treated with


mechanical ventilation support, 111 (40%)
with continuous positive airway pressure,
15 (5%) with high-flow nasal cannula
(Vapotherm, Exeter, NH), 30 (11%) with nasal
cannula oxygen, and eight (3%) were in room
air. At 7 days of age, 115 (42%) infants met
the primary criteria for early PH (Figure 2A),
97 of whom met criteria based on septal
wall flattening (Table 2). The incidence
of septal flattening was highest in those


infants who subsequently developed
severe BPD (50%), although this was not
statistically significant (P = 0.06). Fifty-five
(47.8%) infants with early PH required
mechanical ventilation at 7 days of age,
whereas 53 (33.3%) infants without early
PH required mechanical ventilation at
7 days (P = 0.015). The presence of a PDA

with the development of more severe

found that the following were significantly
associated with the diagnosis of BPD:
decreasing gestational age at birth (relative
risk [RR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval

[CI], 1.01–1.24), decreasing birthweight
z score (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08–1.25),
ventricular septal flattening (RR, 1.12;
95% CI, 1.03–1.23), multiple gestation
(RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01–1.24), and the
Colorado center (RR, 0.89; 95% CI,
0.82–0.98) (Figure 3A; see Table E4). No
clinical risk factors for PH at 36 weeks
PMA were identified, but the 7-day
echocardiographic risk factors of septal wall
flattening (RR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.28–6.33) and
right ventricle dilation (RR, 9.4; 95% CI,
1.58–55.93) were associated with late PH
(Figure 3B; see Table E4).
The characteristics of the infants with
and without PH at 36 weeks PMA using
the primary criteria are shown in Table 1.
Patients with PH had lower birthweights
(P = 0.03) but there were no differences
in gestational age at birth between groups.
Infants with late PH were more likely to
be from a multiple gestation birth than
infants without late PH (P = 0.01). Infants
with PH were more likely to have received
positive pressure ventilation support at
36 weeks PMA, had increased mechanical
ventilation days and oxygen days,
were more likely to be discharged on
supplemental oxygen, and had increased
mortality (P, 0.05).
Pharmacologic therapy for late PH was
relatively uncommon in this cohort. Five
infants were treated with both inhaled nitric
oxide and sildenafil, and one infant was
treated with sildenafil alone. Three of these
infants had echocardiograms at 36 weeks
PMA that were negative for signs of PH, but
had subsequent clinical echocardiogram
evaluations that had signs of PH later in
their course. Seven infants died, including
four with evidence of late PH. Of these, PH
with progressive respiratory failure was the
cause of the death for three, whereas the
fourth subject died of sepsis. Three of these
infants died in the neonatal intensive care
unit (NICU), and one died in hospice care
after discharge. Of the three infants who
died without evidence of late PH, one died
of progressive respiratory failure in the
NICU, one suffered hemorrhagic stroke
after discharge home, and the other died
of acute aspiration after discharge home.
Evaluating the relationship between
PH as determined by the primary criteria
and duration of oxygen use, we found


BPD at 36 weeks PMA (P = 0.003).
Echocardiogram evidence of PDA at 7 days
was associated with early PH (P = 0.002)
but was not associated with late PH
(P = 0.41). Thirty-nine (14%) infants met
criteria for late PH by the primary criteria
(Table 2). Of the infants meeting early
PH criteria at 7 days, 24 (21%) also met
criteria at 36 weeks PMA. Although the
proportion of infants with PH in the no
BPD, mild BPD, and moderate BPD groups
was relatively similar (9–10%), 29% of
severe BPD infants met criteria for PH
(P, 0.001) (Figure 2B). At 36 weeks PMA,
78% of all infants still had evidence of
a patent foramen ovale/atrial septal defect,
whereas 12% had a persistent PDA, but
there were no significant differences in
the proportion of infants with these lesions
between the BPD severity groups.
The incidence of PH using alternative
PH criteria and the association with


BPD status for both echocardiogram
evaluations are presented in Figure 2.
Application of these criteria reduced
the incidence of PH at 7 days of age
and 36 weeks PMA. Very few patients
(8% and 6% at 7 d and 36 wk PMA,
respectively) had tricuspid regurgitant
velocity that were deemed acceptable to
reliably estimate RVSP (Table 2), thus the
criteria involving RVSP could not be
applied to many infants.
The sensitivity and specificity of the
primary criteria applied at 7 days of age
to predict the presence of PH at 36 weeks
was 62% and 61%, respectively, and the
positive and negative predictive values
were 21% and 91%, respectively. These
performance measures were much lower
for both of the alternate criteria (see
Table E3).
We further investigated clinical risk
factors for the development of BPD and

##### Discussion

This prospective study sought to determine
the incidence of PH in preterm infants in
the first week after birth and at 36 weeks
PMA, and the relationship of early
signs of pulmonary vascular disease with
both BPD and late PH. Using a broad
echocardiogram-based definition of PH,
we found an overall incidence of PH of


42% at 7 days of age, and 14% at 36 weeks
PMA, with the highest incidence of late
PH (29%) occurring in infants with
severe BPD. Significant numbers of preterm
infants with none, mild, and moderate BPD
(9–10% in each group) also had evidence
of late PH. Applying alternate, stricter
criteria for PH dramatically reduced the
incidence at both time points. Early signs
of pulmonary vascular disease at 7 days of
age (ventricular septal wall flattening and
right ventricle dilation) were associated
with higher risk of late PH. Risk factors
for BPD in this cohort also included lower
gestational age at birth, lower birthweight
z score, ventricular septal wall flattening at
7 days of age, multiple gestation pregnancy,
and the center of admission. Late PH
was also associated with prolonged use
of positive pressure ventilation and
supplemental oxygen therapy. These


results suggest that even subtle signs
early pulmonary vascular disease in the
first week after birth, as evidenced by
echocardiographic markers of PH, are risk
factors for both BPD and late PH, and that
late PH is associated with increased
duration respiratory support.
Although PH has long been associated
with established BPD in preterm infants,
recognition of the importance of early
disruption of pulmonary vascular growth in
the pathogenesis of BPD and late respiratory
sequelae has been growing (11, 16, 17, 19,
21). This prospective study suggests that
even mild signs of PH at 7 days of age,
independent of gestational age at birth,
birthweight, and other maternal and NICU
comorbidities, are associated with BPD
severity and late PH. Although infants with
severe BPD have the highest risk for late
PH, it is striking that nearly 10% of infants

with none, mild, and moderate BPD
were also found to have late PH, and that
echocardiogram findings of PH in these
subjects were also strongly associated with
duration of respiratory therapy.
We had previously studied a small
group of infants with severe BPD and
known or highly suspected PH to determine
the reliability of echocardiogram measures
of PH in this population (29). We found
that echocardiogram measurements
(including septal flattening) were fairly
sensitive for diagnosing PH compared
with cardiac catheterization. However,
we reported that the echocardiogram was
not completely reliable for determining
the severity of PH as reflected by cardiac
catheterization. In the present study we


attempted to identify sensitive measures of
PH as a screening tool for early pulmonary
vascular disease and as a marker for BPD.
Further studies need to determine whether
this screening method can identify highrisk infants who would benefit from early
intervention.
Overall, these findings support the
hypothesis that early pulmonary vascular
disease in preterm infants contributes to
increased susceptibility for BPD and
late respiratory morbidity. These data
may further provide useful prognostic
information for parents and caregivers,
and suggest that routine echocardiographic
screening may identify preterm infants
who are at increased risk of late
cardiopulmonary morbidities. In addition,


early identification of preterm infants at
greater risk for respiratory morbidities may
allow the opportunity to better study novel
interventions for disease prevention (9).
This is a first study of PH in preterm
infants using blinded interpretation of
echocardiograms with strict a priori
definitions of PH. We found that the
tricuspid regurgitant velocity was rarely
of sufficient quality to adequately
estimate RVSP (present in 8.7% of
echocardiograms). Thus, the usefulness
of the more rigorous alternate PH criteria
using objective echocardiogram findings
is of limited value in this population, and
use of subjective findings of PH, such
as ventricular septal flattening, is likely
required to identify infants with PH.
Although the use of a single masked
cardiologist for interpretation of
echocardiograms enhances the consistency
of reporting PH for this study cohort, it is
unclear whether these interpretations are
generalizable to clinical practice because
assessment of interventricular septal
flattening may be variable.
As may be expected with delayed
cardiopulmonary transition from in utero
life after preterm birth, ventricular septal
wall flattening was very common on
postnatal day 7 (42%), but 62% of infants
with evidence of PH at 36 weeks also
had evidence of PH at 7 days. Conversely,
absence of PH at 7 days was associated with
a very low incidence of late PH (,10%)
and 91% negative predictive value. The
presence of right ventricular dilation at
7 days of age, which was not included in the
criteria for PH, was also a risk factor for late
PH, which reinforces the possibility that
evidence of elevated pulmonary artery
pressure at 7 days of age is associated
with risk for late PH. We also found that
septal flattening at 7 days of age was
strongly associated with the development
of BPD. These findings suggest that
sustained evidence of elevated right
ventricular pressure through the first
week after birth may reflect early
pulmonary vascular injury that increases
risk for BPD. Several studies have reported
an association between PDA and BPD
(31–33). In this cohort, evidence of PDA
at 7 days of age was associated with early
PH and BPD severity, but not late PH
in univariate analyses. The presence of
increased left-to-right flow through a
PDA could impact assessments of PH by
echocardiogram, but also could lead to

pulmonary vascular remodeling and
pulmonary vascular disease. Although
PDA at 7 days or treatment for PDA were
not directly associated with BPD or late
PH in our risk models, its impact could
be encompassed by the association of early
PH with BPD and late PH. Further studies
are required to isolate the impact of PDA
on the risk for PH in this population.
Previous studies of preterm infants
with BPD have suggested that the diagnosis
of PH was associated with increased
mortality risk (34–36). Despite advances
in the management of preterm infants
over the recent decades, there is continued
evidence that PH is still associated with
poor outcomes (23, 37, 38). PH was often
thought to be a rare complication only
impacting infants with most severe
respiratory disease. However, recent
data indicate that angiogenesis and
alveolarization are intricately related,
and even mild perinatal lung injury after
preterm birth disrupts the normal sequence
of lung development, increasing risk for
pulmonary vascular disease, including
PH (10, 37, 39).
Past studies have shown that PH is
commonly found in preterm infants with
BPD (24, 40), with incidence rates of
25% in BPD infants and 18% in extremely
low-birthweight infants, respectively.
Our prospective study includes larger
birthweight infants than the study reported
by Bhat and colleagues (24) but reveals
similar incidence rates of PH (16% for


extremely low-birthweight infants). In the
previous study, median age of diagnosis
was 112 days (range, 93–122 d) with
65% of BPD infants who were ultimately
diagnosed with PH having a “normal”
echocardiogram between 4 and 6 weeks
of age, suggesting that PH can be a late
finding (24). PH was diagnosed as late as
232 days of age in the study by An and
coworkers (40). A recent study by Mirza
and coworkers described a lower incidence
of PH (8% at 10–14 d of age and 4% at
36 wk PMA), but the criteria for PH
diagnosis in that study was more similar
to our alternate criteria-1 (41), which
achieved similar rates of PH in our cohort
(Figure 2). Higher death rates in preterm
infants with BPD and PH compared with
those without PH have been reported as
well (24, 40, 42). Factors associated with
late PH in these studies include lower
birthweight and longer periods of
respiratory support. PDA (40), infection
(40), oligohydramnios (42), and small for
gestational age (24, 43) have also been
associated with PH; however, with the
exception of low birthweight z score, we
did not identify these findings as strong
risk factors for BPD or PH in the present
study.
This study has several potential
limitations, including the lack of
confirmation and quantification of
PH by right heart catheterizations, which
is the gold standard for diagnosis, because
performing these invasive evaluations

was not practical in this population.
Furthermore, clinical decision-making
was independent of the research team,
but decisions for duration of respiratory
support, including oxygen therapy,
may have been influenced by clinical
interpretations of the research
echocardiogram results, which may
have confounded our results. We
identified the center of care to be a risk
factor for the development of PH. Although
the centers were at different altitudes,
differences in the care provided at each
of the hospitals were not controlled, limiting
the ability to conclusively determine
whether altitude was indeed the factor
accounting for this difference. Additionally,
this study population may not represent
a consecutive birth cohort because
enrollment in this study required informed
consent and not all eligible patients
participated.
In conclusion, we found that
echocardiographic evidence of PH was
present in a significant proportion of
preterm infants at 36 weeks PMA and was
strongly associated with the diagnosis of
BPD and duration of oxygen use during
infancy. Although PH was highly prevalent
in infants with severe BPD, significant
proportions of infants with none, mild, and
moderate BPD also had evidence of PH,
suggesting that PH is not solely related to the
severity of lung disease. Early signs of PH
at 7 days of age were common and were
associated with increased risk for both BPD
and late PH. Conversely, absence of PH
at 7 days of age was associated with
a very low risk for late PH. Overall, these
findings support the hypothesis that early
pulmonary vascular disease precedes the
development of BPD and are strongly
associated with late PH and respiratory
morbidities. We speculate that early
echocardiograms may be useful for the
early identification of preterm infants at
high risk for BPD and late PH for future
preventive and therapeutic studies. n
