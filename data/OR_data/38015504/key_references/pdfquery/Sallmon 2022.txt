OBJECTIVE: Extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs) represent an especially vulnerable population. Herein, we aimed to 
determine incidence and severity of pulmonary hypertension associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD-PH) in extremely 
immature ELGANs (gestational age: 230/6–256/7 weeks). 
METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, we assessed BPD-PH by means of several echocardiography markers and 
serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels at 3 and 12 months of chronological age. In addition, we 
analyzed incidence and efﬁcacy of pharmacologic treatment for BPD-PH. 
RESULTS: At 3 months 15/34 ELGANs had echocardiographic evidence of BPD-PH, while at 12 months of age 6/34 still had PH. PH- 
targeted therapy consisted of sildenaﬁl monotherapy in 11 and dual oral combination therapy (sildenaﬁl and macitentan) in four 
ELGANs at 3 and 12 months. 
CONCLUSION: 44% (15/34) of ELGANs developed BPD-PH. All received PH-targeted pharmacotherapy at 3 months, leading to 
hemodynamic improvements at 12 months in most infants. 


INTRODUCTION 
With the improved survival of extremely low gestational age 
newborns (ELGANs), the long-term sequelae of prematurity, 
such as pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronch- 
opulmonary dysplasia (BPD-PH), are of emerging clinical 
interest 
lung 
disorders in BPD-PH is multifactorial (vascular, parenchymal, 
interstitial alterations) and incompletely understood. Prematur- 
ity, ventilatory support and other iatrogenic factors contribute 
to abnormal lung development including pulmonary vascular 
remodeling, ultimately leading to PH and right ventricular (RV) 
failure [3, 4]. Beside supportive care, an increasing number of 
patients with BPD receive PH-targeted pharmacotherapy (off- 
infants born 
label 
<32 weeks gestation with moderate to severe BPD develop 
PH, and—10–20 years ago—almost half of 
these infants 
reportedly did not survive beyond the ﬁrst 24 months of 
postnatal life [4, 7]. Study data speciﬁcally addressing BPD-PH in 
extremely premature infants (e.g., <26 weeks of gestation) are 
very sparse. 


Here, we sought to investigate a cohort of ELGANs (230/6–256/7 
weeks of gestational age) from birth to 12 months of chronological 
age. Echocardiographic variables of biventricular pressure, size and 
function were determined in preterm infants at risk for BPD-PH at 3 
and 12 months of age. Since biomarkers may prove useful 
in 
guiding BPD-PH therapy, we determined serum N-terminal pro-B- 
type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels as a secondary outcome 
measure in ELGANs up to 12 months of chronological age. We 
hypothesized that (i) chronic BPD-PH is common in ELGANs, (ii) can 
be delineated by a combinatory assessment of classical echocardio- 
graphic variables of RV pressure and function, and more recently 
published variables of RV/LV interaction and pulmonary blood ﬂow, 
and (iii) improves with PH-targeted pharmacotherapy between 3 
and 12 months of postnatal life. 
METHODS 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
We considered 47 consecutively born extremely immature infants 
(230/6–256/7 weeks gestational age) who were admitted to our NICU 
between January 2016 and December 2018 for inclusion. We excluded 
patients who died before 3 months of chronological age, surviving 
patients with congenital heart disease, structural 
lung abnormalities, 
genetic syndromes or other conditions expected to adversely affect life 
expectancy (n = 13). Resuscitation was not provided for 
infants 
<23 weeks’ gestational age. By 3 months postnatal age, we ultimately 
enrolled 34 surviving ELGANs into the study.

Neonatal co-morbidities 
Patients were treated according to institutional NICU protocols for invasive 
and noninvasive respiratory support. Postnatal steroids were administered 
intravenously for ≥7 days throughout the study period as a prophylaxis for 
BPD in infants who could not be weaned after 1 week of continuous 
mechanical ventilation (n = 18). For necrotizing enterocolitis 
(NEC) 
prophylaxis, a multimodal approach initiated within the ﬁrst 24 h of life 
was followed, which included early trophic feeding with human breast 
milk, and enteral gentamicin, and Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus. Clinical 
and demographic parameters (e.g., gestational age, birthweight, length, 
and APGAR score) were recorded on electronic charts. 
postnatal life (median day of life 6, range 1–33), 7 of them (54%) on 
day of life 1 (Fig. 1). The following reasons were attributed to their 
deaths: severe lung hypoplasia (n = 3), sepsis with multiorgan failure 
(n = 4), perinatal asphyxia (n = 3), NEC (n = 1), cerebral malformation 
(lissenzephaly, n = 1), persistent seizures (n = 1), 
intraventricular 
hemorrhage, and intestinal perforation (n = 1). Fifteen of 
the 
remaining 34 patients (44%) showed echocardiographic signs of 
PH at 3 months, and six (17.6%) patients had PH signs at 12 months 
of chronological age. Detailed demographic and clinical patient 
characteristics are provided in Table 1. 
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) 
31 of 34 ELGANs developed mild (n = 16), moderate (n = 10), or 
severe BPD (n = 5). By 3 months of age, PH was diagnosed in all 
infants with moderate (n = 10) or severe (n = 5) BPD (BPD-PH 
group), but not in patients with mild BPD (n = 16) or those without 
BPD (n = 3; no PH-group). Of note, the three infants who did not 
fulﬁll the classic criteria to diagnose BPD (e.g., supplemental 
oxygen requirement on the 28th day of 
required 
noninvasive respiratory support by high-ﬂow nasal cannula and/ 
requirements for 
or CPAP, 
diagnosing BPD (grade II) as outlined by Jensen et al. 
[9]. 
Therefore, we included these infants in the BPD group. 


Co-morbidities and incidence of PH 
15/34 ELGANs (44%) showed signs of both PH and moderate-to- 
severe BPD by 3 months, and 6/34 (17.6%) infants still exhibited 
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) 
BPD is classically deﬁned as supplemental oxygen requirement at 
postnatal day 28 [8]. Severity of BPD was then categorized as mild (room 
air at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age, PMA), moderate (need for oxygen 
<30% at 36 weeks of PMA), or severe (need for oxygen ≥30% and/or 
positive pressure ventilation) [8]. We also included infants who did not 
fulﬁll these classic criteria to diagnose BPD (e.g., supplemental oxygen 
requirement on the 28th day of life), but required noninvasive respiratory 
support, thus fulﬁlling the more recent diagnostic requirements for BPD as 
outlined by Jensen et al. (n = 3) [9]. 
Transthoracic echocardiography 
Echocardiograms were performed on a standard echocardiographic system 
(Sonos iE33, Philips), by one experienced cardiologist, according to current 
guidelines [10–12]. Tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV)-derived right 
ventricular-to-right atrial systolic pressure gradient, a surrogate of RV systolic 
pressure (RVSP), and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) 
indicating RV longitudinal systolic function, were determined, as recently 
published in position papers [4, 13, 14]. A TRV > 2.5 m/s was considered the 
noninvasive cut-off value to deﬁne elevated pulmonary arterial pressure 
(PAP), in the absence of RV outﬂow tract obstruction [9, 10]. In order to 
accurately determine RVSP/sPAP from TRV (by using the simpliﬁed Bernoulli 
equation (dP = 4 · v2), the right atrial pressure (v-wave) would need to be 
added to the estimated pressure gradient (dP). However, since we did non 
perform invasive measurements of right atrial pressures, the provided RVSP 
values represent pressure gradient estimates derived from TRV interrogation 
added by an arbitrarily set atrial pressure value of 5 mmHG (dP = 4 · v2 + 5 
mmHg). Severity of PH was categorized as mild, moderate or severe based on 
the estimated RVSP and stratiﬁed by the ratio of TRV-based RVSP and systolic 
systemic arterial pressure recorded simultaneously, (RVSP/SAP: <50% mild 
PH, 50–75% moderate PH, >75% severe PH). We evaluated variables of RV-LV 
interaction such as the RV/LV end-systolic diameter ratio and left ventricular 
end-systolic eccentricity index (LVesEI), and the pulmonary artery acceleration 
time (PAAT) as surrogate markers of PAP and PVR. Of note, in 6 patients RVSP 
could not reliably be estimated by TRV. However, these patients did not show 
any echocardiographic (TAPSE, PAAT, LVesEI, and RV/LV ratio) or clinical sign 
of RV dysfunction or increased PVR. Thus, these infants were included in the 
“no BPD-PH” group. 
Biomarker of cardiac wall stress 
NT-proBNP was analyzed in venous blood samples at 3 and 12 months of 
chronological age (lithium heparin tubes) using the Cobas 8000 assay from 
Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). 
Statistical analysis 
Demographic variables are presented as absolute and relative counts, mean, 
and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR), as 
appropriate. Comparisons of categorical characteristics between infants with 
and without BPD-PH were made using chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, 
and for continuous variables using t test or Mann–Whitney U test, as 
appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. Statistical 
analysis, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, was 
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0.0 (SPSS Inc., 
IBM Company, 
Chicago, IL).

RVSP could be not reliably be estimated by TRV. However, these 
patients did not show any echocardiographic or clinical signs of 
RV dysfunction or 
these infants were 
increased PVR. Thus, 
included in the “no BPD-PH” group. TRV could reliably be 
interrogated in all infants with BPD-PH. 
ELGANs with BPD-PH (n = 15) required supplemental oxygen for a 
longer time than those without PH (n = 19, 3 with mild BPD) [103 
(68–134) days vs. 50 (36–58) days, p < 0.001]. Similarly, patients with 
BPD-PH received nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) 
for a longer duration than those without PH [65 (47–87) days vs. 37 
(26–48) days, p < 0.001], as was the case for the duration of invasive 
mechanical ventilation (iMV) [29 (19–46) vs. 7 (1–12); p < 0.05]. 
Of note, BPD-PH ELGANs showed a higher rate of early onset 
sepsis (EOS, 47%) as compared to patients without PH (11%, p < 0.05). 
In addition, ELGANs with BPD-PH exhibited a signiﬁcantly lower birth 
weight than those with BPD in the absence of evidence of PH (mean 
BW: 650 g vs. 726 g; p < 0.004). However, there was no difference in 
the frequency of infants born small for gestational age (SGA) with PH 
(4/15) as compared to those without PH (5/19; p < 0.05). However, 
body weight at discharge was similar between patients with PH as 
compared to those without PH [3270 (2790–3768) vs. 3455 
(3088–3836); p > 0.05]. Postmenstrual age at discharge was signiﬁ- 
cantly higher in ELGANs with BPD-PH than in those without PH (43.7 
vs. 40.2 weeks, P < 0.001). Consistently, BPD-PH patients required a 
longer hospital stay of 4.8 (3.8–5.1) months vs. 3.2 (2.8–3.7) months in 
patients without PH (p < 0.001), respectively. 
BPD severity is associated with PH and RV dysfunction 
The 15 ELGANs with BPD-PH at 3 months of chronological age had a 
higher estimated “RVSP” of 34 (30–41) mmHg vs. 21 (19–23) mmHg in 
patients without PH (p < 0.001). At the 1-year follow-up time point, 
these 15 patents with BPD-PH diagnosed at 3 months still showed 
higher estimated RVSP values than infants without PH: 24 (22–28) 
mmHg vs. 19.5 (18–21) mmHg, respectively (p < 0.001). Compared to 
those without PH, the 15 ELGANs with BPD-PH had lower longitudinal 
systolic RV function [TAPSE 6.6 (6.0–8.0) mm vs. 9.0 (7.5–9.0) mm] at 
3 months (p = 0.005)]. At 12 months of chronological age, and after 
PH-targeted pharmacotherapy, 9/15 ELGANs showed resolution of PH, 
while 6/15 infants continued to exhibit elevated RVSP values, 
indicating chronic PH. Of note, during 12 months follow-up, all 15 
ELGANs who were initially diagnosed with BPD-PH had lower TAPSE 
values of 11.5 (9.0–13.5) mm vs. 14.0 (13.0–15.0) mm, compared to 
those without PH, respectively (p = 0.004). Accordingly, the TAPSE/ 
RVSP ratio was lower in the BPD-PH vs. non BPD-PH group: 0.22 
(0.17–0.23) vs. 0.37 (0.33–0.47) at 3 months (p < 0.001), and 0.50 
(0.37–0.59) vs. 0.68 (0.57–0.75) at 12 months of chronological age 
(p = 0.008), respectively (Fig. 2, and Supplementary Table). 
In addition, at 3 months, the 15 BPD-PH patients showed lower 
PAAT values of 45 (40–51) ms vs. 60 (53–65) ms in infants without

lower PAAT values were also seen at 
PH, 
12 months of chronological age: 75 (66–82) ms vs. 85 (77–90) ms, 
(p = 0.01). The 15 BPD-PH patients had a higher LVesEI of 1.4 
(1.32–1.50) vs. 1.06 (1.00–1.19) as compared to those infants 
without PH at 3 months of chronological age (p < 0.001). At 
12 months of chronological age, all 15 ELGANs who showed signs 
of BPD-PH at 3 months of age still exhibited higher LVesEI values 
than patients without PH [1.17 (1.05–1.19) vs. 1.00 (0.94–1.02), 
respectively (p < 0.001)]. Furthermore, the 15 BPD-PH patients had 
an increased RV/LV end-systolic ratio of 1.09 (1.05–1.15) vs. 0.90 
(0.82–0.93) than those infants without evidence of PH at 3 months 
of chronological age (p < 0.001), (Fig. 2, and Supplementary Table). 
Patients with persistent BPD-PH at 12 months of postnatal, 
chronological age 
At 12 months of chronological age, 6/15 ELGANs still fulﬁlled the 
diagnostic criteria for BPD-PH. When compared to the no-PH 
group, these 6 ELGANs with chronic BPD-PH had higher RVSP 
[30.5 mmHg (28.0–34.0) vs. 21.0 mmHg (19.0–22.0), p < 0.001], 
higher LVEI [1.23 (1.18–1.30) vs. 1.03 (1.00–1.10), p < 0.001] and 
higher RV/LV ratio values [1.02 (0.98–1.07) vs. 0.87 (0.85–0.94), p < 
0.001]. The 6 BPD-PH patients also had lower TAPSE [8.8 mm 
(7.8–10.3) vs. 13.8 mm (12.6–14.7), p < 0.001], lower PAAT [61 ms 
(53–66) vs. 83 ms (77–88), p < 0.001], and lower TAPSE/RVSP ratio 
values as compared to the infants without PH [0.32 (0.26–0.41) vs. 
0.62 (0.52–0.72), p < 0.001] (Supplementary Table). Of note, all ﬁve 
infants who had severe BPD showed evidence of ongoing BPD-PH 
by 12 months of chronological age requiring treatment, while only 
one infant with moderate BPD had ongoing BPD-PH. These results 
indicate that infants with moderate BPD are more likely to show 
resolution of BPD-PH throughout the ﬁrst 12 months of life. 
Medication 
All ELGANs who were diagnosed with PH received PH-targeted 
pharmacotherapy. Side effects (e.g., ﬂushing for sildenaﬁl; or low 
red blood cell count, common cold-like symptoms for macitentan) 
of the drugs were not observed in our ELGAN cohort. At initiation 
of therapy no signiﬁcant increase in heart rate or blood pressure 
drops of more than 10% to baseline were noted. At the ﬁrst time 
point (3 months of chronological age) out of the 15 ELGAN with 
BPD-PH, 11 received sildenaﬁl monotherapy and four patients 
with signiﬁcant PH received a PH-targeted dual combination 
therapy with sildenaﬁl and macitentan (start of dual combination 
therapy after a mean of 13.2 days under monotherapy). At the 
second time point (12 months of chronological age), out of the six 
ELGANs who still showed clear echocardiographic signs of BPD- 
PH, four infants received sildenaﬁl monotherapy and two were still 
on dual oral combination therapy with sildenaﬁl and macitentan, 
while in the other cases PH-targeted pharmacotherapy could be 
discontinued due to absent echocardiographic signs of PH and 
clinical improvement (Table 2). 
Biomarker of cardiac wall stress 
At 3 months of postnatal age, serum NT-proBNP concentrations were 
IQR: 621–2135) as 
higher in infants with BPD-PH (median: 1255, 
compared to those without PH (median: 466, IQR: 372–663 pg/ml; 
p = 0.023). Consistently, at the second time point (12 months) NT- 
proBNP values were still higher in the 6 ELGANs who had chronic 
BPD-PH despite pharmacotherapy (median: 359, IQR: 356–720 pg/ml 
IQR: 66–125 pg/ml; p = 0.001) (Fig. 3). A receiver 
vs. median: 87, 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed an area under 
the curve (AUC) of 0.91 (standard error 0.05) for NT-proBNP in 
discriminating patients with PH and those without BPD-PH, indicating

established normative age-matched PAAT values in 756 healthy 
neonates and children and found reduced PAAT values in infants 
with signiﬁcant PH [18]. 
study, we found 
signiﬁcantly shorter PAAT values in BPD-PH ELGANs as compared 
to ELGANs without PH at both time points (3 and 12 months of 
chronological age). Measurement of 
the end-systolic LVesEI 
(assessment of septal geometry) reﬂects ventricular-ventricular 
interaction [19]. It is unclear at which time point the preterm RV 
adapts in the context of moderate to severe lung disease (BPD) 
and subsequently increased pressure afterload. Usually, in patients 
with moderate-to-severe PH, the ratio of RV to LV pressure 
increases, and consecutively the septal curvature ﬂattens. An 
association between LVesEI and BPD-PH has been reported, with 
LVesEI values of ≥1.0 indicating PH in premature infants [20]. In 
our study, BPD-PH ELGANs exhibited higher LVesEI values than 
those ELGANs without PH at both time points (3 and 12 months of 
chronological age). 
Although therapeutic options for PH have increased over the 
past several decades, they remain limited and their use is usually 
not approved in preterm infants. Given the high mortality 
reported to be associated with BPD-PH, all ELGANs with features 
of BPD-PH in our cohort were treated off-label with PH-targeted 
medications, predominantly with the phosphodiesterase-5 inhi- 
bitor (PDE-5i) sildenaﬁl and the endothelin receptor antagonist 
(ERA) macitentan. Among the ERAs, only bosentan has been 
approved for pediatric use in children older than 12 months (but 
not in ELGANs) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nevertheless, off-label 
use of sildenaﬁl is increasing in premature infants with PH, but 
based on limited safety and efﬁcacy data [21]. Compared to 
bosentan, macitentan treatment offers some potential beneﬁts, 
such as a lower risk of drug interaction [22]. In addition, freedom 
from mandatory monthly liver function tests, as required under 
bosentan treatment, seems beneﬁcial, especially in preterm 
neonates [23]. Experience with macitentan in the treatment of 
pediatric PH is sparse [24–26] and not available in ELGANs to date. 
We used sildenaﬁl as ﬁrst line treatment in all patients with signs 
of mild or moderate BPD-PH, and macitentan as an add-on drug 
only in those cases with signs of severe, resistant BPD-PH (e.g., 
>half-systemic PA pressure despite treatment). Our data may 
support the assumption that PH-targeted therapy is safe even in 
small ELGANs and can improve echocardiographic parameters of 
biventricular size and function at 12 months of chronological age, 
but require conﬁrmation in larger systematic investigations. 
Of our 34 ELGANs, 31 had BPD, but in fact, 19 of those 34 did 
not show clear signs of PH at 3 months of chronological age. Thus, 
even in ELGANs (230/7–256/7 weeks gestation), physiologically 
resistance values decrease to 
increased pulmonary vascular 
normal ranges in about half of the patients within the ﬁrst 
3 months of postnatal life [27]. However, the speciﬁc etiology of 
PH in at-risk infants remains unclear. Our results suggest that early 
inﬂammation (EOS) may play a role in PH etiology, while other 
speciﬁc risk factor still need to be investigated.

an excellent diagnostic performance of NT-proBNP. Of note, none of 
the infants exhibited a signiﬁcant intra- or extracardiac shunt (e.g., a 
hemodynamically signiﬁcant patent ductus arteriosus), that might 
have confounded NT-proBNP results. 
DISCUSSION 
About 15–20 years ago, the incidence of PH in preterm infants 
born <32 weeks gestation had been reported to be ~25% [4, 15], 
with a PH-associated mortality of almost 50% at 24 months of 
chronological age [4, 7]. An even higher incidence of PH is 
suggested in ELGANs with respiratory morbidities such as BPD 
[16]. Based on systematic screening echocardiography at 3 months 
of uncorrected age, we diagnosed PH in patients with moderate- 
to-severe BPD but not in those with only mild BPD. We used 
traditional criteria for staging severity of BPD [8]. However, this 
deﬁnition has recently been challenged and a new deﬁnition of 
BPD was proposed [9]. The signiﬁcance of this new, alternative 
BPD deﬁnition on the current incidence and morbidity/mortality 
of BPD-PH still needs to be investigated, but our results suggest 
that BPD as deﬁned by Jensen et al. (e.g., no supplemental oxygen 
requirement, but noninvasive respiratory support) may not be 
associated with an increased risk of PH since in our cohort, BPD-PH 
was almost exclusively seen in infants with moderate-to 
severe BPD. 
Recent pediatric PH guidelines recommend that all premature 
BPD infants should undergo an echocardiographic examination at 
36 weeks gestational age and before hospital discharge (i.e., at 
3 months of chronological age in ELGANs) for the evaluation of PH 
[4, 13, 17]. In addition to TRV and TAPSE as surrogate markers for 
RVSP and longitudinal systolic RV function, we herein investigated 
more 
of 
ventricular-ventricular interaction such as RV/LV ratio and LVesEI, 
TAPSE/RVSP ratio (reﬂecting both functional capacity and the 
hemodynamic performance of the individual RV-PA unit) and

levels 
were identiﬁed as signiﬁcant prognostic marker in pediatric PH, 
deemed useful in the longitudinal assessment of PH patients [28]. 
Recent studies found a stable correlation between NT-proBNP and 
BPD development, with and without BPD-PH [29–31]. Accordingly, 
we found that NT-proBNP values at 3 and 12 months were higher 
in patients with BPD-PH as compared to those without PH, and 
well-suited for discriminating between infants with and those 
without BPD-PH. We therefore suggest that NT-proBNP provides a 
suitable addition to the diagnostic work-up for BPD-PH patients, as 
recently suggested in a novel treatment algorithm for BPD-PH [4]. 
Limitations 
While the sample size of this ELGAN cohort is limited, our results still 
allowed us to investigate standard and novel echocardiographic 
variables in extremely immature preterm infants (230/7–256/7 weeks’ 
GA) with and without BPD-PH. However, a comparative assessment 
and multi-regression analysis delineating the individual prognostic 
value of each single variable was not possible, since it is impossible 
to provide a “healthy” control group for a detailed statistical analysis. 
In addition, none of our hemodynamic results were conﬁrmed by 
invasive measurements by cardiac catheterization, though this is not 
uncommon in such a vulnerable population, and actually an explicit 
exception in the recent EPPVDN recommendations on pediatric PH 
[4, 13]. In addition, this is a descriptive study that does not include 
any risk analyses of individual factors and their potential impact on 
BPD-PH development. Larger cohorts need to be studied to address 
these questions. 
In conclusion, we show that ELGANs born at 230/7–256/7 weeks 
are at substantial risk for developing BPD-PH. At 3 months of age, 
44% had signs of BPD-PH, while after 12 months of age, 18% still 
demonstrated echocardiographic features of BPD-PH requiring 
continuation of PH-targeted pharmacotherapy. While our ﬁndings 
may further implicate that early, sufﬁciently dosed PH-targeted 
pharmacotherapy (sildenaﬁl ± ERA) can lower PA and RV pressure 
and has the potential to decrease mortality associated with BPD- 
PH, large controlled trials are required to assess safety and efﬁcacy 
of PH-targeted therapy in the vulnerable population of preterm 
infants.
