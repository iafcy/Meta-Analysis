Abstract 
Premature birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are risk factors for the development of echocardiographic signs of 
pulmonary hypertension (PH) and are associated with changes in cardiac structure and function. It is unclear whether this 
association persists beyond early infancy. The aims of this study are to prospectively investigate the prevalence of PH in children 
with severe BPD and to investigate the effect of BPD and PH on myocardial structure and function at six months corrected age. 
Preterm infants (gestational age (cid:2) 32 weeks) with severe BPD were included. Echocardiography was used to define PH and to 
measure speckle tracking derived longitudinal and circumferential strain of the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). Sixty-nine 
infants with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) gestational age of 25.6 (24.9–26.4) weeks and a median birthweight of 770 
(645–945) gram were included. Eight (12%) infants had signs of PH at six months corrected age. RV fractional area change was 
lower in infants with severe BPD and PH at six months compared to infants without PH (35% (cid:3) 9% vs. 43% (cid:3) 9%, P ¼ 0.03). 
RV mean longitudinal systolic strain was lower in infants with severe BPD and PH compared to infants without PH (17.6% [(cid:4)19.5%/ 
(cid:4)16.1%] vs. (cid:4)20.9% [(cid:4)25.9%/(cid:4)17.9%], P ¼ 0.04). RV size and LV longitudinal and circumferential strain in children with BPD with 
or without PH were similar. Signs of PH were found in 12% of infants with severe BPD at six months corrected age and the 
presence of PH is associated with reduced RV systolic function.

Premature birth is associated with increased right ventricular 
(RV) mass, reduced RV systolic and diastolic function, and 
increased pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs) in schoolchil- 
dren, adolescents, and young adults.1–3 Bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia (BPD) is the leading cause of respiratory-disease 
related pulmonary hypertension (PH) 
in the neonatal 
period4 and carries a high risk for mortality and morbidity.5–9 
Infants born extremely preterm are at risk of developing 
BPD, a chronic lung disease that is characterized by a 
disruption of alveolar and pulmonary vascular growth.6,10 
Neonates are now treated at an earlier gestational age 
(GA), creating a growing population of infants with early 
disruption of pulmonary and vascular development.11

The incidence of PH in infants and neonates with BPD is in 
the range of 2–53%, depending on BPD severity, PH deﬁni- 
tion, type of study design, and age of assessment.9,11–18 The 
exact pathophysiological pathways that link PH towards 
unfavorable outcome in infants with BPD are incompletely 
understood, but changes in the pulmonary vasculature and 
the increased afterload that is imposed upon the RV might 
play an important role. Pulmonary vascular disease and 
increased RV afterload might lead to maladaptation of the 
RV myocardium and ultimately RV failure.19,20 Cardiac 
catheterization is the gold standard for assessing the presence 
or absence of PH, but this invasive procedure is unsuitable 
for screening.21 Echocardiography is a widely available and 
commonly used tool to assess the presence of PH. However, 
there are no published guidelines for the echocardiographic 
assessment of PH in the pediatric population and correlation 
with invasively measured PAP is not optimal.22 For this 
reason other methods should be considered to assess PH 
and its eﬀect on the RV. A potential useful 
to 
assess the RV and left ventricular (LV) function includes 
new echocardiographic methods such as myocardial defor- 
mation 
echocardiography 
[STE]).23 Because long-term prospective follow-up studies 
of children with BPD are scarce, data on the impact of PH 
on cardiovascular function later in life in children with BPD 
are limited.8,11,12,15,24 




Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the pre- 
valence of PH in a prospective non-selected cohort of chil- 
dren with severe BPD. Furthermore, we wanted to 
investigate the eﬀect of BPD and echocardiographic esti- 
mated PH on myocardial structure and function at six 
months corrected age, using standard echocardiograph ima- 
ging and STE. We hypothesize that children with BPD have 
a high risk of developing PH and changes in RV size and 
function. 
Methods 
Patient selection 
This is a prospective cohort study. From April 2012 to April 
2017, we enrolled preterm neonates born at GA < 32 weeks 
with severe BPD who were born in the Erasmus Medical 
Center/Sophia Children Hospital or who were referred to 
us by other hospitals. Severe BPD was deﬁned as oxygen 
supplementation for (cid:5)28 days and need for either >30% 
oxygen, >1 L/min ﬂow, continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) or ventilator support at 36 weeks post menstrual 
age (PMA).15 In our hospital, all patients with severe 
BPD are assessed by a multidisciplinary team (cardiologist, 
pulmonologist, general pediatrician, psychologist, and phy- 
siotherapist) according to a predeﬁned follow-up scheme. 
A clinical assessment was scheduled at the age of (cid:3)6 
months corrected age. In addition, we included 12 healthy 
infants who were born at term at the Leiden University 
Medical Center who participated in a diﬀerent study on 
echocardiographic pediatric normal values (online supple- 
mentary table).25 
Infants were included in this study if they were diagnosed 
with severe BPD at 36 weeks PMA and had a cardiac ultra- 
sound at approximately the age of six months (corrected for 
term date). Exclusion criteria were: (1) hemodynamically 
signiﬁcant congenital heart lesion, except patent foramen 
ovale (<5 mm) and a small patent arterial duct (<1 mm) 
without volume overload; and (2) overall poor quality of 
the echocardiograph images. Written informed consent to 
use these data for research purposes was obtained from 
both parents of the infants. The study was approved by 
the medical ethical committee of 
the Erasmus MC, 
Rotterdam, The Netherlands (METC-2015-694). 

Clinical data were collected using the patients’ medical 
records on usage of prenatal steroids, pre-eclampsia of the 
mother during pregnancy, gender, GA, birthweight, Apgar 
score at 1, 5, and 10 min, medication during infancy, dura- 
tion of mechanical support and invasive oxygen demand; 
presence and treatment of patent arterial duct; perinatal 
infections; use of nitric oxide; and neonatal mortality. 
General data were collected from the patients’ medical 
records on height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate 
at the time of echocardiographic assessment. 

An extensive echocardiogram was performed at the age 
of approximately six months corrected age to exclude 
congenital or acquired heart disease using an EPIQ 7C 
(Philips Medical Systems, Best, 
the Netherlands) or 
Vivid E9 (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) ultra- 
sound system. Apical four-chamber, parasternal long-axis 
and short-axis views were acquired and stored. M-mode, 
two-dimensional (2D), color Doppler, and pulsed wave 
Doppler images were acquired to collect data on tricuspid 
regurgitant jet, pulmonic valve insuﬃciency, pulmonary 
artery acceleration time (PAAT), RV and LV dimensions 
and mass, shortening fraction of the LV, and fractional area 
change (FAC) of the RV. Right ventricular systolic pressure 
(RVSP) was estimated by using the modiﬁed Bernoulli 
equation (tricuspid regurgitant jet2 (cid:6) 4), with no allowance 
for the right atrial pressure.16 All measurements were per- 
formed oﬀ-line using Xcelera (version R4.1, Philips, Best, 
The Netherlands). Z-scores were calculated for LV and RV 
dimensions and wall thickness.26 The average of three mea- 
surements was used. 
The presence of PH was assessed using the following 
criteria12,18: (1) presence of tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity 
(cid:5)2.8 m/s in the absence of pulmonary stenosis; and (2) ﬂat 
or leftward deviated interventricular septal conﬁguration. 
Children with one or both of these ﬁndings were character- 
ized as having PH. 


Two-dimensional echocardiographic images were stored 
for oﬀ-line analysis of myocardial deformation patterns 
(circumferential systolic strain and longitudinal systolic 
strain) of the LV and RV using dedicated speckle tracking 
(Cardiac Performance analysis, version 4.6, 
software 
Tomtec, Unterschleisheim, Germany) 
previously 
described.27 The images were stored as Digital Imaging 
and Communications in Medicine format with a default 
setting of 30 frames/s. Longitudinal systolic strain of the 
LV and RV were measured using apical four-chamber 
views. Circumferential systolic strain of the LV was mea- 
sured using short-axis views at the level of the papillary 
muscles. The endocardial border was manually traced at 
end-systole (minimal volume). Tracking of the endocardial 
border was visually inspected and manually adjusted if 
necessary. After obtaining satisfactory endocardial tracking, 
the epicardial border was added to incorporate the entire 
myocardial wall (except for RV strain, were only the endo- 
cardial wall was 
re-inspected 
throughout the cardiac cycle and adjusted as necessary. 
The cardiac cycle with the best tracking and visually most 
credible strain curves was selected for analysis. If a segment 
was not tracking appropriately, this segment was excluded 
from the analysis. The software divides the myocardium into 
six segments (circumferential strain and longitudinal strain 
of the LV) or one segment (lateral wall of the RV). For LV 
longitudinal systolic strain, the segments are: basal septum; 
mid-septum; apical 
lateral; mid-lateral; 
septum; apical 
and basal lateral. For LV circumferential systolic strain, 
the segments are: mid-anterior; mid-lateral; mid-posterior; 
mid-inferior; and mid-septal. Mean strain values were calcu- 
lated from the individual segmental strain values. At least 4/6 
segments were necessary to calculate mean strain values; 
images with >2 missing segments were excluded from analysis. 



intra-observer variability of 
the strain parameters, 15 
patients were analyzed by the same investigator (AB) on 
two separate occasions, with at least one week of time 
apart. To describe inter-observer variability, the same 15 
patients were analyzed by a second investigator (LK). 


In the study period, a total of 93 patients were diagnosed 
with severe BPD. We excluded 24 patients (Fig. 1). Three 
died before the age of six months: one died of respiratory 
failure caused by BPD; one died of therapy refractory PH; 
and one died as the consequences of a complex congenital 
syndrome. Of the remaining 21 excluded infants, three had a 
hemodynamically signiﬁcant congenital heart defect, 17 
were unable to attend the follow-up clinic at six months of 
age, and one had an echocardiogram with poor quality. All 
general characteristics were similar in excluded versus 
included children except for GA (26.3 [IQR ¼ 25.3–27.2] 
vs. 25.6 [IQR ¼ 24.6–26.5 weeks], P ¼ 0.02), prevalence of 
maternal pre-eclampsia (42% vs. 15%, P ¼ 0.01), 5-min 
Apgar score (8 [IQR ¼ 7–9] vs. 7 [IQR ¼ 6–8], P ¼ 0.04) 
and prevalence of prenatal steroid treatment (78% vs. 
96%, P ¼ 0.03). 
Of the 69 included patients the median (IQR) corrected 
age at echocardiographic follow-up was six months (5–7 
months). 

In Table 1, the general patient characteristics are shown. 
Eight infants (12%) had echocardiographic signs of PH at 

All statistical analyzes were preformed using SPSS software, 
version 21,0 (IBM SPSS Statistic, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, 
USA). A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁ- 
cant. Continuous data were tested for normality using the 
Shapiro Wilk test. Continuous data were described as mean 
((cid:3)SD) if normally distributed or as median (interquartile 
range [IQR]), if non-normally distributed. Categorical data 
were described as frequencies and percentages. Baseline dif- 
ferences in categorical variables between infants were ana- 
lyzed using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous 
variables were analyzed using independent student-test or 
ANOVA if normally distributed. Non-normally distributed 
data were analyzed using Mann–Whitney U test. 

Inter- and intra-observer was tested using a Coeﬃcients of 
Variation (CoV) and Bland–Altman analysis. To describe

the age of six months. The majority of children (n ¼ 63) with 
severe BPD were born at a GA < 28 weeks. Only six children 
were born at 28–32 weeks. All children underwent invasive 
mechanical ventilation during hospital admission, except 
one child who received CPAP only and one child who 
received non-invasive mechanical ventilatory support only. 
Duration of mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks of age was 
statistically signiﬁcantly longer in infants with PH compared 
to infants without PH at six months (40 (cid:3) 16 vs. 24 (cid:3) 16 
days, P ¼ 0.02). PH was based on TI-jet (cid:5)2.8 in ﬁve cases 
and ﬂat intraventricular septum in seven cases (overlap of 
inclusion criteria in four children). Detailed information of 
the children with PH is provided in Table 2. One child was 
treated with sildenaﬁl for 2.5 years, one child was treated 
with sildenaﬁl (4 mg/kg/day) and nitric oxide, and one child 
was treated with nitric oxide only (during the neonatal 
phase). Five out of eight children were still on oxygen ther- 
apy at six months of corrected age at the echocardiographic 
assessment. 

Table 3 summarizes the anthropometric and standard echo- 
cardiographic measurements at the age of six months cor- 
rected for GA. Anthropometric parameters were similar in 
infants with and without PH. The presence of tricuspid 
regurgitation was higher in infants with severe BPD and 
PH compared to infants with severe BPD without PH 
(63% vs. 20%, P ¼ 0.02). RV FAC was statistically signiﬁ- 
cantly lower in infants with PH compared to infants without 
PH (35.4 (cid:3) 9.2% vs. 43.1 (cid:3) 9.4%, P ¼ 0.03). No diﬀerences 
between the groups were observed in RV dimensions 
and PAAT. The results of the myocardial strain parameters 
are presented in Table 4. RV global 
longitudinal strain 
was statistically signiﬁcantly lower (less negative) in BPD 
infants with PH compared to BPD infants without PH

absence of changes in RV size. We also found that preterm 
infants with severe BPD and PH at the age of six months 
required a longer period of mechanical ventilation than 
infants with severe BPD who did not develop PH. 

The majority of the echocardiographic images were of 
suﬃcient quality for analysis. Feasibility for RV global long- 
itudinal strain was 93%. Feasibility for measuring LV 
global longitudinal strain was 96%, whereas the feasibility 
for the LV global circumferential strain was 86%. The 
reproducibility for myocardial strain measurements are 
shown in the online supplement. 

We found in a prospective cohort of children with severe 
BPD that approximately 12% of the infants had echocardio- 
graphic sign of PH at the age of six months. We found 
echocardiographic signs of RV systolic dysfunction in chil- 
dren with PH compared to children without PH as indicated 
by lower RV global longitudinal strain and RV FAC in the 

The prevalence of PH in infants and neonates with BPD 
described in the literature is in the range of <1% to 
53%.11–18,24 The diﬀerences in PH prevalence described in 
various studies probably reﬂect diﬀerences in study design 
(retrospective versus prospective), timing of echocardio- 
graphic assessment, study population (diﬀerences in BPD 
severity), neonatal ventilation, and other treatment strate- 
gies and, to some extent, diﬀerences in PH deﬁnition. The 
majority of studies that describe PH in children with BPD 
perform the echocardiographic assessment at or before two 
months of corrected age.11–13,15–18,24 At this young age, neo- 
nates are within or close to the time window in which the 
physiological transition from high pulmonary vascular resis- 
tance (PVR) intra-uterine to low vascular PVR after birth 
takes place. In addition, the arterial duct is patent in many 
neonates close to birth, which potentially interferes with the 
diagnosis of PH. We therefore chose to assess PH at six

months of corrected age and found a prevalence of 12%. 
The only prospective study in older preterm children we are 
aware of is the multicenter study by Levy et al.14 The study 
population consisted of 239 children born at <29 weeks of 
gestation, of which 164 were assessed at 36 weeks PMA and 
81 were assessed at one year of corrected age.14 Of these 
children, 52% developed BPD in various degrees of severity. 
Echocardiographic deﬁned PH was found in 10% of 
children with moderate to severe BPD at 36 weeks PMA and 
in 1% at the age of one year.14 However, recent studies have 
shown that school-aged children and adolescents who were 
born prematurely (and especially those children with BPD) 
have a greater peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity assessed 
by echocardiography and higher mean PAP assessed by 
catheterization compared to term controls.2,3 
cardiac 
These ﬁndings, together with the ﬁndings of ours and 
other studies, suggest that PH prevalence in prematurely 
born children decreases over time but that these children 
remain at risk for the development and persistence of pul- 
monary vascular disease, especially those children with 
severe BPD. The determination of the true prevalence of 
PH is hampered by the limitations of echocardiography, 
since the velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet and the 
position of the intraventricular septum are at best surrogate 
markers of increased PAPs.22 Recently, the PAAT has been 
suggested as a reliable estimation of PAP and PVR in chil- 
dren.28 Pediatric reference values for PAAT have been pub- 
lished;29 a recent study by Levy et al. found a decreased 
PAAT in preterm born children compared to term-born 
controls and lower values in children with BPD compared 
to children without BPD at the age of one year.30 We found 
a median PAAT of 80 ms in our total population, compared 
to 73 ms in preterm-born infants in the study by Levy et al. 
at the age of one year.30 We found similar PAAT in children 
with and without PH, which suggests that PAAT is not a 
sensitive marker to detect PH at the age of six months of 
corrected age. We believe that the results published by Levy 
et al. should be interpreted with caution, since most of the 
children in their study had a PAAT within the normal range 
(64–116 ms for girls and 62–114 ms for boys).29 In addition, 
PAAT has been validated against invasively assessed pul- 
monary hemodynamics in children with a median age of 
6–8 years and no children aged <1 year were included in 
this validation study.28 
We found that infants with severe BPD and PH at the age 
of six months had a longer duration of mechanical ventila- 
tion at 36 weeks PMA compared to infants with severe BPD 
without PH. In a large retrospective study by An et al., it 
was found that severity of BPD, long-term ventilator care, 
oxygen supplementation, and a high ventilator setting, were 
associated with PH beyond two months of age based on 
univariate analysis.11 Ali et al. performed a study in preterm 
neonates on predictors of BPD and PH and found that the 
duration of invasive oxygen use was signiﬁcantly longer in 
neonates with BPD and PH at 36 weeks PMA.31 Our results 
are in accordance with these studies. 

We found that in children with severe BPD the RV FAC 
and RV global 
longitudinal strain values were lower in 
infants with PH compared to infants without PH at six 
months of corrected age. Levy et al. investigated the matura- 
tional (age- and weight-related) changes of RV FAC in 


preterm and term children.32 They found that preterm 
infants, independent of the presence of PH, with moderate 
to severe BPD had a lower RV FAC at 36 weeks PMA 
compared to preterm infants without BPD. Levy et al. per- 
formed another prospective multicenter cohort study on 
changes in systolic ventricular strain mechanics and found 
that preterm infants (mean GA ¼ 27 weeks) with PH as 
assessed at the age of 36 weeks PMA had signiﬁcant lower 
RV free wall longitudinal strain at the age of one year com- 
pared to infants who did not have PH at 36 weeks PMA.14 
In addition, they found that at the age of 32 weeks PMA, 
36 weeks PMA, and one year, children with BPD had lower 
RV global longitudinal strain values compared to children 
without BPD.14,30 Even after adjusting for the presence of 
BPD, the RV free wall strain at the age of one year remained 
lower in infants with PH compared to infants without PH 
deﬁned at the age of 36 weeks PMA.14 
RV FAC is reduced in older children and adults with 
idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and is 
a strong predictor of mortality.33 In addition, the RV is 
dilated in adult patients with IPAH and increased RV 
volume strongly predicts mortality in these patients.34 
In contrast, increased afterload of the RV in the setting of 
congenital pulmonary valve stenosis is associated with 
normal systolic function as assessed by RV FAC, possibly 
because in early infancy the RV is used to the physiological 
high PVR and high PAP and can therefore maintain ade- 
quate RV function.35,36 Interestingly, in our study, RV size 
as assessed by tricuspid valve annulus size or RV dimension 
in diastole were similar between children with and without 
PH. Our data, together with the data by Levy et al.,14,32 
suggest that adaptation of the RV in extremely premature- 
born children with BPD and PH is fundamentally diﬀerent 
as compared to older children or adults with IPAH 
(decreased RV function and RV dilatation) as well as infants 
and children with pulmonary valve stenosis (relatively well- 
preserved RV function). Levy et al. also found that a small 
group of premature infants without BPD can develop echo- 
cardiographic signs of PH at the age of 36 weeks and that 
these infants also show lower RV global longitudinal strain 
values.14 These observations suggest that a primary pulmon- 
ary vascular injury coupled with RV dysfunction may occur 
in some preterm-born infants irrespective of the underlying 
lung disease.14 Lower RV global longitudinal strain values 
are also found in other studies comparing children with 
BPD to children without BPD.37–39 However, these studies 
were performed earlier in life, mostly around birth, and 
included children with BPD ranging from mild to severe. 
In our study, we found no diﬀerences in RV global long- 
itudinal strain between infants with severe BPD without PH 
and healthy infants. This suggests that later in life the inﬂu- 
ence of BPD on RV function is less important and the pre- 
sence of PH becomes more important. Further studies 
are needed to provide more insight in these time-related 
and disease-related diﬀerences in RV adaptation, preferably 
in a larger multicenter prospective cohort where all 



prematurely born children are routinely screened according 
to a standard protocol. These data are important to design 
prevention and treatment strategies for infants born extre- 
mely premature. 
The LV strain parameters did not diﬀer between infants 
with or without PH. This is in line with current literature.14,37,39 
In young adults born premature, it has been shown that LV 
mass is increased, and systolic and diastolic LV function are 
decreased compared to healthy controls born at term, although 
in this study the presence of BPD is not mentioned.40 

The main strengths of this study are the prospective study 
design, the echocardiographic assessment at an older age 
compared to previously published studies, and the use of 
new echocardiographic techniques. 
To determine PH, we used echocardiography. Although 
this is the safest and most commonly used method to assess 
PH in preterm infants, the gold standard is right heart cathe- 
terization (RHC). There are no standardized methods to 
detect PH in infants using echocardiography and agreement 
with PH assessed by catheterization is, at most, moderate.22 
It is therefore possible that by using ultrasound instead of 
RHC we may have missed or over-diagnosed infants with 
PH. However, RHC is an invasive procedure and, due to 
ethical reasons, not suitable for screening. 
Although we included a relatively large number of 
patients compared to other studies on this topic, 
the 
sample size was too small to perform multiple logistic 
regression analysis in a meaningful way. Larger studies are 
needed to investigate the association between PH and RV 
function and its potential confounders. 
In the initial study design, we did not include a term 
control group. Instead, we used echocardiographic studies 
of children who had participated in a diﬀerent study on 
normal values for myocardial deformation. We acknowl- 
edge that this approach is sub-optimal; however, since the 
main echocardiographic parameters were similar between 
the infants with BPD without PH and the term control 
group, we believe that our ﬁndings in infants with BPD 
and PH are of considerable value. 
All echocardiographic images were stored as Digital 
Imaging and Communications in Medicine format with a 
default setting of 30 frames/s. We decided not to include 
strain rate parameters in our study, since higher frame 
rates are needed to quantify strain rate reliably. For this 
reason, no data on diastolic cardiac function were obtained. 
Lastly, we only included infants with severe BPD. As we 
only screen infants with severe BPD, we cannot make any 
statements regarding infants with mild to moderate BPD 
and preterm infants without BPD. More research on PH 
and the cardiac consequences later in life for prematurely 
born children with and without BPD and healthy controls 
born at term is needed to determine prevention and treat- 
ment strategies. 
In conclusion, the prevalence of echocardiographic signs 
of PH in preterm infants with severe BPD was 12% at the 
median corrected age of six months. Although the clinical 
and echocardiographic features in these infants with PH 
seems relatively mild, they show signs of decreased RV func- 
tion assessed by RV fractional area change and RV global 
longitudinal strain compared to infants with severe BPD 
without PH and compared to term healthy controls. Our 
study suggests that BPD-associated PH might leave a nega- 
tive impact on the RV function, and that the mechanisms of 
RV adaptation in these premature born infants are diﬀerent 
from RV adaptation in children and adults with increased 
RV afterload caused by IPAH or pulmonary valve stenosis.
