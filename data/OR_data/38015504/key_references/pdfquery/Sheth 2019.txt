Abstract 
Objective To investigate factors associated with development of early and late pulmonary hypertension (E/LPH) in preterm 
infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). 
Study design A retrospective case-control observational study of preterm infants with BPD admitted to a level IV referral 
neonatal intensive care unit over 5 years. We compared pre- and postnatal characteristics between infants with or without 
BPD-associated EPH and LPH. 
Results Fifty-nine out of 220 infants (26.8%) had LPH, while 85 out of 193 neonates (44%) had EPH. On multiple logistic 
regression, novel factors associated with development of BPD–LPH included presence of maternal diabetes, EPH, tra- 
cheostomy, tracheitis, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH, grade ≥3) and systemic steroid use. For EPH, these were maternal 
diabetes, IVH grade ≥3, high frequency ventilator use, and absence of maternal antibiotics use. 
Conclusion We identiﬁed novel factors and conﬁrmed previously established factors with development of LPH and EPH, 
which can help develop a screening strategy in BPD patients. 

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common 
chronic lung disease of infancy in the United States with an 
incidence of over 30% in extremely preterm infants, result- 
ing in 10,000–15,000 new cases annually in the United 
States [1]. Prenatal steroids, gentle ventilation techniques, as 
well as exogenous surfactant have increased survival rates in 
preterm infants and decreased the severity of lung injury [2]. 
Over the last two decades, while survival rates of extremely 
low birth weight (ELBW) infants has steadily improved, the 
number of patients with BPD has remained the same or even

increased [3, 4]. BPD is associated with increased mortality, 
poor neurodevelopmental outcome, and long-term respira- 
tory complications in survivors [4–6]. 
Among the cardiovascular sequelae, pulmonary hyperten- 
sion (PH) contributes signiﬁcantly to the high morbidity and 
mortality in BPD patients. Vascular remodeling, reduced 
alveolar–capillary surface area, altered distribution of vessels, 
and abnormal vascular tone and reactivity result in an increase 
in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) [7]. Increased PVR 
leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and subse- 
quently right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and RV failure. 
There have been multiple retrospective and prospective stu- 
dies which have recognized various risk factors for the 
development of PH in infants with BPD such as LBW, small 
for gestational age (SGA), duration of mechanical ventilation, 
use of high frequency ventilation, longer duration of anti- 
biotics, surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus and severe 
BPD [8–12]. However some of these studies used a limited 
number of perinatal factors to seek association with the 
development of PH. There have been limited studies to ﬁnd 
the factors associated with Early PH (EPH) and also the 
relationship of EPH with Late PH (LPH) and BPD [9, 13–15]. 
We conducted a retrospective case-control observational 
study on a fairly large sample size to investigate the asso- 
factors using standardized 
ciation of multiple perinatal 



deﬁnitions for development of EPH and LPH using deﬁned 
echocardiographic criteria in preterm infants with BPD. We 
used a comprehensive list of pre- and postnatal variables with 
the goal of a detailed analysis of all potential risk factors 
contributing to E/LPH. In addition, we investigated the rela- 
tionship between EPH and LPH, with the aim of an earlier 
detection of BPD–LPH for a potential future utility of an 
improved therapeutic approach to identify and manage 
BPD–LPH to decrease morbidity/mortality in these infants. 


This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at 
St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, PA 
and Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia PA. 
The study population was a retrospective, observational 
cohort of patients at St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children 
(SCHC) from January 2012 to December 2016. SCHC is an 
academic, urban hospital in Philadelphia, PA, USA with a 39- 
bed level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which has 
around 300 admissions a year referred from adjacent level I, II 
and III NICUs as well as from emergency rooms. Infants 
<32 weeks gestational age (GA) at birth, and with a birth 
weight (BW) of <1500 g were identiﬁed using electronic 
medical records. Patients were excluded if they died <28 day 
of life (DOL), medical records were missing or if they had 
multiple anomalies/aneuploidy, congenital heart disease 
(CHD, other than atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal 
defect (VSD), or PDA), or congenital lung disease. 


The BPD consensus deﬁnition for infants with GA <32 weeks 
was used to categorize and classify our patient population 
[16], i.e., treatment with oxygen for at least 28 days with 
categorization into the following three subgroups at 36 weeks’ 
postmenstrual age (PMA): (1) mild (breathing room air); (2) 
moderate (need for a <0.3 fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)), 
and (3) severe (need for ≥0.3 FiO2 and/or positive pressure 
support). Infants with BPD who died of respiratory causes 
before the assessment date (i.e., after 28 DOL and before 
36 weeks PMA) were included in the analysis and considered 
to have “severe disease” [17, 18]. 

The primary outcome was Late PH (LPH), deﬁned as PH 
diagnosed ≥28 DOL, while we divided Early PH (EPH) in 
three categories. (1) EPH I: PH diagnosed ≤7 DOL, (2) EPH 
II: PH diagnosed ≤14 DOL and (3) EPH III: PH diagnosed 
<28 DOL. PH was deﬁned based on the following echo- 
cardiogram criteria [10, 19]: (1) RV systolic pressure (SP) 
>40 mmHg; (2) RVSP/systemic systolic blood pressure 
ratio >0.5; (3) Any VSD or PDA with bidirectional or right- 
to-left shunting; (4) If no tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet or 
shunt present then two out of following three criteria: (a) 
Any degree of interventricular septal ﬂattening; (b) RV 
dilatation; (c) RV hypertrophy. As per our NICU protocol, 
all the echocardiograms in NICU are transthoracic complete 
echocardiograms (CEs) with color doppler unless speciﬁed 
by a neonatologist or a cardiologist to be a limited echo- 
cardiogram to look for speciﬁc pathology. As part of our 
NICU protocol, which was implemented in July 2015, CEs 
to screen for PH are performed at corrected 36 weeks PMA 
and interpreted by pediatric cardiologists for the patients 
who are diagnosed with any stage of BPD. 

Interpretation of all the CEs performed on the infants were 
reviewed by the study team. Directionality of the shunt 
through an ASD, patent foramen ovale (PFO), VSD, or 
PDA was entered as (1) left-to-right (2) right-to-left or (3) 
bidirectional. Right ventricular dilatation, hypertrophy, 
septal ﬂattening, and TR jet were deﬁned as either present 
or absent. Reported RV pressure and systemic pressures 
were recorded as numerical. ASDs were categorized as (1) 
none (2) PFO, (3) PFO vs. ASD or (4) ASD. PDA was 
deﬁned as (1) none (2) small (3) moderate (4) large as 
deﬁned by Ramos et al. [20]. Hemodynamically signiﬁcant 
PDA was deﬁned as per Zonnenberg et al. [21]. 



Data abstracted from the patient’s chart included maternal 
history, prenatal characteristics, intrapartum history, post- 
partum history, and postnatal NICU course along with 
multiple complications as shown in Tables 1 and 2. 
Antenatal diagnoses such as gestational diabetes, intrauter- 
ine growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia, preterm pre- 
mature 
and 
chorioamnionitis were deﬁned as per the American College 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines 
[22–26]. Maternal diabetes included preexisting as well as 
gestational diabetes. Maternal antibiotics included any 
antibiotics given to the mother in the antenatal period 
except if given for presurgical prophylaxis. Tracheitis was 
deﬁned as following: (1) absence of clinical or radiographic 
evidence of pneumonia, AND (2) a positive culture 
obtained by deep tracheal aspirate or bronchoscopy, AND 
(3) ≥2 of the following signs or symptoms with no other

tracheal culture in the presence of any of above symptoms 
in the absence of pneumonia ﬁndings on chest x-ray. It is a 
routine clinical practice in our NICU to administer tapering 
doses of dexamethasone for 10 days as per the DART 
protocol for BPD patients requiring prolonged invasive 
mechanical ventilation [29]. Bacteremia was deﬁned as any 
positive blood culture during the NICU stay for the patient. 
Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was classiﬁed as per 
Papile et al., while periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) was 
deﬁned as described by Banker et al. [30, 31]. IVH inter-

maturity (ROP) [32, 33]. 





All data were retrospectively collected using the electronic 
medical records. Chi-square test was used to assess the 
association between categorical variables unless the cell 
frequency was ≤5, in which case the Fisher’s exact test was 
used. Distribution of continuous variables was assessed 
using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed con- 
tinuous variables were analyzed using independent sample 
t-test, while Mann–Whitney U test was used for non-normal 
distributions. To determine the effect of all the prenatal and 
postnatal variables on the outcome of LPH and EPH, 
binomial logistic regression was used to arrive at odds ratios 
(OR), and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI). Adjusted OR

Bold values indicate statistical signiﬁcance p ≤ 0.05 
were determined by multiple logistic regression, to control 
for possible confounding effects of other variables. In the 
multivariate model, LPH (yes or no) and EPH (yes or no) 
were considered as the dependent variables separately, and 
all the prenatal and postnatal variables were analyzed as 
independent variables, which were adjusted for BW and sex 
as covariates. We also replaced BW with GA, with no major 
impact in our results. All data were analyzed with SPSS 
24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All statistical 
tests were two-tailed, and P values ≤ 0.05 were considered 
statistically signiﬁcant. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test was 
conducted to determine the model’s goodness of ﬁt. 


As per Figure 1, over a 5-year-period after using inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, we found 258 patients with BPD, who ﬁt 
the NIH consensus deﬁnition. We had to exclude 38 patients 
as none of them received any CE ≥ 28 DOL. The median GA 
at birth was 25 + 6 weeks (range, 22–31 + 0 weeks), and the 
median BW was 750 g (range, 330–1460 g). Out of 220 
patients, 144, 176, and 193 patients had received at least one 
CE ≤ 7 DOL, ≤ 14 DOL, and < 28 DOL, respectively. So, 
while analyzing data with EPH I, II, and III, we considered 
only those patients who received at least one CE in their 
respective time period. The pre- and postnatal characteristics 
of the infants studied are presented in Table 1. 

As the PH screening protocol was implemented in middle of 
the study period, not all patients included in the study received 
a screening echocardiogram at 36 weeks of GA. Instead, all 
220 patients had at least one CE ≥ 28 DOL. CEs done before 
28 DOL were performed for various indications including 
evaluating for PH, PDA, heart function, as well as to rule out 
CHD. Being a referral center, patients were admitted at dif- 
ferent ages; hence, the total number of CEs received by each 
patient was different. Median age to diagnose LPH was 37 + 
4 adjusted weeks of gestation (range, 26 + 4–73 + 6) and 79 
DOL (range, 29–328 DOL). Out of all the LPH cases, 45.8%,

15.3%, 15.3%, and 23.7% were diagnosed using criteria 1, 2, 
3 and 4 respectively, while out of all EPH cases 27.1%, 
28.2%, 25.9%, and 18.8% were diagnosed using criteria 1, 2, 
3, and 4 respectively. Figure 2 shows the distribution of LPH 
with the degree of BPD severity. 
Factors associated with LPH and EPH II in patients 
with BPD 
Comparison of characteristics between those with or without 
LPH has been shown in Table 2. Excluding infants who died 
(i.e., after 28 DOL and before 36 weeks PMA; n = 6) did not 
impact our results. The novel factors associated with devel- 
opment in LPH in our study were maternal diabetes (OR,

Association of PDA surgical closure with LPH and 
BPD 
Supplemental Table 1 shows the relationship of different 
PDA surgical closure timing with development of LPH; we 


steroids, 
IUGR, oligohydramnios, PPROM, modes of 
resuscitation used in delivery room, APGAR scores, sur- 
factant use, surgical closure of PDA, or multiple gestation 
[9, 10, 35, 37–39]. A number of reasons could explain the 
lack of signiﬁcant association with the factors noted above; 
among them, the most likely one is probably the differences 
in our patient/referral population, compared with other stu- 
dies. In addition, we did not ﬁnd any difference in incidence 
of developing LPH with different timing of PDA surgical 
closure (Supplemental Table 1). 
Of note, maternal diabetes appeared to be an independent 
risk factor for the development of LPH. Out of 13 diabetic 
mothers, 6 had type II diabetes and 7 had gestational dia- 
betes. To the best of our knowledge, such a relationship 
between maternal diabetes and LPH has not been previously 
reported. Maternal diabetes has been associated with per- 
sistent pulmonary hypertension in term newborn infants 
[40]. Recently, it has been proposed that BPD has its origins 
during fetal life and antenatal events including maternal 
placental under-perfusion are determining factors of the 
development of BPD [41–44]. Diabetes can result 
in 
endothelial dysfunction and vascular inﬂammation [45], 
which might be associated with maternal under-perfusion 
and in turn be associated with BPD as well as LPH in these 
infants. As the screening test for gestational diabetes is done 
from 24 to 28 weeks of GA unless at high risk for diabetes, 
we might have missed some of the mothers who potentially 
would have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes later 
during pregnancy [22]. 
There might be a different pathogenesis for PH diag- 
nosed within 1, 2 or 4 weeks of life, but interestingly PH 
diagnosed within 2 and 4 weeks of life (EPH II and III) 
were signiﬁcantly associated with development of LPH in 
preterm infants with BPD in our study. 
Surprisingly, when we compared the characteristics from 
the same dataset to assess the factors associated with EPH II 
(Table 3), there were a few that overlapped with that of 
LPH: maternal diabetes, HFOV use and IVH ≥grade 3 and 
absence of maternal antibiotic use. Most of these factors 
were consistently associated with EPH I and III. Multiple 
theories including maternal placental under-perfusion, dis- 
ruption of normal angiogenesis etc. can be applied to this 
association. In the clinical setting, early CE < 28 DOL can 
be very useful for the early identiﬁcation of preterm infants 
at high risk for BPD and LPH. 
The presence of tracheitis, IVH grade ≥3, G-tube place- 
ment, systemic steroid use for BPD, and tracheostomy were 
additional novel factors in our study. These conditions 
might be associated with high risk of developing LPH due 
to the presence and persistence of inﬂammation in the air- 
way and lung parenchyma, as well as due to severity of 
illness. Fourteen (82%) out of 17 patients who required 
tracheostomy were already diagnosed with LPH before 

did not ﬁnd any association of early vs. late surgical closure 
of PDA with development of LPH in later life. 

This study was carried out to comprehensively evaluate 
multiple pre- and postnatal factors that could impact the 
development of LPH and EPH in infants with BPD. We 
conﬁrmed several well-known factors [34], and determined 
several novel factors associated with the development of 
LPH and EPH in patients with BPD. 
Different studies have deﬁned LPH as PH diagnosed 
after 2, 4, 36 weeks PMA or on ﬁnal echocardiograms 
before discharge [9, 13–15, 35]. To qualify for the BPD 
deﬁnition, an infant should require treatment with >0.21 
FiO2 for at least 28 days and then classiﬁed at 36 weeks 
PMA [16]. On that basis, we used the cutoff at 28 DOL to 
deﬁne LPH and EPH. There have been a few studies, which 
have deﬁned EPH as PH diagnosed within ﬁrst week, 
2 weeks or 4 weeks of life [8, 9, 13–15]. It is possible that 
different pathways could be at play contributing to the 
pathogenesis of PH diagnosed during these time periods; 
hence, we divided EPH in three different categories to see if 
any of them could predict the development of LPH in BPD 
patients. 

factors 
associated with development of LPH, including LBW, SGA, 
high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), longer use of 
mechanical ventilation, longer use of antibiotics, and severe 
BPD [8, 10–12, 36]. However, in contrast to previously 
described associations, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant asso- 
ciation with development of LPH with the use of antenatal

these infants are at a high risk of having long-term ventilator 
dependency and so at risk of getting a tracheostomy. 
In our cohort, the number of severe BPD patients was 
slightly higher than many other studies. We attribute this 
skewness to the severity of illness of patients admitted to 
the level IV referral based NICU serving most of the 
underserved population of Philadelphia, PA. Cardiac 
catheterization has been accepted as the gold standard for 
diagnosing PH, however it is invasive and is not easily 
performed in premature neonates, and hence serial echo- 
cardiography is recommended as the main tool to screen for 
PH in BPD patients despite its limitations [46–48]. In our 
study, 
the diagnosis of E/LPH was made solely from 
echocardiography reports read by different pediatric cardi- 
ologists, which can cause inter-observer variability. A 
number of limitations of the BPD deﬁnition have been 
described; however, given its current universal practical 
value, we chose the NIH consensus deﬁnition for our study 
[49]. Another limitation of our study was that being a ret- 
rospective study, we could not control factors such as the 
consistent timing to get a CE. Despite these limitations, we 
report some important ﬁndings, which could potentially 
improve the earlier identiﬁcation and management of pre- 
mature patients with BPD. The other strengths of our study 
include the use of standardized deﬁnitions and a large 
sample size of our study cohort. Furthermore, the char- 
acteristics of our study population (racial distribution etc.) 
as well as the management of these infants remained rea- 
sonably consistent over the time period at our urban NICU. 

Our study identiﬁed novel factors and conﬁrmed some 
of the previously identiﬁed factors for development of 
BPD-associated LPH and EPH. Based on these results, a 
risk-based scoring system, which would potentially include 
pre- and postnatal factors, can be formulated to screen for 
premature infants at risk for BPD and LPH. We propose to 
have at least one echocardiogram done to screen for PH < 
28 DOL in premature neonates requiring respiratory support 
with FiO2 > 0.21, which can help strategize identiﬁcation 
and management of BPD and LPH. Prospective studies are 
needed to validate this approach.
