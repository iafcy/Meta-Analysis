Abstract Background: Many extremely low birth weight infants develop pulmonary hypertension late in their 
clinical course, and over 60% go undetected by early screening echocardiography. At present, no standardised 
screening protocol exists for detecting late pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants. We 
assessed the utility of oxygen supplementation as a predictor of late pulmonary hypertension. Methods: A retro- 
spective single-centre review of extremely low birth weight infants with no evidence of CHD and those surviving 
for >30 days was performed. The association between oxygen ⩾30% at day of life 30 and diagnosis of late 
pulmonary hypertension was estimated with an odds ratio and 95% conﬁdence interval using logistic regression. 
Doppler echocardiography was used to diagnose pulmonary hypertension in the infants. Results: A total of 230 
infants met the study criteria. The incidence of late pulmonary hypertension was 8.3% (19/230). Infants with late 
pulmonary hypertension were more likely to have a lower mean birth weight (667.1 ± 144 versus 799.3 ± 140 g, 
p = 0.001) and more likely to be small for gestational age (47.4 versus 14.2%, p = 0.004). Oxygen requirement 
⩾30% at day of life 30 was associated with increased risk of late pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio = 3.77, 95% 
conﬁdence interval = 1.42–10.00, p = 0.008) in univariate analysis and after adjusting for birth weight (odds 
ratio = 2.47, 95% conﬁdence interval = 0.89–6.84, p = 0.08). Conclusions: The need of oxygen supplementation 
⩾30% at day of life 30 may be a good screening tool for detecting late pulmonary hypertension in extremely low 
birth weight infants.

Advances in medical technology in the last 2 decades 
have improved survival of extremely low birth weight 
infants in the industrialised world, but have created a 
cohort of patients who are at risk of chronic lung 
disease due to underdevelopment of 
the lungs. 
Previous studies have reported mortality ranging 
from 14 to 38% in premature infants with chronic 
dysplasia 
lung 
remains the most common form of chronic lung 
disease in premature infants, characterised by arrested 
lung development affecting both alveologenesis 
and the pulmonary vasculature.5 According to the 




Tracking Outcomes and Practice in the Paediatric 
Pulmonary Hypertension registry, bronchopulmon- 
ary dysplasia was 
frequent disorder 
the most 
associated with pulmonary hypertension due to 
respiratory disorders or hypoxaemia in infants.6 The 
incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is inversely 
proportional to the degree of prematurity, and the 
incidence of pulmonary hypertension continues to 
increase as these patients have improved survival.7,8 
A recent prospective study examined 145 extremely 
low birth weight infants and found that 77% had 
some form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and that 
one in every six (18%) of extremely low birth weight 
infants developed pulmonary hypertension.8 






Although early diagnosis can lead to improved 
prognosis, the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension 
can be difﬁcult because the clinical symptoms are 
subtle, 
increased oxygen requirement, 
tachypnoea, and failure to thrive, in this patient 
population and can be masked by the broncho- 
pulmonary dysplasia. At present, there is no uni- 
versally 
for 
pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth 
weight infants. Cardiac catheterisation is the gold 
standard for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension by 
direct measurement of pulmonary arterial pressure in 
infants, children, and adults. Unfortunately, it has 
limited utility in extremely low birth weight infants 
due to the risk of vascular injury associated with this 
invasive 
patients. 
Non-invasive techniques using Doppler echocardio- 
graphy can estimate the right ventricular pressure 
and have been validated with reasonably good 
correlation against pressures obtained at cardiac 
catheterisation.9,10 At present, echocardiography is 
the most common modality used to screen and 
diagnose pulmonary hypertension in premature 
infants.3,4 Current management protocols vary by 
institution, and they utilise screening echocardio- 
graphy for screening or when there is clinical suspi- 
cion of pulmonary hypertension, particularly when 
supplementation with high levels of oxygen is 
required. Recently, Bhat et al8 performed a pro- 
spective study using early screening echocardio- 
graphy in extremely low birth weight infants at 
1 month of age. They found that screening echo- 
cardiograms at 1 month of age may miss as many as 
66% of those infants who will develop late pulmon- 
ary hypertension (⩾4 weeks of age) in their clinical 
course.8 Therefore, there is a clinical need for a better 
screening tool for the early detection of late pul- 
monary hypertension in extremely low birth weight 
infants. We hypothesise that the amount of oxygen 
required on day of life 30 may be used as a surrogate 
or screening tool for the detection of late pulmonary 
hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants. 

After institutional review board approval, we per- 
formed a single-centre retrospective study. We 
included all infants with birth weight ⩽1000 g who 
were admitted to All Children’s Hospital between 
January, 2008 and December, 2011. Infants were 
excluded if they had haemodynamically signiﬁcant 
CHD or they did not survive for >30 days of life. 
Demographic data, birth history, and clinical ﬁndings, 
including the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension on 
the discharge summary, echocardiographic evidence of 
pulmonary hypertension at >30 days of life, amount of 
supplemental oxygen at day of life 30, co-morbidities, 
and mortality, were recorded from the electronic 
medical record. Infants were classiﬁed as having 
pulmonary hypertension if a discharge diagnosis was 
recorded on the discharge summary and an echo- 
cardiogram demonstrated clinical evidence of late 
pulmonary hypertension. 
In 2000, the National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development/National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute Workshop developed a severity-based 
deﬁnition for infants under 32 weeks of gestation to 
grade the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.5 
This scoring system includes assessment of the fraction 
of inspired oxygen or positive pressure ventilation at 
36 weeks post-menstrual age. The grades deﬁne mild 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia as the need for supple- 
mental oxygen for at least 28 days but not at 
36 weeks post-menstrual age or discharge, moderate 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia as the need for supple- 
mental oxygen for at least 28 days and treatment with 
<30% oxygen at 36 weeks post-menstrual age, and 
severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia as the need for 
supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days requiring at 
least 30% oxygen and/or positive pressure ventilation 
at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. The other clinical 
characteristics that were studied included presence of 
severe intra-ventricular haemorrhage (grade III or 
IV), ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus, diagnosis 
of necrotising enterocolitis, and the need for surgery 
for retinopathy of prematurity. 
Diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension 
The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is tradi- 
tionally made by cardiac catheterisation with a mean 
pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg in children 
and adults. In this retrospective study of neonates, we 
used echocardiography to estimate the right ven- 
tricular pressure 
to diagnose pulmonary artery 
hypertension. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 
estimated by measuring the peak systolic pressure 
gradient from the right ventricle to the right atrium, 
equation = 4 × 
calculated using the Bernoulli 
maximum velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet 



measured by continuous wave Doppler, and adding 
the estimated right atrial pressure of 5 mmHg. No 
national or institutional guidelines exist to determine 
when a neonate gets an echocardiogram to screen for 
pulmonary artery hypertension. The echocardiograms 
performed in this study were carried out at the clin- 
ician’s discretion to screen for pulmonary artery 
hypertension. All echocardiograms were reviewed 
during the clinical course of these patients. A diag- 
nosis of pulmonary hypertension was made if the 
tricuspid regurgitation jet was >3 m/s, right ven- 
tricular pressure was estimated to be >50% of the 
systemic blood pressure, or septal ﬂattening. Late 
pulmonary hypertension was deﬁned as any pul- 
monary hypertension diagnosed by echocardiography 
in an infant after 4 weeks of life. Infants with per- 
sistent pulmonary hypertension that resolved before 
4 weeks were not included in the category of late 
pulmonary hypertension. 



Demographic and clinical characteristics were sum- 
marised by pulmonary hypertension status using 
counts, with percentages, for categorical variables and 
means, with standard deviation, or medians, with 
range, for continuous variables. Comparison between 
groups was performed using χ2 test or Fisher’s exact 
test for categorical variables and Student’s t-tests or 
Wilcoxon Mann–Whitney 
continuous 
variables. The association of late pulmonary hyper- 
tension was tested with different oxygen supple- 
mentation levels of 30, 35, and 40% at day of life 30. 
The 30% oxygen supplementation was found to be 
the best cut-off. The association between oxygen 
supplementation of 30% or higher at day of life 30 
and the diagnosis of late pulmonary hypertension was 
estimated with an odds ratio and 95% conﬁdence 
interval using logistic regression. Receiver operating 
characteristic curve analyses, computing the area 
under the curve and corresponding 95% conﬁdence 
intervals, were performed to compare the require- 
ment of oxygen supplementation of 30% or higher in 
predicting pulmonary hypertension. Statistical ana- 
lyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, North Carolina, United States of America). All 
statistical tests were two-sided with the threshold for 
statistical signiﬁcance set at p < 0.05. 

A total of 290 extremely low birth weight infants 
were admitted over a 4-year period to the neonatal 
intensive care unit at All Children’s Hospital; 60 
infants were excluded before day of life 30 due to 
early neonatal death (n = 56) or the presence of 
haemodynamically signiﬁcant CHD (n = 4). Among 
all, 230 infants who survived beyond day of life 30 
were included in the study (Fig 1). At day of life 30, 
78 of the 230 infants (34%) required oxygen sup- 
plementation at 30% or higher and 12 of the 78 had a 
diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. In comparison, 
152 infants out of the 230 infants had a supplemental 
oxygen requirement of <30%. Of the 152 requiring 
oxygen supplementation, 
seven (4.6%) patients 
had a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. A total of 
19 out of 230 infants in both the groups (8.3%) met 
the criteria for the diagnosis of 
late pulmonary 
hypertension. 
Patient characteristics 
The demographic characteristics for infants with late 
pulmonary hypertension and without late pulmonary 
hypertension are shown in Table 1. No differences 
existed in relation to gender (p = 1.0) or gestational 
age (p = 0.62) between the two groups. Infants with 
late pulmonary hypertension were more likely to have 
a lower mean weight at birth (667.1 ± 144 versus 
799.3 ± 140 g, p = 0.0001), to be small for gesta- 
tional age deﬁned as birth weight <10th percentile 
for age (47.4 versus 14.2%, p = 0.004). These ﬁnd- 
ings suggest that extremely low birth weight infants 
with pulmonary hypertension are more likely to be 
small for gestational age and have had some form of 
intra-uterine growth restriction. 
Chronic lung disease characteristics 
Clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Infants 
with pulmonary hypertension were more likely to 
need at least 30% oxygen supplementation at 30 days 
of life (63.5 versus 31.3%, p = 0.005), moderate- 
to-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (89.4 versus 
65.4%, p = 0.04), and longer median duration of 
mechanical ventilation (53 versus 26 days, p = 0.0007). 
These data suggest that extremely low birth weight 
infants with pulmonary hypertension have more sig- 
niﬁcant lung disease compared with their counterparts 
without pulmonary hypertension. 
Co-morbidities and mortality 
Extremely low birth weight infants with pulmonary 
hypertension were more likely to require a patent 
ductus arteriosus 
ligation (52.6 versus 19.9%, 
p < 0.001), had longer median length of stay (134 
versus 100 days, p = 0.002), and had increased 
mortality (15.8 versus 3.3%, p = 0.04) compared 
with infants with no pulmonary hypertension. No 
statistically signiﬁcant changes were seen in rela- 
tionship to the incidence of severe intra-ventricular

haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, or retino- 
pathy of prematurity requiring surgery (see Table 1). 
The increased length of stay and mortality suggest 
that extremely low birth weight infants have sig- 
niﬁcant morbidity and mortality associated with this 
disease process. 
Oxygen requirement as a predictor of late pulmonary 
hypertension 
Assessments of oxygen requirement in all the infants 
at day of life 30 were recorded, and logistic regression 
analysis determined that 30% oxygen supplementa- 
tion was the most sensitive point for screening for 
pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth 
weight infants. We found that 33.9% (78/230) 
required supplemental oxygen at 30% or higher. 
Infants requiring supplemental oxygen at 30% or 
more had an increased risk of developing pulmonary 
hypertension (odds ratio = 3.77, 95% conﬁdence 
interval = 1.42–10.00, p = 0.008) compared with 
those requiring supplemental oxygen under 30%. 
This increased risk persisted, although attenuated 
and of borderline signiﬁcance, after adjusting for 
birth weight (odds ratio = 2.47, 95% conﬁdence 
interval = 0.89–6.84, p value = 0.08). Receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis showed an area 
under the curve of 0.69 (95% conﬁdence interval = 
0.58–0.79, p = 0.0006) for oxygen supplementation 
in predicting late pulmonary hypertension (Fig 2) 
and revealed that oxygen requirement at 30% or 
higher at day of life 30 as a screening tool for the 
diagnosis of late pulmonary hypertension in an extre- 
mely low birth weight infant was 63.2% sensitive

Although the sensitivity of 63% and speciﬁcity of 
69% are modest numbers, this test is useful in iden- 
tifying a sub-group of infants who would be at high 
risk of developing pulmonary hypertension later on 
during their hospital course. This readily available 
and cost-effective tool has better clinical utility than 
previously tested screening tools of monthly echo- 
cardiography, which can miss as many as 66% of 
extremely low birth weight infants at risk of devel- 
oping late pulmonary hypertension.8 This would 
avoid the use of excessive screening echocardiograms 
for all extremely low birth weight infants and focus 
echocardiography resources on those most likely to 
have clinical disease.

hypothesis that an abnormal foetal environment leads 
to end-organ changes that can then predispose to 
multiple chronic adult medical conditions including 
pulmonary artery hypertension, obesity, type 2 dia- 
betes, systemic hypertension, and early coronary 
artery disease.11 Small for gestational age is a measure 
of foetal growth restriction. This may be due to 
constitutional issues (genetics) within the foetus or 
due to abnormalities within the foetal environment 
such as maternal health issue, environmental toxin/ 
medication, placental insufﬁciency, or umbilical cord 
abnormality.11 Small for gestational age is a well- 
known risk factor for increased mortality in infants 
including those with cardiovascular disease.11,12 
In our cohort, we also saw a high incidence of late

(95% conﬁdence interval = 38.4–83.7%) and 68.7% 
speciﬁc (95% conﬁdence interval = 62–74.9%). 

All clinicians including neonatologists, cardiologists, 
pulmonologists, general paediatricians, mid-level 
providers, and bedside nurses, who care for extre- 
mely low birth weight infants, need to be aware of the 
inherent risks that pulmonary hypertension can have 
on their patients and how to detect those patients at 
risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. The 
detection of pulmonary hypertension may be difﬁcult 
due to the lack of physical exam ﬁndings and may be 



pulmonary hypertension in small-for-gestational-age 
infants with almost 50% developing the disease. The 
ﬁndings in this study are similar to previous studies 
that reported high incidence of 
late pulmonary 
hypertension in infants who are small for gestational 
age, have more severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 
increased length of mechanical ventilation, more days 
of ventilation, and require patent ductus arteriosus 
ligation during their hospital course.13 
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia exists as a continuum 
of disease within extremely low birth weight infants 
and can be graded as mild, moderate, or severe in nature. 
The pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension in a 
premature neonate with bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
includes abnormal muscularisation of pulmonary 
vessels and reduction of the alveolar–capillary surface 
area.14 This abnormal pulmonary vasculature remo- 
delling process leads to impairment of gas exchange 
and a need for a prolonged oxygen requirement.15 As 
this process may take several months, most extremely 
low birth weight infants will not develop signiﬁcant 
pulmonary hypertension until 
the 3rd or 4th 
month of life. This makes early echocardiographic 
screening in the ﬁrst few months of life difﬁcult.16–18 
Therefore, the requirement of high oxygen supple- 
mentation early in the clinical course of preterm 
infants at day of life 30, irrespective of the severity of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, may be a better screening 
tool than echocardiography. At present, in our institu- 
tion, any extremely low birth weight infant requiring 
>30% oxygen at day of life 30 is screened for pul- 
monary hypertension with a complete echocardiogram. 
The echocardiography is repeated every month, if there 
is persistent high oxygen requirement. 
Very recently, two prospective studies on preterm 
infants have found a positive association between 
early pulmonary hypertension, diagnosed between 
7 and 14 days, and the development of broncho- 
pulmonary dysplasia;19,20 one of these studies by 
Mourani et al,19 which prospectively studied 277 
premature infants ⩽1250 g, reported 14% prevalence 
of 
late pulmonary hypertension. In their cohort, 
screening echocardiography was performed at 7 day 
of life (early) and then at corrected gestational age of 
36 weeks (late). Of all the infants who were diagnosed 
with late pulmonary hypertension at 36 weeks, 
around 40% did not show any evidence of pulmonary 
vascular disease in the early echocardiography. In the 
other study by Mirza et al,20 which included a cohort 
of 120 premature infants of <28 weeks of gestation, the 
late pulmonary hypertension was

hypertension in this cohort was found only in one- 
tenth (10%) of the infants presenting with early 
pulmonary hypertension. Although the ﬁndings of 
both the studies support the hypothesis of early 
pulmonary vascular disease contributing to broncho- 
pulmonary dysplasia, their results also demonstrate the 
limitations of early echocardiography screening for the 
diagnosis of late pulmonary hypertension. 
We report a prevalence of 8.3% of late pulmonary 
hypertension in this cohort of 230 extremely low 
birth weight infants, which is close to the 11.7% 
reported by Bhat et al8 in a previous prospective 
study with 140 infants. Although this study is lim- 
ited by its retrospective design, the hourly recording 
of oxygen requirement in an electronic medical 
record makes it possible to accurately identify the 
average amount of oxygen required on any day and 
minimises recall bias. In addition, echocardiography 
was only performed when clinically indicated by the 
managing neonatal intensive care team; therefore, it 
is possible that the overall incidence could have been 
higher than that reported in our study, as milder cases 
may have been missed and self-resolved. 
Although echocardiography is the most commonly 
used diagnostic modality to detect pulmonary 
hypertension in infants, it has a limited role in the 
risk stratiﬁcation of extremely low birth weight 
infants early in their clinical course and has sig- 
niﬁcant cost associated with its utility. We have 
shown that the need for oxygen supplementation of 
30% or higher on day of life 30 can be used to screen 
extremely low birth weight infants at risk of devel- 
oping late pulmonary hypertension. Identiﬁcation of 
this high-risk sub-group will allow application of 
echocardiographic screening to subsequently detect 
pulmonary hypertension during the hospital course. 
In addition, screening based on supplemental oxygen 
requirement is the point-of-care testing, which is 
more readily available and is much more cost effective 
than echocardiography. We conclude that adjunctive 
use of oxygen requirement screening at 30 days of life 
will improve the rate of detecting late pulmonary 
hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants. 
Small for gestational age may further impact the risk 
of developing late pulmonary hypertension in these 
infants. Further prospective studies are recommended 
to further validate this screening tool, in the hopes 
that it will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of 
infants with pulmonary hypertension.
