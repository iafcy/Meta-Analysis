Objective: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) 
is a severe cardiovascular 
complication of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) 
that contributes to 
the high mortality rates for preterm infants. The objective of this study is to 
establish a prediction model of BPD-associated PH (BPD-PH) by integrating 
multiple predictive factors for infants with BPD. 

Method: A retrospective investigation of 
records 
and data of echocardiography in all the preterm infants with BPD was 
performed from January 2012 to December 2019. A prediction model of 
BPD-PH was established based on the univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analysis of the clinical data and evaluated by using the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), combined 
with the Hosmer–Lemeshow (HL) test. Internal validation was performed with 
bootstrap resampling. 
Result: A total of 268 infants with BPD were divided into the BPD-PH group 
and the no-PH group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
the independent predictive factors of BPD-PH were moderate to severe BPD, 
small for gestational age, duration of hemodynamically signiﬁcant patent 
ductus arteriosus ≥ 28 days, and early PH. A prediction model was established 
based on the β coefﬁcients of the four predictors. The area under the 
ROC curve of the prediction model was 0.930. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test 
(p = 0.976) and the calibration curve showed good calibration. 
Conclusion: The prediction model based on the four risk factors predicts the 
development of BPD-PH with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity and might help 
clinicians to make individualized interventions to minimize the disease risk. 

preterm infant, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, prediction 
model, nomogram 









During the past three decades, since great progress in 
perinatal-neonatal medicine has been made in China, the 
survival of extremely premature infants has markedly increased. 
However, 
the developing lungs are susceptible to various 
injuries, which cause a rising incidence of bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia (BPD) (1). In China, based on previously published 
studies, the incidence of BPD in extremely premature infants 
with a gestational age of less than 28 weeks has increased from 
19.3% in 2011 to 51.7% in 2019 (2, 3). 
at 
Survivors with BPD are 
cardiovascular 

complications because of the disruption of vascular growth 
and signaling (4, 5). Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common 
in infants with moderate or severe BPD, with the reported 
incidence ranging from 8 to 38% (6–9). PH contributes 
signiﬁcantly to high mortality and is associated with dependency 
on respiratory support, prolonged hospitalization, 
impaired 
neurodevelopment, and signiﬁcant medical costs in infants with 
BPD (10, 11). In our previously published data, the mortality of 
BPD infants complicated with PH was 40.5% (12). 
The pathogenesis of BPD-associated PH (BPD-PH) is 
complicated, 
including multiple factors, such as perinatal 
stress, abnormal lung development, and postnatal conditions. 
Therefore, identiﬁcation of the risk factors is important for 
early prevention. However, a single predictive factor is diﬃcult 
to apply in clinical practice due to its inconsistent standards, 
low sensitivity, and speciﬁcity. A prediction model developed 
by integrating multiple predictive factors may improve the 
accuracy of prediction. To test the hypothesis, we performed this 
retrospective study. 


Preterm infants admitted to the Level III neonatal intensive 
care unit (NICU) at Children’s Hospital of Zhejiang University 
School of Medicine between January 2012 and December 2019 
who were diagnosed with BPD were eligible for this study. We 
excluded infants with congenital heart diseases [except patent 
ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrial septal defect, or patent foramen 
ovale], other major congenital anomalies, incomplete data, or 
death before 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age (PMA). This study was 
approved by the Ethics Committees of our hospital with a waiver 
of parental consent. 
Clinical data were collected retrospectively from the 
electronic NICU database. Prenatal data included maternal 
demographics, oligohydramnios (deﬁned as amniotic ﬂuid 
index ≤ 5), prolonged rupture of membrane, pregnancy- 
related complications, antenatal corticosteroids use, and mode 
of delivery. Neonatal data included gestational age (GA), birth 
weight (BW), sex, the Apgar score at 1 and 5 min, small 
for gestational age (SGA) status, cumulative days of invasive 
mechanical ventilation (IMV) before 36 weeks’ PMA, and co- 
morbidity about respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with 
surfactant use, hemodynamically signiﬁcant PDA (hsPDA), 
pneumonia with positive respiratory culture, culture proven 
sepsis, PDA ligation, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), 
and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). 

Pulmonary hypertension was evaluated non-invasively with 
echocardiography by a board-certiﬁed pediatric sonographer 
in cardiology and diagnosed based on either of the following 
criteria (7, 13, 14), including the estimated systolic pulmonary 
arterial pressure (sPAP) > 50% of the systemic arterial pressure, 
end-systolic ﬂattened or left-deviated of the interventricular 
septum (IVS) with or without right ventricular dilatation, 
bidirectional or right-to-left shunt at the patent foramen ovale, 
or ductus arteriosus. When there was a tricuspid regurgitation 
(TR), sPAP was calculated by adding right atrial pressure 
(5 mmHg) to the right ventricle pressure gradient, which 
was estimated by the Bernoulli equation. In the absence of a 
measurable TR, we relied upon a PDA/patent foramen ovale 
gradient to estimate sPAP. Early PH was deﬁned as having 
evidence of PH based on the assessment of echocardiography 
between 72 h and 14 days (15), while BPD-PH was deﬁned 
as having evidence of PH beyond 36 weeks’ PMA in preterm 
infants with BPD (7). 
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed based on the 
2019 criteria proposed by Jensen (16). BPD severity was 
categorized according to the following modes of respiratory 
support administered at 36 weeks PMA, grade 1, nasal cannula 
at ﬂow rates ≤ 2 L/min; grade 2, nasal cannula at ﬂow 
rates > 2 L/min or non-invasive positive airway pressure; 
and grade 3, IMV. 
Hemodynamically signiﬁcant PDA was deﬁned as the PDA 
diameter exceeding 1.5 mm combined with diastolic ﬂow 
reversal in the descending aorta and the ratio of the left atrium 
to aorta greater than 1.5, as well as the clinical ﬁndings of 
pulmonary overcirculation, 
left heart overload, and/or poor 
systemic perfusion (17). SGA was deﬁned as a birth weight 
less than the 10th percentile for gestational age (18). NEC 
was deﬁned as modiﬁed Bells’ stage II criteria or greater (19). 
Pneumonia includes both congenital and hospital acquired 
pneumonia, which is deﬁned as having chest X-ray ﬁndings with 
positive tracheal aspirate culture. Sepsis was deﬁned as infants 
with a positive blood culture who were treated with antibiotics 
for at least 5 days. Severe IVH was deﬁned as Papile’s Grade III 
or greater (20). 









Echocardiography screening protocol 
for hemodynamically signiﬁcant PDA 
and pulmonary hypertension 
All the preterm infants who were admitted before 2 weeks 
of life were evaluated by an echocardiogram 2–3 times a week 
for the hemodynamic status of PDA, pulmonary hypertension, 
and cardiac function. After 2 weeks of age, the frequency of 
echocardiogram was changed to 1–2 times a week. For all the 
preterm infants who developed increasing oxygen or respiratory 
support requirements in the late stage of life (usually after 
4 weeks of life), PH was screened by an echocardiogram. 
When PH was conﬁrmed, a series of echocardiograms were 
repeated every 1 or 2 weeks to monitor the dynamic change 
of PH and the response to interventions. If PH resolved, 
the echocardiogram was repeated monthly until weaning oﬀ 
respiratory support for 6 months. 

Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), 
median [interquartile range (IQR)], or number (percentage) 
where appropriate. Univariate analyses were performed using 
an independent t-test or non-parametric tests for continuous 
variables, and the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact 
for 
categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was 
performed to identify the risk factors associated with BPD-PH. 
A prediction model and nomogram were established based on 
the multivariate logistic regression analysis of BPD-PH. 

The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve (AUC) was measured to assess the discriminative 
performance of the prediction model. A calibration curve was 
generated for the evaluation of calibration, combined with the 
Hosmer–Lemeshow (HL) test. An insigniﬁcant HL test statistic 
implies good calibration. In addition, the prediction model was 
subjected to 1,000 bootstrap resamples for internal validation to 
assess their predictive accuracies. 
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics 
for Windows, version 20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, 
United States). The graphics of the nomogram and calibration 
curve were performed with R 4.0.4 (The R Foundation 
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with the rms 
statistical packages. 

During the study period, 336 preterm infants were 
diagnosed with BPD based on the 2019 criteria. In this study, 
68 cases were excluded because of major congenital anomalies 
or incomplete data. A total of 268 preterm infants with BPD 
were enrolled, with 59 (22.0%) infants who developed BPD-PH 
beyond 36 weeks’ PMA in the BPD-PH group and 209 (78%) 
infants without PH in the no-PH group (Figure 1). The median 
age at admission was 21 days of life in the BPD-PH group and 
4 days of life in the no-PH group. The incidences of PH in grade 
1, grade 2, and grade 3 BPD infants were 5.0% (7/139), 20.9% 
(19/91), and 86.8% (33/38), respectively.

The characteristics and related risk factors were compared 
between the two groups (Table 1). Infants from the BPD-PH 
group were born at a lower gestational age with smaller birth 
weights than the infants from the no-PH group (p < 0.05). The

severe IVH, and PDA ligation were signiﬁcantly higher in the 
BPD-PH group (p < 0.05). The duration of hsPDA and IMV 
before 36 weeks’ PMA was much longer in infants with BPD-PH 
than in those without PH (p < 0.05).

After univariable analysis, the variables of GA, BW, SGA,

duration of hsPDA, PDA ligation, pneumonia, and the duration 
of IMV before 36 weeks’ PMA were entered into the multivariate 
logistic regression analysis. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the 
independent predictive factors of BPD-PH were SGA, early PH, 
moderate to severe BPD (Grade 2 and 3 BPD), and the duration 
of hsPDA ≥ 28 days (Table 2).

On the basis of the ﬁnal regression analysis, a prediction 
model was established that incorporated the β coeﬃcients of the 
predictors,

where, p represented the probability of developing BPD-PH. 
Other values of the predictors are as follows, SGA (no = 0, 
yes = 1), early PH (no = 0, yes = 1), Grade 2 BPD (no = 0, yes = 1), 
Grade 3 BPD (no = 0, yes = 1), and the duration of hsPDA 
(< 28 days = 0, ≥ 28 days = 1). A nomogram was developed 
based on the prediction model to improve the convenience of 
the model in clinical practice (Figure 2). 
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the prediction 
model was 0.930 (95% CI, 0.895–0.965) (Figure 3). The 
Hosmer–Lemeshow test revealed no statistical signiﬁcance 
(p = 0.976), suggesting a good ﬁtting of the model. The 
(Figure 4) 
calibration curve of 
demonstrated good calibration. The cutoﬀ probability in 
this model is 0.173, with a sensitivity of 89.8% and a speciﬁcity 
of 79.4%, respectively. 


Since PH is serious comorbidity of BPD with high 
mortality (31) and a lack of evidence-based therapies, it is of

great importance to identify the risk factors and start early 
interventions to improve the long-term outcome. In this study, 
we established and assessed a prediction model for individually

predicting patients with BPD who are likely to develop BPD-PH. 
The prediction model incorporated demographic and clinical 
characteristics and showed good discrimination and calibration 
performance. We further developed a nomogram, thus making 
it a convenient and valuable tool for clinical practice. 
Several published studies have examined a wide variety of 
risk factors for the development of pulmonary hypertension in 
infants with BPD (6, 8, 21). Nagiub et al. (22) performed a 
meta-analysis to further analyze the eﬀect size of risk factors 
for BPD-PH and showed that the duration of mechanical 
ventilation, prolonged NICU stay, oligohydramnios, the use of 
high frequency ventilation, SGA, sepsis, and severity of BPD 
were signiﬁcant risk factors; while birth weight and gestational 
age were inversely related. 
However, it is diﬃcult to quantify the risk of developing 
BPD-PH according to one single predictive factor due to 
its low sensitivity and speciﬁcity. More importantly, PH 
that complicates BPD is frequently multifactorial, including 
perinatal stress, abnormal 
lung development, and postnatal 
diseases. Thus, how to transform these risk factors into a risk- 
based scoring system could help develop an evidence-based 
screening strategy for infants at high risk. 
Prediction models by integrating multiple predictive factors 
have been used frequently in other conditions, whereas, there 
are few studies about prediction models for developing PH 
in infants with BPD. In the study by Trittmann et al. (23), 
they created a predictive model by combining both clinical and

genetic data to predict the development of PH in patients with 
BPD. An ROC analysis showed the AUC of the prediction model 
of clinical data only, clinical and genetic data combined were 
0.65 and 0.73, respectively. Due to the small cohort size of 20 
cases of BPD-PH and 59 cases of BPD, the application of their 
model is limited and further validation in a larger independent 
prospective BPD cohort is needed. Compared with this study, 
our prediction model has relatively higher discrimination, with 
an AUC of 0.930. 
In our prediction model, grade 3 BPD is the greatest 
contributor to the risk of BPD-PH, followed by the duration 
of hsPDA exposure, SGA, and early PH. The impact of the 
severity of BPD on BPD-PH was variable in previous studies. 
A few studies could not ﬁnd an association between PH and the 
severity of BPD (24). In contrast, Arjaans et al. (25) revealed 
that infants with severe BPD were most at risk of developing 
PH, with a relative risk (RR) doubled (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7, 4.2). 
Our study reconﬁrms severe BPD as a strong risk factor for the 
development of PH, compared with mild or moderate BPD. 
As a provincial referral center, all the cases were transferred 
from the maternal hospital or local hospital. Prolonged 
mechanical ventilation requirement and hsPDA unresponsive 
to pharmacologic therapy were common reasons for transport. 
The longer duration of hsPDA exposure is associated with 
the increasing risk of BPD in extremely preterm infants (26), 
which elucidates that hsPDA may delay lung disease recovery. 
Whether continued hsPDA exposure in infants with severe BPD 
may exacerbate BPD-PH is uncertain. Some studies reported 
no relationship between hsPDA and the development of BPD- 
PH (8, 9). However, in these reports, hsPDA was considered a 
categorical variable (present or absent) with no consideration 
of its duration. In our study, we found infants in the BPD-PH 
group were transferred to our unit much later than infants in 
the no-PH group, which means infants with BPD-PH had longer 
exposure to hsPDA. This also explained why univariable analysis 
showed the PDA ligation rate was much higher in the BPD-PH 
group than in the no-PH group because 76.3% of infants in the 
BPD-PH group had hsPDA exposure for ≥ 28 days. 
Small for gestational age (SGA) has been identiﬁed to 
be a signiﬁcant risk factor across some studies. Check et al. 
(21) further evaluated the associations between birth weight 
percentile and pulmonary hypertension at 36 weeks PMA in 
infants with moderate or severe BPD. In this study, infants with 
birth weights below the 25th percentile cutoﬀ were at a higher 
risk of developing BPD-PH. 
An early injury to the developing lung can impair

manifestations of BPD and PH. Previous prospective and 
retrospective studies in preterm infants have revealed that early 
PH is strongly associated with a high risk for the subsequent 
development of BPD at 36 weeks PMA (7, 27), but the results 









were conﬂicting on the association between early PH and 
the development of 
late PH (15, 28). However, evidence 
about the relationship between early PH and late BPD-PH 
is limited. In our cohort, early PH within 14 days of life is 
identiﬁed to be the independent risk factor of BPD-PH, which 
might 
improve the earlier detection and management of 
patients with BPD-PH. 
Antenatal corticosteroids are well-known interventions that 
decrease the severity of RDS; however, 
the recent meta- 
analysis of the Cochrane Database shows that it is unclear if 
antenatal corticosteroids have any eﬀect on the risk of BPD 
compared with placebo or no treatment (29). Neither of the 
two meta-analyses by Nagiub et al. (22) and Arjaans et al. 
(25) showed any eﬀect of antenatal corticosteroids on BPD-PH. 
In our study, though infants with BPD-PH had received less 
antenatal corticosteroids, the p-value was above 0.05, we did 
not apply antenatal corticosteroids to the multivariate logistic 
regression analysis. 
Presentations of BPD-PH are usually non-speciﬁc and easy 
to be neglected. Hence, active screening and treatment are 
recommended to minimize morbidity and mortality. Consensus 
recommendations for PH screening in infants with BPD have 
been developed by the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension 
Network (PPHNet), a multidisciplinary panel of PH experts 
(30). However, with the prediction model, it is possible to 
estimate the risk of BPD-PH precisely and optimize the 
utilization of medical resources. For patients with high risk, early 
and frequent screenings for PH may be considered individually. 
In addition, risk factors should be controlled more actively, 
such as the prompt treatment of hsPDA and optimization of 
respiratory support for those infants. 

limitations to our study. First, there 
might be selection bias in this retrospective study because 
we excluded infants without complete data or died before 
36 weeks’ PMA. Echocardiograms were performed to evaluate 
the hemodynamic status of PDA every 2 or 3 days for 
very premature infants until PDA became hemodynamically 
insigniﬁcant. HsPDA exposure is a continuous variable, 
but we had to divide the cohort 
subgroups 
because of our inability to precisely calculate the duration of 
hsPDA (days). Second, only internal validation was performed 
because of the single-center study, in which the diﬀerences 
in epidemiology and clinical behavior that exist between 
diﬀerent centers were not considered. Furthermore, genomic 
characteristics were not considered in our study. Genetic data 
combining clinical characteristics may improve the prediction 
model performance. 

In conclusion, the prediction model based on the four 
risk factors predicts 
the development of BPD-PH with 
high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. External validation through 
multicenter prospective studies is necessary to further assess the 
generalizability of the prediction model.
