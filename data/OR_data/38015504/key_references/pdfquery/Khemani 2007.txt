BACKGROUND. Although abnormal pulmonary vascular structure and function in 
preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia may predispose infants to pul- 
monary artery hypertension, little is known about the characteristics and out- 
comes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary artery hypertension 
in the surfactant era. 
METHODS. We studied 42 premature infants ((cid:1)32 weeks of gestation) with broncho- 
pulmonary dysplasia who were diagnosed as having pulmonary artery hyperten- 
sion (cid:1)2 months after birth, between 1998 and 2006, at a median age of 4.8 
months. Pulmonary artery hypertension was graded through echocardiography 
for all patients; 13 patients also underwent cardiac catheterization. 
RESULTS. Eighteen (43%) of 42 patients had severe pulmonary artery hypertension 
(systemic or suprasystemic right ventricular pressure). Among 13 patients who 
underwent catheterization, the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 43 (cid:2) 8 
mm Hg and the pulmonary vascular resistance index was 9.9 (cid:2) 2.8 Wood units. In 
12 patients, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance im- 
proved with 100% oxygen and 80 ppm inhaled nitric oxide but remained elevated. 
The pulmonary vascular resistance index decreased to 7.9 (cid:2) 3.8 Wood units in 
100% oxygen and to 6.4 (cid:2) 3.1 Wood units with the addition of nitric oxide. 
Sixteen patients (38%) died during the follow-up period. Estimated survival rates 
were 64% (cid:2) 8% at 6 months and 53% (cid:2) 11% at 2 years after diagnosis of 
pulmonary artery hypertension. In multivariate analyses, severe pulmonary artery 
hypertension and small birth weight for gestational age were associated with 
worse survival rates. Among 26 survivors (median follow-up period: 9.8 months), 
pulmonary artery hypertension was improved, relative to its most severe level, in 24 
patients (89%). 
CONCLUSION. Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and severe pulmo- 
nary artery hypertension are at high risk of death, particularly during the ﬁrst 6 
months after diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension.

advances in critical care management have led to 
increased survival rates for premature infants but also 
have changed the pathologic features and clinical course 
of chronic lung disease of prematurity, known as bron- 
chopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Historically, oxygen 
toxicity and ventilator-induced injury characterized 
chronic lung disease in premature infants.1,2 In the sur- 
factant era, infants who are much less mature are sur- 
viving, and the normal sequence of lung development is 
disrupted.3 There are substantial histologic differences in 
this “new” BPD, compared with the “old” BPD, including 
reductions in the size and number of alveoli.1,2,4–6 Respi- 
ratory morbidity is common in patients with BPD, who 
often present with recurrent respiratory infections, air- 
way hyperresponsiveness, and exercise intolerance.7–10 
The pulmonary vasculature is also abnormal in in- 
fants with BPD. In conjunction with the abnormally 
small size and number of gas exchange units in the lungs 
of infants with BPD, there are deﬁciencies in the number 
and size of intraacinar pulmonary arteries (PAs), which 
are responsible for a signiﬁcantly reduced total cross- 
sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed.3,11,12 Al- 
though a wide range of vascular abnormalities may be 
found in these patients, it is generally thought that the 
reduction of the vascular cross-sectional area and alve- 
olar hypoxia result in structural remodeling of the pul- 
monary vasculature.3,6 Evidence also suggests increased 
pulmonary vascular tone and heightened vasoreactivity 
well beyond infancy in patients with BPD.6 
Changes in neonatal intensive care practices have 
contributed additional factors that predispose premature 
infants to increased pulmonary vasoconstriction. With 
recognition of the role of supplemental oxygen in reti- 
nopathy of prematurity, target oxygen saturations for 
premature infants have decreased.13,14 Premature infants 
with BPD, and even those without, are known to expe- 
rience signiﬁcant severe hypoxemia.15–17 Most of these 
episodes occur with sleep and feeding and remain un- 
detected with the usual methods modern NICUs use to 
determine the need for supplemental oxygen therapy at 
home.18 These episodes of intermittent severe hypoxia 
likely lead to increased pulmonary vascular tone, com- 
pounding the structural vascular abnormalities described 
above. 
Although the mechanisms responsible for elevated 
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and altered reac- 
tivity remain incompletely understood, the development 
of PA hypertension (PAH) is a recognized and sometimes 
serious complication of BPD that can contribute signiﬁ- 
cantly to the morbidity and mortality rates for preterm 
infants.19,20 Despite the potential importance of PAH in 
this patient population, relatively little is known about 
the prevalence of and risk factors for PAH in formerly 
premature infants with BPD. Several small reports con- 
cerning the clinical features and outcomes of patients 
with PAH and BPD were published in the 1980s,19,21–24 
before the routine use of surfactant, alternative modes of 
mechanical ventilatory support, and adjunctive agents 
such as inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and widespread con- 
cerns about oxygen toxicity.3 Therefore, these series may 
not reﬂect the population of patients surviving after 
extremely premature birth today. The purpose of this 
report is to describe the spectrum and outcomes of PAH 
in formerly preterm infants with BPD in the current era. 

Patients 
We ascertained patients who were born at an estimated 
gestational age of (cid:2)32 weeks, had BPD, and were diag- 
nosed as having PAH between 1998 and 2006 at Chil- 
dren’s Hospital Boston or afﬁliated delivery hospitals 
covered by the cardiology consultation service of Chil- 
dren’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. BPD was deﬁned 
as neonatal respiratory distress treated with mechanical 
ventilation during the newborn period, with the char- 
acteristic radiographic ﬁndings of pulmonary hyperex- 
pansion with scattered areas of atelectasis and focal em- 
physema and with a requirement for supplemental 
oxygen therapy beyond 30 days of age.2 BPD severity 
was graded according to the summary recommendations 
of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute work- 
shop as mild, moderate, or severe.2 
PAH was diagnosed on the basis of elevated PA pressure 
measured directly at the time of cardiac catheterization or 
echocardiograms demonstrating elevated right ventricle 
(RV) pressure. We included only patients with one or both 
of these ﬁndings beyond the postnatal age of 2 months. 
Electrocardiographic evidence of RV hypertrophy alone 
was not sufﬁcient for the diagnosis of PAH. Patients with 
known structural airway or lung anomalies, congenital 
anomalies of the PAs or pulmonary veins, major systemic 
vessel-to-PA collateral vessels, congenital heart disease (ex- 
cept those with a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal 
defect), severe liver disease, or persistent pulmonary hy- 
pertension of the newborn were excluded. Patients were 
also excluded if RV hypertension was diagnosed with echo- 
cardiography but a contemporaneous catheterization re- 
vealed normal RV pressure or if the diagnosis of elevated 
RV pressure was made before the age of 2 months but 
there was no subsequent echocardiogram or catheteriza- 
tion conﬁrming persistently elevated RV pressure at (cid:3)2 
months of age. 
Echocardiography 
Standard cross-sectional and Doppler echocardiography 
was performed for all patients. A full anatomic survey 
was performed to evaluate cardiac and pulmonary vas- 
cular anatomic features. RV pressure was estimated 
through continuous wave interrogation of the tricuspid 





regurgitant jet, if present, and calculation of a systolic 
RV-to-right atrium pressure gradient by using the mod- 
iﬁed Bernoulli equation (pressure gradient (cid:4) 4 (cid:5) jet 
velocity2). If no tricuspid regurgitation was present or if 
the regurgitant jet could not be interrogated adequately, 
then RV pressure was estimated on the basis of ventric- 
ular septal position and was related to systolic systemic 
arterial pressure measured noninvasively or through di- 
rect arterial pressure monitoring if an arterial line was in 
place. RV pressure assessed on the basis of septal position 
was graded as (cid:1)50% of the systemic pressure if the 
interventricular 
round at end-systole, 
(cid:1)50% but (cid:1)100% of the systemic pressure if there was 
end-systolic ﬂattening of the interventricular septum, 
and (cid:1)100% of the systemic pressure if the interventric- 
ular septum bowed into the left ventricle at end-systo- 
le.25 All echocardiograms were reviewed ofﬂine by a 
single echocardiographer. 

Cardiac Catheterization and Vasoreactivity Testing 
For a subset of patients with speciﬁc clinical indications, 
such as those with severe respiratory disease and severe 
PAH on echocardiograms or with known or suspected 
cardiovascular anomalies requiring further evaluation, 
cardiac catheterization was performed with conscious 
sedation or general anesthesia. Right heart and systemic 
arterial pressures and saturations were measured di- 
rectly. Pulmonary and systemic blood ﬂows were esti- 
mated either with the Fick equation, by using assumed 
oxygen consumption, or through thermodilution and 
were indexed to body surface area. PVR indexed to body 
surface area was calculated as PVR index (in Wood units 
[WUs]) (cid:4) (mean PA pressure (cid:6) mean left atrial or PA 
wedge pressure [in millimeters of mercury])/indexed 
pulmonary blood ﬂow (in liters per minute per meter2). 
Pulmonary vascular reactivity was tested ﬁrst by admin- 
istering 100% oxygen and then by adding inhaled NO 
(typically 80 ppm), repeating measurements, and recal- 
culating cardiac index, pulmonary blood ﬂow, and PVR. 
Each condition was maintained for (cid:1)10 minutes before 
data acquisition. 
Pulmonary Artery Hypertension 
To allow for common categorization of PAH severity in 
patients who underwent echocardiography alone and 
those who underwent catheterization as well, PAH was 
graded for all patients according to the scale of RV pres- 
sure estimated on the basis of septal position, that is, 
normal, elevated but (cid:1)50% of systemic pressure, (cid:1)50% 
but (cid:1)100% of systemic pressure, or (cid:1)100% of systemic 
pressure. A patient was reported to have an improve- 
ment in the severity of PAH only if the estimated or 
directly measured RV pressure decreased to a lower 
grade. Similarly, a patient was reported to have progres- 
sion of PAH only if the grade increased during the study 
period. 
Data Analyses 
Outcomes assessed included survival, progression or im- 
provement in severity of PAH, and reactivity to inhaled 
pulmonary vasodilators. Independent variables assessed 
included gestational age at birth, birth weight, small 
birth weight for gestational age ((cid:1)3rd percentile), dura- 
tion of mechanical ventilation, use of high-frequency 
ventilation, 
tracheostomy, patent ductus arteriosus 
treated with indomethacin or surgery, necrotizing en- 
terocolitis, gastrostomy tube placement, grade III or IV 
intraventricular hemorrhage, method of delivery, ma- 
ternal hypertension, maternal age, multiple-gestation 
pregnancy, and oligohydramnios. Independent variables 
were also analyzed for association with severe PAH. In 
survival analyses, severity of PAH was treated as an 
independent variable. For comparison of continuous and 
categorical variables between groups, the independent- 
samples t test and Fisher’s exact test, respectively, were 
used. For comparison of hemodynamic data before and 
after vasoreactivity testing during cardiac catheterization, 
paired t test analysis was performed, with adjustment for 
multiple comparisons. Time-dependent outcomes were as- 
sessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis, with comparisons be- 
tween factors using the log-rank test, and with multivariate 
Cox regression analysis. Data are presented as mean (cid:2) SD, 
median and range, or frequency. Odds ratios are presented 
with 95% conﬁdence intervals. 
The study was approved by the Children’s Hospital 
Committee on Clinical Investigation. We had full access 
to the data and take full responsibility for its integrity. 

Patients 
A total of 42 premature infants (21 male and 21 female) 
with BPD were diagnosed as having PAH between 1998 
and 2006 and met the inclusion criteria for this study. The 
median gestational age at birth was 26 weeks (range: 
23–32 weeks), and the median birth weight was 701 g 
(range: 355–1320 g). Eleven patients (26%) were small for 
gestational age (SGA) at birth, deﬁned as weight of (cid:1)3rd 
percentile for the estimated gestational age. The majority of 
patients were born at other hospitals and transported to 
Children’s Hospital for additional treatment (Table 1). De- 
mographic and diagnostic characteristics of the study pop- 
ulation are summarized in Table 1. 
Pulmonary Artery Hypertension 
PAH was diagnosed at a median postnatal age of 4.8 
months (range: 2.6 –79 months), with all except 4 pa- 
tients (2 with severe PAH and 2 with mild PAH) being 
(cid:1)1 year of age. All patients were evaluated with echo- 
cardiography, and 13 also underwent cardiac catheter- 
ization. For 6 of the 42 patients (all with mild PAH), 
electrocardiograms obtained near the time of echocar- 
diographic diagnosis did not show evidence of RV hy-

a Systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure was documented at some point during the study period. 
b BPD severity, graded according to the recommendations of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop,2 could not be differentiated 
between moderate and severe for 3 patients (1 with severe PAH and 2 with less-than-severe PAH) who required supplemental oxygen at 
gestational age of 36 weeks but for whom the fraction of inspired oxygen at that time could not be determined from available records. 
pertrophy. At the time of diagnosis, RV systolic pressure 
was systemic or suprasystemic for 15 patients (36%), 
(cid:1)50% but (cid:1)100% of systemic pressure for 23 (55%), 
and elevated but (cid:1)50% of systemic pressure for 4 (9%). 
For 8 patients, the severity of PAH progressed at some 
point during the study period; for 28 patients, a decrease 
in the grade of PAH was observed and was sustained at 
the most recent follow-up evaluation. Of the 42 patients, 
18 (43%) were observed to have systemic or suprasys- 
temic RV pressure at some point during the study period. 
Patients who were SGA at birth were signiﬁcantly more 
likely to have systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure 
than were patients with birth weights above the 3rd 
percentile for age (8 of 11 patients [73%] vs 10 of 31 
patients [32%]; odds ratio: 5.6; 95% conﬁdence interval: 
1.2–25.7; P (cid:4) .03). 
Pulmonary Vascular Reactivity 
Hemodynamic data obtained during catheterization are 
summarized in Table 2. For all 13 patients who under- 
went catheterization, pulmonary vascular reactivity test- 
ing was performed with 100% oxygen (n (cid:4) 12) and/or 
80 ppm inhaled NO (n (cid:4) 13). At baseline, the average 
mean PA pressure was 43 (cid:2) 8 mm Hg, the average PVR 
index was 9.9 (cid:2) 2.8 WUs, and the average PVR/systemic 
vascular resistance ratio was 0.51 (cid:2) 0.18. For 12 of 13 
patients, PA pressure and PVR decreased with vasodila- 
tor testing but remained elevated (Table 2). When in- 
dexed PVR decreased, the majority of the change (to 
7.9 (cid:2) 3.8 WUs; 29% (cid:2) 28% decrease from baseline) was 
observed with administration of 100% oxygen, with an 
additional small decrease (to 6.4 (cid:2) 3.1 WUs) after the 
addition of inhaled NO (Fig 1). In 1 case, PVR did not 
change with hyperoxia but decreased (cid:3)30% after the 
addition of inhaled NO. Overall, there was a signiﬁcant 
decrease in PVR in response to 100% oxygen, compared 
with baseline values. With the addition of 80 ppm of 
inhaled NO, the mean PA pressure, RV systolic pressure, 
and PVR/systemic vascular resistance ratio also de- 
creased to levels signiﬁcantly lower than at baseline. 
With a single exception, the only patients for whom 
PVR normalized ((cid:1)4 WUs) with vasodilator testing were 
3 patients with secundum atrial septal defects, in whom 
PA pressure remained elevated but left-right shunting 
and pulmonary blood ﬂow increased. For these 3 pa- 
tients, the pulmonary/systemic blood ﬂow ratio in- 
creased from 1.1 to 1.3 at baseline to 1.7 to 2.1 with 
100% oxygen and 80 ppm inhaled NO. 
Among patients diagnosed as having PAH through 
echocardiography alone, 4 had (cid:1)1 study during which 
serial evaluation was performed before and after addi- 
tion of inhaled NO, in the cardiac ICU. Two of those 
patients had lower RV pressure while receiving inhaled 
NO than before the addition of NO.

of PAH, at a median age of 10.9 months (range: 5.1–101 
months). Sixteen patients (38%) died during the fol- 
low-up period, 13 within 2 months after diagnosis. For 
14 of those patients, PAH was determined to be a prox- 
imate contributing factor to death, often in concert with 
respiratory failure; the other 2 patients had relatively 
mild PAH ((cid:1)50% of systemic pressure) and died as a 
result of respiratory failure (n (cid:4) 1) or sepsis (n (cid:4) 1). 
By Kaplan-Meier analysis, survival rates after diagnosis 
were 85% (cid:2) 6% at 1 month, 70% (cid:2) 7% at 2 months, 
64% (cid:2) 8% at 6 months, 61% (cid:2) 8% at 1 year, and 52% (cid:2) 
11% at 2 and 3 years (Fig 2A). Independent variables that 
were associated signiﬁcantly with or approached signiﬁ- 
cance for association with shorter survival times in log- 
rank testing included severe PAH (systemic or suprasys- 
temic RV pressure) at any time during the study period (P 
(cid:4) .003), SGA status (birth weight of (cid:1)3rd percentile for 
age) (P (cid:4) .03), previous support with high-frequency ven- 
tilation at any time (P (cid:4) .05), and systemic or suprasys- 
temic RV pressure at the time of PAH diagnosis (P (cid:4) .065). 
Of note, severe BPD was not associated with worse survival 
rates. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, severe PAH 
(systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure) at any time during 
the study period (P (cid:4) .003) was the only independent 
predictor of shorter survival times, although SGA status 
approached signiﬁcance (P (cid:4) .07). The multivariate Cox 
regression models were also performed while controlling 
for gestational age, SGA, and severity of BPD, and the 
presence of systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure at any 
time during the study period remained a signiﬁcant inde- 
pendent predictor of shorter survival times. As depicted in 
Fig 2B, survival rates determined through Kaplan-Meier 
analysis for patients with systemic or suprasystemic RV 
pressure were 65% (cid:2) 12% at 1 month, 44% (cid:2) 12% at 6 
months, 37% (cid:2) 12% at 1 year, and 25% (cid:2) 13% at 2 and 
3 years; for patients with less-than-severe PAH, survival 
rates were 100% at 1 month and 78% (cid:2) 9% at (cid:1)6 
months. 
Follow-up Findings and Management 
Among 26 surviving patients, the median duration of 
follow-up monitoring was 9.8 months (range: 1–98 
months) after the diagnosis of PAH. RV pressure was 
normal in 5 of those patients (19%), (cid:1)50% of sys- 
temic pressure in 16 (62%), (cid:1)50% but (cid:1)100% of 
systemic pressure in 3 (12%), and (cid:1)100% of systemic 
pressure in 2 (8%). The severity of PAH was improved 
for 24 of those patients (89%), compared with the 
most-severe level of PAH. Seven patients with severe 
PAH at any time during the study period were alive at 
the most recent follow-up evaluation. Two of those 
patients continued to have RV pressure (cid:1)100% of 
systemic pressure, 1 had RV pressure (cid:1)50% but 
(cid:1)100% of systemic pressure, and 4 had RV pressure 
(cid:1)50% of systemic pressure, 2 of whom had atrial 
septal defects that had been closed. 





patients, most demonstrated some degree of improve- 
ment in PAH during the follow-up period. 
Little is known about risk factors for PAH among 
formerly premature infants with BPD, but there are 
several published reports concerning the clinical features 
and outcomes of such patients. Most of those were small 
series that included primarily infants born in the 1980s, 
before the routine use of surfactant and alternative 
modes of mechanical ventilation and widespread con- 
cerns about oxygen toxicity. Therefore, these reports 
may not reﬂect the characteristics and treatment of pa- 
tients surviving after extremely premature birth in the 
current era. A study published by Fouron et al22 in 1980, 
for example, showed a mortality rate of 50% in infants 
with BPD who had PAH at (cid:3)4 months of life. In 2 
separate reports of patients with BPD evaluated with 
cardiac catheterization, Berman et al23 reported mean PA 
pressures as high as 89 mm Hg at 10 to 28 months of age 
and persistently elevated PA pressures at a mean age of 
5.8 years.4 Abman et al21 reported an average mean PA 
pressure of 48 mm Hg in a series of 6 young children 
with BPD who underwent cardiac catheterization. These 
reports, published (cid:3)2 decades ago, demonstrated that 
elevated PA pressure may be a long-term and signiﬁcant 
problem in preterm infants with BPD. More recently, 
Subhedar and Shaw28 demonstrated that premature in- 
fants with BPD had higher echocardiographically de- 
rived PA pressures than did premature infants without 
BPD. 
Patients with BPD and PAH in the setting of an atrial 
septal defect are a clinically distinct subgroup. Of 3 such 
patients in this series, 2 had severe PAH but were highly 
reactive to 100% oxygen and inhaled NO and had RV 
pressure (cid:1)50% of systemic pressure after closure of the 
atrial septal defect.

Spectrum and Outcomes of PAH in Infants and Children 
With BPD 
The prevalence of PAH in formerly premature infants 
with BPD is not known.4,26,27 In this study, we reviewed 
our experience from 1998 to 2006 with 42 infants with 
BPD for whom a diagnosis of PAH was conﬁrmed 
through echocardiography and/or cardiac catheteriza- 
tion at (cid:3)2 months of age. The spectrum of PAH in these 
patients was wide; almost one half had severe PAH, with 
systemic or suprasystemic RV pressure, whereas 4 had 
only mild PAH, with RV pressure (cid:1)50% of systemic 
pressure, and the remainder had RV pressure between 
50% and 100% of systemic pressure. The mortality rate 
was high, with only 64% (cid:2) 8% surviving 6 months after 
the diagnosis of PAH. As might be expected, the survival 
rate was signiﬁcantly worse among patients with severe 
PAH, and there was a trend toward worse outcomes 
among infants who were SGA at birth. Among surviving 
Anatomic and Functional Factors Contributing to PAH in 
Infants With BPD 
Intrinsic and secondary abnormalities of the pulmonary 
circulation in premature infants with BPD may predis- 
pose the infants to PAH. BPD associated with prematu- 
rity in the surfactant era is characterized by inhibition of 
lung development, with altered structure, growth, and 
function of the distal airspaces and vasculature. Al- 
though intrinsic abnormalities of lung growth and func- 
tion have been characterized, the vasculature of the 
immature lung is also susceptible to the injury that is 
seen in BPD.3,12,29 For example, endothelial cells are es- 
pecially vulnerable to injury via hyperoxia and inﬂam- 
mation, which may contribute to smooth muscle cell 
proliferation and incorporation of myoﬁbroblasts into 
the vessel wall.11,12 Structural abnormalities of the pul- 
monary vasculature lead to narrowing of vessel diame- 
ters and decreased vascular compliance. Decreased an- 
giogenesis is another consequence of BPD and may 





contribute to reduced vascular cross-sectional area.3 
Functionally, these factors contribute to elevated PVR. 
The pulmonary circulation in patients with BPD is 
abnormally responsive to oxygen and other pulmonary 
vasodilators and may remain so long beyond infan- 
cy.3,6,21,23 In 1985, Abman et al21 demonstrated signiﬁcant 
decreases in PA pressure in response to high concentra- 
tions of inspired oxygen, with similar beneﬁts conferred 
by lower levels of supplemental oxygen. A study by 
Mourani et al,6 however, indicated that a subset of this 
population receiving oxygen therapy would continue to 
have elevated baseline PA pressure, as well as the clinical 
symptoms associated with PAH. With the addition of 
inhaled NO to 100% oxygen, their patients experienced 
additional improvement in PA pressure and PVR, in 
many cases to normal or nearly normal levels.6 In the 
present study, we found that 100% inspired oxygen 
signiﬁcantly decreased PVR but not mean PA pressure 
and the addition of inhaled NO led to additional im- 
provement. Other investigators demonstrated improve- 
ment in PVR in patients with BPD and PAH in response 
to prostacyclin12,20 and variable responsiveness to cal- 
cium channel blockers.6,30 
Evaluation of PAH in Infants With BPD 
The prevalence of and risk factors for PAH in infants 
with BPD are not known, which complicates the devel- 
opment of an effective screening strategy. In the present 
study, almost one half of the 18 patients with systemic or 
suprasystemic RV pressure were SGA, which suggests 
that SGA infants may be at increased risk for severe PAH. 
There was also an association between severe PAH and 
severe lung disease, on the basis of the fact that previous 
high-frequency ventilation, prolonged mechanical ven- 
tilation, and tracheostomy were more prevalent among 
patients with severe PAH than among those without 
severe PAH. However, it is not clear whether this asso- 
ciation is an indication of increased PAH among patients 
with severe BPD or vice versa. 
Appropriate screening guidelines for PAH in prema- 
ture infants do not currently exist, which may have 
important clinical implications, such as missed or de- 
layed diagnoses. In this study, for example, 4 patients 
were diagnosed as having PAH at (cid:3)1 year of age, includ- 
ing 2 with severe PAH. Development of a suitable 
screening strategy is complicated by a lack of informa- 
tion about the true prevalence of PAH in patients with 
BPD and uncertainty about the optimal methods of and 
criteria for screening. Electrocardiography may reveal 
evidence of RV hypertrophy in many patients with RV 
hypertension. However, a recent study found that elec- 
trocardiography had a sensitivity of only 67% and a 
positive predictive value of 69% for detecting echocar- 
diographically documented RV hypertrophy in children 
undergoing evaluation for PAH.31 These ﬁndings mirror 
our own clinical experience and suggest that electrocar- 
diography alone is insufﬁcient to screen for PAH in 
infants with BPD. Echocardiography also has limitations 
as a screening strategy for PAH in this population. In the 
absence of tricuspid regurgitation, a subjective estima- 
tion of septal ﬂattening is the only method of determin- 
ing RV pressure elevation. Unsedated imaging of active 
infants may limit the extent and validity of data that can 
be acquired, whereas sedation of infants with underlying 
BPD has attendant risks (albeit small). 
Indications to screen for PAH in infants with BPD may 
include evaluation before attempted weaning from ox- 
ygen supplementation or assessment of the need for 
additional prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial vi- 
rus. Many premature infants do not qualify for a second 
season of palivizumab in the absence of associated car- 
diac disease.32,33 Among all forms of congenital cardio- 
vascular disease, PAH is associated with the most signif- 
icant 
risk of morbidity resulting from respiratory 
syncytial virus infection.33–35 
Our current approach is to recommend echocardio- 
graphic screening for PAH in premature infants with 
BPD who meet any of the following criteria: (1) extreme 
prematurity (gestational age at birth of (cid:2)25 weeks or 
birth weight of (cid:2)600 g), (2) SGA, (3) requirement for 
prolonged mechanical ventilatory support (duration de- 
pends on age), (4) oxygen requirement out of propor- 
tion to the severity of lung disease, or (5) persistent poor 
growth despite adequate caloric intake. For patients born 
at (cid:1)28 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight of 
(cid:1)1000 g, for whom we estimate the risk of severe PAH 
to be lower, a screening electrocardiogram may be more 
cost-effective, despite the limitations described earlier. 
Cardiac catheterization is typically reserved for patients 
with severe respiratory disease and severe PAH on echo- 
cardiograms or for patients with known or suspected 
cardiovascular anomalies that may require additional 
evaluation. Prospective studies to determine risk factors 
for PAH among infants with BPD are needed to develop 
more-sensitive and more-speciﬁc screening guidelines. 
Treatment of PAH in Infants and Children With BPD 
The goal of therapy for PAH in children with BPD de- 
pends on the severity of the disease. For patients with 
severe PAH, acute treatment is aimed at increasing the 
chances of survival and must work in concert with res- 
piratory support. The objectives of therapy for patients 
with less-severe PAH and those who are recovering from 
severe disease include minimizing exacerbation and 
morbidity while supporting pulmonary growth and de- 
velopment of the child. Ultimately, pulmonary growth 
may be the deﬁnitive remedy for BPD-associated PAH. 
Appropriate therapy includes excluding causes of pro- 
longed or intermittent hypoxemia other than underlying 
BPD in this population. Overnight oximetry studies may 
help diagnose hypoxic episodes, and a sleep study or 
pneumogram can determine whether hypoxia is attrib- 





utable to central, obstructive, or mixed apnea, which 
may be treated by means other than supplemental oxy- 
gen therapy. 
Long-term supplemental oxygen therapy is consid- 
ered the standard treatment for PAH associated with 
BPD.3 Concerns about the adverse effects of supplemen- 
tal oxygen treatment have complicated the issue and 
may prompt accelerated removal of oxygen therapy. 
Target systemic arterial oxygen saturations in premature 
infants remain controversial, but we recommend satu- 
rations of (cid:3)93% for all premature infants and (cid:3)95% for 
infants with documented PAH. Data showing persistent 
elevation of PA pressure beyond infancy and early child- 
hood in formerly premature infants with BPD,6,24 along 
with pulmonary vascular responsiveness to low doses of 
oxygen, support maintaining supplemental oxygen ther- 
apy for infants and children with BPD and PAH. For 
patients with a history of PAH, removal of oxygen 
should be gradual and should be completed only after an 
overnight oximetry study conﬁrms that saturations can 
be maintained above target levels. RV pressure should be 
monitored with serial echocardiography until it has nor- 
malized and remained so for several months after sup- 
plemental oxygen therapy has been removed and until 
the patient has demonstrated an ability to maintain nor- 
mal oxygen saturation without supplemental oxygen. 
Reactivity to inhaled NO in this and previous studies 
suggests the use of NO in an acute setting, a recommen- 
dation that may be supported by recent studies suggest- 
ing a beneﬁcial effect of NO on neurodevelopmental 
outcomes for premature infants.36 Improved pulmonary 
hemodynamic features in response to inhaled NO also 
provide an impetus to study the utility of mechanistically 
similar enteral agents, such as sildenaﬁl. 
Limitations 
This study is limited by its retrospective design. All pa- 
tients with BPD at our institution did not undergo echo- 
cardiography during the study period, and it is likely that 
patients with milder elevations in RV pressure did not 
receive diagnoses, particularly patients whose primary 
follow-up care was outside our system. Because prema- 
ture infants with severe lung disease are at risk for death 
resulting from a variety of conditions, it is possible that 
patients with severe PAH and severe lung disease were 
not ascertained if they died as a result of respiratory 
disease, infection, and/or other factors. Similarly, the 
frequent association between severe lung disease and 
severe PAH complicates the assessment of the relation- 
ship between PAH severity and survival rates, and our 
cohort might not have been sufﬁciently powered to 
identify independent survival effects of these 2 factors. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The mortality rate associated with PAH in formerly pre- 
mature infants with BPD is high. Although risk factors 
for PAH among infants with BPD are not well deﬁned, 
premature infants who were SGA at birth were dispro- 
portionately represented among our cohort of patients 
with severe PAH, which supports the hypothesis that 
SGA status may predispose infants with BPD to PAH. 
Similarly, there seemed to be an association between 
severe PAH and more-severe lung disease, although se- 
vere PAH was associated with worse survival rates even 
when analyses were controlled for the severity of BPD. 
Additional studies are needed to determine risk factors 
for PAH among infants with BPD and to formulate ef- 
fective screening strategies and treatment protocols.

“Van Jones is a rare bird. He’s a black social activist in Oakland, CA, and as 
green an environmentalist as they come. He really gets passionate, and funny, 
when he talks about what it’s like to be black and green: ‘Try this experiment. 
Go knock on someone’s door in West Oakland, Watts or Newark and say: 
“We gotta really big problem!” They say: “We do? We do?” “Yeah, we gotta 
really big problem!” “We do? We do?” “Yeah, we gotta save the polar bears! 
You may not make it out of this neighborhood alive, but we gotta save the 
polar bears!”’ Mr. Jones then just shakes his head. You try that approach on 
people without jobs who live in neighborhoods where they’ve got a lot better 
chance of getting killed by a passing shooter than a melting glacier, you’re 
going to get nowhere—and without bringing America’s underclass into the 
green movement, it’s going to get nowhere, too. ‘We need a different on- 
ramp’ for people from disadvantaged communities, says Mr. Jones.”
