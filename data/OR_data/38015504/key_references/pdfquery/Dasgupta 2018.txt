Abstract 
Objective Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a known complication of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This study aimed 
to determine the utility of serial N-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NTproBNP) levels in the screening of BPD 
associated PH (BPD-PH) in preterm infants. 
Study design Infants with birth weight <1500 g and <30 week corrected gestational age (CGA) were followed with serial 
NTproBNP levels and echocardiograms (ECHO). They were divided into control, BPD and BPD-PH groups. Statistical 
analyses included repeated measures analysis of variance and receiver operator curve (ROC) generation. 
Results Infants in the BPD-PH and BPD group had signiﬁcantly elevated NTproBNP levels as compared to the control 
group. ROC curves for NTproBNP at 28 weeks CGA provided a cut-point of 2329 pg/ml and 578.1 pg/ml for detection of 
BPD-PH and BPD, respectively. 
Conclusions NTproBNP appears to be a good screening tool to determine the onset of BPD-PH as early as 28 weeks CGA. 

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is deﬁned as a mean pul- 
monary artery pressure >25 mmHg after the ﬁrst 3 months 
of life [1]. It is a well-known complication of neonatal 
respiratory diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
(BPD). Almost 18–25% of preterm infants with moderate to 
severe BPD develop PH (BPD-PH) [2, 3] with high mor- 
bidity and mortality (up to 38%) [4, 5]. The deﬁnitive 
diagnosis of PH is usually done by measuring the pul- 
monary artery pressure during cardiac catheterization, 
which may not be feasible in the majority of cases [5]. Most 










centers rely on the echocardiographic (ECHO) parameters 
for the diagnosis of PH although no concrete guidelines 
exist for the diagnosis of PH in the neonatal period. ECHO 
has its own limitations that include its cost, the need for 
experienced personnel to perform and interpret and some- 
times its subjectivity [6]. 
For these reasons, various biochemical markers have 
been proposed as potential screening tools in the diagnosis 
and management of BPD-PH in preterm infants. N terminal 
pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) is synthesized 
and secreted mainly by the ventricular myocardium under 
conditions of sustained volume and pressure overload [7]. 
Montgomery et al. 
showed good correlation of 
NTproBNP as a surrogate biomarker for the diagnosis of 
BPD-PH in preterm infants but Koenig et al. failed to 
demonstrate a similar correlation [9]. The recent American 
Heart Association Guidelines 
recommend that brain 
natriuretic peptide (BNP) or NTproBNP be measured at 
diagnosis and during follow-up to supplement clinical 
decision (Class I; Level of Evidence B) [1]. 

In a recent meta-analysis Al-Ghanem et al. [10] found 
higher odds of mortality and morbidity in infants with BPD- 
PH and they further suggested the need for 
routine 
screening for PH in preterm infants with BPD. However, 
without evidence of any beneﬁt of early screening and

treatment, such screening programs may be best suited in 
the context of properly designed prospective studies by 
using some screening biomarkers of BPD-PH. The purpose 
of our study was to determine the utility of serial 
NTproBNP levels in the screening of early BPD-PH in 
preterm infants. 

prolonged premature 
chor- 
ioamnionitis, diabetes, hypertension and use of antenatal 
steroids, GA, birth weight, gender, respiratory support, 
duration of total parenteral nutrition, and length of hos- 
pital stay. 



This was a prospective observational study. After 
the 
institutional review board approval and parental informed 
consent, we recruited very low birth weight infants (birth 
weight <1500 g and <30 weeks CGA) between February 
2015 and February 2017. Infants with known chromosomal 
anomalies or congenital defects affecting the cardior- 
espiratory system were excluded. 

● Gestational age: calculated either from the 1st trimester 
ultrasound or last menstrual period which ever was 
earlier. 


● PH: deﬁned as ECHO ﬁndings of pulmonary artery 
pressure >25 mmHg estimated by tricuspid regurgitant 
jet velocity, the presence of right ventricular hypertro- 
phy and/or ﬂattening of the inter-ventricular septum 
[11]. We classiﬁed an infant as having PH if all 3 
ECHO’s at 28, 32, and 36 weeks CGA showed evidence 
of PH. 

Infants meeting the inclusion criteria were divided into three 
groups: 









The following data were collected from all eligible sub- 
jects: demographic, perinatal and neonatal data including 
the presence of 
maternal 


In our neonatal intensive care unit, all VLBW infants 
routinely get complete blood count (CBC) every 2 weeks. 
After CBC was performed, the left-over blood samples 
were stored in the laboratory at 4 °C. The collected left- 
over blood samples were centrifuged at 1000×g for 15 
min and plasma (125–150 μL) was collected and imme- 
diately stored at −80 °C for 
future measurement of 
NTproBNP levels. NTproBNP levels were measured by 
using VITROS NTproBNP reagent pack and VITROS 
NTproBNP calibrators on the VITROS 5600 ECi/ECiQ 
Immunodiagnostic Systems. Approximately 40–50 µL of 
plasma was required to measure NTproBNP. We col- 
lected these samples from all the subjects at 28, 32, and 
36 weeks CGA. 

ECHO was performed on all subjects at 28, 32, and 
36 weeks CGA by a trained and certiﬁed pediatric ECHO 
technician within 12 h of blood collection. The Phillips iE- 
the ECHO’s. All 
33 machine was used to perform all 
ECHOs were interpreted by a pediatric cardiologist who 
was blinded to the study groups and to the NTproBNP 
levels. All the data were collected and saved in a secure 
database. 



Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS©. Proce- 
dures used included nonparametric one-way analysis of 
variance 
utilized Dwass, Steel, 
Critchlow-Fligner for pairwise two-sided multiple com- 
parisons (DSCF). This nonparametric technique was used 
to compare continuous variables between the three 
groups. Multivariate general 
techniques 
using Bonferroni methods for multiple comparison were 
used to control for potentially confounding effects of 
gestational age and birth weight as well as used for 
repeated measures analysis of variance. Logistic modeling 
was used for receiver operator curve (ROC) generation 
and signiﬁcant differences between ROC curves was 
determined by chi-square analysis. Analysis of nominal 
variables across the three groups was carried out by chi- 
square tests. The level of statistical signiﬁcance was 
arbitrarily set at p < 0.05.

Clinically important outcome data were obtained in all the 
three groups. 


Although 60 infants were eligible for the study, only 52 
were enrolled (refusal of assent n = 8). Eight 
infants 
(15.3%) were in the BPD-PH group, 28 infants (53.8 %) 
were in the BPD group and 16 infants (30.7%) were in the 
control group (Fig. 1). Maternal demographic variables such 
as mean age, mode of delivery, premature prolonged rup- 
ture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, diabetes, hyperten- 
sion, use of magnesium sulfate, or steroids did not 
signiﬁcantly differ across the three groups (Table 1). Infant 
characteristics evaluated included mean birth weight, mean 
GA, sex, mean days on various modes of oxygen support, 
mean duration of TPN, and hospital stay (Table 2). Based 
on nonparametric ANOVA testing, the following signiﬁcant 
differences were apparent. The BPD group had a lower birth 
weight and GA as compared to the control group. Infants in 
the BPD group spent more days on nasal cannula, SIPAP 
and conventional mechanical ventilation and had sig- 
niﬁcantly longer duration of mean TPN duration and hos- 
pital stay. There was no statistical signiﬁcance between any 
of the variables between the BPD_PH group and the control 
group. We believe this to be because of the lack of power 
(only eight patients in the BPD-PH group). 
There was one infant with borderline PH on ECHO 
(mean pulmonary artery pressure 24 mmHg) on the ECHO 
at 28 weeks CGA but no such evidence on subsequent 
ECHOs and was ultimately enrolled in the BPD group. 
Eight patients had a PDA out of which two (one in BPD-PH 
group and one in BPD group) had hemodynamically sig- 
niﬁcant PDAs (>2 mm in diameter). These closed after the 
indomethacin. The hemodynamically

Statistical signiﬁcance determined by one-way analysis of variance using DSCF Methodology for pairwise 
two-sided multiple comparison analysis 
The median NTproBNP values (IQR) for infants in the 
control group were 500 (613), 608 (702) and 918 (960) pg/ml 
at 28, 32, and 36 weeks CGA, respectively (Table 3). Using 
nonparametric one-way analysis of variance testing for mul- 
tiple comparisons, the corresponding values in the BPD-PH 
group were 8382 (8567), 9502 (8418) and 9656 (8589) pg/ml 
(p < 0.05; compared to control) and in the BPD group were 
1200 (1150), 1564 (979) and 1840 (1892) pg/ml (p < 0.05; 
compared to control). Comparison of the BPD-PH with the 
BPD group showed signiﬁcantly elevated NTproBNP levels 
in the BPD-PH group at the same intervals (p < 0.05). 
In a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
general linear model that included the GA and NTproBNP 
levels at 28, 32, and 36 weeks CGA, NTproBNP values 
among the BPD-PH classiﬁed infants remained signiﬁcantly 
higher than NTproBNP values in the BPD classiﬁed infants. 
Although the NTproBNP levels for BPD-PH did not change 
signiﬁcantly over time, the GA was signiﬁcantly associated 
with time demonstrating a small, but signiﬁcant increase in 
NTproBNP levels with gestational age. In a similar repeated 
measures analysis of infants in BPD vs control group 
adjusting for GA, there were no signiﬁcant associations 
with NTproBNP levels at 28 and 32 weeks CGA, however, 
at 36 weeks CGA, NTproBNP levels were signiﬁcantly 
elevated and there was an overall signiﬁcant interaction 
between time and GA. ROC curves were generated for 
NTproBNP levels at 28 weeks CGA which provided a cut- 
off value of 2329 pg/ml for the detection of BPD-PH 
(sensitivity 87.5%, speciﬁcity 95%) (Fig. 2) and a cut-off 
value of 578.1 pg/ml for the detection of BPD (sensitivity 
89%, speciﬁcity 68%) (Fig. 2). Area under the curve con- 
trasts between 28, 32, and 36 weeks did not show any 
statistically signiﬁcant differences. 

Based on our review of literature, this is the ﬁrst prospective 
study to perform serial ECHO and measurements of 
NTproBNP levels at 28, 32, and 36 weeks CGA to deter- 
mine its utility as a surrogate biomarker for the screening of 
BPD-PH in preterm infants. We have demonstrated good 
correlation (high sensitivity and speciﬁcity) of NTproBNP 
cut-off levels at 28 weeks CGA and the development of 
BPD and BPD-PH at 36 weeks CGA in preterm infants. 
This study may be the basis of future multi-center larger 
studies to validate our ﬁndings. 

BNP is synthesized and secreted mainly by the ventricular 
myocardium [7]. Within the myocytes, BNP is derived from 
the precursor preproBNP, which is cleaved to the prohormone 
proBNP and a signal peptide. Under conditions of sustained 
ventricular volume and/or pressure overload, proBNP is 
is cleaved by an 
released into the circulation, where it 
unknown protease into the physiologically active hormone 
BNP, 
inactive metabolite NTproBNP [12]. 
NTproBNP is a preferred cardiac biomarker as it remains 
stable at 4 °C for 24 h, has a longer plasma half-life, and 
higher plasma concentration as compared to BNP [13, 14]. 
Various studies have demonstrated a correlation between the 
levels of BNP and NTproBNP with the severity of PH in the 
adult population [15]. However, studies looking at the utility 
of using NTproBNP for the screening and diagnosis of BPD- 
PH in preterm infants are limited. 

Our results correlate well with the ﬁndings of Mon- 
tgomery et al. who enrolled PI (<27 weeks GA and birth 
weight <750 g) to identify NTproBNP as an early surrogate 
biomarker 
[8]. They performed a 
screening ECHO at 36–38 weeks CGA and measured 
plasma NTproBNP levels within 1 week. Signiﬁcantly 
higher NTproBNP levels were demonstrated in infants in 
the BPD-PH group. They concluded that NTproBNP may 
be a cost-effective biomarker for the screening of BPD-PH 
in preterm infants. 
In a retrospective study, Cuna et al. [16] also reported 
higher BNP levels in premature infants with BPD. On 
multivariate cox proportional hazard analysis, BNP levels 
predicted survival independent of age, gender, and BPD 
severity. Area under the ROC identiﬁed a BNP level of 220 
pg/ml to have 90% sensitivity and 65% speciﬁcity in pre- 
dicting mortality. They concluded that BNP estimation in 
preterm infants with BPD-PH may be a useful prognostic 
biomarker of mortality. The aim of our study was not to 
correlate NTproBNP levels in predicting mortality. How- 
ever, we demonstrated high sensitivity and speciﬁcity in 

Fig. 2 ROC Curve comparisons: Curve A: Control vs BPD with NT 
proBNP values at 28 weeks, 32 weeks, and 36 weeks. Curve B: BPD 
vs BPD_PH with NTproBNP values at 28 weeks, 32 weeks, and 
36 weeks. Area under the curve (AUC) contrast estimation between 28 
and 32 weeks; and 28 and 36 weeks demonstrated no signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences for Curve A or Curve B 
predicting development of BPD as well as BPD-PH in 
preterm infants. 

On the other hand, in a more recent retrospective study, 
Koenig et al. enrolled preterm infants at <32 weeks GA who 
had an ECHO and plasma levels of BNP and NTproBNP 
within the ﬁrst 72 h of life [9]. PH was deﬁned by increased 
right ventricular 
systolic pressure measured by 
ECHO. They failed to demonstrate any correlation between 
BNP or NTproBNP and RV systolic pressure in simple and 
multiple linear regression analysis. The authors concluded 
that BNP or NTproBNP did not correlate with RV systolic 
pressure and hence PH in the early postnatal period in 
preterm infants. However, in this study ECHO was per- 
formed to assess persistent PH of newborn and was per- 
formed on day 3 of life, which may be too early to detect 
evidence of BPD-PH. 

to previous studies, we measured serial 
plasma NTproBNP levels along with ECHO at 28, 32, and 
36 weeks CGA. We demonstrated that elevated NTproBNP 
levels at 28 weeks CGA correlated well with the develop- 
ment of BPD (578.1 pg/ml) and BPD-PH (2329 pg/ml) at 
36 weeks CGA. If these results are validated by future 
studies, it may enable treatment protocols to be modiﬁed 
prior to the development of irreversible pulmonary vascular 
changes. 
Our study demonstrated signiﬁcantly elevated NTproBNP 
values in the BPD-PH and BPD group as compared to the 
control group in serial measurements at 28, 32, and 36 weeks 
CGA. Comparison between the BPD-PH and BPD group also 
showed signiﬁcantly elevated NTproBNP levels in the BPD- 
PH group during serial measurements. Interestingly, we 
showed that an NTproBNP value >2329 pg/ml would detect 
BPD-PH with 87.5% sensitivity and 95% speciﬁcity, while a 
value >578.1 pg/ml would detect BPD with a sensitivity of 
89% as early as 28 weeks CGA. If these results are validated 
by further studies, NTproBNP has the potential of reducing 
the need for serial ECHO in the management of patients with 
BPD-PH. 

The main limitation of our study was the small sample size. 
Though this is the ﬁrst study to perform serial measure- 
ments of NTproBNP in preterm infants, the results obtained 
should be validated in larger studies. Another limitation was 
the use of ECHO for the diagnosis of PH. It could be 
subjective and operator dependent in the absence of a good 
tricuspid regurgitant jet. However, in the absence of cardiac 
catheterization it remains the standard of diagnosis of PH. A 
third limitation was using NTproBNP as a biomarker of 
BPD-PH in the absence of deﬁned normal values in preterm 
infants [5]. Finally, we did not evaluate the effect of treat- 
ment (pulmonary vasodilators) on the NTproBNP levels in 
the patients included in the study. Consideration may be 
given to evaluate the trend of NTproBNP levels with ther- 
apy in a future study. 
Many experts, neonatologists, pediatric pulmonologists, 
and cardiologists recognize that a sensitive and speciﬁc bio- 
marker is needed to improve the screening, diagnosis, and 
management of BPD-PH in preterm infants. This may help in 
risk stratiﬁcation and targeted therapy in those at risk. We 
believe that the present study is a ﬁrst step in this direction. 
Further studies of serial ECHO and NTproBNP measure- 
ments are warranted for early screening and eventually the 
diagnosis of BPD-PH in preterm infants. We suggest using 
the NTproBNP as a screening tool for the diagnosis of BPD- 
PH in preterm infants between 28 and 36 weeks CGA. 

NTproBNP levels of >2329 pg/ml is a good screening tool 
to determine the onset of BPD-PH as early as 28 weeks 
CGA with high sensitivity (87.5%) and speciﬁcity (95%). 
NTproBNP >578.1 pg/ml appears to be 89% sensitive and 
68% speciﬁc for the prediction of development of BPD as 
early as 28 weeks CGA. NTproBNP levels at 28 weeks 
CGA is less speciﬁc to predict the development of BPD, 
although as one might expect, over time, the predictive 
value appears to improve. At present, it is premature to 
recommend therapeutic 
intervention for BPD-PH at 
28 weeks CGA based on elevated NTproBNP levels. Fur- 
ther studies are suggested to validate our ﬁndings.
