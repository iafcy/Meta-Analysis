Objectives: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a complica- 
tion of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and associated 
with increased mortality and morbidity. Our aim was to 
identify, in infants with BPD, the effect of PH on health-care 
utilisation and health related cost of care. 
Methods: An electronic data recording system was used to 
identify infants ≤32 weeks of gestation who developed BPD. 
PH was classiﬁed as early (≤28 days after birth) or late 
(>28 days after birth). 
Results: In the study period, 182 infants developed BPD; 22 
(12.1%) developed late PH. Development of late PH was 
associated with a lower gestational age [24.6 (23.9–26.9) 
weeks, p=0.001] and a greater need for positive pressure 
ventilation on day 28 after birth (100%) compared to in- 
fants without late PH (51.9%) (odds ratio (OR) 19.5, 95% CI: 
2.6–148), p<0.001. Late PH was associated with increased 
mortality (36.4%) compared those who did not develop 
late PH (1.9%) after adjusting for gestational age and

ventilation duration (OR: 26.9, 95% CI: 3.8–189.4), 
p<0.001. In infants who survived to discharge, late PH 
development was associated with a prolonged duration of 
stay [147 (118–189) days] compared to the infants that did 
not develop late PH [109 (85–149) days] (p=0.03 after 
adjusting for gestational age). Infants who had late PH had 
a higher cost of stay compared to infants with BPD who did 
not develop late PH (median £113,494 vs. £78,677, p=0.016 
after adjusting for gestational age). 
Conclusions: Development of late PH was associated with 
increased mortality, a prolonged duration of stay and 
higher healthcare cost.

The survival rates of extremely premature infants have 
improved significantly in the last few decades, but are 
associated with long term morbidities [1–3]. Broncho- 
pulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common adverse 
outcome and can result in complications which may extend 
into adulthood [4]. One of the signiﬁcant contributory fac- 
tors for morbidity and mortality in infants with BPD is the 
development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) [5]. 
The incidence of pulmonary hypertension in infants 
with BPD ranges from 17 to 37% [6–8]. The pathogenesis of 
pulmonary vascular disease associated with BPD is multi- 
factorial and can be attributed to the interaction of maternal, 
genetic and postnatal factors. Inhibition of angiogenesis has 
been associated with decreased alveolarization and pul- 
monary vascular growth in an animal model [9]. The arrest 
of vascular growth and the reduction in the alveolar- 
capillary surface result in impaired gas exchange. Thus, the 
lungs are exposed to prolonged ventilation and high oxygen 
levels along with hemodynamic and inﬂammatory stressors. 
This causes pulmonary arterial remodelling leading to 
ﬁbrosis of the vessel walls [10]. The risk factors associated 
with the development of pulmonary hypertension include 
intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, maternal 





substance abuse, lower gestational age and birthweight, 
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) requiring treatment and 
sepsis [8, 11–14]. 
The gold standard to diagnose pulmonary hypertension 
is cardiac catheterization, but this is often difficult to 
perform in BPD infants who may have significant vascular 
and haemodynamic complications [15]. Two-dimensional 
echocardiography, however, is a valuable tool for screening 
and diagnosis of PH in such patients [10]. Various studies 
have investigated the risk factors, outcomes [5–8, 11, 14, 
16–21] and evolution of pulmonary hypertension in BPD 
infants [7, 8, 14, 19–21]. The identiﬁed risk factors include 
early pulmonary hypertension, postnatal steroid adminis- 
tration, tracheostomy and tracheitis [5, 16, 17]. Outcomes 
associated with PH in BPD infants include increased mor- 
tality and morbidity including a prolonged duration of 
invasive ventilation, increased occurrence of severe IVH and 
prolonged hospitalization [5, 7, 8, 14, 19–21]. Our aim was to 
identify, in infants with BPD, the effect of PH on health-care 
utilisation and the health related cost of care. 

paediatric cardiologist. The presence of PH was defined based on 
quantitative or qualitative assessments. Quantitative assessment 
included the presence of tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV)>3 m/s 
(right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP)>36 mm Hg). In the absence of 
tricuspid regurgitation, qualitative assessment was used to detect PH 
using the following parameters: (i) ﬂattened or left deviated intraven- 
tricular septum in ventricular systole (ii) right to left shunting across a 
patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect or 
patent ductus arteriosus, if present (iii) right ventricular hypertrophy or 
dysfunction [15]. 

BPD was defined as per the Jobe and Bancalari criteria [22]. Early PH 
was deﬁned as PH diagnosed within 28 days after birth, while late PH 
diagnosed after 28 days [16]. Severe intraventricular haemorrhage was 
deﬁned as Grade 3 or 4 as described by Papile [24]. 
The last echocardiogram during the admission was used to 
identify the presence of PH at discharge or death. Risk factors for late 
PH assessed included maternal preeclampsia, substance abuse, 
small for gestational age (SGA) (defined as birthweight less than 10th 
percentile or less than −1.28 standard deviation for gestational age 
[25]), positive pressure ventilation (PPV) at 28 days after birth, 
medically or surgically treated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), 
sepsis (positive blood culture requiring intravenous antibiotics) and 
presence of early PH. 


An observational study was conducted of infants admitted to the 
neonatal unit at a London hospital, United Kingdom (UK) between 
January 2017 and December 2020. Badgernet, an electronic patient 
record database, was used to identify study subjects. The criteria for 
inclusion were (i) infants born at or prior to 32 weeks’ gestation 
(ii) birthweight less than 1,500 g and (iii) development of BPD 
(oxygen requirement for at least 28 days from birth) [22]. Infants who 
died before 36 weeks of gestation, but required oxygen for at least 
28 days were included in the study [23]. 
Infants had an echocardiogram when there was a clinical sus- 
picion of pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by different pre- 
ductal and post-ductal saturations, a persistently high oxygen 
requirement above 60% and/or requiring increased mean airway 
pressures to maintain oxygenation. Some infants had an echocar- 
diogram for assessment of whether they had a patent ductus arteriosus 
(PDA). Infants whose echocardiogram reports were not available, who 
were admitted for short surgical procedures such as inguinal hernia 
and laser photocoagulation and those with major respiratory and 
cardiac anomalies were excluded from the study. 

The study was registered with the local Clinical Governance and Audit 
Department and did not require informed parental consent. 

The echocardiograms of the infants were reviewed by one author, a 
neonatologist trained in echocardiography and further reviewed by a 
We assessed the mortality in the cohort and the total duration of stay in 
the survivors. Additionally, the total cost of stay was calculated based 
on national average costs of neonatal unit stay. We also compared the 
length and cost of stay in infants whom PH resolved prior to discharge 
against the ones in whom PH did not resolve prior to death or 
discharge. The average daily cost ranges from £437 to £1,218 was 
graded based on the intensity of care coded as intensive care, high 
dependency and special care (Table 1) [26]. The duration of care at 
each level of care was extracted from Badgernet and used to estimate 
the total cost of stay in the neonatal unit. 

On testing for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test, the data was found to 
be non- normally distributed. Therefore, the Mann-Whitney U test was 
used for comparing the continuous variables and Chi-square test for 
dichotomous variables. Multiple logistic or linear regression was used 
to adjust for confounding variables. All the risk factors were adjusted

The effect of total cost of stay was further adjusted for gestational age. 
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) 
was used to analyse the data. 

A total of 428 premature infants were admitted to the 
neonatal unit during the study period, 211 (49.3%) subse- 
quently developed BPD; 189 infants were included in the 
analysis and 29 infants were excluded (Figure 1). 
The included infants had a median (interquartile 
range) gestational age of 25.9 (24.9–27.7) weeks and 
birthweight of 769 (667–930) grams (Table 2). Twenty-one 
(11.5%) infants had early PH of which six (28.5%) subse- 
quently developed late PH. Twenty-two (12%) infants had 
late PH. Amongst the 22 infants with late PH, pulmonary 
hypertension resolved in 10 infants, four had pulmonary 
hypertension at discharge from neonatal care and eight 
died with pulmonary hypertension (Figure 2). 
The characteristics of infants who developed early PH, 
late PH, both early and late and no PH have been detailed 
in Table 3. The infants who developed both early and late 
PH had a lower (median) gestational age (24.4 weeks) 
compared to those who had only early PH (25.7 weeks), late 
PH (24.6 weeks) or no PH (26.1 weeks, p=0.02). Further- 
more, infants who developed both early and late PH had a 
lower (median) birthweight (603 g) compared to those who 
had early PH (780 g), late PH (673 g) or no PH (818 g, 
p<0.001).

birthweight (642.5 vs. 816.5 g, p<0.001) compared to those 
who did not have late PH. The infants who developed late 
PH were more often mechanically ventilated on day 28 after 
birth compared to the ones who did not develop late 
PH [100 vs. 51.9%, p<0.001; OR: 19.5 (CI: 2.6–148)]. The 
infants who developed late PH had a longer median 
duration of mechanical ventilation compared to the infants 
without late PH (53.5 vs. 27.5 days, p<0.001) [Table 4]. 
Eleven infants (6%) died in the study population. Eight 
had pulmonary hypertension at death, of those eight, six 
had developed PH within 28 days after birth (Figure 2).

increased mortality [OR: 21.4 (4.1–111.3), adjusted p=0.001]. 
Similarly, the presence of late PH in surviving infants was 
independently associated with a longer duration of hospi- 
tal stay [147 vs. 109 days, adjusted p: 0.03] (Table 5). 

the 182 infants was 
£17,164,290 ($23,957,659). The median (IQR) total cost of 
stay in infants with late PH was £113,494 (72,650–169,798) 
compared to £78,677 (48,476–115,483) in infants with BPD, 
but no late PH after adjusting for gestational age (p=0.016) 
[Table 5]. The median cost of stay in infants with BPD and 
PH was approximately £35,000 higher (44% higher) 
compared to that of infants with BPD without PH. 
The median length of hospitalisation was similar in 
infants whom PH resolved before discharge [147 (118–189) 
days] compared to the infants in whom PH did not resolve 
before discharge or died with PH [147 (72–259) days, 
p=0.81]. The total cost of stay was not signiﬁcantly different 
in infants in whom PH resolved before discharge [£85,992 
(67,524–121,939)] compared to the infants in whom PH did 
not resolve before discharge [£148,458 (80,185–252,455), 
p=0.07]. 

We have demonstrated late PH was associated with a higher 
mortality and a longer duration of stay compared to infants 
with BPD without PH. Furthermore, we found that the total 
cost of stay for infants with late PH and BPD was higher 
compared to those who did not develop late PH.

with BPD, but did not describe the impact of this on mor- 
tality [16, 17]. This highlights the need for early as well as 
regular screening for pulmonary hypertension via echocar- 
diographic assessment in infants with BPD. 
One study reported the healthcare utilization of infants 
with PH associated with BPD presenting after two months 
of age into a BPD clinic and found that the infants were 
hospitalised for a longer duration and had more respiratory 
morbidity than infants with BPD but no PH [28]. Our study 
reported on the total cost of stay based on national average 
in infants with BPD and PH and to our knowledge this is the 
ﬁrst study which speciﬁcally looked into the effect of pul- 
monary hypertension in infants with bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia on health care costs. 
Our study has strengths and some limitations. In our 
study population we used echocardiography to identify 
pulmonary hypertension; echocardiography is considered 
to be an effective and reliable screening tool for detection 
of pulmonary hypertension in infants with BPD [29]. A 
limitation, however, was that the infants had echocardio- 
grams at various time intervals according to clinical need 
rather than at speciﬁc intervals, but this makes our results 
generalisable to clinical practice. 
In conclusion, infants with late PH had a longer 
duration of hospitalization and increased mortality 
compared to the infants without late PH. The presence of 
late PH in infants with BPD resulted in increased 
healthcare costs. 
Our study showed that while the incidence of overall 
mortality was 6% in the study population, the presence of 
late PH was associated with a 36% increase in mortality. 
Studies have described the association of PH and mortality 
with an incidence ranging from 10 to 38% [7, 8, 14, 17, 18, 27]. 
Notably, among the eight infants who died with pulmonary 
hypertension, six of them had developed PH within 28 days 
(Figure 2). Two studies have shown that early PH increases 
the risk for severe BPD and development of late PH in infants
