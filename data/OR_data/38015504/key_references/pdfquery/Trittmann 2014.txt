Aim—To test the hypothesis that there are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of 
the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH) in neonates with 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). 
Methods—Neonates with BPD were enrolled (n = 140) and clinical characteristics compared 
between case (BPD + PH) and control (BPD) groups. DNA was isolated from blood leucocytes 
and assayed for 17 SNPs in L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway genes by Sequenom massarray. Genes 
included carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthase, 
nitric oxide synthase and arginase. SNPs were selected from the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information database for their putative functionality. Calculated minor allele 
frequencies (MAF) of cases and controls were compared using χ2 and logistic regression. 
Results—Of the 140 patients with BPD, 26% had echocardiographic evidence of PH. Ventilation 
days were longer for cases than controls (mean 31 vs. 15 days, p < 0.05). Of the 17 SNPs,

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm 
infants, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiovascular complication of BPD that is 
associated with a marked increase in morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated that 25 
to 40% of infants with BPD will develop PH (1–4), but there are currently no tests for 
predicting which BPD patients might develop this life-threatening complication. Identifying 
BPD- associated PH early may be important in capturing the reversible phase of PH and 
thereby improving outcomes (1). 
Endogenous nitric oxide synthesis is required for regulation of neonatal pulmonary vascular 
resistance and vasore-activity (5–7). Disruption of the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway may 
alter vascular reactivity and contribute to the development of PH in patients with BPD (1, 8). 
Nitric oxide synthase and arginase compete for their common substrate L-arginine and have 
opposing effects in PH. Nitric oxide synthase produces the potent vasodilator nitric oxide, 
while arginase is the first step in polyamine and proline production leading to cellular 
proliferation and vascular remodelling. In animal models of BPD, lung levels of endothelial 
nitric oxide synthase are low and increasing nitric oxide production normalises patterns of 
lung growth and vascularisation in these models (1, 8, 9). In term infants with another form 
of PH, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, it has been found that the 
circulating levels of L-arginine are lower due to decreased production of L-arginine by the 
urea cycle enzymes, and this was associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
in the urea cycle gene carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (10). Therefore, our objective was to 
test the hypothesis that in preterm infants with BPD there are SNPs in the L-arginine/ nitric 
oxide pathway associated with the development of PH. 

The Institutional Review Board at Nationwide Children's Hospital approved this study. 
Neonates were enrolled from the neonatal intensive care unit at Nationwide Children's 
Hospital after 1 September 2009. Patients were enrolled if they met National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development criteria for the definition of BPD, which was defined 
as treatment with supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days (11). The cohort included 140 
patients with BPD, of which there were 36 patients with echocardiographic evidence of 
elevated pulmonary arterial pressure who were classified as having PH and therefore 




considered cases. Elevated pulmonary arterial pressure was considered to be present on 
echocardiography if there was right ventricular hypertrophy, flattening of the 
intraventricular septum, presence of tricuspid regurgitation in the absence of pulmonary 
stenosis and/or elevated right ventricular pressure, as estimated by tricuspid regurgitant jet 
velocity (2, 12). The controls were patients with BPD who did not have PH according to 
these criteria. Patients with congenital heart disease, except patent ductus arteriosus or atrial 
septal defect, were excluded from the study. Patients with anatomical causes of PH, 
including diaphragmatic hernia or other causes of lung hypoplasia, were also excluded from 
the study. 
After consent was obtained, blood samples were collected, maintained on ice for no more 
than six hours, and centrifuged. The blood cells were stored for isolation of DNA from 
leucocytes. SNPs were selected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
SNP database for their putative functionality (5, 13–22). DNA was isolated from blood 
leucocytes and assayed for 34 SNPs in genes of the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway by 
Sequenom MassArray (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). Subsequently, 17 SNPs had 
calculated minor allele frequencies (MAF) of zero and these SNPs were excluded from the 
study. A total of 17 SNPs were studied in six genes, including carbamoyl-phosphate 
synthetase (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthase (ASS), 
nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), arginase (ARG1, ARG2). 

Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between BPD and PH (cases) 
versus BPD alone (control) groups. Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test. 
Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test. Calculated MAF of cases and 
controls were compared using the χ2 test. An additive logistic regression model was used to 
estimate the adjusted odds ratio of the risk of individual genotypes in developing PH in 
BPD. Analysis of the distributions of genotypes was performed by χ2 analysis with 1 degree 
of freedom (10). A p-value <0.05 was considered to be significant. This study was designed 
to test a specific hypothesis and only candidate genes in the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway 
were included in the study. Given the limitation of study sample size, less conservative 
values are also of interest, and may be hypothesis generating. Therefore, no correction was 
made for multiple testing. STATA/IC 12.0 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA) 
statistical software was used to complete all of the analyses in this study. 
Among all 140 patients with BPD, 36 (26%) patients also had echocardiographic evidence 
of PH. For patients with both BPD and PH, the average day of life for the first 
echocardiogram was 11 ± 14 days and the average day of life of PH diagnosis was 29 ± 40 
days. Table 1 compares demographic and clinical characteristics between case and control 
groups. Overall, there were no significant differences between case and control groups, 
except for ventilation days and number of echocardiograms. Ventilation days were 
significantly longer for the case group (31 36 days) than for the control group (15 ± 27 days, 




p = 0.02) ± and the number of echocardiograms were also increased in the PH group (3.9 vs. 
2.5, p < 0.01). 
Table 2 compares MAF for cases and controls for 17 of the SNPs studied. We found that the 
rs2781666 (arginase I gene) T allele was less common in cases (MAF = 0.23) than in 
controls (MAF = 0.37, p = 0.04). None of the other 16 SNPs showed a significant difference 
in MAF between cases and controls. 
Figure 1 demonstrates the allele frequencies for the arginase I SNP rs2781666 in cases and 
controls. The proportion of patients who were homozygous for the G allele (wild type) was 
greater in the BPD and PH group than in the BPD alone group (p = 0.03). Using an additive 
logistic regression model, for each additional minor allele (T), having the minor allele 
decreases the risk of PH in BPD by 43% (OR per additional T allele 0.57 [95% CI 0.31– 
1.02]; p = 0.047). 
In this cohort of BPD patients, 27% had mild BPD and 73% had moderate/severe BPD as 
defined by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development consensus 
workshop (11). Of the BPD patients with PH, 14% had mild BPD and 86% had moderate/ 
severe BPD, and this was not different from patients with BPD alone (31% mild, 69% 
moderate/severe, p = 0.07). 

The major objective of the present study was to investigate the association of SNPs in the L- 
arginine/nitric oxide pathway with the development of PH in patients with BPD. The major 
findings of this study were that the rs2781666 SNP in the arginase I gene was associated 
with a lower incidence of PH in patients with BPD and the odds of PH were decreased by 
43% for each copy of the minor allele of the rs2781666 SNP in patients with BPD. These 
findings support our hypothesis that SNPs in genes involved in the L-arginine/nitric oxide 
pathway are associated with the development of PH in preterm infants with BPD. 
The rs2781666G/T SNP is located in the promoter region of the arginase I gene. There have 
been reports of associated cardiovascular changes with the rs2781666G/T polymorphism of 
arginase I. Meroufel et al. (21) reported that the rs2781666 SNP of the arginase I gene was 
associated with a trend toward decreased systolic blood pressure (p = 0.067) in an adult 
Algerian population. Furthermore, two separate reports by Dumont et al. (23) and Sediri et 
al. (24) demonstrated the association of the arginase I rs2781666 SNP with the risk of 
myocardial infarction. In addition to cardiovascular disease, arginase genes have also been 
associated with childhood asthma. Salam et al. (22) reported that a particular arginase I 
haplotype was associated with a reduced risk of asthma. 
There are both in vitro and in vivo data supporting that changes in arginase levels are 
associated with pulmonary vascular disease. An increase in arginase expression and activity 
has been shown in both human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and microvascular 
endothelial cells, resulting in greater cell proliferation (25, 26). In a murine model of PH, 
arginase has been shown to be elevated in the lung homogenates (27). In addition, arginase 
II has been shown to be elevated in adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (28). 



In the present study, a SNP was found in the arginase I gene that differed between BPD 
patients with and without PH. It remains to be elucidated exactly what effects this SNP has 
on arginase activity, but we would speculate based on the above that the rs2781666 SNP 
results in lower arginase activity. 
There are several limitations of this study that should be noted. Our sample size was 
relatively small, but using a directed gene approach we found a significant difference in the 
rs2781666 SNP of arginase I gene between patients with BPD and PH and those with BPD 
alone. We acknowledge that this study needs to be replicated in a larger cohort of patients, 
but emphasise that our findings provide a novel insight into a potential marker for BPD- 
associated PH. Another limitation of our study is the inherent difficulty of diagnosing PH in 
the newborn period. The gold standard for diagnosis of PH is cardiac catheterisation, but due 
to the invasiveness associated with cardiac catheterisation in preterm infants, 2D 
echocardiography is the most common approach to diagnose PH in this population (12). 
Our findings suggest that genetic variations in arginase I are associated with PH in preterm 
infants with BPD. Our study provides important data that supports a more detailed 
investigation of the SNPs in the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway genes in the BPD 
population. These findings also highlight that there may be genetic markers that predict the 
onset of PH in infants with BPD, such that therapeutic approaches might be developed to 
prevent PH in BPD and thereby improve outcomes for patients with BPD.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) substantially increases morbidity and mortality in 
neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and predictors of BPD- 
associated PH are needed for earlier diagnosis and treatment. 
In a cohort of 140 neonates with BPD, a single polymorphism (SNP) rs2781666 
in arginase I gene was associated with less PH and each additional minor allele 
decreased the risk of PH by 43%.
