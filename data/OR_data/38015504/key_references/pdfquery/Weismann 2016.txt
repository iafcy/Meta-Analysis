prospective screening program

OBJECTIVE: Determine prevalence and associations with pulmonary hypertension (PH) in preterm infants. 
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective institutional echocardiographic PH screening at 36 to 38 weeks’ corrected gestational age (GA) for 
infants born o 32 weeks' GA who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; group BPD), and infants without BPD who had a birth 
weight (BW) o 750 g, or clinical suspicion for PH (group NoBPD). 
RESULTS: Two hundred and four infants were screened (GA 25.9 ± 2 weeks, BW 831 ± 286 g). The PH prevalence in group BPD was 
higher than in group NoBPD (44/159 (28%) vs 5/45 (11%); P = 0.028). In group BPD, BW and GA were lower in infants with PH 
compared with NoPH. Following correction for BW and GA, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), severe intraventricular hemorrhage 
(IVH), atrial septal defect (ASD), and mortality were independently associated with PH in infants with BPD. In group NoBPD, NEC was 
the only identiﬁed factor associated with PH. Altogether, screening only those infants with NEC and infants with BPD who also had 
a BW o840 g would have yielded a 84% sensitivity for detecting PH, and reduced the number of screening echocardiograms 
by 43%. 
CONCLUSIONS: PH in prematurity is associated with NEC in infants with and without BPD. In infants with BPD, smaller GA and BW, 
severe IVH, ASD and mortality are also associated with PH. Infants without identiﬁed PH-associated factors may not require routine 
echocardiographic PH screening. 

Over the past few decades, survival of premature infants has 
signiﬁcantly increased. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one 
of the most common morbidities associated with prematurity and 
with the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH in this 
population is thought to be due to abnormal microvascular 
development and pulmonary vascular remodeling, resulting in 
reduced cross-sectional area of pulmonary vasculature.1 
In 
addition, pulmonary vascular reactivity is increased rendering 
these infants more sensitive to periods of hypoxemia.2 PH has 
been reported in 23 to 37% of premature infants in multiple 
retrospective studies with variable inclusion criteria, deﬁnitions for 
PH, and echocardiographic interpretation.3–6 However, 
recent 
prospective studies suggest that the incidence of ‘late’ PH, at 
~ 36 weeks’ corrected gestational age (CGA), may actually be 
lower (4 to 14%).7–9 Both prenatal and postnatal risk factors have 
including 
been associated with PH in infants with BPD, 
oligohydraminios, 
lower birth weight 
(BW), small 
infection and patent ductus 
arteriosus (PDA). Outcomes associated with PH in infants with BPD 
include prolonged mechanical ventilation and need for prolonged 
supplemental oxygen therapy, increased length of hospital stay 
and, most importantly, increased mortality.3–7,10–12 To date, there 
are no published guidelines for PH screening in infants with BPD. 
In 2010, we instituted a screening program in the Yale-New 
Haven Children’s Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for 
infants at perceived risk for PH (Figure 1). The aim of this study 


was to determine the prevalence of PH as well as associated risk 
factors for PH in a cohort of infants o 32 weeks’ gestation. 
METHODS 
At Yale-New Haven Children’s Hospital, we established an echocardio- 
graphic screening protocol for PH in preterm infants. We report data 
collected prospectively between April 2010 and November 2014. Screen- 
ing echocardiograms were performed at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA. Inclusion 
criteria were (1) born o32 weeks’ GA and diagnosed with BPD at 
36 weeks’ CGA (group BPD) or 2) born o32 weeks' GA and o 750 g BW 
but without BPD (group NoBPD). In addition, screening was also performed 
at the request of the medical team for any infant o32 weeks’ GA with 
pulmonary disease that did not meet criteria for BPD at 36 weeks’ CGA but 
had a clinical suspicion for PH (group NoBPD). 

factors, neonatal 
demographics, major neonatal morbidities and outcomes for inclusion in 
our analyses. Maternal factors included the presence of chorioamnionitis, 
maternal hypertension and administration of antenatal steroids. Neonatal 
factors included gender, GA, BW and small 
for GA status. Neonatal 
morbidity data included BPD, early- and late-onset sepsis, necrotizing 
enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and presence of a 
PDA. BPD was graded by severity as mild, moderate or severe using the 
consensus deﬁnition by National 
Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development (2000).13 Early-onset sepsis was deﬁned as a positive blood 
culture(s) obtained at ⩽ 72 h of life, which yielded a traditional neonatal 
pathogen (e.g. Escherichia coli, Group B streptococcus). Late-onset sepsis 
was deﬁned as a positive blood culture(s) obtained at 472 h of life 
which yielded a traditional neonatal pathogen or a commensal 
species (e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis).14 Blood cultures that yielded

coagulase-negative staphylococci were reviewed using speciﬁc criteria 
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.15 NEC was deﬁned 
according to the modiﬁed Bell’s staging and included only those ⩾ stage 
IIA.16 Surgical NEC included only those cases that went on to require 
surgical intervention. IVH was graded based on the classiﬁcation system 
developed by Papile et al.17 with severe IVH including only those of grade 
III or IV. PDA included only those deemed to be hemodynamically 
signiﬁcant and was diagnosed via echocardiogram as reviewed by a 
pediatric cardiologist. Last, outcome data included death, cumulative time 
(in days) requiring mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube, 
length of hospital stay, CGA at the time of discharge and whether or not an 
infant was discharged from the NICU on supplemental oxygen. 
A screening echocardiogram was conducted at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA 
using the Philips IE33 (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA) or 
Siemens Sequoia SC2000 (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Mountain View, 
CA, USA) equipment. All echocardiograms were performed by a pediatric

echocardiography technician using our institutional PH protocol. Echo- 
cardiograms were interpreted by a single pediatric echocardiographer 
(CGW) who was blinded to the clinical status of the patient. PH was deﬁned 
as a tricuspid regurgitation jet gradient of 436 mm Hg or presence of 
septal ﬂattening in systole. We also documented presence of a small or 
greater atrial septal defect (ASD) or PDA. A patent foramen ovale was 
deﬁned as the space between a well-developed septum primum and a 
normally formed septum secundum, and was considered normal.18 A 
secundum ASD was deﬁned by the presence of deﬁciency of the septum 
primum. 
Infants with evidence of PH underwent follow-up echocardiograms at 
individualized intervals. We documented the presence or absence of PH at 
the time of last follow-up but no later than 1 year of age. Infants who had a 
normal PH screening echocardiogram at 36 weeks’ CGA and who were 
under the care of the Pediatric Respiratory Medicine service underwent 
repeat echocardiography at ~ 1 year of age. 
For statistical analyses continuous variables were expressed as mean 
(s.d.), unless otherwise indicated. Categorical variables were expressed as 
numbers (frequencies). For comparisons between groups, the t-test for 
independent samples was used for continuous data. Fisher's exact or χ2 
tests were used as appropriate for comparison of categorical variables 
between groups. Binary logistic regression was used to correct 
for 
differences in BW and GA between the groups and adjusted odds ratios 
(ORs) with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were determined. Receiver 
operating characteristics curves were created. The set signiﬁcance level 
was Po 0.05. For multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was used 
(e.g. NEC vs surgical NEC, Po0.025 was considered signiﬁcant). Statistical 
analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences, 
version 21 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). 
RESULTS 
Three hundred and ninety-eight infants born at o 32 weeks' GA 
and still in our NICU at 36 weeks' CGA were eligible for inclusion 
(Figure 2). One hundred and eighty-nine infants were excluded 
because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (i.e. they were 
o32 weeks’ GA, ⩾ 750 g BW but without BPD or clinical suspicion 
for PH). We excluded an additional two infants with congenital 
heart disease and associated elevated right heart pressure. Three 
infants with BPD never had a screening echocardiogram before 
discharge (Figure 2). Two hundred and four infants o 32 weeks’

gestation who met the inclusion criteria and underwent a PH 
screening echocardiogram at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA at Yale-New 
Haven Children’s Hospital were included in this study. Group BPD 
included 159 infants diagnosed with BPD at 36 weeks’ CGA.13 
Group NoBPD included 45 infants born at o32 weeks’ GA. These 
included 15 infants screening strictly for BW o750 g as well as 30 
infants with non-BPD pulmonary disease and a clinical suspicion 
for PH (n = 30). 
Group BPD 
In group BPD, 44 of 159 infants (27.7%) had echocardiographic 
evidence of PH at the time of the screening echocardiogram. Of 
those, 35 had systolic septal ﬂattening only, 1 had a tricuspid 
regurgitation jet gradient 436 mm Hg only and 8 met both the 
criteria. Infants with PH were of lower birth BW and GA, and were 
more likely to have early-onset sepsis, severe IVH and NEC 
(medical and surgical) as compared with those without PH 
(Table 1). At the time of the PH screening echocardiogram, infants 
with PH were also more likely to have an ASD (Table 1). Left–right 
interatrial shunting was present in all but of the two infants. The 
presence of an ASD was strongly associated with right ventricular 
hypertrophy (ASD 16/32 (50%) vs no ASD 21/127 (17%), P o 0.001) 
and dilation (ASD 16/32 (50%) vs no ASD 8/127 (6%), P o0.001). 
No association between the severity of BPD and the prevalence of 
PH was determined. Following correction for GA and BW in a 
logistic regression model, all NEC, surgical NEC, severe IVH and the 
presence of an ASD remained independent predictors of PH in the 
cohort with BPD (Table 2). Early-onset sepsis occurred only in 
infants with PH and therefore could not be used in the logistic 
regression model. PH was also determined to be an independent 
predictor for death before discharge from the NICU (Tables 1 
and 2). In infants with BPD, length of stay, duration of mechanical 
ventilation and discharge/transfer on oxygen did not differ 
between infants with and without PH (Table 1). 
Two infants in group BPD underwent a diagnostic cardiac 
catheterization, 5 infants were placed on PH-speciﬁc oral agents, 
10 received inhaled nitric oxide (NO), and 3 received both oral and 
inhaled treatment. Thirty-ﬁve of 44 (80%) 
infants in the PH 
subgroup underwent follow-up echocardiograms. At the time of

their most recent follow-up, only six (17%) still had evidence of PH 
(Table 1). Fifty-nine of 115 infants with BPD but without initial 
evidence of PH had follow-up echocardiograms. Only one infant 
had newly developed PH at the time of a clinical deterioration. The 
infant died secondary to NEC totalis. 
Group NoBPD 
In the NoBPD group, 5 of 45 (11%) infants had echocardiographic 
evidence of PH. There were no signiﬁcant differences in select 
maternal factors, gender, BW or GA between infants with or 
without PH in this group. The only postnatal factor associated with 
PH in the NoBPD group was NEC (Table 1). There were no 
differences 
in echocardiographic and/or outcome variables 
between infants with or without PH in this cohort, and no infants 
in this group died before NICU discharge (Table 1). Of note, there 
was no difference in the prevalence of PH at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA 
when comparing the subgroup of infants with BW o 750 g with 
those with BW ⩾ 750 g (2/15 (13%) vs 3/30 (10%); P = 1). At the 
time of the most recent follow-up, none of the 25 infants with 
available echocardiographic data had evidence of PH (Table 1). 
Group BPD and NoBPD combined 
In both groups BPD and NoBPD alike, NEC was the most signiﬁcant 
factor associated with PH, with 57% (16/28) having echocardio- 
graphic evidence of PH at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA. The prevalence of 
PH for infants who did not have a history of NEC was 22% (31/138) 
for group BPD compared with 5% (2/38) 
for group NoBPD 
(P = 0.018). 
In a subgroup analysis of group BPD without NEC, 
lower BW (area under the curve 0.619, 95% CI: 0.504 to 0.734, 
P = 0.044) was associated with PH, whereas GA (area under the 
curve 0.568, 95% CI: 0.0.456 to 0.679, P = 0.253) and severe IVH (PH 
in severe IVH 5/13 (38%) vs 26/125 (21%) 
if no severe IVH; 
P = 0.167) were not. Based on these results, a BW o840 g as a 
predictor of PH was associated with a 80% sensitivity and 41% 
speciﬁcity in this subgroup (PH for BW o 840 g 25/88 (28%) vs 
6/50 (12%) for BW ⩾ 840 g; P = 0.033). 
Therefore, if we limited PH screen to only those infants with 
NEC, and to those with BPD who also had a BW o840 g, the 
sensitivity for detecting PH would have been 84%. This approach 
would have missed eight infants with echocardiographic evidence 
of PH. However, by applying these more restrictive criteria for PH 
screening, we would have reduced the number of echocardio- 
grams performed by 88 (i.e. by 43%). 
DISCUSSION 
This is the ﬁrst investigation of PH in infants o32 weeks’ GA with 
BPD that prospectively identiﬁed NEC (both medical and surgical), 
surgical NEC, severe IVH, the presence of an ASD and mortality as 
factors independently associated with PH at 36 to 38 weeks’ CGA. 
In infants o 32 weeks’ GA and without BPD, NEC was the only 
identiﬁable factor associated with PH. 
The prevalence of PH in our study is within the previously 
reported range for PH in prematurity of up to 36%.3–6 However, 
two recent prospective studies suggest that the incidence of ‘late’ 
PH, at ~ 36 weeks' CGA, may actually be lower (4 to 14%).8,9 This 
wide range may be attributed to the retrospective design of most 
lack of prospective screening protocols, variability in 
studies, 
inclusion criteria, time points when the echocardiograms were 
performed, classiﬁcation of PH based on the clinical interpretation 
of echocardiograms by different readers and variable echocardio- 
graphic deﬁnitions for PH. 
The gold standard for diagnosing PH is a mean pulmonary 
arterial pressure of 425 mm Hg via cardiac catheterization.19 
Interestingly, this deﬁnition applies to adults, children and infants 
alike, even though there are signiﬁcant differences in systemic 
arterial blood pressure from infancy to adulthood. Using 
echocardiography as a screening tool for PH, an estimated systolic 
pulmonary arterial pressure ⩾ 35 to 40 mm Hg or the presence of 
end-systolic septal ﬂattening are considered abnormal.9,20,21 
Echocardiographic presence of end-systolic septal ﬂattening is 
generally thought to indicate more than half systemic right 
ventricular systolic pressure. This was ﬁrst described over 30 years 
ago in a study of 26 children who underwent cardiac catheteriza- 
tion and echocardiography simultaneously.20 Assessment of septal 
ﬂattening, however, has signiﬁcant 
interobserver variability.22 
Quantitative estimates of septal ﬂattening may therefore be 
useful 
in the absence of enough tricuspid regurgitation to 
estimate right ventricular systolic pressure.22–25 The left ventricular 
end-systolic eccentricity index (SEI) quantiﬁes the degree of septal 
ﬂattening. A SEI of 1 would be considered normal, septal 
ﬂattening is recognized by a single observer at an SEI ⩾ 1.15, 
but greater than half systemic right ventricular pressure estimates 
was only noted at SEI ⩾ 1.3.22 In our patient cohort, changing the 
deﬁnition of PH to SEI ⩾ 1.3 would decrease the prevalence of PH 
from 27 to 10%. Although SEI as a quantitative measure of septal 
ﬂattening may increase reproducibility, correlation to actual 
hemodynamic data will remain challenging until simultaneous 
cardiac catheterization is performed as part of a larger 
multicenter study. 
BPD has been previously reported to be a major independent 
for PH, especially if severe.3,5,8,9 While BPD was 
risk factor 
associated with PH in our study, severity was not. This discrepancy 
may be due to variable deﬁnitions of BPD. While we used NIH 
criteria, we did not perform physiologic testing.7,9 



In our study, NEC (medical and surgical NEC combined as well 
as surgical NEC alone) and severe IVH remained independently 
associated factors for PH in infant with BPD after controlling for GA 
inﬂammation and 
and BW. 
hypoxemia have all been associated with acute and/or chronic 
development of PH.26,27 Diminished endothelial NO production by 
endothelial NO synthase can lead to PH in those clinical settings, 
which has also been described in infants with NEC.28 In addition, 
there is some evidence linking insufﬁcient supply of endogenous 
NO in premature infants to BPD and IVH.29 This may explain why 
NEC and severe IVH were identiﬁed as PH-associated factors in our 
cohort of preterm infants. 
Risk stratiﬁcation of preterm infants may enable us to reduce 
the number of screening echocardiograms performed. Biochem- 
ical markers may complement echocardiographic PH screening. 
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is a potential biochem- 
ical marker that is used clinically for monitoring patients with PH. 


Recently, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was found to 
be consistently elevated 41000 pg ml − 1 in preterm infants with 
BPD and PH at 36 to 38 weeks' CGA, when compared with 
controls.30 If 
those results are validated in a larger study, 
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide may replace echocardio- 
graphy as the primary screening method for infants deemed to be 
at low risk for PH. 
Prematurely born infants have a higher prevalence of con- 
genital heart disease.31 In our investigation, infants with BPD and 
PH at the time of the screening echocardiogram were signiﬁcantly 
more likely to have an ASD. It has been suggested that increased 
pulmonary blood ﬂow may further enhance the pulmonary 
vascular remodeling already induced by other factors and result 
in pulmonary vascular disease.32 Early ASD closure during infancy 
with symptomatic improvement has been reported, and should be 
considered in preterm infants with BPD and PH.33 
Our overall mortality rate for infants with PH was 12%, which is 
at the lower end of published associated mortality rates of 10 to 
38%.3,5,9,10,21 Length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation 
and discharge or transfer on oxygen did not differ between infants 
with and without PH in our cohort. Prior investigations have 
reported conﬂicting data regarding differences in these outcomes 
between infants with and without PH.3,5,9,21 In our NICU, once 
PH was identiﬁed medical management was altered to avoid 
hypercarbia and to allow for higher oxygen saturations.

initiated. Overall, only a small number of infants received PH- 
speciﬁc therapy. Prospective screening for PH in at-risk infants 
allowed us to adjust medical management in an effort to optimize 
cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. We speculate that early recog- 
nition of PH may improve outcome. 

The strengths of this study are the prospective design of our 
screening program, and the interpretation of echocardiograms by 
a single reader (CGW) who was blinded to the patient’s clinical 
including the 
status. This study also has several 
possibility of a type II error given the relatively small number of 
infants with PH, especially in the NoBPD group. Infants without 
BPD who had a BW 4750 g were only screened for PH at 36 to 
38 weeks' CGA if there was a clinical concern allowing for selection 
bias. Further, follow-up echocardiograms to evaluate for new or 
persistent PH beyond 36 weeks’ PMA were performed at variable 
time points, but usually at ~ 1 year of age if no clinical concerns 
existed to warrant sooner evaluation. EKG as a screening test was 
not part of 
the gold 
standard for diagnosing PH is cardiac catheterization, an invasive 
test that was only performed in selected patients with echocar- 
diograms suggesting signiﬁcant PH at more than one time point. 
Last, given the highly variable prevalence of prematurity-related 
comorbidities and respiratory management, our ﬁndings may 
not be generalizable and should be evaluated in a larger 
multicenter study. 


In a cohort of premature infants with BPD and after controlling for 
GA and BW, NEC, severe IVH, the presence of an ASD and mortality 
were identiﬁed as independent factors associated with PH at 36 to 
38 weeks' CGA. NEC was the only factor associated with PH in 
preterm infants without BPD. The variability in reported risk factors 
for PH in premature infants underscores the complexity of this 
disease process in this population. Our 
results need to be 
validated in a larger multicenter study to suggest an echocardio- 
graphic PH screening algorithm for preterm infants that can be 
applied across multiple institutions. A better understanding of 
demographic and risk factors associated with PH may reduce the
