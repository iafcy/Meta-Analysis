WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Pulmonary hypertension is 
associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely low 
birth weight infants and contributes to morbidity and mortality. 
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Pulmonary hypertension affects at least 
1 in 6 extremely low birth weight infants and persists to 
discharge in most survivors. Routine screening of these infants 
with echocardiography at 4 weeks of age identiﬁes only one-third 
of those affected.

OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary hypertension is associated with bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants and contrib- 
utes to morbidity and mortality. The objective was to determine the 
prevalence of pulmonary hypertension among ELBW infants by screen- 
ing echocardiography and evaluate subsequent outcomes. 
METHODS: All ELBW infants admitted to a regional perinatal center 
were evaluated for pulmonary hypertension with echocardiography 
at 4 weeks of age and subsequently if clinical signs suggestive of 
right-sided heart failure or severe lung disease were evident. Man- 
agement was at discretion of the clinician, and infants were evaluated 
until discharge from the hospital or pre-discharge death occurred. 
RESULTS: One hundred forty-ﬁve ELBW infants (birth weight: 755 6 144 
g; median gestational age: 26 weeks [interquartile range: 24–27]) 
were screened from December 2008 to February 2011. Overall, 26 
(17.9%) were diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at any time 
during hospitalization (birth weight: 665 6 140 g; median 
gestational age: 26 weeks [interquartile range: 24–27]): 9 (6.2%) by 
initial screening (early pulmonary hypertension) and 17 (11.7%) who 
were identiﬁed later (late pulmonary hypertension). 
Infants with 
to receive oxygen 
pulmonary hypertension were more likely 
treatment on day 28 compared with those without pulmonary 
hypertension (96% vs 75%, P , .05). Of the 26 infants, 3 died (all 
in the late group because of cor pulmonale) before being discharged 
from the hospital. 
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension is relatively common, affect- 
ing at least 1 in 6 ELBW infants, and persists to discharge in most sur- 
vivors. Routine screening of ELBW infants with echocardiography at 4 
weeks of age identiﬁes only one-third of the infants diagnosed with 
pulmonary hypertension. Further research is required to determine 
optimal detection and intervention strategies. Pediatrics 2012;129:

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) 
continues to be a major cause of mor- 
bidity and late mortality in extremely 
preterm infants.1 Pulmonary hyperten- 
sion is a cardiovascular complication 
that is associated with increased mor- 
bidity and mortality in infants with BPD.2 
,3 Reduction of cross-sectional perfusion 
area and abnormal muscularization of 
peripheral pulmonary vessels are im- 
portant in the pathogenesis of pul- 
monary hypertension in BPD,4 and 
abnormal vascular development also 
may contribute to the development 
of BPD.5,6 Previous studies from the 
presurfactant era7,8 and more recent 
studies9,10 have used retrospective 
designs, which make it difﬁcult to de- 
termine the prevalence and outcomes 
of pulmonary hypertension in BPD. 
There are no clear guidelines for as- 
sessment and monitoring, and case 
series and cross- sectional studies may 
identify only infants with more severe 
BPD and pulmonary hypertension,11 
because pulmonary hypertension may 
be silent initially and become evident 
only after the onset of right-sided 
heart failure. After the diagnosis of 
right-sided heart failure in a series of 
infants, 
routine echocardiographic 
screening of extremely low birth 
weight (ELBW) infants and tracking of 
subsequent outcome were implemen- 
ted in our neonatal intensive care unit 
to determine if we could diagnose and 
manage pulmonary hypertension be- 
fore it became severe and possibly 
irreversible. We hypothesized that 
routine screening of extremely pre- 
mature infants would lead to diag- 
nosis of pulmonary hypertension in 
infants without overt signs and 
this 
determine the prevalence of 
complication. 

Over a 2-year period (December 2008– 
February 2011), ELBW infants (birth 
weight #1000 g) who survived to 28 
days of age at the NICU of the University 
of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital 
were evaluated soon thereafter (be- 
fore 6 weeks of age) with echocardi- 
ography to determine the presence or 
absence of pulmonary hypertension. 
Infants with structural heart disease 
other than persistent ductus arterio- 
sus or patent foramen ovale and those 
with multiple congenital anomalies

screened but 
transferred to other 
hospitals before 36 weeks’ corrected 
postmenstrual age (PMA) also were 
excluded, because outcomes by dis- 
charge were not always available. 
Subsequent echocardiography was done 
if severe lung disease or clinical signs 
suggestive of right-sided heart failure 
were present. Publication of this study 
was approved by the University of Ala- 
bama at Birmingham institutional re- 
view board, with waiver of informed 
consent. 
Infants were diagnosed with pulmonary 
hypertension if at least 1 of the fol- 
lowing echocardiographic ﬁndings was 
present: (1) right ventricular hyper- 
trophy, (2) ﬂattening of interventricular 
septum, (3) presence of tricuspid re- 
gurgitation in the absence of pulmonary 
stenosis, and (4) elevated right ventric- 
ular pressures as estimated by Doppler 
studies of tricuspid regurgitation jet. 
Management of pulmonary hyperten- 
sion was at the discretion of the clini- 
cian, and infants were managed to 
discharge from the hospital or death. 
We deﬁned early pulmonary hyper- 
tension as pulmonary hypertension 
detected during the initial screening. 
Late pulmonary hypertension was 
deﬁned as pulmonary hypertension 
diagnosed after a negative initial screen- 
ing (after 6 weeks of age). All infants 
diagnosed with pulmonary hyperten- 
sion had a predischarge echocar- 
diogram. All echocardiograms were 
interpreted and reported by pediatric 
cardiologists. 
Patient characteristics and outcomes 
were collected prospectively until death 
or discharge (Tables 1 and 2). BPD was 
diagnosed and graded at 36 weeks’ 
PMA12 with the physiologic deﬁnition 
used for oxygen requirement.13 Pul- 
monary hypertension was considered 
to be treated if supplemental oxygen 
with higher oxygen targets, sildenaﬁl, 
inhaled nitric oxide, bosentan, and/or 
intravenous prostacyclin was used. 
Pulmonary hypertension was consid- 
ered to be persistent if the predis- 
charge echocardiogram showed any 
evidence of pulmonary hypertension. 
Pulmonary hypertension was consid- 
ered to have resolved if the last 
echocardiogram before discharge 
showed no evidence of pulmonary 
hypertension. Baseline characteristics 
and outcomes were compared between 
infants who developed pulmonary hy- 
pertension and those who did not.

Descriptive statistics were used to 
evaluate the study population. Contin- 
uous variables were compared by using 
either the t test or the Wilcoxon rank 
test/Mann–Whitney U test for normal 
or skewed distributions, respectively. 
Proportions were compared by x2 
/Fisher’s exact test. Risk factors were 
evaluated by odds ratios and conﬁ- 
dence intervals by using contingency 
tables. Adjusted odd ratios were deter- 
mined by multiple logistic regression, 
to control for possible confounding 
effects of other variables. In the multi- 
variable model, pulmonary hyperten- 
sion at or after initial screening was 
considered the dependent variable, 
and risk factors signiﬁcant at an a 
cutoff of P , .20 were analyzed as 
independent variables. All data were 
analyzed with SPSS 17.0 for Windows 
IL). All statistical 
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, 


tests were 2-tailed, and P values , .05 
were considered statistically signiﬁ- 
cant. 

During the study period, 172 ELBW 
infants who survived to postnatal day 28 
were evaluated for echocardiographic 
screening. Twenty-one infants were 
excluded because of congenital heart 
disease or other anomalies, and 6 were 
excluded because of transfer to another 
facility (Fig 1). The remaining 145 in- 
fants had an echocardiogram at 4 to 6 
weeks of age. The characteristics of this 
study population are shown in Table 1. 
Overall, 26 (17.9%) were diagnosed with 
pulmonary hypertension by at least 1 
echocardiogram at any time during 
hospitalization: 9 (6.2%) were identiﬁed 
by initial screening (early pulmonary 
hypertension), and 17 (11.7%) were 
identiﬁed later (late pulmonary hyper- 
tension) (Fig 1). The differences in 
characteristics between the infants 
with and without pulmonary hyper- 
tension are shown in Table 2. In brief, 
infants with pulmonary hypertension 
had lower birth weight but similar 
gestational age, which was consistent 
with the observation that more infants 
with pulmonary hypertension were 
identiﬁed as “small 
for gestational 
age.” Infants with pulmonary hyper- 
tension received higher concentrations 
of oxygen (P , .01) and were more 
frequently (P = .06) on mechanical 
ventilation on postnatal day 28 (Table 2). 
One of 31 infants on room air at post- 
natal day 28 was diagnosed with 
early pulmonary hypertension. None of 
the infants on room air on day 28 were 
later diagnosed with pulmonary hy- 
pertension. Of 75 infants who were 
receiving neither continuous positive 
airway pressure nor intermittent man- 
datory ventilation (IMV) on postnatal 
day 28, 10 infants (13.3%) developed 
pulmonary hypertension. At 36 weeks’ 
PMA, 
infants with pulmonary hyper- 
tension were more likely to be on ox- 
ygen supplementation or mechanical 
ventilation and to be diagnosed with 
moderate or severe BPD. Four of 9 
infants with early pulmonary hyper- 
tension and 12 of 17 infants with late 
pulmonary hypertension were classi- 
ﬁed as having severe BPD. Mortality 
and length of stay also were increased 
in infants with pulmonary hyperten- 
sion (Table 2). The multivariable logis- 
tic regression model identiﬁed lower 
birth weight as being associated with 
pulmonary hypertension after adjust- 
ment for the other variables (gesta- 
tional age, male gender, 
fraction of 
inspired oxygen on day 28, and IMV on 
day 28) included in the model (Table 3). 
Details of the management of pulmo- 
nary hypertension are shown in Table 4, 
Table 5, and Fig 1. Respiratory support

on postnatal day 28 was similar 
between early and late pulmonary 
hypertension groups (Table 4). No sig- 
niﬁcant difference was noted between 
management of early or late pulmonary 
hypertension, although the limitations 
of small sample size and low power 
must be considered. Clinical practice 
generally involved sequential or additive 
use of higher oxygen saturation limits 
(91%–95% vs 85%–95%), 
inhaled 
nitric oxide, sildenaﬁl, bosentan, and 
epoprostenol (prostacyclin or Flolan) 
(Tables 4 and 5). Eight of the 9 infants 
diagnosed with early pulmonary hyper- 
tension were managed with supple- 
mental oxygen: 1 infant with pulse 
oximeter oxygen saturation.90% on 
room air did not receive any additional 
therapy, and pulmonary hypertension 
had resolved by the time this infant was 
discharged from the hospital. Of the 26 
infants with pulmonary hypertension, 3 
died in the late pulmonary hyperten- 
sion group because of right ventricular 
failure (cor pulmonale). The median 
age at pulmonary hypertension di- 
agnosis was 31 days (interquartile 
range: 29–41) in the early pulmonary 
hypertension group and 112 days 
(interquartile range: 93–122) in the 
late pulmonary hypertension group 
(P , .01). Fifteen infants had persis- 
tence of pulmonary hypertension at 
time of discharge (5 of 9 with early 
pulmonary hypertension, 10 of 17 with 
late pulmonary hypertension). Three of 
the 5 infants with persistent pulmonary 
hypertension in the early pulmonary 
hypertension group and 8 of the 10 
infants with persistent pulmonary hy- 
pertension in the late pulmonary hy- 
pertension group were discharged 
from the hospital on oxygen therapy. 
Ten infants also received home medi- 
cation at the discretion of the treating 
clinician, mainly from the late pulmo- 
nary hypertension group (8 of 10). Two 
of 4 infants with resolved pulmonary 
hypertension in the early pulmonary 
hypertension group and 2 of 4 infants 
with resolved pulmonary hypertension 
in the late group were discharged on 
supplemental oxygen therapy for BPD. 

The major ﬁndings of our study are that 
18% or ∼1 in 6 extremely premature 
infants develop pulmonary hyperten- 
sion. Preterm infants with growth re- 
striction and higher oxygen requirements 
at 4 weeks of age and those with se- 
vere BPD were at higher risk for the 
development of pulmonary hyperten- 
sion. Prospective screening by echo- 
cardiography at 4 to 6 weeks of age 
identiﬁed only one-third of the ELBW 
infants who developed pulmonary

lung disease is unknown because it is 
not routinely assessed,11 and case se- 
ries and retrospective analyses may 
be biased toward identiﬁcation of pul- 
monary hypertension in more severe 
BPD.11 Limitations of our study include 
that although the initial echocardio- 
gram was performed as a screening 
echocardiography 
test, 
was done only at the discretion of the 
clinician, which may underestimate the 
true incidence of pulmonary hyper- 
tension because mild forms of late- 
onset pulmonary hypertension may 
have been missed. We also excluded 6 
infants who were transferred from our 
institution before 36 weeks’ PMA. Al- 
though these infants did not have early 
pulmonary hypertension on initial 
screening, it is possible they may have 
had late pulmonary hypertension. In- 
clusion of these 6 infants in the analy- 
sis does not noticeably change the 
incidence of early pulmonary hyper- 
tension (from 6.2% to 6.0%). Another 
limitation is that it may be difﬁcult to 
extrapolate ﬁndings from a single- 
center study to other neonatal inten- 
sive care units, because clinical prac- 
tices (eg, mechanical ventilation 
management, oxygen saturation tar- 
gets, and resuscitation practices of 
infants at the borderline of viability) 
may alter the incidence of pulmonary 
hypertension. A more subtle limitation 
is that although echocardiographic 
estimates of systolic pulmonary artery 
pressure are relatively sensitive in 
identiﬁcation of pulmonary hyperten- 
sion, the severity of pulmonary hyper- 
tension is difﬁcult to determine, and 
qualitative echocardiographic ﬁndings 
may be even less accurate.14 Because 
there 
this study was observational, 
was no attempt to regulate therapeu- 
tic interventions in infants diagnosed 
with pulmonary hypertension, and the 
sample size is too small to permit de- 
therapeutic effective- 
termination of 
ness of 
interventions.

design of a randomized controlled trial 
for the management of pulmonary hy- 
pertension in ELBW infants, however. 
We observed that 18% of ELBW infants 
developed pulmonary hypertension. 
Pulmonary hypertension persisted to 
time of discharge in most infants (58% of 
those with pulmonary hypertension), 
and the 3 infantswho died did so with cor 
pulmonale. The relatively high incidence 
ofpulmonaryhypertensionisconcerning, 
because this condition is more common 
than other well-known morbidities in 
this population, such as early-onset 
sepsis, periventricular leukomalacia, 
and necrotizing enterocolitis.1 An et al,9 
in a retrospective analysis of 116 pre- 
term infants with BPD, observed that 
25% had pulmonary hypertension (9.5% 
and 58.0% of infants with moderate and 
severe BPD, respectively) at a median 
postnatal age of 65 days, and that it was 
improved in 76% of infants after a me- 
dian of 85 days, whereas 14% of infants 
died. Slaughter et al,10 in a retrospective 
cohort study of 1156 ELBW infants, 
identiﬁed 216 infants with BPD who re- 
quired IMV, CPAP, or nasal cannula (ﬂow 
.2 liters per minute (LPM)) at the 
postnatal age of 28 days. Forty-one 
percent of these infants were evalu- 
ated with echocardiography, with 37% 
having evidence of pulmonary hyper- 
tension.10 Thirty-eight percent of the 29 
infants with pulmonary hypertension 
died, as compared with 14% of the 49 
infants without pulmonary hyperten- 
sion.10 Khemani et al15 studied 42 infants 
with BPD and pulmonary hypertension 
at a median age of 4.8 months and noted 
that 38% of these infants died during 
follow-up. Multivariate analysis indi- 
cated that severe pulmonary hyper- 
tension and being small for gestational 
age were associated with higher mor- 
tality15; however, it is difﬁcult to com- 
pare the results from these studies with 
our results, because they deal with se- 
lected populations of infants with BPD, 
only some of whom were evaluated by 
using echocardiography. Our results 
indicate that although a substantial 
number of infants who will develop pul- 
monary hypertension are identiﬁed by 4 
to 6 weeks of age, many infants who go 
on to develop pulmonary hypertension do 
so at 3 to 4 months of age, and repeat- 
ed evaluation with echocardiography 
may be necessary in infants at higher 
risk (higher oxygen requirement or 
severe BPD). The later detection of 
pulmonary hypertension in these 
infants may possibly be secondary to 
ongoing deterioration of lung function 
and vascular remodeling associated 
with intermittent or persistent episodes 
of hypoxemia.16–18 It is possible that in- 
tercurrent infections, such as urinary 
tract infections, may exacerbate or 
present as pulmonary hypertension in 
such infants, but because many sick 
infants in the intensive care unit have 
a ﬂuctuating course, it is difﬁcult to 
assign causality to changes over time 
in the clinical course. Alternatively, it is 
possible that infants with absence of 
a tricuspid regurgitation jet may not 
have had detection of elevated pulmo- 
nary pressures on the initial echocar- 
diogram.14 This pilot observational study 
does not have the statistical power to 
demonstrate that earlier detection of 
pulmonary hypertension (and earlier 
therapy) is associated with better out- 
comes, although it must be noted that 
all the infants who died were in the late 
pulmonary hypertension group. 



Preterm infants who were growth- 
restricted at birth were at greater 
risk for development of pulmonary hy- 
pertension. The increased risk may be 
possibly secondary to in utero inhibition 
of lung development caused by nutri- 
insufﬁciency, with 
tional or placental 
a reduction in cross-sectional vascular 
area, resulting in elevated pulmonary 
pressures and a greater probability of 
severe BPD due to pre-existing impaired 
development. It must be noted that al- 
most one-fourth of our evaluated infants 
were small for gestational age (SGA), 
which may have inﬂuenced the preva- 
lence of pulmonary hypertension. Acute 
episodes of pulmonary hypertension 
also have been reported in growth- 
restricted preterm infants soon after 
birth.19 As expected, infants with pul- 
monary hypertension were more likely 
to receive higher fraction of inspired 
oxygen at 4 weeks of age and have se- 
vere BPD at 36 weeks’ PMA. Although 
these variables identiﬁed infants at

higher risk, use of these risk factors 
as sole screening criteria would have 
led to a missed diagnosis in several 
infants. 
The optimal management of premature 
infants with pulmonary hypertension is 
not clear. Multiple therapies, including 
inhaled nitric oxide,20 sildenaﬁl,21,22 and 
endothelin blockers such as bosen- 
tan22 and epoprostenol23 have been 
evaluated only in retrospective studies 
that indicate preliminary efﬁcacy and 
possible safety for the management of 
pulmonary hypertension in premature 
infants with chronic lung disease. 
In 
our center, if pulmonary hypertension 
appeared to be resolved on subse- 
quent echocardiograms, we attempted 
to wean and discontinue the therapy 
before discharge. Our study provides 
data for the calculation of sample size 
and design of prospective randomized 
controlled trials to rigorously evalu- 
ate these unproven and sometimes 
expensive therapies for which the 
risk-beneﬁt ratio has not yet been 
determined. 

Pulmonary hypertension is a relatively 
common problem, affecting ∼1 in 6 
ELBW infants, and it persists to dis- 
charge in most affected infants. Rou- 
tine screening of ELBW infants with 
echocardiography at 4 to 6 weeks of 
age identiﬁes only one-third of these 
infants, so frequent follow-up evalua- 
tions may be required to determine 
later onset of pulmonary hyperten- 
sion. Further research is required to 
determine optimal detection and inter- 
vention strategies (eg, higher oxygen 
saturation targets, inhaled nitric oxide, 
and sildenaﬁl) and timing of treatment. 
The longer-term beneﬁts and risks of 
medications such as sildenaﬁl and 
bosentan in this population need to be 
evaluated.
