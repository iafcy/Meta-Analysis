Background: The incidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) 
has not been investigated in regional cohorts. The aim of this study was to clarify the incidence of PH associated 
with BPD in all very low birthweight infants (VLBWIs) born during the study period in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. 
Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of all VLBWIs born in Aichi Prefecture. The 
inclusion criteria were VLB, birth between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2015, and admission to any neonatal 
intensive care unit in Aichi Prefecture. BPD28d and BPD36w were defined as the need for supplemental oxygen or 
any respiratory support at 28 days of age or 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA). The primary outcome was the 
incidence of PH after 36 weeks’ PMA (PH36w) in VLBWIs with BPD28d and BPD36w. The secondary outcomes 
were the clinical factors related to PH36w in BPD36w patients. Mann–Whitney U-test and Fisher’s exact test were 
used for univariate analysis. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. Risk ratio (RR) and 
95% confidence interval (CI) were also evaluated. 
Results: A total of 441 patients were analyzed. A total of 217 and 131 patients met the definition of BPD28d and 
BPD36w, respectively. Nine patients were diagnosed with PH36w (4.2% and 6.9% of the BPD28d and BPD36w 
patients, respectively). The presence of oligohydramnios (RR, 2.71; 95% CI: 1.55–4.73, P = 0.014) and sepsis (RR, 
3.62; 95% CI: 1.51–8.63, P = 0.025) was significant in the PH36w patients. 
Conclusions: The incidence of PH36w was 4.2% and 6.9% in the BPD28d and BPD36w patients, respectively. 
Oligohydramnios and sepsis were significantly associated with PH36w in VLBWIs.

The mortality of very low birthweight infants (VLBWIs) has 
recently improved with the recent advances in intensive 
neonatal management.1,2 However, bronchopulmonary dys- 
plasia (BPD) remains one of the most severe problems for 
VLBWIs because it is associated with high mortality and neu- 
impairment.3–5 According to the Neonatal 
rodevelopmental 
Research Network of Japan (NRNJ) database, the incidence of 

BPD at 28 days of age in VLBWIs increased from 27.7% in 
2005 to 41.6% in 2014.6 In addition, pulmonary hypertension 
(PH) associated with BPD is considered important, because 
more severe preterm newborns have been saved by the recent 
advanced intensive neonatal management.7–9 There have been 
some studies about PH associated with BPD, but they were 
based on patient data from a single or small number of institu- 
tions.4,10–15 To determine the actual incidence of PH associ- 
ated with BPD in VLBWIs, a cohort survey is needed. 
In Aichi Prefecture, Japan, there are approximately 65 000 
births each year. Almost all VLBWIs born in Aichi Prefecture 
are hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of 
the Tokai Neo Forum, which includes all hospitals with 
NICUs in Aichi Prefecture. A cohort survey of VLBWIs with 
BPD admitted to NICUs in the Tokai Neo Forum might con- 
tribute to our knowledge of the incidence of PH associated 
with BPD in more detail. By understanding the background of 
PH associated with BPD in detail, an appropriate management 
strategy to prevent 
it might be established. Thus, we con- 
ducted this study to clarify the incidence of PH associated 
with BPD in all VLBWIs born during the study period in 
Aichi Prefecture. 

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of all 
VLBWIs born in Aichi Prefecture. The inclusion criteria of 
this study consisted of VLB, birth between 1 January 2015 
and 31 December 2015, and admission to NICUs of the Tokai 
Neo Forum. To exclude factors other than BPD that could 
affect PH, we excluded VLBWIs with obvious chromosomal 
or other congenital anomalies. 
In the survey we investigated gestational age (GA) in 
weeks and days, birthweight (BW) in grams, sex, small for 
gestational age (SGA; defined as birthweight below the 10th 
percentile for GA in the Japanese population),16 oligohydram- 
nios, preterm rupture of membranes (PROM), prenatal mater- 
intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), IVH grade 
nal steroids, 
≥3,17 periventricular 
leukomalacia (PVL),18 retinopathy of 
prematurity (ROP) stage ≥3,19 auditory screening test failure, 
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),20 survival at 28 days of age, 
and BPD28d (defined as the requirement of oxygen or respira- 
including nasal high-flow therapy 
tory supportive therapy, 
[NHF], at 28 days of age), for each VLBWI. If BPD28d was 
present we investigated serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M level 
(mg/dL) at admission, clinical or histological chorioamnionitis 
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 
(cCAM or hCAM), 
pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage, sepsis, Japanese BPD 
classification based on the presence or absence of RDS, 
intrauterine infection/inflammation, and chest X-ray findings 
(Table 1),21,22 postmenstrual age (PMA) at 
termination of 
mechanical ventilation (MV) in weeks, PMA at termination of 
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or NHF in 
weeks, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) use up to 7 days after birth, 
indomethacin for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),

surgical treatment for PDA, BPD36w (defined as oxygen use 
or any respiratory supportive therapy, 
including NHF, at 
inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 
36 weeks’ PMA), 
36 weeks’ PMA, steroid therapy for BPD28d, respiratory care 
after discharge or at the investigation, and PH36w (defined as 
PH after 36 weeks’ PMA). We also queried which parameter 
was used for the echocardiographic diagnosis of PH. The 
queried parameters 
included tricuspid regurgitation (TR) 
velocity, systolic flattening of interventricular septum (IVS), 
ratio of acceleration time to ejection time (AT/ET) of pul- 
monary artery (PA) flow, right ventricular (RV) wall thickness 
and PH score. The PH score consists of seven items: ratio of 
the diameter of the aortic valve to the diameter of the PA 
valve, ratio of the diameter of the mitral valve to the diameter 
of the tricuspid valve, thickness of the RV anterior wall at 
end-diastole and at end-systole, ratio of the length of the left 
ventricular major axis to minor axis at end-systole on left 
ventricular short axis view, RV systolic time interval, and 
AT/ET of PA flow. Each item was scored from 0 to 2 and 
the total score of all items was evaluated. A total score of 0– 
1 was defined as no PH, a total score of 2–4 was defined as 
mild PH, a total score of 5–8 was defined as moderate PH, 
and a total score of ≥9 was defined as severe PH.23 Addition- 
ally, 
respiratory therapy and vasodilation agents used for 
PH36w were investigated. Oxygen therapy, MV and NIPPV 
or NHF were included as types of respiratory therapy. As 
vasodilation agents, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibi- 
tors (sildenafil and tadalafil), endothelin antagonists (bosentan, 
ambrisentan and macitentan), prostacyclin derivatives (epo- 
prostenol, beraprost and treprostinil), and iNO were investi- 
gated. 
The primary outcome measure of this study was the inci- 
dence of PH36w in VLBWIs with BPD28d and BPD36w. The 
secondary outcome measures were the clinical factors related 
to PH36w in BPD36w patients. To identify clinical factors 
predicting PH36w in BPD36w patients, we compared clinical 
factors in the PH36w and non-PH36w patients. All statistical 
analyses were performed with EZR version 1.31. Mann–Whit- 
ney U-test and Fisher’s exact test were used for univariate 
analysis. Logistic regression analysis was planned for multi- 
variate analysis. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval 
(CI) were also evaluated. Differences were considered statisti- 
cally significant at P < 0.05. 



8.634, P = 0.025) between the PH36w and non-PH36w 
patients. Multivariate analysis was not possible because of the 
small number of PH36w patients (Table 3). 

Survey responses were obtained from all 20 facilities in the 
Tokai Neo Forum. One institution had no admission of 
VLBWIs. From the 19 other institutions, 468 VLBWIs were 
included and 27 were excluded. The excluded patients con- 
sisted of one patient with atrial septal defect, one patient with 
ventricular septal defect, four patients lost to follow-up due to 
transfer 
to hospitals outside of Aichi Prefecture, and 21 
patients who died before the age of 28 days. Of the 441 
patients included in the analysis, 217 met the definition of 
BPD28d (49.2%: 95% CI: 44.4–54.0%). Of the 217 BPDd28 
patients, one died before 36 weeks’ PMA and 131 patients 
were classified as having BPD36w. Of the 131 BPD36w 
patients, nine patients were further classified as having 
PH36w. There were no PH36w patients in the group of 85 
patients who did not have BPD36w (Fig. 1). The characteris- 
tics of all 
included VLBWIs, BPD28d, non-BPD28d and 
BPD36w patients are listed in Table 2. 
Incidence of PH36w in VLBWIs, BPD28d and BPD36w 
patients 
The incidence of PH36w in VLBWIs, BPD28d patients (ex- 
cluding one patient who died before 36 weeks’ PMA), and 
BPD36w patients was 0.020 (95% CI: 0.009–0.038), 0.042 
(95% CI: 0.019–0.078) and 0.069 (95% CI: 0.032–0.126), 
respectively. 

On univariate analysis a significant difference was seen in the 
presence of oligohydramnios (RR 2.711; 95% CI: 1.554– 
4.731, P = 0.014) and sepsis (RR 3.615; 95% CI: 1.513– 
Comparison of characteristics between PH36w and non- 
PH36w patients 
The PMA at termination of MV was not significantly different 
between PH36w and non-PH36w patients, but the PMA at ter- 
mination of NIPPV or NHF was significantly longer 
in 
PH36w patients. The frequency of any grade of IVH, IVH 
grade ≥3, PVL and ROP stage ≥3 was not significantly differ- 
ent between the two groups of patients. The composite out- 
come of respiratory care at the investigation or death after 
36 weeks’ PMA was 
significantly more common in the 
PH36w patients (Table 3, P < 0.001). 

PH36w patients were reported from five institutes. PH was 
diagnosed on echocardiography in all cases (Table 4). The 
findings of TR velocity, systolic flattening of IVS and PH 
score were used in five of the nine PH36w patients for PH 
diagnosis. All patients with systolic flattening of IVS were 
given a pulmonary vasodilator. At the time of investigation, 
two patients died, four patients were receiving home oxygen 
therapy, one patient discharged without any home care and 
two patients continued hospitalization with NIPPV. 

This cohort survey is the first regional survey to include all 
VLBWIs during the survey period, allowing for estimation of 
the incidence of PH36w in VLBWIs with BPD28d and 
BPD36w. During the survey period, there were 65 615 births 
in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, of which 492 involved VLBWIs 
according to the vital statistics records of Aichi Prefecture.24

This study has some limitations. First, there was no stan- 
dardized protocol for screening echocardiography to identify 
PH associated with BPD, due to the retrospective nature of the 
study. The pediatric PH guidelines endorsed by the American 
Heart Association and American Thoracic Society recom- 
mending screening echocardiography for PH in premature 
infants with moderate to severe BPD were published in 2015. 
institutions included in this study did not have 
Almost all 
protocols to perform screening echocardiography for PH in 
BPD36w patients. Thus, mild PH in BPD36w patients might 
have been missed, leading to an underestimation of the inci- 
dence of PH36w in BPD36w patients. Altit et al. reported that 
only 38% of institutions had screening protocols for PH asso- 
ciated with BPD according to an electronic survey conducted 
in 2017.25 However, circulatory management strategies that 
included echocardiographic assessment were found to be com- 
monly used by Japanese neonatologists in a national survey 
about circulatory management for extremely low birthweight 
infants in 2011. That study showed that echocardiography was 
in all NICUs.26 Thus, because 
performed by neonatologist 
echocardiographic assessment has been shown to be common 
in the NICUs, we assumed that evaluation for PH was per- 
formed in all units in this study when physicians in the

institutions considered that a close examination of PH was 
necessary. 
Second, there was no standardized protocol to clarify BPD 
severity in this survey, such as the oxygen reduction test.27,28 
The definition of BPD36w in this study included any respira- 
tory supportive therapy at 36 weeks’ PMA. Respiratory ther- 
apy decisions were based on the judgment of each attending 
physician. However, changes in neonatal respiratory support 
such as mild respiratory care with NHF made many infants 
unclassifiable based on current BPD definitions.2,29,30 With 
that in mind, we believe that this study was able to evaluate 
the incidence of BPD as of 2015. 
Regarding the incidence of BPD28d and BPD36w in 
VLBWIs in this study, the incidence of BPD28d was slightly 
higher in this survey than that according to the NRNJ database 
in 20146 (49.2% vs 41.6%), but the incidence of BPD36w was 
similar (29.5% vs 29.6%). This means that the BPD severity 
in the present survey was similar to the BPD severity in the 
patients included in the NRNJ database. This survey may 
show the relationship between severe BPD and PH secondary 
to BPD in Japan. 
By contrast, the incidence of PH36w with BPD28d in this 
cohort of VLBWIs, 4.2%, was lower than the 21.7% reported by 
Sun et al. in a single-institution study with almost the same 
inclusion criteria.13 Similarly, Sheth et al. reported that the inci- 
dence of PH associated with BPD was 26.8% in patients with 
GA <32 weeks at birth and BW <1,500 g in a single-institution 
study.8 The definition of BPD36w in the present study was 
almost the same as the definition of moderate to severe BPD 
used by the National Institute of Child Health and Human

Development in 2001.31 The incidence of PH36w associated 
with BPD36w, defined as moderate to severe BPD in the present 
cohort, was 6.9% and lower than the previously reported 
incidence from several single-institution studies (22.0%,14 
27.6%10 and 28.3%7) in which inclusion criteria included GA 
<28 weeks, <32 weeks, and <29 weeks, respectively. If the 

present patients were limited to those with GA <28 weeks, there 
would have been 88 BPD36w patients and eight PH36w 
patients, and the incidence of PH associated with moderate to 
severe BPD would still have been low, at 9.1% in this setting. 
One of the factors that led to a low incidence of PH36w 
with BPD36w in this study is the Japanese respiratory strat- 
egy, which tolerates relatively high oxygen saturation (SpO2) 
levels. A 2015 national survey of BPD management in Japan 
found that 54% of units set the upper SpO2 limit at 95% or 
more after BPD is diagnosed.6 This might have been due to 
the fact that low SpO2 levels have been shown to be associ- 
ated with high mortality rates and respiratory complications 
such as PH.30,31 As already noted, there was no standardized 
protocol to screen for PH associated with BPD with echocar- 
diography in this study. Thus, our study might have over- 
looked mild PH and included only moderate to severe 
symptomatic PH associated with BPD in the estimation. Du 
et al. reported that the number of patients with mild PH was 
threefold higher than the number of patients with moderate to 
severe PH in their study.12 They also noted that patients with 
moderate to severe PH accounted for an estimated 5.9% of all 
patients, similar to the present results. 

With regard to the clinical factors associated with PH36w 
in BPD36w patients, oligohydramnios and sepsis were found 
to be significant in the present study. Oligohydramnios has 
been reported as a significant risk factor for PH associated 
with BPD because of its inhibitive effect on lung develop- 
ment.32 It is considered that the hypoplastic lung may have 
elevated pulmonary vascular resistance due to maldevelopment 
including a decrease in the cross-sectional area and abnormal 
muscularization of the pulmonary vasculature.33–35 In contrast, 
An et al. 
infection during hospitalization is 
related to PH associated with BPD.4 In BPD, structural abnor- 
malities of the pulmonary vasculature might cause vessel nar- 
rowing 
compliance. Decreased 
vascular 
angiogenesis as a consequence of BPD might contribute to the 
smaller vascular cross-sectional area. These factors contribute 
to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. In addition, pul- 
monary vasculogenesis has been shown to be disturbed in a 
postnatal sepsis model.36–41 Although SGA has been found to 
be related to PH associated with BPD32, a significant associa- 
tion with SGA was not found in the present study. As men- 
tioned earlier, it is possible that cases of mild PH might have 
been overlooked in the present study. In addition, we were not 
able to perform multivariate analysis because there were too 
few PH36w patients. 


In conclusion, the incidence of PH36w was 4.2% and 6.9% 
in VLBWIs with BPD28d and BPD36w, respectively, and the 
presence of oligohydramnios and sepsis was significant 
in 
BPD36w patients with PH36w. This study evaluated the 
prevalence of PH36w associated with BPD36w in a regional 
birth cohort without a definitive PH screening protocol. The 
prevalence of PH36w associated with BPD36w in this study 
the prevalence of moderate to severe PH. 
might 
reflect 
studies with more subjects and an 
Although additional 

established protocol for PH screening are warranted, the pre- 
sent findings imply that VLBWIs with BPD36w, especially 
when combined with oligohydramnios and sepsis, might need 
screening for PH.
