Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease 
of infancy, impacts the pulmonary and overall health and 
development of thousands of infants each year.1 It is one of 
the most common complications of extreme preterm birth 
and results in signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality in 
infants.2–5 Risk factors 
extremely low birth weight 
associated with the development of severe BPD includes 
lower gestational ages (GAs) and birth weights.6 Previous 
studies have suggested that 
infants with BPD are at 
increased risk for developing cardiovascular complications 
including pulmonary hypertension (PH), cor pulmonale, 
and death.7–10

Objective Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) increases the risk for developing pul- 
monary hypertension (PH). However, the risk factors associated with BPD-associated PH 
remain unclear. Our primary aim was to determine perinatal risk factors associated with 
the development of PH in infants with BPD. 
Study Design We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 303 infants born at (cid:3) 28 
weeks’ gestation. Infants were categorized as having no, mild, moderate, or severe BPD. 
PH was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test, two- 
sample t-test, and multivariable logistic regression. 
Results The incidence of PH in our cohort was 12%. Infants with PH had lower birth 
weights and gestational ages (p < 0.001). After controlling for confounding variables, 
severe BPD (p < 0.001), and higher Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) scores 
(p ¼ 0.04) were associated with the development of PH. 
Conclusion Severe BPD increases the risk for developing PH. Higher CRIB scores 
correlate with PH development in infants with BPD. We speculate that CRIB scores 
may allow for early categorization of preterm infants with a higher likelihood of 
developing PH. 


There is a paucity of information about the risk factors, 
pathogenesis, and natural history of BPD-associated PH. 
Although vascular remodeling, increased vasomotor tone, 
and reduced alveolar capillary coupling have been implicated 
in the pathogenesis of PH, the precise mechanism by which 
BPD-associated PH develops 
remains poorly elucidat- 
ed.8,9,11,12 Infants with severe BPD appear to be at highest 
risk for developing PH suggesting that higher inspired oxygen 
concentrations and inﬂammation may play a role in its 
pathogenesis.1,13–15 Other proposed mechanisms for BPD- 
associated PH include growth restriction, exposure to certain 
drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
genetic predisposition, and cardiovascular shunts.11,16,17 Re- 
cently, elevated maternal α-fetoprotein (AFP) and human 
chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), as well as decreased unconju- 
gated estriol (uE3) have been shown to be associated with an 
increased risk of developing BPD suggesting that a prenatal 
predisposition for BPD may exist.18 
At present, there is no consensus on the deﬁnition, screen- 
ing, or management of clinically signiﬁcant PH in extremely 
preterm infants.19 Although cardiac catheterization is the gold 
standard for diagnosing PH,10 it is often avoided in fragile 
premature infants as it is an invasive procedure. PH deﬁnitions 
range widely from the isolated right ventricular hypertrophy 
(RVH) to more stringent criteria of elevated tricuspid regurgi- 
tation jet and ventricular septal ﬂattening in addition to 
RVH.11,20,21 Routine screening for BPD-associated PH has not 
been universally adopted because of questions regarding the 
optimal timing for screening. In a recent study of extremely 
low birth weight infants, BPD-associated PH was seen in 6% of 
infants at 4 weeks of life; an additional 12% of patients were 
diagnosed with PH beyond 4 weeks of life.22 
In this study, we examined the maternal and neonatal 
characteristics of infants born at (cid:3) 28 weeks’ GA admitted to 
the intensive care nursery at the Children’s Hospital at 
Monteﬁore, Weiler Division, between 2006 and 2012, who 
developed BPD-associated PH. Our objective was to identify 
maternal and neonatal risk factors associated with the devel- 
opment of PH in extremely premature infants. In this study of 
infants born at (cid:3) 28 weeks’ gestation with a screening 
echocardiogram obtained at or after 36 weeks’ corrected 
GA, we hypothesized that infants with severe BPD were at 
the highest risk for developing PH and that certain targeted 
neonatal characteristics would help to better identify pre- 
term infants with evolving chronic lung disease who would 
beneﬁt from routine, and possibly earlier, screening for PH. 
(4) presence of any congenital conditions that would pre- 
dispose the infant to developing PH or worsen preexisting 
PH such as congenital heart disease and diaphragmatic 
hernia. During the study period, screening echocardio- 
grams to diagnose BPD-associated PH were performed at 
the discretion of the attending neonatologist. Therefore, all 
infants born at less than 28 weeks’ gestation did not have 
PH screening. 
Baseline maternal and neonatal demographic information 
were obtained from our database and chart review. Maternal 
characteristics analyzed included age, quad screen results 
(AFP, HCG, estriol, and inhibin), antenatal steroid administra- 
tion, and the presence or absence of obesity, diabetes, hyper- 
tension, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, preterm premature 
rupture of membranes (PPROM), depression requiring medi- 
cation, and toxic habits (tobacco, alcohol, and/or illicit drug 
use). Neonatal characteristics recorded included GA, birth 
weight (BW), gender, race, small for GA (SGA) status, and 
Apgar score (cid:3) 5 at 5 minutes of life. Additional neonatal 
characteristics analyzed were Clinical Risk Index for Babies 
(CRIB) scores as an indicator of illness severity in the ﬁrst 12 
hours of life; the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 
with or without the need for surgical ligation, retinopathy of 
prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and gas- 
trointestinal perforation; severity of intraventricular hemor- 
rhage (IVH); and average ﬂuid intake over the ﬁrst 2 weeks of 
life. For each patient, the presence or absence of BPD was 
noted. Each infant was then categorized by severity of BPD 
based on validated NICHD criteria. The four groups included 
no BPD, mild BPD (oxygen requirement at 28 days of life), 
moderate BPD (FIO2 of < 30% at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual 
age), and severe BPD (FIO2 (cid:4) 30% or need for continuous 
positive airway pressure, high ﬂow nasal cannula, or ventila- 
tor support at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age).23 
The primary outcome measure was development of PH in 
preterm infants born at (cid:3) 28 weeks’ gestation. The deﬁnition 
of PH was met if a patient had elevated right ventricular 
pressures on echocardiogram, deﬁned as the presence of two 
or more of the following criteria: RV pressure greater than 
25 mm Hg in the presence of a tricuspid regurgitation jet, 
right ventricular hypertrophy, and intraventricular septal 
ﬂattening.24–26 Patients were included only if an echocardio- 
gram was obtained at 36 weeks’ corrected GA or greater, at 
which time physiologic postnatal PH should no longer be 
evident and moderate or severe BPD can be diagnosed. 


This is an observational, retrospective cohort study of all 
the infants with GA (cid:3) 28 weeks’ who were admitted to the 
neonatal intensive care unit at the Children’s Hospital at 
Monteﬁore, Weiler Division, from 2006 to 2012. Eligible 
infants were identiﬁed from our comprehensive neonatal 
database. Infants were excluded from the study if they met 
the following criteria: (1) death within 28 days of birth, (2) 
transfer to an outside hospital within the ﬁrst week of life, 
(3) echo not obtained at or after 36 weeks’ corrected GA, or 
The p values for comparison across PH and non-PH patients 
were tabulated by Fisher exact test for categorical variables 
and by two-sample t-test for continuous variables. Multivari- 
able logistic regression was utilized to assess the independent 
effects of the various risk factors for PH and to control for 
potential confounders. The predictor variables included in the 
model were severity of BPD, CRIB scores, PDA, PDA ligation, 
severity of ROP, GA, BW, and maternal age. Statistical signiﬁ- 
cance was considered at p < 0.05. All analyses were per- 
formed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 





The Children’s Hospital at Monteﬁore treats patients in a large 
urban area with a diverse population. A total of 351 infants 
were screened for the study of which 303 infants met inclu- 
sion criteria. Overall, 48 infants (14%) were excluded—6 
infants (2%) secondary to death before 28 days of life and 
42 infants (12%) because of lack of echocardiogram results at 
or after 36 weeks’ corrected GA (►Fig. 1). Of the 303 infants 
studied, the incidence of PH was 12% (►Table 1). The overall 
incidence of BPD of any severity was 89% (270/303) with 37% 
(112/303) of infants categorized as having severe BPD. Infants 
with PH had lower BW (p < 0.001) and lower GA (p < 0.001) 
(►Table 1). Although there was a trend toward an increase in 
PH in SGA infants, this was not statistically signiﬁcant 
(p ¼ 0.09; ►Table 1). 
To understand how maternal health may impact the 
development of PH in extremely preterm infants, we exam- 
ined the presence of maternal comorbidities and the subse- 
quent development of PH in preterm infants. Maternal 
morbidities such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
preeclampsia, and chorioamnionitis were not associated with 
PH development as indicated in ►Table 2. Of note, unlike 
previous reports, we did not observe an association between 
maternal use of SSRI’s for depression and the development of 
PH in our cohort of patients. However, only four patients in 
our cohort reported a history of taking SSRIs for depression 
(►Table 2). No relationship was demonstrated between quad 
screen results and the development of BPD or PH. 
Because pulmonary disease is associated with the devel- 
opment of PH, we evaluated the relationship between BPD 
severity and PH. Severe BPD was positively associated with 
the development of PH (►Table 3). BPD-associated PH was 
diagnosed at a median age of 96 days (range, 66–179 days). To 
better understand the relationship between illness severity 
and the development of PH, we assessed the relationship 
between CRIB scores, a marker of illness severity within the 
ﬁrst 12 hours of life,27 and PH. Elevated CRIB scores were 
noted to be signiﬁcantly associated with the subsequent 
development of PH (p < 0.001; ►Table 3). There was no 
association between the degree of elevation of CRIB scores 
and the timing of the diagnosis of PH. Interestingly, other 
neonatal morbidities including NEC, gastrointestinal perfora- 
tion, and severity of IVH were not associated with the 
development of PH in our cohort. 
A multivariable logistic regression model was used to 
assess the independent effects of the various risk factors for 
PH and to control for potential confounders. In this model, 
severe BPD and higher CRIB scores remained signiﬁcantly 
associated with PH development (►Table 4). The odds of 
developing PH were 4.7-fold higher in infants with severe BPD 
compared with those without (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 4.74; 95% 
conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.68–13.4). 


In this single center, retrospective review of extremely pre- 
term infants, we observed that the development of PH was 
associated with severe BPD and neonatal disease severity as 
measured by CRIB scores. Previously published studies of 
infants with BPD describes an incidence of PH ranging from 
17.9 to 43%.13,28 In comparison, we found a PH incidence of 
12% in our study cohort. This lower incidence may be related, 
at least in part, to our more stringent criteria for diagnosing 
PH in the study patients. In this study, infants had to meet two 
or more echocardiographic criteria to be diagnosed with PH 
whereas other studies required only one echocardiographic 
ﬁnding.13,22 The median age at diagnosis of PH was 96 days of 
life (range, 66–179 days) suggesting that it may take a few 
weeks to months for echocardiographic evidence of PH to 
manifest in the presence of signiﬁcant lung disease. 
Infants with severe BPD were at higher risk for developing 
PH than infants with no BPD or BPD of lesser severity. 
Although 26% of patients with severe BPD developed PH, a 
few patients with mild and moderate BPD also developed PH 
(6 and 3%, respectively). This is likely related to the fact that 
the development of PH is a multifactorial process. Infants with 
the most signiﬁcant lung disease may be impacted for several

may be further impaired by the severity of the infant’s illness 
and comorbid conditions.12 Alternatively, more severe post- 
natal lung disease may lead to PH. Abnormal gas exchange 
and increased pulmonary arterial pressure in the lungs may 
lead to pulmonary artery hypertrophy, increased right-sided 
heart pressures, and ultimately PH.11,30 
Higher illness severity, as estimated by CRIB scores, was 
associated with an increased likelihood of PH development.

This is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate a relationship between 
early illness severity as characterized by CRIB scores and the 
development of PH in extremely premature neonates 
(►Table 4; 1.2-fold increased risk of developing PH in infants 
with higher CRIB scores; p ¼ 0.04). CRIB scores are used as 
indicators of early illness severity and risk of mortality. They 
are compiled based on GA, BW, gender, admission tempera- 
ture, and greatest base deﬁcit in the ﬁrst 12 hours of life. One 
may hypothesize that, in addition to GA and BW, initial 
temperature abnormalities/instability and acidosis may con- 
tribute signiﬁcantly to long-term infant morbidity and mor- 
tality. A score of < 10 is generally considered to indicate a less 
sick infant, whereas scores > 15 are associated with in- 
creased mortality.31 As our non-PH group had a mean score 
of 10.7 versus the PH group with an average score of 13.3, one 
can envision how a CRIB score of greater than 11 may be used 
as an indicator for a higher likelihood of developing PH. CRIB 
scores have recently been shown to be superior to other 
illness severity scores including the Score for Neonatal Acute 
Physiology (SNAP)32; they have demonstrated a greater 
ability to discriminate illness severity, possess good predic- 
tive value, and are less time intensive to compile.33,34 SNAP 
scores have recently been reported to be associated with BPD 
or death. However, as CRIB scores are based on 5 parameters 
versus 28 parameters used in calculating SNAP scores, CRIB 
scores are more likely to be utilized in the clinical arena 
because of the ease of calculation.35 
On the basis of our ﬁndings of a positive correlation 
between CRIB scores and PH development, we propose that 
CRIB scores may be used as an early screening tool for 
future PH development as they can be calculated on the ﬁrst 
day of life. Currently, BPD is diagnosed after a chronological 
age of 28 days for mild BPD and 36 weeks’ postconceptual 
age for moderate-to-severe BPD. With the early identiﬁca- 
tion of preterm infants at the greatest risk of developing PH, 
targeted interventions can be provided earlier to the “at 
risk” population, thus improving short- and long-term 
health outcomes. 
Infants with growth restriction have previously been 
reported to be at risk for the development of both BPD and 
PH. Mechanisms for this association may be related to poor 
overall growth in these infants leading to incomplete alveo- 
larization and pulmonary vascular development. African 
American mothers, even after controlling for risk status, are 
2.6 times more likely to give birth to SGA infants compared 
with their White counterparts.16 Overall, 49% of our cohort 
was African American. However, we did not observe a signiﬁ- 
cant association between growth restriction and the devel- 
opment of PH (►Table 1; p ¼ 0.09). This may be related to the 
relatively small numbers of SGA infants in the study (49 SGA 
subjects, 22/49 African American); however, these ﬁndings 
warrant further exploration in a larger cohort. 
There are several limitations to our study. The retrospec- 
tive nature of this study may predispose our ﬁndings to being 
impacted by various confounders and bias. As this is a single 
center study, our patient population, primarily underserved 
and racially diverse, may not reﬂect the patient character- 
istics seen elsewhere. Although our sample size of 303 infants 
is robust, some of the trends that we observed may have 
achieved signiﬁcance if the sample size was larger. In addi- 
tion, the absence of a correlation between various prematu- 
rity-related comorbidities and BPD-associated PH may be 
related to the fact that the study was not powered to detect 
differences for these variables. Finally, during the study 
period, all infants born at less than 28 weeks’ gestation did 
not have screening echocardiograms to evaluate for BPD- 
associated PH. However, the eligible infants who did not have 
screening echocardiograms at 36 weeks’ corrected GA were 
low-risk infants with low CRIB scores for whom the attending 
neonatologist deemed screening for PH not of high utility. 
Thus, the exclusion of these infants should not affect the 
predictive value of the high CRIB score. At the conclusion of 
this study, we have since instituted standardized PH screen- 
ing guidelines in our unit. Our screening guidelines are 
indicated for infants born at < 30 weeks’ gestation or those 
infants diagnosed with BPD at 28 days of life. These infants 







have a screening echocardiogram at 6 weeks’ chronological 
age and if PH is diagnosed at this time, therapeutic measures 
such as adjusting respiratory support or oxygen saturation 
targets when appropriate, and institution of diuretic therapy 
are undertaken. Patients with diagnosed PH at 28 days of life 
are routinely screened with echocardiograms every 2 weeks, 
or earlier if clinically indicated. If PH is not diagnosed, then 
routine screening echocardiograms are obtained every 
4 weeks until the infant is in room air and PH is not present. 
In conclusion, after controlling for potential confounding 
factors, severe BPD and higher CRIB scores were associated 
with an increased likelihood of development of PH. We 
speculate that CRIB scores may represent a reliable and 
quantiﬁable screening tool for early identiﬁcation of infants 
most at risk of developing PH that may allow for possible 
interventions to prevent its development or progression.
