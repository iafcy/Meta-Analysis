OBJECTIVE: To assess whether mortality in patients with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, deﬁned as ⩾ 28 days of 
oxygen exposure with lung disease) is independently associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and surgery. 
STUDY DESIGN: Single institution retrospective birth cohort of preterm infants with gestational age (GA) 230/7 to 366/7 weeks, and 
evolving BPD delivered between 2001 and 2014. Surgery was classiﬁed as minor or major using published criteria. Mortality was 
analyzed by stepwise logistic regression analysis. 
RESULTS: Among 577 patients with evolving BPD, 33 (6%) died prior to discharge. Mortality decreased with GA (adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR): 0.69; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.55, 0.87), birth weight Z-score (aOR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.996) and increased with PAH 
(aOR: 30, 95% CI: 2.1, 415), major surgery (aOR; 2.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 6.3), and PAH and surgery (aOR: 10.3, 95% CI: 2.5, 42.1). 
CONCLUSION: Among preterm patients with evolving BPD, PAH and surgery are independently associated with mortality. 
INTRODUCTION 
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) contributes to signiﬁcant 
morbidity and mortality in preterm infants, impacting ~ 10 000– 
15 000 infants annually in the United States alone.1 Pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH), a cardiovascular complication of 
abnormal vascular growth, occurs in 25–38%2–6 of preterm infants 
with BPD and is associated with a four- to ﬁvefold increase in odds 
of mortality.3,7 
There are relatively few studies describing outcomes in patients 
with PAH who undergo surgery. In adults undergoing major joint 
replacement surgery, PAH is associated with a fourfold increase in 
mortality.8 For patients with PAH, there must be careful titration of 
anesthetic medications and maintenance of hemodynamic 
stability to prevent worsening of PAH in the perioperative 
period.9–12 A referral pulmonary hypertension program reported 
that among pediatric patients undergoing non-cardiac surgical 
procedures, 
the odds of major perioperative complications 
increased by a factor of 8 in association with baseline 
suprasystemic PAH.13 
Preterm infants are at increased risk of poor outcomes when 
major surgery is performed. Morriss et al. classiﬁed surgery into 
major surgery (presumed general anesthesia) and minor surgery 
(presumed non general anesthesia) in a cohort of very low birth 
weight infants in the National 
Institutes of Child Health and 
Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network. They 
found increased adjusted odds of death or neurodevelopmental 
impairment in all surgery patients and in the subgroup of major 
surgery patients, but not in the subgroup of minor surgery.14 
However, a retrospective series of 22 infants with severe BPD 
undergoing anti-gastroesophageal reﬂux surgery in a single center 
described that all of the patients survived the procedure; 18 of 
these patients had PAH.15 
Owing to the scarcity of data on mortality after surgery in 
preterm patients with BPD and PAH, we sought to assess whether 
mortality in patients with evolving BPD is 
independently 
associated with PAH and with surgery. 

Design 
This was a retrospective birth cohort study of preterm infants with 
gestational age (GA) 230/7 to 366/7 weeks and evolving BPD (deﬁned as 
⩾ 28 days of oxygen exposure with lung disease) delivered between 1 May 
2001 and 31 December 2014 at Parkland Memorial Hospital (PMH) in 
Dallas, TX, USA. We chose 1 May, 2001 as a starting date for this study, 
because 30 April, 2001 was our latest day of recruitment for the NICHD 
Preemie Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study, a trial that examined the effectiveness 
of 
inhaled nitric oxide as a therapy for severe respiratory failure in 
premature infants.16 This trial increased awareness of PAH and utilization 
of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment modality. The study was approved by 
the Institutional Review Board at University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center and a waiver of consent was granted.

Pulmonary hypertension and surgery in preterm Infants 
LB DeVries et al 

Study population 
The study population included all preterm infants with gestational age 
(GA) 230/7 to 366/7 weeks and evolving BPD. Exclusion criteria were: critical 
congenital heart disease,17 pulmonary vein stenosis diagnosed prior to the 
ﬁrst surgery, severe congenital anomalies and persistent pulmonary 
hypertension (PPHN). Patients with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), 
ventricular septal defect or atrial septal defect were not excluded from 
the study. Potential patients for this study were identiﬁed by searching the 
PMH prospective neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) database. 
Classiﬁcation 
Infants were classiﬁed into three groups on the basis of surgery after 
28 days: no surgery, minor surgery and major surgery, based on the most 
severe surgery, according to criteria published by Morriss et al.14 
Presence of PAH was assessed after 28 days of life for patients who did 
not have surgery, or within a perioperative window of 1 month prior to or 
2 weeks post surgery. To conﬁrm the diagnosis of PAH, available 
echocardiograms or echocardiogram reports were reviewed by a pediatric 
cardiologist (CR), who was unaware of the clinical condition. Patients were 
classiﬁed as: 

(a) Echocardiogram diagnosis based on the classiﬁcation deﬁned by 
Mourani et al.,18 in which PAH is deﬁned by any of the following: 
estimated right ventricular systolic pressure 440 mm Hg; ratio of 
right ventricular systolic pressure to systemic systolic blood 
pressure 40.5; any cardiac shunt with bidirectional or right-to-left 
ﬂow; any degree of ventricular septal wall ﬂattening; 
(b) Improvement of oxygen saturation by at least 30% with treatment 
inhaled nitric oxide, or 
(increased oxygen administration, 
vasodilators such as Sildenaﬁl or Bosentan). 

(a) Patients with clinical diagnosis or suspicion of PAH but not 
response to treatment as 
conﬁrmed by echocardiogram or 
described above; 


Variables 
The primary outcome variable was death prior to discharge from the initial 
irrespective of whether the infant was discharged from 
hospitalization, 
PMH or from the adjacent referral children’s hospital, Children’s Medical 
Center Dallas. 
Variables collected from the NICU database included: PAH, GA, birth 
weight, ethnicity, gender, 5-min Apgar score, administration of antenatal 
failure, administration of 
steroids before delivery, congestive heart 
indomethacin for PDA, administration of postnatal systemic steroids for 
treatment of BPD, culture proven sepsis, culture proven meningitis, 
necrotizing enterocolitis stage II or greater (NEC), seizures conﬁrmed by 
electroencephalogram, 
interventions and 
congenital malformations. 

Medical records were reviewed for all patients suspected of having PAH 
from the NICU database, to collect information on timing of diagnosis, to 
determine if temporal variables (that is, sepsis, meningitis, NEC, seizures) 
were present in the perioperative window described above, and to 
determine the type of anesthesia used for surgery. In addition, medical 
records were reviewed in all infants for whom malformation severity was 
not clearly deﬁned. 
Statistical analysis 
The primary outcome was assessed by stepwise logistic regression to 
adjust for confounding variables that were present at 28 days. To avoid 
collinearity with GA, birth weight was converted to birth weight Z-score for 
GA and gender (using tables from Olsen et al.19). Other analyses included 
χ2 analysis, Fisher’s exact test, Student’s t-test, Mann–Whitney test, and 
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. We used SPSS version 23 (IBM Corporation) 
and considered two-tailed tests with P-values o0.05 as statistically 
signiﬁcant. 
Sample size analysis 
Sample size was calculated based on 10% surgical mortality among 
preterm infants20 and an estimated PAH-associated odds ratio (OR) of 
mortality of 4–5 compared with preterm infants without PAH.3,7 We 
estimated that we would require a sample size of at 144 patients 
(assuming that 20% of the patients would have PAH), or 240 patients 
(assuming that 10% would have PAH), to have a two-sided alpha of 0.05 
and 80% power to detect an OR of 5, and 214 and 350 patients, 
respectively, to detect an OR of 4. 
On the basis of preliminary data from the NICU database, we estimated 
we would need to collect data over 10–15 years. For multivariate analysis 
we limited the number of variables in the ﬁnal model to one per 10 
patients who died before discharge; as 33 patients died, only three 
variables were included. Stepwise logistic regression was used to select the 
most signiﬁcant variables among all variables that were present at 28 days. 
Interaction was tested using an additive model comparing patients with 
PAH who underwent major surgery, those without PAH who underwent 
surgery and those with PAH who did not undergo surgery with the 
controls, who had no PAH and did not undergo surgery.

Patient characteristics 
The NICU database identiﬁed 604 patients with evolving BPD 
(Figure 1). Twenty-seven patients were excluded: one with 
pulmonary vein stenosis prior to surgery, sixteen with severe 
congenital malformations and ten with PPHN. Thus, the study 
population included 577 preterm infants with evolving BPD, of 
whom 227 had major surgery, 83 had minor surgery and 267 had 
no surgery (Figure 1). Among 577 patients with evolving BPD, 33 
(6%) died prior to discharge. Mortality was higher (Po 0.05) in 
those with major surgery (9.7%), but not in those with minor 
surgery (0%), in comparison with those who did not have surgery 
(4.1%). Therefore, we combined those with no surgery and those 
with minor surgery in further analyses. Supplementary Table 2 
describes the frequency of surgical procedures in the population. 
Table 1 shows the neonatal characteristics of BPD patients. 
Eighteen patients had conﬁrmed PAH. Patients with conﬁrmed 
PAH were less likely to be Hispanics, had lower birth weight Z- 
scores, and had longer duration of mechanical ventilation and 
higher frequency of postnatal steroids for BPD and of surgery than 
controls (Table 1). Conﬁrmed PAH was more frequent in patients 
born at 33–36 weeks (2/9, 22%) than in those born at 23–28 weeks 
GA (13/481, 3%), and those born at 29–32 weeks (3/87, 3%) 
(P o 0.05). The majority (15/18) of patients were diagnosed using 
echocardiographic criteria, though three patients were diagnosed 
based on a signiﬁcant response to PAH treatment. The result of 
the echocardiogram review was consistent with chart review for 
diagnosis of PAH, with the exception of one patient with whom 
there was 
septal 
ﬂattening, who was nonetheless treated clinically as PAH based 
on real 
time echocardiogram interpretation and therefore 
classiﬁed as conﬁrmed PAH. 

Among patients who underwent major surgery, mortality was 
4/14 (29%) among those with PAH and 18/213 (8%) among those 
without PAH (Figure 1). Among those who had no surgery or 
minor surgery, mortality was 1/4 (25%) among those with PAH 
and 10/346 (3%) among those without PAH. Mortality decreased 
with gestational age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.69; 95% 
conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.55, 0.87), birth weight Z-score (aOR: 
0.69, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.996) and increased with PAH (aOR: 30, 95% CI: 
2.1, 415), major surgery (aOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 6.3) and both PAH 
and major surgery (aOR: 10.3, 95% CI: 2.5, 42.1). 
DISCUSSION 
The major ﬁnding of our study is that mortality in patients with 
is 
evolving BPD, adjusted for GA and birth weight Z-score, 
associated with PAH and with major surgery. We found no 
evidence for interaction between PAH and surgery. Mortality of 
patients undergoing minor surgery was not signiﬁcantly different 
from those who did not undergo surgery. 
Our results are consistent with several recent publications that 
demonstrate an increased mortality in association either with 
major surgery14 or with PAH in this population.2–4,7,21,22 
Strengths of our study include a birth cohort design; the use of 
a prospective, validated database; well-deﬁned echocardiographic 
criteria for PAH, conﬁrmed by study cardiologist for most patients 
and chart review in all those with PAH. The latter was essential to 
differentiate PPHN from PAH that develops with chronic lung 
disease; patients with PPHN were excluded from the study. As the 
pathogenesis of PPHN differs from that of PAH,23 we felt that it 
was important to separate these two entities and focus speciﬁcally 
on PAH that develops with chronic lung disease. 
Limitations of this study include retrospective design, single site 
study, small sample size and lack of a prospective protocol to 
diagnose PAH in BPD patients. Small sample size prevented 
for all possible confounding variables (including 
adjustment 
maternal pre-eclampsia, asthma or smoking and severity of 
BPD). It is possible that the difference in mortality between the 
PAH and comparison groups could be in part related to increased 
BPD severity in patients with PAH, suggested by the longer 
duration of mechanical ventilation and higher percentage of those 
who received systemic steroids for BPD. We were unable to 
classify BPD by severity because the study started in 2001, before 
implementation of the physiologic deﬁnition of BPD and of the 
NIH consensus deﬁnition of BPD. Our NICU has never used well- 
deﬁned criteria for diagnosis of PAH, nor a systematic protocol of 
serial echocardiograms to detect PAH in patients with BPD. 
Application of strict echocardiographic criteria for PAH for this 
study was limited to interpretation of previously interpreted 
echocardiogram reports. When images were available, clariﬁcation 
was provided from a pediatric cardiologist (CR), however, the only

LB DeVries et al 

patients that were reviewed were those suspected of PAH 
from the NICU database; therefore, 
it is possible that we have 
missed patients with PAH or details about patients in the 
comparison group. 
A recent report from the American Heart Association and 
American Thoracic Society recommends screening infants with 
established BPD for PAH as well as serial echocardiograms to 
monitor response to PAH-targeted therapy.24 Both Nagiub et al.,25 
and Mourani et al.,18 describe algorithms for diagnosing PAH non- 
invasively via echocardiograms that would be worthy of further 
study. Furthermore, the Mourani study18 and a recent study by 
Bhat et al.,21 prospectively studied PAH in preterm infants, yet 
neither of these studies address the common issue of surgery in 
this population. 
We conclude that mortality in patients with evolving BPD, 
adjusted for GA and birth weight Z-score, is associated with PAH 
and with major surgery. Larger, prospective studies with a 
systematic protocol for serial echocardiograms and a rigorous 
deﬁnition of PAH are needed to further elucidate whether 
mortality among preterm infants with BPD is affected by an 
interaction between surgery and PAH.
