Bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
Abstract
 
Background: Despite the potential importance of pulmo- 

 
nary artery hypertension (PAH) in preterm infants with bron- 
chopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), little is known about the risk 
factors for PAH. Objectives: To investigate the risk factors for 
PAH in preterm infants with BPD. Methods: Infants diag- 
nosed with BPD were assigned to the PAH group or non-PAH 
group except for infants with mild BPD who had no PAH. PAH 
was diagnosed on the basis of echocardiograms demon- 
strating elevated right ventricle pressure beyond the post- 
natal age of 2 months. Logistic regression analysis was done 
for the multivariate assessment of the risk factors for PAH in 
preterm infants with moderate or severe BPD. Results: A to- 
tal of 98 infants among 145 infants with BPD were divided 
into a PAH group (n = 25) or non-PAH group (n = 73), while 
the remaining 47 infants had mild BPD with no PAH. Among 
the study patients, survival rate of the PAH group was sig- 
nificantly lower than that of the non-PAH group. Infants with 
PAH had more severe cases of BPD and underwent longer 
durations of oxygen therapy, conventional or high-frequen- 
cy ventilation, and hospitalization compared to those with- 
out PAH. Low 5-min Apgar scores ( ^ 6; relative risk (RR) 6.2; 
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–28.0; p = 0.017) and oligohy- 
dramnios (RR 7.7; 95% CI 2.0–29.6; p = 0.030) were found to 
be significant risk factors for PAH according to multivariate 
analysis. Conclusions: The present study shows that oligo- 
hydramnios is a specific risk factor for PAH in preterm infants 
with moderate or severe BPD.

Thepathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
 
(BPD) has evolved from its classical form following the 
introduction of antenatal glucocorticoid, surfactant re- 
placement therapy, and gentler ventilatory support since 
the disease condition was originally described by North- 
way in 1967 [1–4] . Recently, the impact of antenatal lung 
injury and inflammatory response, and the mechanism 
underlying the priming effect of antenatal inflammation 
on the pathogenesis of current forms of BPD have been 
investigated [5, 6] . Despite this evolution, BPD still re- 
mains a major chronic pulmonary complication in small 
preterm infants [7] . Although most studies of BPD have

focused primarily on airway pathologies, infants with 
BPD are also at high risk of cardiovascular sequelae such 
as pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), left ventricular 
hypertrophy, systemic hypertension, systemic to pulmo- 
nary collateral vessels, and others [8] . 
Early injury to the lung circulation leads to the rapid 

 
development of PAH after premature birth [8] . According 
to several small studies concerning the outcomes of in- 
fants with PAH and BPD, a quarter of BPD infants later 
show echocardiographic evidence of PAH [9, 10] . Al- 
though the exact mechanisms responsible for pulmonary 
vascular resistance remain incompletely understood, 
PAH in BPD results from increased vascular tone and ab- 
normal vasoreactivity, hypertensive remodeling, and de- 
creased vascular growth [8, 11] . The development of PAH 
is sometimes a serious complication of BPD that can sig- 
nificantly impact the morbidity and mortality rates of 
preterm infants [12–14] . 
Currently, there are few published studies about the 

 
clinical course and outcomes of PAH in preterm infants 
with BPD [15] . Despite the potential importance of PAH 
in preterm infants, little is also known about the risk fac- 
tors for PAH in preterm infants with BPD. A lack of in- 
formation about the risk factors for PAH complicates de- 
velopment of appropriate screening guidelines for PAH 
in preterm infants with BPD. The objective of this study 
was to investigate the risk factors for PAH in preterm in- 
fants with BPD in the postsurfactant era. 
Patients 

 
Aretrospective review was performed of data from 295 infants 
 
with a gestational age of ! 32 weeks born in the neonatal intensive 
care unit (NICU) at Seoul National University Children’s Hospi- 
tal during a 5-year period (January 2005 to December 2009). In- 
fants with major congenital malformations (e.g. documented 
chromosomal anomaly or multiple malformations) and infants 
who died before reaching a postconceptional age (PCA) of 36 
weeks were excluded (n = 30). Infants diagnosed with BPD were 
assigned to the PAH group or non-PAH group except for infants 
with mild BPD who had no PAH. Data on the patients’ clinical 
characteristics and outcomes were collected and analyzed retro- 
spectively. A flow diagram showing the study design involving 
the 295 infants enrolled in this study is presented in figure 1 . 
Clinical characteristics were evaluated by a single reviewer di- 

 
rectly from medical records. Clinical characteristics studied in- 
cluded birth weights ! 3rd percentile for age, preterm premature 
rupture of membrane (PPROM, rupture of membranes before 37 
completed weeks of gestation and 24 h prior to delivery), histo- 
logic chorioamnionitis (HCAM, presence of acute inflammatory 
changes on examination found up on a membrane roll and the 
placental chorionic plate), prenatal steroids (any dose of steroids 
including either a partial or completed course), and oligohydram- 
nios (defined as amniotic fluid index ! 5 cm by ultrasound per- 
formed just before delivery [16] ). 
BPD and its severity were defined using the criteria of the Na- 

 
tional Institute of Child Health Workshop definition for BPD [17] , 
i.e. treatment with oxygen for at least 28 days with division into 
the following three subgroups at 36 weeks’ PCA: (1) mild (breath- 
ing room air); (2) moderate (need for a ! 30% fraction of inspired 
oxygen (FiO 2 )), and (3) severe (need for 6 30% fraction of inspired 
oxygen and/or positive pressure support). A diagnosis of respira- 
tory distress syndrome (RDS) required the presence of respira- 
tory distress, increased oxygen requirement and a radiological 
finding consistent with RDS in the absence of evidence of any 
other cause of respiratory distress. Intraventricular hemorrhage 
(IVH) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were classified using 
the Volpe grading system and modified Bell’s staging criteria, re- 
spectively [18, 19] . Presence of proven sepsis was defined as at least 
a single blood culture and clinical signs of infection. Patent ductus 
arteriosus (PDA) was diagnosed by echocardiography. 
Pulmonary Artery Hypertension 

 
Inthe cardiologic division of Seoul National University Chil- 
 
dren’s Hospital, we conducted monthly echocardiographic exam- 
ination of the preterm infants with BPD in the NICU to screen for 
PAH and of the follow-up patients with moderate to severe BPD 
after discharge from the hospital even though the patients did not 
have PAH while in the NICU. PAH was diagnosed on the basis of 
echocardiograms demonstrating elevated right ventricle (RV) 
pressure using the following criteria: (1) velocity of tricuspid valve 
regurgitation of 6 3 m/s in the absence of pulmonary stenosis, 
and (2) flat or leftward deviated interventricular septal configura- 
tion, and right ventricular hypertrophy with chamber dilation. 
Patients with one or both of these findings beyond 2 months of

dence of PAH before 2 months of age were included in this study. 
Patients with congenital heart disease (except those with a patent 
foramen ovale, PDA, or atrial septal defect), persistent pulmonary 
hypertension of the newborn, or congenital diaphragmatic hernia 
were excluded. 
Data Analyses 

 
Toinvestigate the impact of PAH on the outcomes of preterm 
 
infants with BPD, we performed univariate analyses for the fol- 
lowing variables: durations of oxygen therapy, conventional or 
high-frequency ventilation, and hospitalization, weight ! 3rd per- 
centile for age at discharge, and expired patients after PCA 36 
weeks. 
Next, in an attempt to define the roles of different risk factors 

 
associated with the development of PAH in preterm infants with 
BPD, we performed univariate analyses to compare the following 
variables which are presumed to be associated with the develop- 
ment of PAH in infants with or without PAH as reported in previ- 
ous studies [11, 15, 20] : gender, multiple births, mode of delivery, 
gestational age, birth weight, birth weight ! 3rd percentile for age, 
low 5-min Apgar scores ( ^ 6), PPROM, HCAM, prenatal steroids 
administration, preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, RDS, PDA, IVH 
(Gr 6 3), NEC (stage 6 2), and proven sepsis. The univariate anal- 
yses were followed by a multivariate logistic regression analysis to 
determine independent risk factors for the development of PAH. 
Variables that were significant in the previous univariate analyses 
were chosen to be included in the logistic regression model. For 
this analysis, we used the binary logistic regression procedure. 
Using this analytic method, we evaluated the contribution of each 
variable to the logistic regression model and selected the ones 
whose contribution was significant independent of the effect of 
the other variables in the model. Next, we calculated the adjusted 
relative risks (RR) for the development of PAH and the 95% con- 
fidence intervals (CI) of the selected variables. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, 

 
version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA). Categorical variables 
were analyzed by the (cid:2) 2 test and Fisher’s exact test. Differences in 
continuous variables were assessed by Student’s t test and the 
Mann-Whitney U test. Time-dependent outcomes were assessed 
using Kaplan-Meier analysis, with comparison between two 
groups using the log-rank test. Data are presented as mean 8 SD 
or frequency. p values ! 0.05 were considered significant. 


 
Except for 47 infants with mild BPD that had no PAH 
among these 145 infants, a total of 98 infants were divid- 
ed into the PAH group (n = 25) or non-PAH group (n = 
73) ( table 1 ). 
In all subjects, infants with PAH had a greater need for 

 
630% FiO 2 or positive pressure support at PCA 36 weeks, 
 
suggesting severe BPD (p = 0.000) and longer durations 
of oxygen therapy (p = 0.011), conventional or high-fre- 
quency ventilation (p = 0.032), and hospitalization (p = 
0.022) compared to those without PAH ( table 1 ). Five pa- 
tients (20%) in the PAH group died during the follow-up 
period in contrast with 1 patient (1%) in the non-PAH 
group who died. Among with all subjects, the average 
survival rate of the PAH group was significantly lower 
than that of the non-PAH group (p = 0.011) ( fig. 2 ). 
Univariate analysis for the comparison of clinical 

 
characteristics according to the presence or absence of 
PAH in all subjects included in this study showed a sta- 
tistically significant difference (p ! 0.05) in three vari- 
ables ( table 1 ): birth weight ! 3rd percentile for age (28 vs. 
10%, p = 0.031), low 5-min Apgar scores ( ^ 6; 88 vs. 63%, 
p = 0.015), and oligohydramnios (40 vs. 8%, p = 0.001). 
We investigated the specific risk factors for the develop- 
ment of PAH by multivariate logistic regression analysis 
with adjustment for variables which were significant in 
the previous univariate analysis. In all subjects, low 5-min 
Apgar scores ( ^ 6; RR 6.2; 95% CI 1.4–28.0; p = 0.017) and 
oligohydramnios (RR 7.7; 95% CI 2.0–29.6; p = 0.030) 
were found to be significant risk factors for PAH after ad- 
justing for birth weight ! 3rd percentile for age, low 5-min 
Apgar scores ( ^ 6), and oligohydramnios ( table 2 ). Uni- 
variate analysis in a total of 40 infants with severe BPD 
showed a statistically significant difference in two vari- 
ables: low 5-min Apgar scores ( ^ 6) and oligohydramni- 
os. In addition, in the multivariate analysis, low 5-min 
Apgar scores ( ^ 6; RR 7.8; 95% CI 1.2–52.0; p = 0.034) and 
oligohydramnios (RR 7.2; 95% CI 1.1–47.3; p = 0.040) 
were also significant risk factors for PAH after adjusting 
for low 5-min Apgar scores ( ^ 6) and oligohydramnios. 
Ofthe 295 infants enrolled in the present study, 145 
 
(49%) were diagnosed as having BPD. A total of 25 pre- 
term infants (17 males and 8 females) with BPD had PAH. 
PAH was diagnosed in 52.5% (21/40) of infants with se- 
vere BPD, 6.9% (4/58) of infants with moderate BPD, and 
0% (0/47) of infants with mild BPD. Risk for the develop- 
ment of PAH in infants with severe BPD was 7.6 times 
higher than those with moderate BPD (p = 0.000). PAH 
was diagnosed at a median age of 90 days (range 33–250). 


 
Inthe present study, most of the infants diagnosed as 
 
having PAH had underlying severe BPD (84%, 21/25) and 
none of them had underlying mild BPD. This proportion 
of infants with underlying severe BPD among ones diag- 
nosed as having PAH was much higher than the 41% re- 
ported in a recent study [15] . We excluded infants with 
mild BPD from our study because the inclusion of infants

with mild BPD having no PAH could make it difficult to 
identify the risk factors for PAH. 
It has been reported that the mortality rate for PAH 

 
among preterm infants with BPD is very high. Two stud- 
ies published in the ‘presurfactant era’ showed mortality 
rates of 50 and 29%, respectively, in infants with BPD and 
PAH [12, 13] . Additionally, in the ‘postsurfactant era’, 
PAH with BPD was strongly associated with poor sur- 
vival with a recent report showing a mortality rate of 38% 
for infants with PAH [15] . Contrary to our study, all of the 
reports mentioned above did not compare the mortality 
rates of infants with PAH to non-PAH patients. In the 
present study, a mortality rate of 20% associated with 
PAH was significantly higher than the 1% observed in 
infants without PAH but with moderate or severe BPD. 
In addition, given that infants with PAH have more se- 
vere cases of BPD and longer durations of oxygen therapy, 
conventional or high-frequency ventilation, and hospi- 
talization than those without PAH, PAH may be a serious 
factor impacting the outcomes of BPD. 
Recent experimental studies have shown that early in- 

 
jury to the developing lung can impair angiogenesis 
which further contributes to decreased alveolarization 
and simplification of distal lung airspace, leading to the 
development of BPD (the ‘vascular hypothesis’) [21–23] . 
It is also speculated that reciprocal interactions exist be- 
tween the developing airspace and pulmonary circula- 
tion [24] . Abnormal lung circulation in BPD patients, in- 
cluding both anatomical and physiologic abnormalities, 
is related to the development of PAH. Patients with BPD 
show a reduction of small pulmonary arteries and an al- 
tered distribution of pulmonary arteries within the pul- 
monary interstitium that cause reduction of the alveolar- 
capillary surface area [2, 25] . This reduction in surface

PAH in all subjects with moderate or severe BPD. To 
identify the risk factors for PAH with BPD regardless of 
its severity, we performed additional analyses on the sub- 
jects with severe BPD but not those with moderate BPD. 
In these analyses, 5-min Apgar scores ( ^ 6) and oligohy- 
dramnios were also significant independent risk factors 
for PAH. The notable finding of the present study is that 
oligohydramnios was the specific risk factor for PAH in 
preterm infants with BPD. Oligohydramnios is likely to 
influence growth and morphogenesis of the developing 
lung. Furthermore, a retrospective study conducted in 
infants with a gestational age of ! 37 weeks who had an 
echocardiographic diagnosis of PAH within the first 4 
weeks of life also suggested that oligohydramnios was in- 
dependently predictive of PAH [20] . Normal transition 
from the canalicular stage to the saccular stage of devel- 
opment requires the production of fluid by the fetal lung. 
Lung fluid is kept pressurized by a combination of laryn- 
geal closure and fluid production by the respiratory epi- 
thelia. The pressure of fetal lung fluid is important for 
lung growth as illustrated by the pulmonary hypoplasia 
seen in neonates with oligohydramnios [26–28] . Preterm 
infants with hypoplastic lungs may have elevated pulmo- 
nary vascular resistance; this may be related to maldevel- 
opment including a decrease in the cross-sectional area 
and abnormal muscularization of the pulmonary vascu- 
lature [28–30] . Although there was no evidence of defi- 
nite hypoplastic lungs in infants according to our study, 
some inhibitive effect of oligohydramnios on lung devel- 
opment might influence the development of PAH in pre- 
term infants with BPD. Altogether, our results suggest 
that oligohydramnios may contribute to vascular arrest 
as well as alveolar arrest during fetal lung development, 
and furthermore result in the subsequent development of 
PAH in BPD patients. This corresponds to the ‘vascular 
hypothesis’ of BPD. In the present study, a low 5-min Ap- 
gar score ( ^ 6) was another specific risk factor for PAH in 
Fig. 2. Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrating the probability of sur- 

 
vival from the time of birth for the study patients with moderate 
or severe BPD (n = 98), including infants with PAH (n = 25) and 
those without PAH (n = 73). Survival rate of the PAH group was 
significantly lower than that of the non-PAH group (p = 0.011).

area leads to impaired gas exchange and increases the re- 
quirement for prolonged oxygen and ventilator treatment 
which in turn raises the risk of severe PAH [11] . In the 
present study, low 5-min Apgar scores ( ^ 6) and oligohy- 
dramnios were significant independent risk factors for

preterm infants with BPD. Some researchers reported 
that oligohydramnios is associated with an increased risk 
of adverse perinatal outcome [31, 32] . In one meta-analy- 
sis, infants with oligohydramnios had a 5.2-fold increased 
risk for a 5-min Apgar score of ! 7 [31] . Based on these 
previous studies, it is assumed that low 5-min Apgar 
scores ( ^ 6) found to be a PAH risk factor can be the con- 
sequence of oligohydramnios. Meanwhile, Khemani et 
al. [15] reported that among 18 patients with severe PAH 
(systemic or supra-systemic RV pressure) almost half 
were born with weight ! 3rd percentile for age, which sug- 
gests that birth weight ! 3rd percentile for age may be at 
increased risk for severe PAH. This same group [15] also 
reported that birth weight ! 3rd percentile for age with 
severe PAH is associated with worse survival rates in 
multivariate analyses, However, in the present study birth 
weight ! 3rd percentile for age was associated with the 
development of PAH in the univariate analysis but not in 
the multivariate analysis. 
In the present study, the diagnosis of PAH depended 

 
entirely on echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization 
has been accepted as the gold standard for diagnosing 
PAH to date. However, since this procedure is very inva- 
sive and is not easily performed in the preterm cases in 
NICU, serial echocardiography is recommended as the 
main tool to screen for PAH in BPD patients despite its 
several limitations [11, 33] . In the present study, it was 
found that echocardiography is a useful tool for diagnos- 
ing PAH and predicting the outcomes in infants with 
BPD in clinical setting. 
In summary, among infants with moderate or severe 

 
BPD, the survival rate of ones with PAH was significant- 
ly lower than that of infants who did not. Furthermore, 
the infants with PAH had to undergo longer durations of 
oxygen therapy, conventional or high-frequency ventila- 
tion, and hospitalization than those without PAH. Oligo- 
hydramnios was a specific risk factor for PAH in preterm 
infants with moderate or severe BPD. We therefore sug- 
gest that a more active screening echocardiogram may be 
needed for diagnosing PAH in preterm infants with mod- 
erate or severe BPD, especially in the setting of oligohy- 
dramnios. Further large cohort studies will be required 
to confirm our results and identify other risk factors for 
the development of PAH in infants with BPD.
