Of 366 eligible infants, 116 (Group I [BPD-PH] = 7, Group II [BPD with no PH] = 109) were lost to follow-up. 
Of the remaining 250 infants, 51 in Group I and 199 in Group II were followed at 18–24 months CA. Group

premature infants [1]. The incidence of BPD in infants born at < 29 weeks GA in Canadian NICUs varies 
between 58%-73% [2, 3]. Early and late BPD complications include prolonged NICU stay, increased 

mortality, growth failure, increased respiratory infections, need for home oxygen therapy, pulmonary 
hypertension (PH), frequent hospital visits, and the risk of hyperactive airway disease and 


and prolonging hospitalization. PH is estimated to occur in about 25% of infants with moderate to severe 
BPD [8, 9]. The risk of NDI and mortality due to PH in term infants varies between 18–46% and 14–40%

This was a retrospective cohort study based out of two-level 3 NICUs at Foothills Hospital in Calgary, 
Canada, and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, United States. The study was 





2019, admitted to the NICUs at Foothills Medical Center in Calgary, Canada, and the University of Texas 
Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, United States. Neonatal data of these infants were collected 

CA. Infants with signicant congenital anomalies, complex congenital heart disease and chromosomal 
disorders were excluded from the study. 

The exposure variable of interest was PH. Infants were divided into two groups based on the presence of 
PH: Group 1: BPD with PH and Group II: BPD with no PH. All premature infants born at < 29 weeks are 
routinely followed up in the Neonatal follow up clinics (NFC), at both centers, at the ages of four months, 
eight months, 18–24 months, 36 months, and ve years with a multidisciplinary team. Both centers use 

the Bayley III for neurodevelopmental assessment at follow-up. From April 2020, routine Bayley 
assessments were stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To enable ongoing developmental 
assessments of high-risk neonates, the neonatal follow-up clinics had to rely on the Ages and stages 
questionnaire version 3 (ASQ 3) as a screening tool. This was followed by tailored assessments in the 
follow-up clinics for infants identied as having concerns on ASQ 3. ASQ is an easy-to-use tool consisting 
of a set of questions to be answered by parents, which takes about 15 minutes to answer. ASQ has been 
studied as a screening tool to identify developmental issues in various populations and has shown 
modest agreement with other formal methods of neurodevelopmental assessment such as Bayley III and 
WPSSI [17, 18]. One study reported that the sensitivity, specicity, and correlations between measures 
improved in children with risk factors such as prematurity and increased age at assessment [18]. We used 
ASQ 3 scores for ND outcomes as a surrogate marker of NDI, especially in the pandemic period when 
infants did not have Bayley scores due to virtual follow-up. 

Standardized demographic, perinatal and neonatal data were collected from patients’ medical records 
and a research coordinator and entered into a computerized neonatal follow-up clinic database upon 
discharge from the NICU. All surviving premature infants underwent comprehensive developmental 
assessment by a multidisciplinary team (consisting of a neonatologist or developmental pediatrician, 
psychologist, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, dietician, speech language pathologist, social 
worker, nurse, ophthalmologist, audiologist). The Bayley-III was administered at 18–24 months CA by a 
trained psychologist/psychometrist, audiologist and speech-language pathologist. Members of the 
multidisciplinary team were not blinded to the infant’s neonatal hospital course details, which may 



Infants with any degree of PH were included in the BPD-PH group. PH was diagnosed at 36 weeks’ PMA 
based on echocardiography features of interventricular septal attening, right ventricular systolic 
pressure /systemic systolic blood pressure ratio as measured by tricuspid regurgitation envelope and 
presence of main pulmonary artery dilation. 

The primary outcome for this study was a composite of mortality or NDI at 18–24 months of CA. 
Secondary outcomes included individual components (cognitive, language, motor) of the primary 
outcome, cerebral palsy, visual impairment, and sensorineural or mixed hearing loss. 
NDI was dened as a Bayley-III score of < 85 on any one of the components (cognitive, language, motor 
composite score), and severe NDI dened as a score of < 70 on any one of the components. 


For infants in both groups, perinatal, birth and neonatal data were extracted from both centers’ neonatal 
follow-up clinics’ databases. Perinatal factors included maternal hypertension, maternal diabetes, 
chorioamnionitis, and antenatal corticosteroids (ANCS). Birth data included gestational age, sex, Apgar 
scores at 5 minutes and small for gestational age (SGA) status. Neonatal morbidities included respiratory 
distress syndrome (RDS), duration of mechanical ventilation, blood culture or CSF culture-proven sepsis, 
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and its treatment, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) Bell’s criteria[19], 
intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade 3 or higher as dened by Papile classication[20]. 

Maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes were compared between the two groups using the 
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and the t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for 
continuous variables. Logistic regression models were used to adjust for confounding variables. 
Confounders included gestational age at delivery, ANCS, SGA, PDA requiring treatment, chorioamnionitis 
and NEC. Bootstrap analysis was done to determine the condence intervals (CI) of the adjusted odd ratio 
(aOR). Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). 

We used a convenience sample of all eligible infants born in the study period for whom we had data for 
echocardiography screening for PH. With 58 infants in Group I and 308 in Group II, and 60% of infants 
with BPD without PH having the primary outcome, we had 80% power to detect a difference as small as 
20% between the two groups. 


hundred and fty-two infants were excluded from the study [signicant congenital anomalies (n = 3), 
complex congenital heart disease (n = 10), infants with missing screening echo at 36 weeks (n = 23), lost 
to follow-up (n = 116)]. We had 51 infants in group I and 199 infants in group II included in the analysis. 
Demographic characteristics, perinatal risk factors and incidence of neonatal morbidity among neonates 
in the BPD with PH and BPD without PH groups are described in Table 1.

signicantly higher in the BPD-PH group. Infants in the BPD-PH Group had lower gestational age (median 
25 weeks versus 26 weeks) and birth weight and had a higher incidence of SGA, NEC, ROP stage ≥ 3 or 
needing treatment. Additionally, infants in the BPD-PH group also had a longer duration of mechanical 
ventilation and prolonged hospital stay (median 122 days versus 104 days) and were more likely to be 
discharged home on oxygen (55% versus 32%) (Table 1). 
Comparison of the neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18–24 months CA between the two groups is 
shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2. For neurodevelopmental assessment at 18–24 months CA, 130 infants had 
Bayley III scores, and 67 babies had only ASQ3 scores. Eighty-seven percent of infants in the BPD-PH 
group had a composite of death, or NDI, compared to 60% in infants with BPD without PH (p = 0.007). 
Infants with BPD- PH had higher mortality (14% versus 1%) compared to BPD without PH group (p = < 
0.001). Infants in group I had a higher proportion of Bayley III language composite score < 85, Bayley III 
Motor composite score < 85 and any Bayley cognitive, language, motor composite score < 85 scores 
compared to infants in group II (Fig. 2). The proportion of infants with severe NDI was higher in group I 
but this was not statistically signicant (8/19 (42%) in group I versus 21/87 (24%) in group II, p = 0.112). 
Group I had a signicantly higher proportion of Bayley III motor composite scores < 70 (7/23 (30%) in 

 
group I versus 7/98 (7%) in group II, p = 0.005). There was no difference in the rates of cerebral palsy, 
visual impairment, or hearing impairment between the two groups (Calgary data only, as data was not 
available from UTMB).

Preterm infants with BPD-PH were at increased risk of the composite outcome of death or NDI at 18–24 
months CGA. This study has a substantial number of infants with BPD-PH, with structured ND outcome 


mortality in the BPD-PH group, supporting our study's ndings [8]. This systematic review did not address 
the neurodevelopmental outcome of infants with BPD-PH. However, this nding is in contrast with recent 
studies on BPD-PH, which found no increased risk of mortality, but small sample sizes limited these 
studies [14, 15]. 
Our study observed an increased risk of NDI on univariate analysis in the BPD-PH group. Infants with PH 
had an increased risk of having any NDI as measured by Bayley III composite score < 85. This was 
consistent with other studies, who reported increased NDI in infants with BPD-PH [14, 16]. The individual 
components of Bayley III, specically the number of infants with language composite score < 85 was 
signicantly higher in the BPD-PH group, which contrasts with the results of the study by Nakanishi et al 
and Choi et al [14, 16]. Unlike their study, we did not nd signicant differences in the cognitive scores < 
85, but the difference in Bayley III motor scores < 85 was statistically signicant. Other studies did not nd 
any differences in the cognitive, language or motor scores between infants with BPD-PH compared to 
BPD alone [15, 16]. In a multivariate analysis, after adjusting for confounding factors (GA at delivery, 
antenatal steroids, SGA, PDA requiring treatment, chorioamnionitis and NEC), infants in the BPD-PH 


explain the effect of PH on adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including increased inammatory 
mediators, increased episodes of hypoxia, cardiac dysfunction leading to impaired cerebral perfusion or 
increased clinical/subclinical infection episodes associated with interventions such as mechanical 
ventilation [10, 13]. 
Among factors contributing to increased morbidity in the BPD-PH group, infants in the group I had an 
increased incidence of NEC and ROP ≥ stage 3. These morbidities have not shown a consistent pattern in 
previous studies, albeit limited by small numbers in these studies [14–16]. In our study, BPD-PH was 
associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation, increased duration of hospitalization and 
increased home oxygen therapy. Similarly, Nakanishi et al. also reported increased hospitalization and 
home oxygen therapy duration in their BPD-PH group. In contrast, Choi et al. did not nd the increased 
duration of hospitalization or any difference in respiratory support/ oxygen use. In contrast to other 



between severity of BPD and NDI, which was not possible due to a low number of infants with severe 
BPD in our cohort. However, a higher proportion of infants with the primary outcome was associated with 


restrictions. Therefore, neurodevelopmental outcomes were measured using Bayley III and ASQ scores, 
and they were not different between groups I and II. Validity studies between ASQ3 and Bayley III have 
shown a modest correlation in NDI detection. NDI assessment by ASQ3 must be interpreted with caution, 
considering the imitations of ASQ [18, 23]. 
The strengths of our study include a large number of infants with BPD-PH and being a multicenter study 
with standardized neurodevelopmental follow-up assessments. This study has a good follow-up rate 

with multidisciplinary teams that reported on NDI in BPD-PH. The demographic characteristics of the 
study population lost to follow-up were similar to those and unlikely to affect the study results. 


cases were minimal at the start of the pandemic and then opened to infants who, after virtual consults, 
were deemed to require occupational /physical therapy. At younger ages of 18–24 months, parental 
perception of developmental delays may be less reliable compared to the older pediatric population [24]. 
NDI, as assessed by ASQ3, is moderately reliable; however, this can be used in a pandemic situation 




In conclusion, our study found infants with BPD-PH were at a higher risk of death and/or NDI at 18–24 
months of corrected age in infants born at < 29 weeks GA. These infants should be prioritized for closer 
follow-up and early intervention. The provided information will be helpful in counselling parents while the 
infants are in the NICU. However, further studies based on the severity of PH may better stratify the risks
