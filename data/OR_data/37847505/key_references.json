The psychometric properties of PHQ-2 in the Colombian population are unknown.\n## METHODS\nPHQ-2 were assessed in 243 patients in general medical consultations using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as the gold standard. Internal consistency, convergent validity and criterion validity were calculated by analyzing the Receptor Operating Characteristics (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC).\n## RESULTS\nCronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega coefficients were 0.71. Spearman's rho coefficients for correlations with PHQ-9 and HADS-D scores were 0.63 and 0.59 (p<0.01). AUC was 0.89. The optimal cut point was \u22652 with the following indicators: sensitivity 0.87 specificity 0.74; Youden index 0.60; PPV 0.47; NPV 0.95; (LR+) 3.24; (LR-) 0.18 (95% CI 0.09-0.37). Kappa coefficient between PHQ-2 and MINI for depression was .458 and 0.46 for HADS-D.\n## LIMITATIONS\nSince this study was done with people attending hospital, which could has implications for the prevalence of depression, affecting the validity indicators of the instrument.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPHQ-2 show an acceptable test performance in the context of the study. However, the test could yield a considerable amount of false positives that would require specialized evaluation to establish a reliable diagnosis.\n",

            "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to assess the measurement properties (reliability, factor structure, and criterion validity) of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as an instrument for screening major depressive disorder (MDD) in elderly primary care users in Chile. Method: About 582 participants aged between 65 and 80 years were enrolled from primary care centers. They completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a survey with sociodemographic characteristics and the PHQ-9. Results: The PHQ-9 revealed an acceptable internal consistency (\u03c9 = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.75-0.80] and \u03b1 = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.75-0.81]); confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a good fit for both 1- and 2-factor solutions. The chi-square difference test (\u03c72 = 0.61, gl = 1, p = 0.43) and correlation between the somatic and the cognitive-effective latent factors were very high (r = 0.97, p < 0.001), indicating that the 1 factor model was more parsimonious. Utilizing the CIDI as the gold standard, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88 (SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.84-0.90). The optimal cut-off score of \u2265 6 yielded good sensitivity and specificity for detecting MDD (0.95 and 0.76, respectively). However, considering the clinical utility index, the cut-off score of \u22659 proved to be a more effective marker for discarding cases of MDD. Conclusion: The PHQ-9 has adequate psychometric properties for elderly primary care users. In clinical settings, it showed its greatest utility in ruling out the presence of an MDD, however, its clinical value for identifying possible cases of MDD is limited. In cases above the cut-off point, it is recommended to perform a more thorough evaluation.",

            "abstract": "The patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is one of the most widely used self-report instruments in primary care. There is no criterion validity of the PHQ-9 in Colombia. The objective was to validate the PHQ-9 as a screening tool in primary care. A cross-sectional, scale criterion validity study was performed using as reference criterion the mini neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) in male and female adult users of primary care centres. We calculated the internal consistency and convergent and criterion validity of the PHQ-9 by analysing the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). We analysed 243 participants; 184 (75.7%) were female. The average age was 34.05 (median of 31 and SD = 12.47). Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.80 and McDonald's \u03c9 was 0.81. Spearman's Rho was 0.64 for HADS-D (P <0.010) and 0.70 for PHQ-2 (P\u00a0<0.010). The AUC was 0.92 (95% CI 0.880-0.963). The optimal cut-off point of PHQ-9 was \u22657: sensitivity of 90.38 (95% CI: 81.41-99.36); specificity of 81.68 (95%\u00a0CI: 75.93-87.42); PPV 57.32 (95% CI: 46.00-68.63); NPV 96.89 (95% CI: 93.90-99.88); Youden index 0.72 (95% CI: 0.62-0.82); LR+ 4.93 (95% CI: 3.61-6.74); LR- 0.12 (95% CI: 0.005-0.270).

            "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition among the general population, and its prevalence is even higher among patients hospitalized due to medical illnesses. It has been estimated that one out of four patients hospitalized for medical illness has a comorbid major depressive episode (MDE) The presence of depression in a patient hospitalized due to a medical illness worsens the medical prognosis, increases symptom burden, complicates self-care and treatment-adherence, extends the hospitalization stay, and inflates the costs of care and mortality. Taking into account that patients with depression can be effectively treated with medication and psychotherapy, early diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce this burden . Despite this, almost 50% of patients who suffer comorbid depression when hospitalized for medical conditions do not have the condition detected by clinicians. This is explained, at least in part, by the lack of quick and sensitive diagnostic tools, especially for use in specific languages and cultures. Structured clinical interviews such as the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)  or the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) are the gold standard for diagnosing depression. However, the use of these instruments require administration by trained mental health professionals, are time-consuming and difficult to systematically apply in routine clinical practice. This highlights the need for reliable, valid, and easily applicable self-assessment screening tools to detect depression in patients hospitalized due to a non-psychiatric medical illness. Several self-screening tools are available for screening, tracking and documenting depressive symptoms with minimal clinician time, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). To our knowledge, no studies have compared, at the same time and with the same sample, the psychometric properties of these three self-rated questionaries' with a semi-structured clinical interview in patients hospitalized for non-psychiatric medical illness. To cover this gap, we designed the present study. Our aims are to: (1) compare the operating characteristics of PHQ-9, BDI-II and HADS according to an independent criterion standard for MDE in patients hospitalized due to non-psychiatric medical illness; (2) determine the optimum cut-off scores of these self-rating scales for discriminating between patients with and without MDE in this specific group of patients. The results of this study will provide general practitioners with highly valuable information to choose an assessment tool for depression in this subgroup of patients.",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Spanish primary care (PC) centres is high. However, MDD is frequently underdiagnosed and consequently only some patients receive the appropriate treatment. The present study aims to determine the utility of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to identify MDD in a subset of PC patients participating in the large PsicAP study.\n## METHODS\nA total of 178 patients completed the full PHQ test, including the depression module (PHQ-9). Also, a Spanish version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was implemented by clinical psychologists that were blinded to the PHQ-9 results. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 as a screening tool as compared to the SCID-I as a reference standard.\n## RESULTS\nThe psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 for a cut-off value of 10 points were as follows: sensitivity, 0.95; specificity, 0.67. Using a cut-off of 12 points, the values were: sensitivity, 0.84; specificity, 0.78. Finally, using the diagnostic algorithm for depression (DSM-IV criteria), the sensitivity was 0.88 and the specificity 0.80.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAs a screening instrument, the PHQ-9 performed better with a cut-off value of 12 versus the standard cut-off of 10. However, the best psychometric properties were obtained with the DSM-IV diagnostic algorithm for depression. These findings indicate that the PHQ-9 is a highly satisfactory tool that can be used for screening MDD in the PC setting.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN58437086 .
