            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Otolaryngologists have a higher risk of physical/psychological problems due to their frequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2. There is no information about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of these specialists in low/middle-income countries from Latin America. This study aimed to assess the frequency of anxiety, depression, and stress, as well as the changes in occupational and daily activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a group of pediatric otolaryngologists in Latin America.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Observational, cross-sectional study conducted between October and December 2020. Mental health tools such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Perceived Stress Scale-10 were applied. Fear to COVID-19 scale and questionnaires about occupational and daily activities were also applied.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among 55 pediatric otolaryngologists, the frequency of anxiety, depression, and stress were 67.3%, 45.5, and 40%, respectively. Up to 27.3% of the specialists reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, while 7.3 and 40% presented moderate depression and stress symptoms. The specialists reported a reduction of 58.3% of their consultations, as well as a 51.7% reduction in their monthly income compared to the same period before the pandemic. Up to 14.6% of the specialists expect to incorporate long-term (>1 year) drastic changes in their daily activities due to the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The frequency of anxiety, depression, and stress was high among pediatric otolaryngologists in Latin America compared to previous studies performed in high-income countries. Further research on these psychological outcomes is needed to achieve early mental health strategies."

            "abstract": "The study evaluated depression and self-care management among patients with diabetes and/or heart disease in a 12-month randomized trial conducted in Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) community clinics. We compared LAC-DHS clinic usual care (UC) versus A-Helping-Hand (AHH) intervention in which bilingual promotoras, hired and supervised by the research project, provided 6 weekly psychoeducational sessions followed by boosters. Of 1957 screened, 348 depressed patients (PHQ-9 score≥10) were enrolled, randomized to AHH (n=178) or UC (n=170) after baseline interview assessing mental health, treatment receipt, co-morbid illness, self-care management, and environmental stressors. Comprehensive assessments were repeated at 6 and 12months by an independent interviewer blind to the study group. Patients (85% diabetes, 4% heart disease, 11% both) were predominantly female (85%), Latino (99%), born outside of the US (91%). Study attrition at 12months was 30% (AHH 31%, UC 28%, P=0.51). No baseline characteristics were associated with attrition. Half of AHH patients received 4 or more sessions. Intend-to-treat analysis found study groups did not vary significantly at 6 and 12months. Before-after paired t-tests showed significant improvements in most measures in each group. During the trial, LAC-DHS activated healthcare improvements including depression screening, referral to clinic staff including community health workers (with the same role as the promotoras) to improve patient care management. Both patient groups performed equally well which may be a function of the enhanced healthcare model. Future research should replicate the promotora-integrated care model with other groups and care settings with similar comorbid conditions."

            "abstract": "The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a widely-used screening tool for depression in primary care settings. The purpose of the present study is to identify the factor structure of the PHQ-9 and to examine the measurement invariance of this instrument across different sociodemographic groups and over time in a sample of primary care patients in Spain. Data came from 836 primary care patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (PsicAP study) and a subsample of 218 patients who participated in a follow-up assessment at 3 months. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test one- and two-factor structures identified in previous studies. Analyses of multiple-group invariance were conducted to determine the extent to which the factor structure is comparable across various demographic groups (i.e., gender, age, marital status, level of education, and employment situation) and over time. Both one-factor and two-factor re-specified models met all the pre-established fit criteria. However, because the factors identified in the two-factor model were highly correlated (r = .86), the one-factor model was preferred for its parsimony. Multi-group CFA indicated measurement invariance across different demographic groups and across time. The present findings suggest that physicians in Spain can use the PHQ-9 to obtain a global score for depression severity in different demographic groups and to reliably monitor changes over time in the primary care setting."

Objective: To evaluate the short-term (post-intervention) and longer term (6-month) effectiveness of the newly developed, 8-session manualized family intervention for individuals with SCI and their family members compared to a control group. Methods: In this clinical demonstration project, longitudinal self-report data were collected from 8 individuals with SCI and their family members in Colombia, South America. The 8 families were randomly assigned to either the SCI intervention group or the waitlist control group. The intervention group included 10 individuals from 4 different families, with a mean age of 41.40 years (SD = 14.18). The control group was composed of 13 individuals from 4 different families with a mean age of 44.38 years (SD = 14.76). All participants completed Spanish versions of instruments that assessed depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), burden (Zarit Burden Interview), and perceived problem-solving skills (Problem-Solving Inventory). Results: Results provide preliminary evidence that symptoms of depression, anxiety, and burden as well as problem-solving appraisals improved significantly for individuals who participated in the intervention, whereas no change in symptoms was observed among those in the waitlist control group. Conclusions: Findings suggest that this newly developed intervention for families facing SCI can be beneficial; however, this pilot study represents only the first step in the examination of the efficacy and effectiveness of this intervention."

A binary logistic regression was then performed to measure whether univariate associations remain significant after correction for other variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Chi-square analysis revealed significant differences in screening based on univariate associations of language, gender and number of office visits. No significant difference was found for age or ethnicity. Binary logistic regression revealed the following odds ratio of being screened for depression for each variable: Spanish language (OR = 0.694, CI = 0.559 to 0.862), female gender (OR = 1.155, CI = 1.005 to 1.328) and office visit frequency of three or more office visits per year (OR = 2.103, CI = 1.835 to 2.410).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Spanish-speaking adults were significantly less likely to be screened for depression than their English-speaking counterparts. Women were more likely to be screened than men, and the odds of screening increased with more frequent exposure to the office. Future studies should be directed at validating these findings in multiple clinical settings."

            "abstract": "This population-based study focused on the validity of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for screening major depressive episodes in the general population in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Households were selected by multi-stage sampling, and adults (> 20 years) were invited to participate. The gold standard was the structured diagnostic Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), applied by psychiatrists and psychologists. Both the PHQ-9 and the MINI were applied in the subjects' homes. In a total of 447 participants (191 men and 256 women), the continuous analysis identified > 9 as the cutoff point with the highest sensitivity (77.5%; 61.5-89.2) and specificity (86.7%; 83.0- 89.9). Use of the test's algorithm decreased the sensitivity to 42.5% (27.0-59.1), while the specificity increased to 95.3% (92.8-97.2). The PHQ-9 proved appropriate for screening major depressive episodes. For greater sensitivity, the continuously scored PHQ-9 proved more adequate than the algorithm for screening major depressive episodes in the community."

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,517 pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Item 9 of the PHQ-9 assesses suicidal ideation over the last 14 days while item 10 of the EPDS assesses suicidal ideation in the past 7 days.

Using Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) criteria for past-12-month major depressive disorder as the reference standard, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of the PHQ-9 for detecting depression were assessed at various cutpoints of the PHQ-9. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate one- and two-factor structures for the PHQ-9. Cronbach's alpha was computed for the entire PHQ-9 scale and for subscales supported by CFA.

            "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition among the general population, and its prevalence is even higher among patients hospitalized due to medical illnesses. It has been estimated that one out of four patients hospitalized for medical illness has a comorbid major depressive episode (MDE) The presence of depression in a patient hospitalized due to a medical illness worsens the medical prognosis, increases symptom burden, complicates self-care and treatment-adherence, extends the hospitalization stay, and inflates the costs of care and mortality. Taking into account that patients with depression can be effectively treated with medication and psychotherapy, early diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce this burden . Despite this, almost 50% of patients who suffer comorbid depression when hospitalized for medical conditions do not have the condition detected by clinicians. This is explained, at least in part, by the lack of quick and sensitive diagnostic tools, especially for use in specific languages and cultures. Structured clinical interviews such as the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)  or the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) are the gold standard for diagnosing depression. However, the use of these instruments require administration by trained mental health professionals, are time-consuming and difficult to systematically apply in routine clinical practice. This highlights the need for reliable, valid, and easily applicable self-assessment screening tools to detect depression in patients hospitalized due to a non-psychiatric medical illness. Several self-screening tools are available for screening, tracking and documenting depressive symptoms with minimal clinician time, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). To our knowledge, no studies have compared, at the same time and with the same sample, the psychometric properties of these three self-rated questionaries' with a semi-structured clinical interview in patients hospitalized for non-psychiatric medical illness.

Our aims are to: (1) compare the operating characteristics of PHQ-9, BDI-II and HADS according to an independent criterion standard for MDE in patients hospitalized due to non-psychiatric medical illness; (2) determine the optimum cut-off scores of these self-rating scales for discriminating between patients with and without MDE in this specific group of patients. The results of this study will provide general practitioners with highly valuable information to choose an assessment tool for depression in this subgroup of patients."

            "abstract": "The syndemics theory seeks to understand the effect of multiple synergic problems in promoting poor health outcomes. To disentangle which and how syndemic conditions affect the quality of life (QoL) may be important to improve well-being of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). This study evaluates the association between syndemic conditions and QoL among PLWHA. We performed a secondary analysis using data obtained between 2014 and 2017 among PLWHA under care in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The outcomes were the six QoL domains (physical, psychological, level of independence, social relationships, environmental, and spirituality) measured through the World Health Organization Quality of Life in HIV infection scale, abbreviated version (WHOQOL-HIV-BREF). The independent variables were demographic and clinical characteristics, syndemic conditions (binge drinking, compulsive sexual behavior, polysubstance use, intimate partner violence, and depression), and syndemics (two or more syndemic conditions simultaneously). Bivariate analysis (t-test and ANOVA) and linear regressions were performed for each quality-of-life domain. The analytical sample comprised 1530 participants, mostly male at birth (64%) and with median age of 43 years. The syndemic conditions most frequently observed were binge drinking (56%), IPV (13%), and depression (9%). Both individual syndemic conditions and syndemics were associated with worse QoL. In the multivariate analysis, positive screening for depression was associated with worse QoL in all domains. Polysubstance users presented worse QoL at social and environmental domains. Intimate partner violence was associated with worse QoL at environment domain while binge drinking was associated with worse scores in the physical domain. The presence of syndemics increased the likelihood of worse scores in the psychological, social, and environment domains. Our study expands the understanding of QoL in PLWHA, as it considers a holistic/integral, multifactorial, and synergistic approach to the determinants of QoL. Seeking strategies that target syndemics may be important to improve patient-centered outcomes in health.Abbreviations: HIV/AIDS: human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndromeWHO: World Health OrganizationQoL: quality of lifeHRQoL: health-related quality of lifePLWHA: people living with HIV/AIDScART: combined antiretroviral therapyIPV: intimate partner violenceINI/FIOCRUZ: Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious DiseasesOswaldo Cruz FoundationSRH: self-rated healthVL: viral loadCD4: CD4 cell countNIAAA: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and AlcoholismCSBcompulsive sexual behaviorWHO-ASSIST: alcoholsmoking and substance involvement screening test developed by the World Health OrganizationPHQ-2: Patient Health Questionnaire-2."

            "abstract": "Today's college students are at increased risk for depression. Therefore, accurate and sustainable assessment of depressive symptoms among college students has become an important issue. One promising instrument for depression screening in college settings is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a 9-item self-report measure developed in primary care and designed to assess the presence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) symptom criteria for major depressive disorder. Although the PHQ-9 has been well validated in primary care settings, no studies have examined its factor structure for diverse college populations in the United States. This study used confirmatory factor analysis to test competing measurement models and the measurement invariance of the PHQ-9 across gender (men and women) and racial/ethnic groups (African American, Asian American, European American, Latino/a American) in a sample of 857 U.S. college students. Results supported a 1-factor model of the PHQ-9. Based on configural, metric, and scalar invariance test results, the PHQ-9 assesses depressive symptoms equivalently across gender and racial/ethnic groups. In support of validity evidence, PHQ-9 scores were positively associated with alcohol use and negatively associated with mental well-being. Implications for future research and assessment are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Based on the Treatment-Resistant Depression in America Latina (TRAL) study, epidemiology and burden of TRD in MDD patients from Argentina is reported in this paper. A sample of adult MDD patients (n=396) from 5 sites in Argentina, with clinical diagnosis were included. Patients with psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, dementia, with severe chemical dependence or currently participating in another clinical trial were excluded. Patient reported outcomes and clinical assessment scales were used as outcomes. The prevalence of TRD in MDD patients in Argentina is 33.2%, based on TRAL data. Patients in TRD are older compared to those without TRD, and was more evident in married/consensual union MDD patients. Higher suicidality, greater comorbidity based on MINI, and worse scores in MADRS and PHQ-9 were identified in TRD patients. The prevalence identified in TRAL study for Argentina is substantial comparing with other Latin American countries and worldwide prevalence. TRD represents a disproportional burden to society, and efforts should be placed on reducing the burden of MDD and TRD in Argentina by improving early diagnosis, therapeutic management and ensuring that all patients have better access to mental healthcare."

The aim of the present study of primary care patients with emotional disorders was to analyse the associations between four different QoL domains and the most prevalent clinical symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety and somatization), while controlling for sociodemographic variables. A total of 1241 participants from 28 primary care centres in Spain were assessed with the following instruments: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 to evaluate depression; the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD)-7 for anxiety; PHQ-15 for somatization; and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Short Form (WHOQOL-Bref) to assess four broad QoL domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. The associations between the symptoms and QoL domains were examined using hierarchical regression analyses. Adjusted QoL mean values as a function of the number of overlapping diagnoses were calculated. The contribution of sociodemographic variables to most QoL domains was modest, explaining anywhere from 2% to 11% of the variance. However, adding the clinical variables increased the variance explained by 12% to 40% depending on the specific QoL domain. Depression was the strongest predictor for all domains. The number of overlapping diagnoses adversely affected all QoL domains, with each additional diagnosis reducing the main QoL subscales by 5 to 10 points. In primary care patients with a diagnostic impression of an emotional disorders as identified by their treating GP, clinical symptoms explained more of the variance in QoL than sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, level of education, marital status, work status, and income. Given the strong relationship between depressive symptoms and QoL, treatment of depression may constitute a key therapeutic target to improve QoL in people with emotional disorders in primary care."

The objective of this study was to determine whether LI into trigger points combined with a PT program would be more effective than each separate treatment alone in improving pain, function, and quality of life in a group of patients with MPS of the shoulder girdle and cervical region.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A single-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) was conducted with three parallel groups in the Departments of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of two urban hospitals in Medellin, Colombia. One hundred and twenty seven patients with shoulder girdle MPS for more than 6 weeks and pain greater than 40 mm on the visual analog scale (VAS) were assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups: PT, LI, or the combination of both (PT + LI). The primary outcome was VAS pain rating at 1-month post-treatment. The secondary outcomes included VAS pain rating at 3 months, and, at both 1 and 3 months post-treatment: (a) function, evaluated by hand-back maneuver and the hand-mouth maneuver, (b) quality of life, as measured by sub-scales of the Short Form - 36 (SF-36), and (c) depressive symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9).

The goal of this study was to identify and categorize hospitalized Spanish-speaking injury survivors' posttraumatic concerns. Method: A secondary analysis of baseline data collected as part of a larger randomized comparative effectiveness trial was conducted. Participants were 22 male and female Spanish, non-English, speaking survivors of intentional and unintentional injuries, ages ≥ 18. At baseline, while hospitalized, each patient was asked to describe the nature and severity of their post-injury concerns. Patient concern narratives were audio-recorded and later transcribed. Raters coded patients' transcribed concerns into content domains. The associations between patient self-reported concern severity and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms assessed with the PTSD Checklist and depressive symptoms assessed with the PHQ-9 were also ascertained. Results: The concerns of Spanish-speaking patients were reliably categorized into previously described content domains (i.e., work and finance, physical health, social, psychological, medical, and legal domains). The composite Kappa statistic across domains was 0.83 (95% Confidence Interval = 0.74, 0.92). Spanish-speaking patients also expressed novel concerns, including immigration, discriminatory experiences, and Coronavirus pandemic, related concerns. The number of severe patient concerns was highly correlated with PHQ-9 depressive symptom levels (r = 0.52, p < .05). Conclusions: The concerns of Spanish-speaking trauma survivors can be readily elicited and reliably interpreted. Future research could integrate concern narrative elicitation and amelioration into stepped care intervention procedures in order to engage diverse Spanish-speaking injury survivors and advance equitable trauma care system service delivery."

            "abstract": "A major barrier to improving care effectiveness for mental health is a lack of consensus on outcomes measurement. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) has already developed a consensus-based standard set of outcomes for anxiety and depression in adults (including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale, and the WHO Disability Schedule). This Position Paper reports on recommendations specifically for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder in children and young people aged between 6 and 24 years. An international ICHOM working group of 27 clinical, research, and lived experience experts formed a consensus through teleconferences, an exercise using an adapted Delphi technique (a method for reaching group consensus), and iterative anonymous voting, supported by sequential research inputs. A systematic scoping review identified 70 possible outcomes and 107 relevant measurement instruments. Measures were appraised for their feasibility in routine practice (ie, brevity, free availability, validation in children and young people, and language translation) and psychometric performance (ie, validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change). The final standard set recommends tracking symptoms, suicidal thoughts and behaviour, and functioning as a minimum through seven primarily patient-reported outcome measures: the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory for Children, the Children's Revised Impact of Events Scale, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, the KIDSCREEN-10, the Children's Global Assessment Scale, and the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale. The set's recommendations were validated through a feedback survey involving 487 participants across 45 countries. The set should be used alongside the anxiety and depression standard set for adults with clinicians selecting age-appropriate measures."

Meta-analytic reviews reveal wide variation in therapist-attributable variability in psychotherapy outcomes, with most studies reporting therapist effects in the region of 5% to 10% and some finding minimal to no therapist effects. However, all except one study to date have been conducted in high-intensity or mixed intervention groups; therefore, there is scarcity of evidence on therapist effects in brief low-intensity psychological interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To examine therapist effects in low-intensity interventions for depression and anxiety in a naturalistic setting.\n    \n\n\n          Data and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Session-by-session data on patient-reported outcome measures were available for a cohort of 1,376 primary care psychotherapy patients treated by 38 therapists. Outcome measures included PHQ-9 (sensitive to depression) and GAD-7 (sensitive to general anxiety disorder) measures. Three-level hierarchical linear modelling was employed to estimate therapist-attributable proportion of variance in clinical outcomes. Therapist effects were evaluated using the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bayesian empirical predictions of therapist random effects. Three sensitivity analyses were conducted: 1) using both treatment completers and non-completers; 2) a sub-sample of cases with baseline scores above the conventional clinical thresholds for PHQ-9 and GAD-7; and 3) a two-level model (using patient-level pre- and post-treatment scores nested within therapists).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The ICC estimates for all outcome measures were very small, ranging between 0% and 1.3%, although most were statistically significant.

Twenty people diagnosed with DM/HBP having a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥ 15 points were recruited. The TCC program consisted of a face-to-face, computer-assisted psychosocial intervention (CPI, five biweekly sessions), telephone monitoring (TM), and a mobile phone application for behavioral activation (CONEMO). Assessments of depressive symptoms and other health-related outcomes were made. Thirteen patients completed the CAPI, 12 received TM, and none tried CONEMO. The TCC program was potentially efficacious in treating depression, with two-thirds of participants achieving response to depression treatment 12 weeks after baseline. Decreases were observed in depressive symptoms and healthcare visits and increases in mental health-related quality of life and adherence to treatment. Patients perceived the CPI as acceptable. The TCC program was partially feasible and potentially efficacious for managing depression in people with DM/HBP. These data are valuable inputs for a future randomized clinical trial."

The multivariate model showed that, adjusted by location, being female, being between 35 and 44 years old, having experienced at least one stressful life event, currently smoking, and having a history of chronic medical diseases were independently associated with an increased risk of MDE, while having higher education and being married or living with a partner reduced the risk of MDE.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      These results are representative of the selected cities included in the study. As such extrapolation to the general populations of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay should be done with caution CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence and variability of MDE in the Southern Cone of Latin America."

However, depression prevalence is lower in Latinos (8% to 15%, with Spanish speakers at 8%) than non-Latino whites (22%). As a result of these prevalence differences, PCPs may use ethnicity and language of the patient to determine depression screening behaviors.

Methods: Review of all adolescents referred for multidisciplinary evaluation in a developmental center in 2019. Data included demographics, DD diagnoses, and use of and scores on the PHQ-9 at initial visit. Statistics included chi-square and non-parametrics. Results: Of all the children evaluated in 2019 (n = 240), 52 were adolescents, 35 boys (63%)/17 girls (37%), age 14 ± 2 years old, and 27 (54%) belonging to a bilingual English-Spanish household. DD: Developmental Language Disorder (88%), Learning Disabilities (54%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (44%), Autism Spectrum Disorder (25%), Intellectual Disabilities (12%), and Phonological Disorder (8%). The PHQ-9 was administered to 30 (58%) individuals. Scores varied from minimal depression for 17 (57%), mild for 10 (33%), and moderate and severe for 3 (10%); 3 patients endorsed suicidality. Females were more likely to obtain higher scores on the PHQ-9 than males.

The 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) is an ultrabrief screening instrument for anxiety and depression with sound psychometric properties demonstrated in the general population and primary care, but not among pregnant women. The aim of this study was to provide initial evidence of the validity and reliability of the PHQ-4 among pregnant women. Materials and Methods: Data from an international sample of 1148 pregnant women who participated in an online cross-sectional survey were examined using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multigroup analysis approaches. Average chronological and gestational ages were 27.7 years old (standard deviation [SD] = 6.5) and 16.8 weeks (SD = 10.6), respectively. Participants were from diverse cultural backgrounds and English and Spanish speaking (n = 587 and n = 561, respectively). Results: CFA reflected two distinct factors, which accounted for 59% of the proportion of variance in the two anxiety items and 50% in the two depression items. Coefficient H values of 0.74 for anxiety and 0.70 for depression suggested good factor reliability. Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating initial evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the PHQ-4 in pregnant women. Should this study be replicated, a clinical interview, which is the gold standard procedure, should be included. Regardless, the PHQ-4 may be a useful ultrabrief resource for maternal mental health clinicians and health care providers who need to identify potential cases of anxiety and depression in pregnant women using efficient and evidence-based tools."

However, no Spanish validation has been published. The aim of this study was to validate a Spanish version of the BEAQ in a clinical sample treated at a community mental health unit.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants ( N = 332) completed the BEAQ as well as other self-report measures of experiential avoidance and psychopathology.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Internal consistency was satisfactory (α = .82). No statistically significant gender differences were found in the BEAQ scores. The data also showed high test-retest reliability after four to six weeks, acceptable concurrent validity with another experiential avoidance measure and acceptable convergent validity with the psychopathology measure. The principal component analysis, forcing the one factor solution proposed in the original scale, produced indicators similar to the English version of the BEAQ.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results firmly support the reliability and validity of this Spanish validation, stressing its usefulness as a measure of experiential avoidance in clinical populations."

Disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] disability index [DI]), pain (visual analog scale), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) were assessed each time. Disease activity (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28] using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate), serology results, radiographs, treatments, and irreversible articular damage were also recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At baseline, 71% had significant disability (HAQ DI >1), and 34% were depressed.

Baseline to 12-month HAQ DI recovery exceeding the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) occurred in 42% of patients. Recovery was associated with concurrent improvements in DAS28, pain, and PHQ-9 scores (albeit below their respective MCIDs), as well as with absence of erosions.

It is necessary to help the relatives of people with SBD to reduce their discomfort and burden. Family Connections (FC) is a program that has been shown to be effective in reducing burden, depression, and anxiety, and increasing dominance and validating behaviors in relatives of people with borderline personality disorder. However, there are no RCTs that demonstrate the efficacy of the FC program in patients with SBD. Our research team adapted FC for relatives of people with SBD for delivery in the Spanish population (FC-SBD). The FC-SBD program contains 12 two-hour sessions held once a week. The first aim is to verify the efficacy of the FC-SBD intervention for relatives of people diagnosed with SBD in a randomized control trial with a Spanish sample. The second objective is to analyze the feasibility and acceptance of FC-SBD in relatives.

This is a quantitative and cross-sectional study, carried out in the inland of the state of São Paulo with 111 caregivers, 60 of whom were unpaid and 51 were paid. The caregivers answered a questionnaire for the assessment of sociodemographic and care characteristics, the Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), and the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ). Unpaid caregivers were older, married, have been providing care for a longer period of time, and devoted more days and hours per week to care when compared to paid caregivers. Depressive symptoms and mental disorders (non-psychotic) are related to the levels of burden in both paid and unpaid caregivers (p < 0.001). The care process causes harm such as burden, depressive symptoms, and mental disorders in paid and unpaid caregivers. Thus, it is important to think about coping strategies to minimize the psychological consequences of the care process."

One screening tool, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which was developed for use in primary care has also gained popularity in research settings. The reliability and validity of the PHQ-9 has been well established among predominantly Caucasian samples, in addition to many minority groups. However, there is little evidence regarding its utility among Hispanic Americans, a large and growing cultural group in the United States. In this study, we investigated the reliability and structural validity of the PHQ-9 in Hispanic American women. A community sample of 479 Latina women from southern California completed the PHQ-9 in their preferred language of English or Spanish. Cronbach's alphas suggested that there was good internal consistency for both the English- and Spanish-language versions. Structural validity was investigated using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. Results support a similar one-factor structure with equivalent response patterns and variances among English- and Spanish-speaking Latinas. These results suggest that the PHQ-9 can be used with confidence in both English and Spanish versions to screen Latinas for depression."

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 164 low-income Latino patients at San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC) who had been recruited into a mental health program between January 2007 and March 2008. Patients were between the ages of 18 and 83 years, 54 were males and 109 females. Patients were screened using the 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), a standardized instrument used to measure depression severity. We used regression models to analyze the relationship between severity of depression and CVD risk factors. Seventy-eight percent of the patients had at least mild depression based on PHQ-9 score categories. Significant age-adjusted pairwise associations were found with CVD risk factors; body mass index (BMI), diabetes status, serum cholesterol level, and serum triglyceride level were all associated with depression severity score. Regression models indicated that diabetic patients on anti-depressive medication with higher BMI scores and triglyceride levels had significantly higher depression severity scores. Clinicians should be made aware that depressive symptoms may impede efforts to modify BMI, serum triglycerides, anti-depression medication, and diabetes among Latino patients. They should, therefore, screen and treat depression among Latinos at risk to CVD."

The instruments consisted of the 8-item EUROHIS-QOL, PHQ-9, Social Support Questionnaire, WHOQoL-SRPB, and CD-RISC.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 3,274 participants were included in this study. 23.67% of the participants met the criteria for a depressive episode. Higher age, spirituality, social support, resiliency, and quality of life were associated with less depressive symptoms. Quarantine length; mental health treatment; chronic disease; age; sex; lower levels of spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, physical exercise, and education; and unpaid occupation were found to be predictors of depressive symptoms during COVID-19 quarantine.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The data are limited to the pandemic initial period, the sample isn't random and the use of self-reported questionnaires are some limitations of our study.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil, quarantine time, treatment for mental health, chronic illness, lower levels of education, and unpaid occupation were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Age, sex, spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, and physical exercise showed a negative relationship with depressive symptoms."

Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to assess the occurrence of depressive symptoms longitudinally and to analyze the association between sociodemographic characteristics, working conditions and violence at work with depressive symptoms over time among Spanish-speaking au pairs living in Germany. A prospective cohort study was performed with three measurement intervals, which included 189 participants. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models were implemented to estimate the association between predictors and depressive symptoms. Au pairs who worked >40 h per week were more than three times more likely to experience depression than those who did not (OR: 3.47; 95% CI: 1.46-8.28). In addition, those exposed to physical violence were almost five times more likely to suffer from depression (OR: 4.95; 95% CI: 2.16-9.75), and au pairs who had bad schedule adaptation to social and family commitments had twice the risk of depression than those who did not (OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 0.95-5.28). This knowledge could be of interest for future au pairs, host families, au pair agencies and policy makers. Together, they could improve awareness and monitoring of au pair working conditions."

The intervention was cost-effective based on the €30,000 willingness-to-pay threshold typically applied in Spain (equivalent to approximately $36,060). According to the deterministic sensitivity analyses, the potential reduction of costs associated with intervention scale-up would reduce the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the intervention, although it remained more costly than usual care.

As part of the WOMAP (Woman Mental Health and Addictions on Pregnancy) initiative, our study aimed to describe the prevalence of co-occurring mental illness and substance use problems, diagnoses and severity of those considered at risk and rates of treatment.A screening of 2,014 pregnant women was done using the AC-OK scale and they were asked about their smoking habits and services use for mental health/substance abuse. Of these, 170 women were considered at risk of co-occurring mental illness and substance use problems (≥ 2 positive responses to the AC-OK-Mental Health subscale, ≥ 1 positive response to the AC-OK-Substance Abuse subscale and/or smoking more than once a month and no use of specialized services) and were assessed with a more extensive battery of measures (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], General Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7], Posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] Checklist for DSM-5 [PCL-5], Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Test [DAST] and Fagerström).In the last year, 614 women (30.5%) smoked tobacco (42.5% daily) and 9.8% were positive for both substance use and mental illness per the AC-OK. Only 11.1% of them received specific treatment in the previous three months while another 13.6% were scheduled to attend services in the following month. From the subsample assessed in depth, 62(36.5%) endorsed at least moderate depression, 35(20.6%) endorsed at least moderate anxiety, 32(18.8%) endorsed PTSD on the PCL, and 37 out of 88 alcohol users scored above the threshold in AUDIT (≥ 3). In conclusion, high prevalence and low treatment rates suggest that effective detection mechanisms should be integrated into usual care, allowing for early interventions."

Patients ≥ 18 years old, with a diagnosis of RA according to ACR-EULAR 2010 criteria, were included in a cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic data, comorbidities, RA characteristics, disease activity, and current treatment were registered. Questionnaires were administered, including EQ-5D-3 L, QOL-RA II, HAQ-A, and PHQ-9. The QOL-RA II was re-administered in 20 patients to evaluate reproducibility. Four hundred and thirty patients were included. Median QOL-RA was 6.6 (IQR 5.3-8). Mean time to complete it was 1.7 ± 0.57 min and to calculate it was 12 ± 1.7 s. It showed very good reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.97), reproducibility (ICC, 0.96), and good correlation between the different items and the total questionnaire, without evidence of redundancy. Besides, QOL-RA II presented good correlation with EQ-5D-3L (Rho, 0.6) and moderate with DAS28 (Rho, 0.38), and CDAI (Rho, 0.46). Worse quality of life was observed in patients not doing physical activity, unemployed, and current smokers. Patients with higher disease activity had a significant poorer quality of life. Adjusting by age, sex and disease duration, unemployment, higher disease activity, disability, and the presence of depression were independently associated to worse quality of life. QOL-RA II demonstrated good construct validity, reproducibility, and reliability. It was easy to complete and calculate and does not require a license for its use, thus making it the optimal tool for assessing the quality of life in Spanish-speaking patients with RA. Key Points • The evaluation of quality of life is very important in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. • Most of the questionnaires used to assess the quality of life require a license to use. • QOL-RA II is a valid and simple questionnaire to evaluate the quality of life of patients with RA and does not require a license for its use."

At the population level, multimorbidity, frailty and late-life depression are associated with similar adverse outcomes (i.e. falls, disability, hospitalization, death), share the same risk factors, and partly overlap in their clinical presentation. Moreover, these three variables may share a common underlying pathophysiological mechanism like immune-metabolic dysregulation. The overall objectives of MiMiCS-FRAIL are 1) to explore (determinants of) the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between multimorbidity, depression, and frailty among non-demented geriatric outpatients; 2) to evaluate molecular levels of senoinflammation as a broad pathophysiological process underlying these conditions; and 3) to examine adverse outcomes of multimorbidity, frailty and depression and their interconnectedness.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      MiMiCS-FRAIL is an ongoing observational cohort study of geriatric outpatients in Brazil, with an extensive baseline assessment and yearly follow-up assessments. Each assessment includes a comprehensive geriatric assessment to identify multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes, a structured psychiatric diagnostic interview and administration of the PHQ-9 to measure depression, and several frailty measures (FRAIL, Physical Phenotype criteria, 36-item Frailty Index). Fasten blood samples are collected at baseline to assess circulating inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, leukocytes' subpopulations, and to perform immune-metabolic-paired miRome analyses. The primary outcome is death and secondary outcomes are the number of falls, hospital admissions, functional ability, well-being, and dementia. Assuming a 5-year mortality rate between 25 and 40% and a hazard rate varying between 1.6 and 2.3 for the primary determinants require a sample size between 136 and 711 patients to detect a statistically significant effect with a power of 80% (beta = 0.2), an alpha of 5% (0.05), and an R2 between the predictor (death) and all covariates of 0.20.

It has also been reported that depression among older people is underdiagnosed. As a result, the mental health needs of this group are insufficiently met. The aim of this study was to explore gender differences in the factors associated with positive screens for depression and self-reported diagnosis among older adults in Chile.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from 3786 older adults who participated in the Social Protection Survey in 2016 were analysed. PHQ-9 was used to identify screen-positive cases. Self-reported diagnosis of depression was used to determine the proportion of people with a screen-positive result who had received a diagnosis of depression. Logistic regression models were used to determine sociodemographic and health factors associated with depression and underdiagnosis in older men and women.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of a screen-positive result was 20.91% (5.83% major depressive disorder) among men, and 36.38% (12.43% major depressive disorder) among women. 18.77% of men and 34.11% of women with a positive depression screening had received a diagnosis.

This is a secondary data analysis, using data collected in the screening of participants to be included in the PROACTIVE cluster randomized trial. Individuals aged ≥ 60 years, registered in primary care clinics in Guarulhos, were assessed for sociodemographic characteristics, depressive symptoms according to the PHQ-9, mobile phone ownership, and use of WhatsApp. We performed multiple logistic regression models to investigate characteristics of the potential users of digital interventions. Of 3,356 older adults screened for depression, 45.7% said they use WhatsApp to receive/send messages. In the subsample that presented depressive symptomatology (n = 1,020), 41.9% stated using WhatsApp. Younger older adults and those with better socioeconomic status used more WhatsApp and were more likely to own a mobile phone. Participants with higher levels of symptoms of depression were less likely to use WhatsApp. Gender, age, schooling level, income, and depressive symptomatology are variables associated with the possession of a cell phone and with the use of WhatsApp by the older adults of the sample. These findings can help to implement digital health programs better suited to disadvantaged populations in Brazil and other low- and middle-income countries through mental telehealth interventions using WhatsApp and mobile health services to the older people."

This study evaluates mental health in older and elderly Puerto Ricans 6 months after the hurricanes and suggests strategies for improving future psychosocial responses. Patients attending clinics were evaluated for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and suicide risk (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions [ASQ]) and were surveyed about their perceived safety, designated as a proxy for anxiety. Used in conjunction, PHQ-9 and ASQ were found to identify a greater proportion of individuals experiencing adverse mental health effects than if each instrument was used in isolation. Patients were also surveyed about time to water and electricity restoration, and it was found that prolonged time to water restoration was associated with increased prevalence and severity of depression and decreased perceived safety. Based on collected patient data (n = 523), using multiple mental health screening tools for diagnosis, improving perceptions of home safety or anxiety, and prioritizing water restoration may reduce mental health sequelae in the elderly and enhance the effect of psychosocial responses following disasters."

Some patients develop de novo psychiatric symptoms or have exacerbation of pre-existing conditions during DA therapy. A practical, clinically sensitive depression and impulse control disorders (ICD; particularly hypersexuality and gambling disorders) detection tool is important for identifying at risk patients. The Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) are sensitive in identifying impulsivity and depression. Objective: Detail use of the BIS-11 and PHQ-9 as screening tools for depression and ICD in patients with pituitary disease at a high-volume academic pituitary center. Methods: DA-treated and naïve patients with pituitary disease were included. Patients with a known history of depression or psychiatric disorder were excluded. PHQ-9 standardized interpretation criteria were utilized to classify depression severity. For BIS-11, threshold was established based on previous studies. Statistical analysis was with SPSS version 25. Results: Seventy-six DA-treated and 27 naïve patients were included. Moderate and moderately severe depression were more prevalent in DA-treated patients; severe depression only found in DA-treated patients. A normal BIS-11 score was noted in 76.69%; higher scores (not significant) were noted in DA-treated patients. There was a positive correlation between higher BIS-11 and PHQ-9 scores; higher in DA-treated patients (r = 0.52, p < 0.001) than DA-naïve patients. Patients with BIS-11 scores ≥60 were younger and received lower cumulative DA doses compared to patients with BIS scores <60. There was no association between male sex and BIS-11 ≥60 and male sex did not increase the odds of increased scores (OR = 0.66, CI95% 0.25-1.76, p = 0.41). No significant difference was found for macroadenoma, prolactin levels, testosterone levels, hypogonadism, testosterone replacement in men, and increased impulsivity or depression scores. Conclusion: Use of PHQ-9 and BIS-11 is practical for routine screening of depression and ICD during outpatient pituitary clinic visits for patients with pituitary disease both naïve to treatment and during DA therapy. We recommend close follow-up after initiation of DA therapy for younger patients, regardless of dose."

Perceived self-efficacy and positive affect (PA) were correlated, as perceived helplessness with anxious symptoms and negative affect (NA). Regression analysis showed that sex, anxiety symptoms, and NA explained perceived helplessness while positive and NA explained self-efficacy. The structural regression model analysis identified that fear of COVID-19 (composed of fear of infecting others and fear of contagion), predicted mental health conditions (i.e., depressive or anxiety symptoms); also, mental health conditions were predicted by PA and NA. Perceived helplessness and Perceived self-efficacy were interrelated and represented the perceived stress variable.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We proposed an explanatory model of perceived stress based on two correlated dimensions (self-efficacy and helplessness) in the Peruvian general population during the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with two out of three individuals surveyed having at least one mental health condition."

Major depressive episodes were associated with a reported lack of personal protective equipment (PR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01-1.42), whereas suicidal ideation was inversely related to per capita income > 3 minimum monthly wages (PR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.11-0.68), and positively related to the use of psychotropic drugs (PR: 3.14; 95% CI: 1.87-5.26).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our results suggest that nursing professionals' working conditions are associated with their mental health status.

Person's health conditions worsen and daily functioning declines in the presence of depression. However, little attention has been given to how depression is accurately assessed in diverse populations from other countries residing in the United States. Thus, this study examined the factor structure, factorial invariance, concurrent validity, and convergent validity of the widely used 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) among emerging adults of Mexican and Central American (e.g., Salvadorians, Guatemalans) men and women residing in the United States. Undergraduate student participants (n = 2,782) completed an online or paper-and-pencil version of the assessment. Support was found for two-factor and one-factor solutions; however, the unidimensional structure was recommended due to the very high correlation between the two factors (r ≥ .87). The unidimensional scale was invariant between (a) Mexican and Central American descent and (b) men and women. Depressive symptoms (as measured in the PHQ-8) were significantly correlated with another valid and reliable measured of depression, and scores on the PHQ-8 were significantly correlated with theoretically related variables (i.e., quality of life, parental support, and perceived stress).

            "abstract": "Adolescent depression is a clinically relevant concern that has major implications for mental and physical health. The trajectory of depressive symptoms among adolescents suggests that there is likely variability throughout this developmental period. The aim of the study was to assess the longitudinal relationship between individual symptoms of depression among early and middle adolescents to provide guidance for future research investigating targeted intervention efforts. Data were extracted from electronic medical records (2015-2017) from a pediatric primary care clinic in an urban setting. Cross-Lagged Panel Network analysis was used to evaluate symptoms of depression measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) measured twice over a 1-year period among early adolescents (ages 11-13 years; n = 309) and middle adolescents (ages 14-16 years; n = 255). The sample was predominantly Hispanic (90%) and 56% female. The analyses highlighted key differences and similarities between early and middle adolescence, largely focused on the role of suicidal ideation and tightly linked with feelings of failure and appetitive disturbance. In early adolescence suicidal ideation was highly likely to lead to other symptoms. In middle adolescence, however, suicidal ideation no longer had connections to other symptoms and instead the strongest connections were toward suicidal ideation. Interestingly, across both early and middle adolescence feelings of failure and appetitive disturbance were highly likely to lead to suicidal ideation. These exploratory findings highlight several longitudinal associations between early and middle adolescence that provide insight into differences and similarities regarding how symptoms might progress within those developmental periods. Taken together these results can provide direction for future research to evaluate brief, targeted interventions for adolescents."

The total score for the CES-D 10 displayed acceptable internal consistencies (Cronbach's alpha's = .80-.86) and test-retest reliability (r values = .41-.70) across the total sample, language group and ethnic background group. The total CES-D 10 scores correlated in a theoretically consistent manner with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, r = .72, p < .001, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression measure, r = .80, p < .001, the Short Form-12's Mental Component Summary, r = -.65, p < .001, and Physical Component Summary score, r = -.25, p < .001. A confirmatory factor analysis showed that a 1-factor model fit the CES-D 10 data well (CFI = .986, RMSEA = .047) after correlating 1 pair of item residual variances. Multiple group analyses showed the 1-factor structure to be invariant across English and Spanish speaking responders and partially invariant across Hispanic/Latino background groups. The total score of the CES-D 10 can be recommended for use with Hispanics/Latinos in English and Spanish. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Patients with both conditions have a worse prognosis and higher disability, and their treatment options are scarce. Behavioral activation (BA) may be an especially useful intervention for these patients, as it targets mechanisms of action that seem to be common to both disorders. Nevertheless, its efficacy has not been examined in people with both conditions. We describe the design and rationale of a randomized clinical trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding BA (applied in groups) to usual care in order to reduce the severity of depressive symptoms (primary outcome) among Chilean women with fibromyalgia and major depression (N = 90). Pain intensity, fibromyalgia impact, pain catastrophizing and hypervigilance, physical health symptoms, environmental reward, and BA will be evaluated as secondary outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Women will be randomized to an experimental arm (n = 45) which will receive usual care (UC) for fibromyalgia with comorbid depression plus BA; and a comparison arm, which will receive only UC for fibromyalgia with comorbid depression (n = 45). Outcome assessment will take place at four time points: (1) at baseline, (2) when the experimental arm is under treatment (between sessions 6 and 7), (3) immediately after the experimental arm complete the treatment, and (4) at a 3-month follow-up. The following instruments will be used: Chilean version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Composed Pain Intensity Index, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQ-R), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire (PVAQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15), Reward Probability Index (RPI), and the Activation subscale of the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      We expect that, after treatment, the group receiving BA should experience greater reductions in the primary and secondary outcomes than the group receiving only UC.

Very little prior research, however, has examined potential variation in this relationship across different racial/ethnic groups.

Among White women, obesity was associated with significantly greater likelihood of depression (OR=2.37; 95% CI=1.41, 4.00) compared to normal weight. Among Black women, although not statistically significant, results are suggestive that obesity was inversely associated with depression (OR=0.56; 95% CI=0.28, 1.12) relative to normal weight.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9) is a brief (10 items) screening and monitoring measure designed for use in primary care settings that operationalizes most of the DSM-IV and ICD-9 diagnostic criteria for major depression. In the United States, the PHQ-9 has become the recommended depression measure in primary care settings. However, there are no published reports of its use in developing countries and no reports of the feasibility of using the Spanish version of the PHQ-9 to screen for depression. METHOD: During a medical brigade in October 2001, we tested the feasibility of using the Spanish PHQ-9 to screen for major depression in primary care clinics. A team of U.S. and Honduran physicians and medical students assessed 199 mothers of children under 10 years of age as part of a depression prevalence study in 5 rural sites. RESULTS: The PHQ-9 proved easy to administer to this population of poor, rural, young, and mostly illiterate Honduran women who had never participated in research before. Rater training required about 30 minutes of instruction for this group of physicians and medical students, plus occasional questions on the first day of use. Duration of administration of the PHQ-9 by interview ranged from 3 to 15 minutes. No items required major modification for cultural differences. The PHQ-9 identified a rate of 15% for major depression in this sample, and the PHQ-9 results showed a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 100% compared with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV mood disorders module. CONCLUSION: Like the English PHQ-9, the Spanish PHQ-9 is an efficient and reliable screening measure for major depression in primary care. It is useful as a research measure for estimating the prevalence of major depression and as an aid to the primary care clinician in rural Honduras."

The vulnerability of FSW is expressed in all health indicators. Indicators of health status, antenatal care, pap smear coverage, and contraception were worse than in the Brazilian population, and point out to the importance of increase FSW's access to health care services. Also, stigma and discrimination emerged as an important barrier to FSW's health care in all dimensions and need to be struggled."

Despite the growing evidence about the link between the pandemic, its control measures, and mental health worldwide, there is still no regional evidence of the potential mental health impact. We describe the prevalence and distribution of depressive symptoms across demographic and socioeconomic risk factors in the Peruvian population amidst a national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Cross-sectional study conducted during the community transmission phase and national lockdown in Peru (May 4th-16th, 2020). We recorded 64,493 responses from adult Peruvian residents through an opt-in online questionnaire. All analyses were weighted using raking based on proportions of sociodemographic variables from the last Peruvian census in 2017. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was calculated using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score of 10 or more. We identified associated demographic and socioeconomic factors by prior mental health diagnosis. Sensitivity analysis considered an alternative cut-off point for depressive symptoms of PHQ-9 ≥ 14.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 57,446 participants were included in the analytical sample. A third of the participants (n = 23,526, unweighted) showed depressive symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the study. Participants who reported a previous mental health diagnosis doubled the sample prevalence of depressive symptoms (59, 95%CI 56.7, 61.4%) of those without a prior diagnosis. Psychosocial and functioning reactions were largely more prevalent among females and young adults. A dose-response relationship was found between household income and depressive symptoms across previous mental health diagnosis strata, being as low as 32% less in the wealthiest than the most impoverished group (PR: 0.68, 95%CI 0.58,0.79). Other critical factors associated with a higher burden of depressive symptoms were lower education level, single, unemployed, and chronic comorbidity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      An increased burden of depressive symptoms and psychosocial reactions has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru compared to previous years. The mental health burden disproportionately affects women, the younger population, and those with low income and education.

We used data from 90,846 participants in the 2019 Brazilian National Survey of Health (PNS 2019), a population-based study with complex and probabilistic sampling. Sociodemographic and clinical data and information on homeopathy use during the last 12 months were collected. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression. All variables were categorized. Logistic regression models were built to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The prevalence of homeopathy use was 0.99% (95%CI: 0.98-1.00). In the adjusted analysis, the following variables were associated with higher use of homeopathy: female gender, age above 51 years, white ethnicity, higher socioeconomic and educational attainment, residence in Southern/Southeastern Brazil, poorer self-reported health status, and depression. Brazil shows increased offer of complementary medicine, including homeopathy.

Method: About 582 participants aged between 65 and 80 years were enrolled from primary care centers. They completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a survey with sociodemographic characteristics and the PHQ-9. Results: The PHQ-9 revealed an acceptable internal consistency (ω = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.75-0.80] and α = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.75-0.81]); confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a good fit for both 1- and 2-factor solutions. The chi-square difference test (χ2 = 0.61, gl = 1, p = 0.43) and correlation between the somatic and the cognitive-effective latent factors were very high (r = 0.97, p < 0.001), indicating that the 1 factor model was more parsimonious. Utilizing the CIDI as the gold standard, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88 (SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.84-0.90). The optimal cut-off score of ≥ 6 yielded good sensitivity and specificity for detecting MDD (0.95 and 0.76, respectively). However, considering the clinical utility index, the cut-off score of ≥9 proved to be a more effective marker for discarding cases of MDD. Conclusion: The PHQ-9 has adequate psychometric properties for elderly primary care users. In clinical settings, it showed its greatest utility in ruling out the presence of an MDD, however, its clinical value for identifying possible cases of MDD is limited. In cases above the cut-off point, it is recommended to perform a more thorough evaluation."

Very little research has focused on alternative methods of treatment for depression using CBT. Thus, there is a need for research into other therapeutic approaches.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of 3 low-intensity, internet-based psychological interventions (healthy lifestyle psychoeducational program [HLP], focused program on positive affect promotion [PAPP], and brief intervention based on mindfulness [MP]) compared with a control condition (improved treatment as usual [iTAU]).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A multicenter, 4-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted between March 2015 and March 2016, with a follow-up of 12 months. In total, 221 adults with mild or moderate major depression were recruited in primary care settings from 3 Spanish regions. Patients were randomly distributed to iTAU (n=57), HLP (n=54), PAPP (n=56), and MP (n=54). All patients received iTAU from their general practitioners. The main outcome was the Spanish version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) from pretreatment (time 1) to posttreatment (time 2) and up to 6 (time 3) and 12 (time 4) months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the visual analog scale of the EuroQol, the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and the Pemberton Happiness Index (PHI). We conducted regression models to estimate outcome differences along study stages.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A moderate decrease was detected in PHQ-9 scores from HLP (β=-3.05; P=.01) and MP (β=-3.00; P=.01) compared with iTAU at posttreatment. There were significant differences between all intervention groups and iTAU in physical SF-12 scores at 6 months after treatment. Regarding well-being, MP and PAPP reported better PHI results than iTAU at 6 months post treatment. PAPP intervention significantly decreased PANAS negative affect scores compared with iTAU 12 months after treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The low-intensity, internet-based psychological interventions (HLP and MP) for the treatment of depression in primary care are more effective than iTAU at posttreatment. Moreover, all low-intensity psychological interventions are also effective in improving medium- and long-term quality of life. PAPP is effective for improving health-related quality of life, negative affect, and well-being in patients with depression. Nevertheless, it is important to examine possible reasons that could be implicated for PAPP not being effective in reducing depressive symptomatology; in addition, more research is still needed to assess the cost-effectiveness analysis of these interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN82388279; http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN82388279.\n    \n\n\n          International registered report identifier (irrid):\n        \n      \n      RR2-10.1186/s12888-015-0475-0."

            "abstract": "Depression is associated with poor cardiovascular health (CVH) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease in high-income countries. However, it is unclear whether depression, particularly somatic depressive symptoms, may similarly contribute to poor CVH in a different socioeconomic context. Our aim was to investigate the association between depression and CVH in Brazil, a middle-income country. 49,658 participants (≥18 years) from the 2013 National Health Survey-Brazil. Favorable CVH was defined by meeting recommended levels on five CVH components (blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia status, smoking status). Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; depressed if score ≥ 10). Two PHQ-9 sub-domain scores (somatic or cognitive symptoms) were also considered. Covariates included age, sex, race, income, education, region of residence, marital status, chronic diseases, diet and physical activity. Depression was associated with a 27% lower odds of having favorable CVH (OR 0.73; 95%CI 0.62-0.86), and the association was stronger among women (OR 0.72; 95%CI 0.60-0.86). Both somatic and cognitive depression symptoms were inversely associated with lower odds of having favorable CVH. In conclusion, depression is associated with lower odds of having favorable CVH in Brazil, and associations are evident across both somatic and cognitive components of depression. Moreover, the relationship was independent of socioeconomic factors, chronic diseases, and was not strongly explained by diet or physical activity. Overall, our findings suggest that the greater odds of having poor CVH among depressed individuals is not unique to high-income countries."
