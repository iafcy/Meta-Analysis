Abstract
Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a brief toolto assess thepresence and severity of
depressive symptoms. This study aimed to validate and calibratethe PHQ-9 to determine appropriate cut-off points
for different degrees ofseverity of depression inArgentina.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on an intentional sample of adult ambulatory care patients with
different degrees ofseverity ofdepression. Allpatientswho completed thePHQ-9 were further interviewed by a
trained clinician withthe Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the BeckDepression Inventory-II
(BDI-II). Reliability and validity tests, including receiver operating curve analysis, were performed.
Results: One hundred sixty-nine patients were recruited witha mean age of 47.4years (SD=14.8),of whom 102
were females (60.4%). The local PHQ-9 had high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=0.87) and satisfactory
convergent validity withthe BDI-II scale [Pearson’scorrelation=0.88 (p<0.01)]. For thediagnosis ofMajor
Depressive Episode (MDE) according to the MINI, a PHQ-9≥8 was the optimal cut-off point found (sensitivity
88.2%, specificity 86.6%, PPV 90.91%). The local version of PHQ-9 showed goodability to discriminate among
depression severity categoriesaccording to theBDI-II scale. The best cut off points were 6–8for mild cases, 9–14
for moderate and 15 or more for severe depressive symptoms respectively.
Conclusions: The Argentineversion of thePHQ-9 questionnaire has shown acceptable validity and reliability for
both screening and severity assessment of depressivesymptoms.
