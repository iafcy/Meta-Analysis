The patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is one of the most widely used self-report
instruments in primary care. There is no criterion validity of the PHQ-9 in Colombia.
The objective was to validate the PHQ-9 as a screening tool in primary care. A cross-
sectional, scale criterion validity study was performed using as reference criterion the
mini neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) in male and female adult users of primary care
centres. We calculated the internal consistency and convergent and criterion validity of
the PHQ-9 by analysing the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the area under
the curve (AUC). We analysed 243 participants; 184 (75.7%) were female. The average age
was 34.05 (median of 31 and SD = 12.47). Cronbach’s ˛ was 0.80 and McDonald’s ω was
0.81. Spearman’s Rho was 0.64 for HADS-D (P < 0.010) and 0.70 for PHQ-2 (P <0.010). The
AUC was 0.92 (95% CI 0.880–0.963). The optimal cut-off point of PHQ-9 was ≥7: sensitiv-
ity of 90.38 (95% CI: 81.41–99.36); specificity of 81.68 (95% CI: 75.93–87.42); PPV 57.32 (95% CI:
46.00–68.63); NPV 96.89 (95% CI: 93.90–99.88); Youden index 0.72 (95% CI: 0.62–0.82); LR+ 4.93

Introduction
Depression is a major public health problem worldwide1and
has a significant impact on quality of life,2 high morbid-
ity levels,3 reduced life expectancy4 and excess mortality.5
The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDE)
is 11.2%.6 Prevalences tend to be higher in low and middle
income countries such as Pakistan, where depression preva-
lences of 45.9% have been reported.7In primary care (PC), the
prevalence of MDE varies significantly in a range from 4.5% to
47.8%.8
In the 2015 Colombian National Mental Health Survey, the
prevalence of major depression in the general population was
5.4 (95% CI: 4.6–6.4), 2.3 (95% CI: 1.8–2.9) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5–1.3)
for lifetime, the last year and the last month, respectively.9In
Bucaramanga, the prevalence of clinically significant depres-
sive symptoms (CSDS) was 22.3% (95% CI: 20.0–24.6) and 11.2%
for major depressive disorder (MDD) (95% CI: 9.7–12.9%).10
A later population study in adults living in Bucaramanga
(N = 266), using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV
Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), reported a prevalence of 16.5% (95%
CI: 12.3–21.6),11which confirms the high prevalence of depres-
sion in this
In
region.
spite of its high burden, chronicity and recurrent nature,
depression is underdiagnosed in PC, as approximately 50% of
patients who present depression will not be detected.12 This
diagnostic gulf could be explained by the fact that more than
75% of patients with depression initially consult a family or PC
physician with little training in the identification of depressive
disorders,13 time constraints in busy PC environments14 and
the lack of validated screening tools in low and middle income
countries.15
Because of the above, programmes have been developed
to recognise depression,16,17which recommend standardised
tools. A number of tools exist to identify cases of depression;
however, their benefits have not been fully determined and the
literature reveals contradictory results.18A recent systematic
review suggests that of the screening tools, only the Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) attains the optimum accu-
racy level for depression.19 The PHQ-9 is an adjectival scale
derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders
(PRIME-MD) to assess depressive symptoms using the DSM-IV
criteria.20 The PHQ-9 is shorter than most of the depression
screening scales21,22and is considered the best screening tool
for depression in PC due to its accuracy, brevity, being in the
public domain and multipurpose, and ease of administration,
scoring and interpretation.19,23The PHQ-9 has been translated
into more than 20 languages and used in many countries and
r e v c o l o m b p s i q u i a t . 2 0 2 1;5 0(1):11–21 13
contexts.24In PC, the sensitivity of the PHQ-9 was between 0.71
and 0.84 (mean 0.77) and its specificity was between 0.90 and
0.97 (mean 0.94),25confirming its adequate psychometric per-
formance in PC, albeit with some variations in the cut-off point
(COP) and psychometric parameters that can be explained by
the influence of cultural aspects in the response pattern.23Its
broad use is also supported by the findings of Williams et al.,
who concluded, in an analysis of more than 38 studies with
more than 32,000 PC patients, that the PHQ-9 was equal or
superior to other measures of depression.22 In addition, the
DSM-5 MDD working group and the NICE guidelines consider
the PHQ-9 the preferred measure to assess the presence of the
depression and quantify its severity.21,22,26
The PHQ-9 has been evaluated in Colombia in university
students27: however, it was not compared to a gold standard.
The PHQ-9 criteria therefore need to be validated in PC in
Colombia against a gold standard, in particular due to the
opportunity PC services represent in the early detection of
depression.28 As a result, this study’s objective was to assess
the validity of the PHQ-9 criteria, comparing it with the Mini-
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for screening
for depressive symptoms in adult PC users in the Bucara-
manga metropolitan area.
Materials and methods
Design
This study was designed and analysed based on the recom-
mendations of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
Studies (QUADAS-2) declaration.29An analytical observational
study of the validity of a scale’s criteria was conducted using
reference criteria.
Participants
Local PC users of both genders, aged 18–65 years were
included. The PC centres belong to the Instituto de Salud de
Bucaramanga [Bucaramanga Health institute] (ISABU), a State
social enterprise that coordinates primary health care services
in the Bucaramanga metropolitan area.
Subjects with psychoactive symptoms, cognitive decline,
delirium or an intellectual disability that might prevent them
from responding to the tools, those under the effects of psy-
choactive substances, with functional changes in vision or
hearing that might prevent them from understanding the con-
tent of the survey, and those who did not understand Spanish
were excluded. The sample size was calculated to evaluate the
hypothesis regarding the characteristics of a diagnostic test30:

where (cid:4) 1is the sensitivity of the standard (0.96) and (cid:4) 2is the
anticipated sensitivity of the PHQ-9 (0.88); Z 1−˛/2 was set at
1.96 and Z1-Bat 1.28; ı was set at 0.08 ((cid:4) 1− (cid:4) 2). The result was
214. Participants were selected consecutively as they
the
attended
health centres until a maximum number of subjects above
214 had been surveyed.
Procedures
The study was approved the ethics committee of ISABU and
the Universidad de Santander [University of Santander], tak-
ing into account the current international31 and national
norms32for research with human subjects.
The PHQ-9 was translated following the recommendations
for adaptation of self-reporting tests.33 A direct translation
from the original scale was performed by two independent
certified bilingual translators; discrepancies between the two
translations were discussed, then a backtranslation was done
into English, which was reviewed by the research team to
assess its closeness to the original scale. The translated scale
was then reviewed by 10 psychiatrists with research exper-
tise or clinical experience to verify whether the items were
consistent with the construct of depression, who also com-
mented on the comprehension and wording of the items. Ten
people from the general population with a history of depres-
sion also gave their opinions on the comprehension of the
questions. The research group analysed and incorporated the
patients’ and experts’ observations to obtain the new Colom-
bian version (Fig. 1). With the new version of the scale, a pilot
test was conducted with 21 subjects with characteristics sim-
ilar to the study subjects but in other centres. They answered
the questions without difficulties and no adjustments to the
grammatical structure were needed.
The research team was trained in the structured psychi-
atric interview (MINI) and hetero-administration of the PHQ-9.
The people responsible for administering the scales and struc-
ture interviews were professionals with clinical experience
(four psychologists, two general practice residents and one
psychiatrist) who received eight hours of training by the lead
author, with theoretical and practical sessions, role play-
ing, and observation of pilot interviews with feedback. The
study participants were contacted in the waiting room as they
arrived for outpatient appointments with a general practi-
tioner for any reason. One member of the research group
explained the nature of the study and gave them the informed
consent form. The screening scales were read by trained
members of the research team. After completing the PHQ-9,
each participant was assessed on the same day in another
consulting room by a different trained member of the team
(psychologist or psychiatrist) who did not know their PHQ-9
result, to administer the MINI depression module. The ques-
tionnaires were reviewed by two independent reviewers and
saved in a form generated in Excel.
Tools
PHQ-9
The PHQ-9 is a screening scale that measures the presence and
severity of depressive symptoms.34 The PHQ-935 is made up
of the nine symptoms from DSM-IV MDE criterion A.20These
nine items are arranged in the form of an adjectival scale that
assesses the presence of the symptom in the last two weeks
(“not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days” and

“nearly every day”), scored from 0 to 3 to give a score between
0 and 27.36
It can be self- or hetero-administered and is used both
algorithmically to make a probable diagnosis of MDE or as
a continuous measure of scores from 0 to 27 with cut-off
points (COP) at 5, 10, 15 and 20 representing levels of depres-
sive symptoms, i.e. mild, moderate, moderately severe and
severe.34The scores can also be used dichotomously based on
a COP to classify subjects with or without CSDS.37 According
to Kroenke et al., the psychometric characteristics of the PHQ-
9 have a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88%, adequate
internal consistency (Cronbach’s ˛ of 0.86–0.89), a test–retest
score of 0.84, a concordance between self-administered and
evaluator-administered tests of 84% and an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.95.34 In this study a COP of 8 or more was
used to identify cases of CSDS, based on the meta-analysis by
Manea et al.23and the study by Rancans et al. in PC.38
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview
The MINI is a brief structured diagnostic interview that
explores the diagnostic categories of the DSM-IV and the ICD-
10.39Its original version was developed by Sheehan et al.39and
Lecrubier et al.40 in the United States and France. It contains
130 questions organised into modules that assess 16 disor-
ders from axis i of the DSM-IV and one personality disorder.
The original version in English has a sensitivity range between
0.46 and 0.94 and a specificity between 0.72 and
excellent

inter-rater (kappa 0.70) and test–retest reliability, and
moderate validity of criteria compared to the Composite Inter-
national Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the SCID-P.39,40 The
MINI quickly gained international acceptance,41–43has trans-
lated versions in 43 languages39and its reliability and validity
have been explored in its Italian,44 Japanese,45 Norwegian,46
Moroccan47 and Portuguese48 versions. The average admin-
istration time is 18.7 ± 11.6 min, with a mean of 15 min.39
Together with the CIDI and the SCID-I, the MINI is considered
a globally accepted gold standard for the diagnosis of mental
disorders in clinical and research settings.49
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was
designed by Zigmond and Snaith in 198350to detect mood dis-
orders, especially those associated with somatic symptoms. It
consists of 14 items, with an anxiety subscale (odd items) and
a depression subscale (even items). Each item is graded on a
four-point frequency scale from 0 to 3. The HADS has been
translated into most European languages, Arabic, Hebrew,
Urdu, Japanese and Chinese51 and its reliability and validity
has been demonstrated in numerous studies.52 In Colombia,
it was validated in cancer patients, finding adequate internal
consistency (Cronbach’s ˛ of 0.85), a COP of 8 for the anxiety
subscale and 9 for the depression subscale.53 These psycho-
metric properties were confirmed in a populational sample
r e v c o l o m b p s i q u i a t . 2 0 2 1;5 0(1):11–21 15
(n = 1500) in several cities in Colombia.54In this work, the ver-
sion adapted by Rico et al. was used.53
Patient Health Questionnaire-2
The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) consists of the
first two items of the PHQ-9, which are necessary to suspect
the presence of depression according to the DSM-IV criteria.55
The scoring system is the same as for the PHQ-9 and scores
range from 0 to 6. A COP of 3 is optimal for screening, but a
recent meta-analysis suggests that a COP of 2 may increase
its sensitivity.56 Patients who score positive for CSDS should
be evaluated with the PHQ-9 to determine whether they meet
the MDE criteria.57Its clinical utility stems from the fact that
it reduces the time taken in normal PC consultations, which
are usually busy.58 The PHQ-2 has been found to have psy-
chometric performance comparable to the PHQ-9, with good
reliability, validity and sensitivity to change.56In this work, a
COP of 2 or above was used to identify patients with CSDS.59
Statistical analysis
The data were analysed in SPSS version 20.0,60 carefully
verified and reviewed twice. A descriptive analysis of the qual-
itative and quantitative variables was performed. Cronbach’s ˛
and McDonald’s ω coefficients were calculated to assess inter-
nal consistency; for concurrent validity, Spearman or Pearson
correlations were estimated depending on the distribution
of the variables. To assess the accuracy of the PHQ-9 as a
screening tool compared to the MINI, the receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) and AUC were analysed. The optimum
COP for the PHQ-9 was determined taking into account validity
indices: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),
negative predictive value (NPV), positive and negative likeli-
hood ratios (LR), Youden’s index and ROC curve/AUC analysis.
Results
Participant characteristics
Three hundred and eighty-four users were contacted, of
whom 95 did not agree to participate. Of the surveys con-
ducted, 46 were discarded due to missing and inconsistent
data; the analysis therefore included 243 participants, of
whom 184 (75.7%) were female. The average age was 34.05
years with a standard deviation (SD) of 12.47 years. For male
participants the average age was 33.59 years with a SD of
12.89 years, while for female participants the average was
34.20 years with a SD of 12.37 years. The sociodemographic
characteristics of the sample can be seen in Table 1.
The prevalence of CSDS was 27.2% according to the results
of the PHQ-9 and 21.8% according to the MINI structured inter-
view.
Internal consistency
A Cronbach’s ˛ coefficient of 0.80 and an ω coefficient of 0.81
were obtained. The overall internal consistency of the scale if
each item is eliminated is shown in Table

of test to use for the concurrent validity analysis of the
PHQ-9 against the PHQ-2 and the HADS depression subscale
(HADS-D). These variables were not found to have a normal
distribution, to Spearman’s Rho was used. The Spearman’s
Rho was 0.646 for the HADS-D (P < 0.010) and 0.701 for the
PHQ-2 (P < 0.010).

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on PHQ-9
criterion validity in PC in Colombia. The prevalence of MDE
in this study was 21.8%. The Colombian version of the PHQ-9
demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance as a depres-
sion screening tool, as can be seen from the ROC curve and
AUC. The PHQ-9 also demonstrated an adequate balance of
sensitivity and specificity at the COP of ≥7 when
with
compared
the MINI as a reference standard, establishing the PHQ-9’s
adequate criterion validity. The comparison of PHQ-9 scores
against those from the HADS-D and the ˛ and ω coefficients
demonstrated good convergent validity and adequate internal
consistency.
The percentage of subjects classified as having CSDS based
on the PHQ-9 with the pre-established COP was 27.2% (95%
CI: 26.3–28.9), higher than the prevalence of 22.3% (95% CI:
20.0–24.6) found in Bucaramanga using the Zung Self-rating
Depression Scale.10 This difference can be explained by the
poor diagnostic performance of the Zung scale in the Colom-
bian population.61With regard to the prevalence of MDE based
on the MINI, in this sample it was 21.8% (95% CI: 20.8–23.5),
which is within the expected range based on a meta-analysis
of 41 studies in PC with an adjusted global prevalence of
19.5% (95% CI: 15.7–23.7).62However, the prevalence of MDE in
this study is a little higher than the 16.5% (95% CI: 12.3–21.6)
reported in previous studies in the general population in
Bucaramanga,11 which can be explained by the fact that this
study was conducted in people attending PC centres, where
the prevalence of depression is higher than in the general
population63and by the large proportion of women.64
Cronbach’s ˛ coefficient was 0.80 and McDonald’s ω coeffi-
cient was 0.81, indicating good internal consistency.65,66For a
self-reporting tool to be reliable, Cronbach’s ˛ and McDonald’s
ω need to be at least 0.70.67The internal consistency found in
this study is in keeping with a previous study in Colombia37
and with others conducted in different languages, whose coef-
ficients ranged from 0.79 to 0.89.68,70,71
Previous studies have demonstrated that the PHQ-9 has
adequate concurrent validity with various measured, includ-
ing the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), short
health assessment forms and even the PHQ-2.72In our study,
total PHQ-9 scores showed a statistically significant positive
correlation with HADS-D and PHQ-2 scores (Spearman’s Rho of
0.64 [P < 0.01] for HAM-D and 0.70 [P < 0.01] for PHQ-2), in keep-
ing with previous studies in which the Pearson’s coefficients
for the PHQ-9 with the HAM-D and the Beck Depression Inven-
tory (BDI) were 0.52 and 0.76, respectively.68,73–75 Meanwhile,
a study of patients with Parkinson’s disease showed that
the PHQ-9 correlated positively with the Self-rating Depres-
sion Scale and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, with
r e v c o l o m b p s i q u i a t . 2 0 2 1;5 0(1):11–21 17
a Spearman’s coefficient of 0.63 in both cases.76 The corre-
lation coefficients found in this study confirm the convergent
validity of the PHQ-9, with Spearman’s correlation coefficients
between 0.60 and 0.80 indicating a good or considerable posi-
tive correlation.77
With regard to the COP, various studies have recommended
a COP of 10 in the PHQ-9 for the identification of MDE.34 For
example, in a study of PC users in China, an optimum COP
of 10 produced a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.8.69
However, a recent meta-analysis of 18 studies demonstrated
that the optimum COP of the PHQ-9 could range from 8 to 11,
depending on the population studied; nevertheless, the bal-
ance of sensitivity and specificity is maintained for a COP of
7 (5 of the 18 studies included).23 In our study, the COP of 7
appears to have given the optimum balance between sensi-
tivity and specificity, which was confirmed with an additional
measure of accuracy: Youden’s index,78 defined as the max-
imum vertical distance between the ROC curve and the 45
degree line, as an indicator of how far the curve is from an
uninformative test.79 Youden’s index is a function of sensi-
tivity (Se) and specificity (Sp); it is calculated as (Se + Sp-1)80
and should be considered alongside the ROC curve as they are
usually related.81 The range is 0–100 when converted into a
percentage. Values >50% are generally considered acceptable
for diagnostic accuracy.82
The values associated with the COP in our study are con-
sistent with a study in older adults in PC, in whom PHQ-9
criterion validity was assessed by administering the MINI, in
which an optimum COP ≥ 7 (sensitivity 0.92; specificity 0.78)
demonstrated the best psychometric characteristics.83 Nev-
ertheless, this COP of 7 is lower than that found in most
studies with the PHQ-9 in other populations. The cultural and
demographic characteristics of the samples may be the rea-
son for this difference.84 Stigma is an important aspect that
can also influence people’s response pattern to depression
screening scales in our population, causing shame in peo-
ple with mental illnesses, which limits the identification of
psychopathological phenomena.85,86 It is worth noting that
PHQ-9 COPs tend to be lower in middle and low income
countries87–89 compared with high income countries.75,90,91
However, there are no studies looking at this phenomenon.
This difference in optimum COP highlights the importance
of validating screening tools in different social and cultural
contexts.92
For a COP of ≥7, the sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-9
in this sample were 90% and 83%, respectively. These find-
ings are consistent with the study by Wang et al., in which the
COP of ≥7 allowed an adequate balance between sensitivity
and specificity (sensitivity 85%; specificity 86%).93 The accu-
racy indices in our study are therefore considered appropriate,
as the screening tool is considered good when its sensitivity is
between 79% and 97% and its specificity is between 63% and
86%.94 Wittkampf et al. systematically reviewed the psycho-
metric properties of the PHQ-9 and found a sensitivity of 77%
(71–84%) and specificity of 94% (90–97%), including studies in
subgroups with a high prevalence of depression, such as PC
users.25
The LR+ and LR− of the PHQ-9 in our sample, for a COP
of ≥7, were 4.93 and 0.12, respectively. This means that, in a
similar clinical context, a positive result in the PHQ-9 (COP ≥
if
7)
five times more common in a patient with depression than
in one without depression, while a subject with a negative
result would have a likelihood of having depression of less
than 2%.95These results are comparable with those obtained
in the Chinese version of the PHQ-9, which with a COP of ≥7,
had an LR+ and LR- of 5.99 and 0.17, respectively.93
The AUC of this Colombian version of the PHQ-9 for PC was
0.92, which indicates a high degree of accuracy96and is consis-
tent with previous studies in PC and other populations.69,71,93
This study’s main strengths include the use of a clinical
reference criterion to assess the PHQ-9 validity criterion, the
adequate participant response rate (75.3%), adequate train-
ing of interviewers, adherence to the QUADAS-2 guidelines29
and the execution of a rigorous analysis plan. In addition, the
PHQ-9 was translated in accordance with the standardised
guidelines for transcultural adaptation of scales. The linguistic
adaptation was supported by a group of experts, guaranteeing
appropriate content validity.
This study has several limitations. Firstly, our study was
conducted in a PC context, therefore the results cannot be
generalised to the general population, whose characteris-
tics would produce a different response pattern.84 Secondly,
the study was limited to adults. There is growing evi-
dence that adolescents are particularly affected by depressive
disorders,97 so future studies in Colombia would need to
assess the psychometric performance of the PHQ-9 in this
population. Thirdly, this was a cross-sectional study, and as
a consequence there will be a need, in the future, to design
longitudinal studies to establish the sensitivity to change of
the PHQ-9 in the Colombian population, as works exist that
have used in to assess response to treatment of depression.98
Fourthly, the fact that the sample was predominantly female
(75%) could affect the estimates of accuracy indices, as the
prevalence of depression is higher in women than in men,
giving a higher number of positive cases of depression.99And
fifthly, one relative weakness in the sample size, which was
calculated following the recommendations of Sanchez et al.
for comparing the sensitivity of a screening test with a refer-
ence standard.30 However, other authors, such as Buderer100
and Obuchowski101 demand larger samples. On the other
hand, following Bean’s criteria for comparing the sensitivity
or specificity of two diagnostic tests, sample sizes similar to
ours are obtained.102
In keeping with global results, the Colombian version of
the PHQ-9 for PC has excellent psychometric performance
as a screening test, which guarantees that it can be used
in contexts with few resources and with weaknesses in the
healthcare system, where the availability of psychiatrists is
limited.103 Among the strategies to limit the burden of men-
tal health disorders in low and middle income countries is
integration of mental health in PC.104 One of the major bar-
riers to achieving this goal is the lack of easy-to-administer
and validated screening tools to detect depression. The val-
idation of instruments such as the PHQ-9 in these contexts
can help to solve this problem.105It is known that just screen-
ing for depression is insufficient to mitigate the growing care
needs for mental health disorders in low and middle income
countries; nevertheless, given that depression contributes sig-
nificantly to the burden of disease, having validated screening
tools is the first step towards solving this problem.106 In
18 r e v c o l o m b p s i q u i a t . 2 0 2 1;5 0(1):11–21
some low income countries, there are cost-effective depres-
sion intervention programmes, in which screening tools can
be used to identify appropriate participants.107 One of the
main components of effective mental health interventions in
PC is monitoring depressive symptoms using simple, brief and
easy-to-administer questionnaire such as the PHQ-9.108
With the validation of this version of the PHQ-9,
researchers in Colombia now have valid and reliable psycho-
metric information about depression screening in PC, which
will enable the PHQ-9 to be used in studies where it is nec-
essary to identify depressive symptoms with an appropriate
COP.
In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the
Colombian version of the PHQ-9 is a valid and reliable tool
for screening for depression in a PC context in Bucaramanga,
with a COP of 7 or above. The psychometric properties of this
version of the PHQ-9 will need to be evaluated in different
populations and other regions of the country. Future studies
in Colombia should assess the PHQ-9’s sensitivity to change.
