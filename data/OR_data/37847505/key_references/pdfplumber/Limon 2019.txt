Abstract
Latino farmworkers (LFWs) experience depression at a significant higher
rate than non-Latino Whites; yet, research regarding depression-screening
instruments in Spanish is scarce. The first author created a depression
screener using terms used by LFWs to describe symptoms of depression.
This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Latino Farmworker Affective
Scale (LFAS-15) in accurately detecting symptoms of depression in this
population as compared with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the
Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale (CESD-10) using the DSM structured clinical interview
(SCID) as the reference standard. Study results indicated that the LFAS-15,
as well as the PHQ-9, and the BSI-18 performed. The data also indicated
that the LFAS-15 has good internal consistency, measures primarily one
construct (depression), demonstrated convergent validity with the SCID,

Introduction
Research findings indicate that low socioeconomic status (SES) Latinos in
the United States experience mental health disorders at a rate of 23.2%
whereas non-Hispanic Whites experience mental health disorders at a rate of
11.8% (Olfson et al., 2000). There is also evidence to suggest that depressive
symptoms are more persistent and severe for Latinos than that of non-His-
panic Whites (Liang, Xu, Quiñones, Bennett, & Ye, 2011). Among all Latino
groups in the United States, Latino farmworkers (LFWs) are particularly at
high risk of developing depression due to working and living conditions
inherent of farm work (Grzywacz et al., 2010). The prevalence of depression
in LFWs has been estimated to be up to 41% (Hiott, Grzywacz, Davis,
Quandt, & Arcury, 2008), and it has been reported that LFWs are unlikely to
seek mental health services (Lewis-Fernandez, Das, Alfonso, Weissman, &
Olfson, 2005) due to a variety of cultural, social, and structural factors
(Georges et al., 2013).
Primary Care Provider (PCP) Factors in Underdetection of
Depression
Underdetection of depression in Latinos, particularly in primary care, has
been linked to the limited training that PCPs receive in identifying and treat-
ing depression (Vega, Rodriguez, & Ang, 2010), language differences
between Latino patients and providers in how depression symptoms are
described (Vega et al., 2010), PCPs’ lack of awareness regarding the role of
low literacy levels among LFWs in relation to care, which limits their ability
to read screenings, understand treatment plans, or adhere to prescriptions
from the PCPs (Lewis-Fernandez et al., 2005), and PCPs’ limited time with
each patient in busy medical practices (Lake, 2008). Combined, these four
factors heavily influence the quality of health care that Latinos receive in
relation to depression or symptoms associated with depression. These PCP
factors become even more complex when matched with Latinos’ reasons for
low utilization of services.
252 Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences 41(2)
Low Utilization of Mental Health Services
Oftentimes Latinos have a preference for alternative medicine performed by
“curanderos” (a healer who uses folk remedies) or spiritual healers rather
than accessing mental health services (Arcury et al., 2005). Several factors
account for LFWs’ low utilization of mental health services. First, LFWs’
high mobility due to following seasonal crops may interfere with their ability
to learn about community resources, and medical and mental health services
are undermined (Arcury et al., 2005). Second, LFWs live and work in rural
areas far from communities where mental health clinics are usually located
thus limiting access to services (Ricketts, 2000). In addition, Farmworkers
work long hours and often 7 days per week and they lack transportation of
their own (Arcury & Quandt, 2007) making access to mental health services
challenging (Arcury, Estrada, & Quandt, 2010). Third, low wages make it
difficult for LFWs to purchase health insurance further reducing access to
health care (Arcury & Quandt, 2007).
A fourth reason for underutilization of mental health services by LFWs are
the cultural beliefs associated with mental health and mental illness (Leng,
Changrani, Tseng, & Gany, 2010). One study found that Latinos experiencing
depression often describe the inability to control their mood, emotional reac-
tivity, difficulty coping, and excessive worrying as common struggles rather
than attributing them to symptoms of a mental health condition (Guarnaccia,
Canino, Rubio-Stipec, & Bravo, 1993). Thus, in cases where cultural health
beliefs are incongruent or in contradiction with the Western model of health
and illness, Latinos often refrain from endorsing depression symptoms when
they access health care services. Instead, they attempt to heal in ways that are
congruent with their beliefs about the cause of symptoms such as drinking
herbal infusions or seeking out the wisdom from a curandero to soothe their
nerves (Garcés, Scarinci, & Harrison, 2006). Cultural beliefs common among
Latino immigrants in the United States also includes a belief that the onset
and course of illness is out of one’s control (i.e., God’s punishment for ill will
or destiny; Falicov, 1999). These beliefs known as fatalism are believed to
negatively affect “help seeking” behaviors because individuals do not trust
that conventional treatment will be effective (Chavez, Hubbell, Mishra, &
Valdez, 1996).
Finally, stigma associated with depression is another factor that interferes
with the detection of depression because Latinos think of depression as the
result of having “weak character” (Caplan et al., 2013). The stigma associ-
ated with depression may result in underreporting of symptoms or somatic
complaints that would have otherwise caught the attention of the PCP and the
need for a depression screening.
Limon et al. 253
To improve depression detection rates in LFWs, the effectiveness of a new
depression screening measure titled “The Latino Farmworker Affective Scale
or LFAS-15” was developed. Thus, the present study was designed to study
the effectiveness of the LFAS-15 identifying symptoms of depression in the
LFWs as compared with the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9;
Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001), the CESD-10 (Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale; Radloff, 1977), or the BSI-18 (Brief Symptom
Inventory-18; Derogatis, 2001), when their accuracy is checked against the
diagnostic results provided by the structured clinical interview for depression
or SCID (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1995). This research inquiry
was approached using the critical multiculturalism theory (Nylund, 2006) to
integrate the unique ways in which depression was experienced by LFWs
into the construction and corresponding analysis of the LFAS-15.
Method
The LFAS-15 was constructed after one of the authors observed that farm-
worker patients at a federally qualified health care center (FQHC) did not
entirely understand or relate to the questions on the PHQ-9. Consequently,
said author began compiling a list of words commonly used by patients that
resulted in a list of 15 words or short phrases that were titled, “The Latino
Farmworker Affective Scale” or LFAS-15. The LFAS-15 was designed to be
accessible for individuals with low Spanish literacy considering previous
research on education levels of LFWs (Arcury & Quandt, 2007). Therefore,
individuals who took the LFAS-15 only needed to know how to read and
understand the meaning of the word(s), instead of understanding the structure
of a sentence. Because the words and short phrases that make up this assess-
ment reflect the words collected from LFWs themselves, it was assumed that
most LFWs would be able to understand the meaning of the words on the
instrument.
Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the
LFAS-15 as compared with the PHQ-9, the CESD-10, and the BSI-18. These
measures were chosen for comparison because of the wide support cited in
the literature in regard to their psychometric properties.
To test the effectiveness of the LFAS-15, the following hypotheses were
formulated:
Hypothesis 1: Scores on the LFAS-15 will be positively related to scores
on the SCID.
Hypothesis 2: Scores on the PHQ-9, CESD-10, and BSI-18 will be posi-
tively related to scores on the SCID.
254 Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences 41(2)
Hypothesis 3: When predicting scores on the SCID, the LFAS-15 will
demonstrate incremental validity over the PHQ-9, CESD-10, and
BSI-18.
Hypothesis 4: The LFAS-15 will have higher levels of sensitivity and
specificity than the PHQ-9, the CESD-10, and BSI-18.
Hypothesis 5: The LFAS-15 will more accurately detect symptoms of
depression than the PHQ-9, the CESD-10, and the BSI-18.
Setting, Participants, and Sample Size
Participants were selected from a pool of patients accessing primary health
care at a community health center. Potential participants were included if
they (a) were Latinos; (b) their main occupation was farm work, or worked in
an occupation closely related to farm work for the majority of their time liv-
ing in/visiting the United States; and (c) fluent in Spanish. Potential partici-
pants were excluded if (a) they were receiving pharmacological or
psychological treatment for depression, (b) they had a comorbid psychotic
disorder, or (c) they had lived in the United States for more than 15 consecu-
tive years to prevent confounding the study with acculturation issues (Berry,
2005). Selecting an alpha level of .05, power at .80, and effect size of .40, the
researchers used Cohen’s table (Cohen, 1988) to determine that 99 partici-
pants were needed to conduct this research project.
Measures
The PHQ-9 is a nine-item depression-screening instrument that asks indi-
viduals being screened to report a numeric value ranging from 0 to 3 for how
frequently they experienced the symptoms listed on every item during the last
2 weeks. The PHQ-9 has been found to have good internal consistency reli-
ability (α = .89) and good criterion validity (r = 84) using the SCID as refer-
ence standard (r = .79; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & PHQ Primary Care
Study Group, 1999).
The CESD-10 is a 10-item depression-screening instrument that assesses
symptoms of depressed affect, interpersonal relationships, and positive affect.
The frequency of the symptoms is assessed in reflection of the last 7 days on
a scale of 0 to 4 indicating the days that symptoms were present. The CESD-
10 has been reported to have adequate internal consistency (α = .73) in a
sample of Latino immigrants (Grzywacz et al., 2006).
The BSI-18 consists of 18 items, and it assesses for anxiety, depression,
and somatic symptoms. The instrument assesses the level of distress experi-
enced by responders on a Likert-type scale and asks responders to rate the
Limon et al. 255
severity of their distress between 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Internal con-
sistency estimates for the BSI-18 have been reported to be adequate (α = .89;
Asner-Self, Schreiber, & Marotta, 2006) using the Hopkins’s symptom
checklist (Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Uhlenhuth, & Covi, 1974) as the ref-
erence standard with a concurrent validity reported to be high (α = .73;
Asner-Self et al., 2006).
The SCID is an instrument modeled after criteria for a diagnosis of depres-
sion as stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The SCID was
selected for use as a reference standard for the evaluation of the LFAS-15,
because it contains all of the criteria for a diagnosis of depression and it
allows respondents to expand on answers that can clarify a deeper under-
standing of the answers obtained. The SCID was also thought to be useful,
because it contains questions that allow ruling out symptoms that may be due
to medication/substance use, bereavement, or medical conditions.
The LFAS consists of 15 words or short phrases that LFWs have been
used to describe LFWs experience of emotions and cognitions that corre-
spond to symptoms of depression. Participants were instructed to report
the severity of each of the items on the instrument on a 5-point Likert-type
scale. The order in which the items in the LFAS were presented was con-
sidered and it was decided to first present items that reflect somatic symp-
toms related to eating, sleeping, generalized pain, and chest pressure (e.g.,
no tengo hambre, sin sueño, todo me duele, con el pecho apretado). The
items presented next were those that indicated negative symptoms (e.g.,
“desganado” [lack of will to do anything], “no me importa nada” [lack of
interest in anything], “nada me complace” [nothing pleases me], and “des-
animado” [feeling empty inside]). Next, positive symptoms indicating the
presence of unproductive emotions, cognitions, and behaviors were pre-
sented and they included “con mal genio” (short temper), “desesperado”
(without hope), “nervioso” (nervious), “tengo ansias” (I feel anxious), and
“con susto” (I feel fright). The last two items introduced were “triste” (sad)
and “con ganas de morirme” (feeling like I want to die). These items were
introduced at the end because the words “feeling sad” and “wanting to die”
could prompt participants to associate these symptoms with cultural stigma
about being weak (Vega et al., 2010).
Procedures and Data Collection
Upon approval from the ECU (East Carolina University) institutional review
board, the recruitment process began at either the health care center or farm
housing site. Participants, who agreed to be part of the study provided
256 Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences 41(2)
informed consent, completed a demographic questionnaire and the PHQ-9,
CESD-10, BSI-18, and the LFAS-15. Then the SCID was completed for
comparison.
Analyses
Descriptive statistics were performed to ensure that assumptions for the dif-
ferent statistical tests were met (Field, 2009). An exploratory factor structure
analysis was performed on the responses to the LFAS-15 to ascertain its fac-
tor structure. Item analysis was also performed to determine whether each
item contributed to the overall structure (Moore, McCabe, & Craig, 2009). A
multiple regression analysis was performed on the scores of all instruments
against the scores of the SCID to determine the relationship between the
scores of the LFAS-15 and the symptoms reported on the SCID (Moore et al.,
2009). Multicollinearity was found between the measures, which violated the
assumptions necessary to make inferences from regression analysis with con-
fidence, thus a relative importance/weight analysis was performed to make a
better assessment of the relationship between all of the measures. Finally, a
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis (Fawcett, 2006) was
conducted with the LFAS-15 scores against the data obtained from the SCID.
This analysis provided information regarding sensitivity and specificity of
the LFAS-15.
Results
The focus of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the LFAS-15 to
accurately identify individuals with depression as compared with the PHQ-9,
the BSI-18, and the CESD-10, using the SCID as the reference standard.
The final sample consisted of 99 participants. The average age of the par-
ticipants was 38.44 years (SD = 10.78), and the sample was primarily male
(88 male, 11 female). The average participant had worked in the United
States for 11 seasons, 89 lived in employer provided, and 10 reported living
with their families in communities nearby the farms where they worked.
Statistical Analysis
A test of sphericity indicated that the data were adequate for factor analy-
sis. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) supported a one-factor structure.
The EFA results showed that three factors accounted for 69.3 % of the
variance and showed eigenvalues above 1; however, the difference between
Factors 2 and 3 was relatively small (Factor 2 = 11.156%, Factor 3 =

7.56%) and together they only accounted for 18.7% of the variance whereas
the first factor accounted for 50.59% of the variance suggesting a one-
factor structure. To test for the internal consistency of the LFAS, a reli-
ability analysis was performed and returned a Cronbach’s alpha of .925 (n
= 15) providing further evidence that the scale effectively measures the
construct of depression.
A multiple regression analysis showed a positive and significant correla-
tion between the scores of the SCID and those of the LFAS-19, PHQ-9,
CESD-10, and the; therefore, Hypothesis 1 and 2 were supported by the
data (Table 1). It was observed, however, that the scores on all of the mea-
sures were highly correlated (Table 2), therefore, a collinearity diagnosis
was performed for the PHQ-9, the BSI-18, and the LFAS-15, which con-
firmed multicollinearity (Table 3). To address this problem, a Johnson’s
relative importance/weight analysis (J. W. Johnson, 2000) was performed
(Table 4). The relative weight analysis results show that the PHQ-9 and the
BSI-18 explain 29.4% and 29.75% of the variance accordingly, whereas the
LFAS-15 only explains 21.2% of the variance in the regression model.
Thus, these results combined with the multiple regression analysis indicate
that the LFAS-15 performs different from the PHQ-9 and the BSI-18 in
detecting depressive symptoms in LFWs.

ments (Table 5). However, the PHQ-9 (t = 3.25, p = .002) and the BSI-18

(t = 3.29, p = .001) both contributed significantly to the regression model
indicating that the scores on the SCID can be effectively predicted from the
scores on the PHQ-9 and the BSI-18, but not by the scores on the LFAS-15.
These results are not surprising, because the PHQ-9 and the SCID were
both constructed directly from the DSM-IV criteria for major depression, as
such this outcome would be expected.
Hypothesis 4 was supported by the data. Cases that met the SCID cri-
teria for depression were coded and an ROC curve was performed on the
LFAS-15 scores against the coded data for individuals with or without
depression as per the SCID. The total area under curve (AUC) for the
LFAS was .939, indicating that the scale has excellent combined sensitiv-
ity and specificity and can discriminate effectively between individuals
with and without depressive symptoms (Table 1). The AUC for PHQ-9
and BSI-18 were .927 and .888, respectively, indicating that the PHQ-9
and the BSI-18 effectively discriminated between depressed and nonde-
pressed participants.
The LFAS-15 showed good internal consistency, good convergent valid-
ity with the SCID and good sensitivity and specificity but a poor contribu-
tion to the multiple regression model when predicting SCID scores. To
better understand these results, sensitivity and specificity scores were cal-
culated using a cutoff point of 10 > in consideration of studies that deter-
mined that a cutoff point of 10 > provided an adequate balance of sensitivity
and specificity for both the PHQ-9 (Stafford, Berk, & Jackson, 2007) and
the BSI-18 (Reuland et al., 2009). Thus, with a cutoff point of 10 >, the
LFAS-15 showed a sensitivity of 90.4% and specificity of 58.3%, χ2 =
18.697, df(1), p = .000. The cutoff point that optimized both sensitivity and
specificity was >20. With a cutoff score of >20, the LFAS-15 showed a
260 Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences 41(2)
sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 75%. These results demonstrate that
the LFAS-15 is performing at least as strongly as other established mea-
sures such as the PHQ-9 and the BSI-18; but, also that its performance
(particularly its specificity) can be improved by revising Items 1 (no tengo
hambre) and 15 (con ganas de morirme), which showed poor performance
in the internal consistency analysis.
Hypothesis 5 was not supported by the data. Although the LFAS-15
demonstrated convergent validity with the SCID, good internal structure,
and higher sensitivity and specificity than the PHQ-9, and the BSI-18, the
regression analysis did not show that the LFAS-15 was adequate in pre-
dicting the scores on the SCID. Some researchers have advocated for the
development of new methods for validating measures of farmworkers
mental health (Grzywacz et al., 2010). The authors posited that instru-
ments that can be used as reference standard present problems in their
structure and language that are problematic for LFWs who tend to have an
average of 6 years of schooling, their literacy is low, have no experience
taking highly structured tests, and have difficulties with abstract thinking.
Thus, the problems observed in assessing LFWs for depression with the
PHQ-9 and the poor performance of the LFAS-15 in predicting depressive
symptoms on the SCID might both point to the need of developing a refer-
ence standard specific to this population. Nevertheless, the findings in this
study contribute to the limited body of research in the detection of depres-
sion in LFWs and offer a new alternative to the repertoire of depression
screening measures in the Spanish language.
Discussion
Research evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of depression screening instru-
ments in Spanish is limited (Reuland et al., 2009). Research findings indi-
cate that Latinos of Mexican origin, including LFWs, have difficulty
understanding and responding to highly structured mental health assess-
ments. The LFAS-15 was constructed in congruence with the principles of
CMT (Nylund, 2006) by learning directly from LFWs the unique way
depression is manifested in this population. Thus, this study evaluated the
effectiveness of the LFAS-15 in detecting depressive symptoms in LFWs as
compared with the PHQ-9, the CESD-10, and BSI-18 using the SCID as the
reference standard.
The CESD-10 was excluded from the analysis due to low correlation
with the SCID in the multiple regression analysis. Consistent with the lit-
erature on depression screening, both the PHQ-9 and the BSI-18 demon-
strated good internal consistency and convergent validity with the SCID.
Limon et al. 261
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, only one study has evaluated the
effectiveness of the PHQ-9 with LFWs and that study reported evidence in
favor of the use of the measure with LFWs (Donlan & Lee, 2010).
Similarly, previous researchers have reported support for the BSI-18 with
different Latino groups, yet, it appears as though the BSI-18 has not been
evaluated with LFWs prior to this study. This study provides preliminary
evidence of the BSI-18 measure’s viability to screen for depression with
LFWs.
The findings reported by Donlan and Lee (2010) together with the find-
ings in this study, directly contradict the first author’s observations on the
performance of the PHQ-9 in LFWs. In the study by Donlan and Lee
(2010), the PHQ-9 was administered verbally by a researcher and the
authors did not specify whether the researcher administering the measure
merely read the items or whether the items were further explained or elab-
orated upon to increase the participants’ understanding of the language and
structure of the measure. The participants in this study took the measure
independently, and they received assistance only when they requested help
with understanding items or words; thus, it cannot be determined if partici-
pants accurately understood the language and structure of the instrument
or whether their responses reflected response bias. The procedures in both
studies preclude us from being able to determine confidently that the par-
ticipants’ responses accurately reflect their depression symptoms. This
brings into focus the need to carefully control, document, and refine both
screening and research procedures to increase our confidence in our
research findings.
Our findings indicate that the LFAS-15 is performing at least as well as the
PHQ-9 and the BSI-18; however, the measure can be improved by revising
Items 1 and 15. As mentioned before, the literature pertaining to depression
screenings in the Latino community continues to be undermined by the lack
of a valid reference standard. Grzywacz et al. (2010) advocated for improved
methods for validating measures for LFWs’ mental health and the outcomes
from this study further support this need. When the SCID was selected as the
reference standard for this study, it was determined that the ability to probe
deeper into participants’ responses would likely be sufficient to obtain reli-
able data. However, based on the first author’s observations of participants’
guarded stance with some of the questions, it is no longer deemed to be an
appropriate reference standard for use with LFWs. The SCID was developed
from data based on the dominant majority, and this finding highlights the
underlining assumption of this study that cultural adaptations to tools and
measures created for the dominant majority do not necessarily translate into
culturally competent measures. Rather, consistent with critical multicultural
262 Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences 41(2)
theory, we need to investigate the “otherness” of the LFWs’ experience of
depression and develop a clinical interview guide that is culturally relevant
for this population (Hall, 1994).
Limitations
One important limitation to this study was the small number of individuals
who actually reported depressive symptoms, making it difficult to make in-
depth inferences from the data. Of the 99 participants, 88 were males and 11
were female; so the greater proportion of male participants may have skewed
the findings. Also relevant is that the Hispanic literature on depression
shows that immigrant women are more likely to report depressive symptoms
than their male counterparts. The sample was small (99) and skewed in the
direction of males, and only 12 participants were found to have significant
symptoms of depression by the SCID, which may be due to the overrepre-
sentation of males in the sample.
