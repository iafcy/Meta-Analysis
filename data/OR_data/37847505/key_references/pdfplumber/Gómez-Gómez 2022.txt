Abstract
Background. Primary health care (PHC) professionals may playacrucial role in improving
early diagnosis of depressive disorders. However, only 50% of cases are detected in PHC.
The most widely used screening instrument for major depression is the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ), including the two-, eight- and nine-item versions. Surprisingly, there
is neitherenough evidence about the validityof PHQ in PHC patients in Spain nor indica-
tions about how to interpret the total scores. This study aimed to gather validity evidence
to support the use of the three PHQ versions to screen for major depression in PHC in
Spain. Additionally, the present study provided information for helping professionals to
choose the best PHQ version according to the context.
Methods. The sample was composed of 2579 participants from 22 Spanish PHC centers
participating in the EIRA-3 study. The reliability and validity of the three PHQ versions
for Spanish PHC patients were assessed based on responsesto the questionnaire.
Results.ThePHQ-8andPHQ-9showedhighinternalconsistency.Theresultsobtainedcon-
firmthe theoreticallyexpected relationshipbetween PHQresultsand anxiety, socialsupport
and health-related QoL. A single-factor solution was confirmed. Regarding to the level of
agreement with the CIDI interview (used as the criterion), our results indicate that the
PHQ has a good discrimination power. The optimal cut-off values were: ⩾2 for PHQ-2,
⩾7 for PHQ-8 and ⩾8 for PHQ-9.
Conclusions.PHQisagoodandvaluabletoolfordetectingmajordepressioninPHCpatients

Spain, PHC is organized into around 3000 PHC centers (Government of Spain, 2021).
However, it has been estimated that only 22–31% of patients with major depression received
a correct diagnosis in Primary Health Care (Aznar-Lou et al., 2018; Fernández et al., 2010).
