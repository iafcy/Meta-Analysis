Discussion
In this study, we assessed the utility of the PHQ-9 as a
screening tool to identify MDD in users of Spanish PC
services. The main appeal of the PHQ-9 is that it is an
easy to administer and inexpensive self-report measure.
Ourmain finding isthat thePHQ-9isof valueinidenti-
fying MDD in patients at Spanish PC centres, but our
findings suggest that a higher cut-off value (12 or more)
or the “diagnostic algorithm” might be better than the
standard 10-point cut-off value in order to improve
specificity inthispatientpopulation.
Our results show that the PHQ-9 is a sensitive screen-
ing instrument for MDD, and in most cases it correctly
identified individuals with MDD when the most
common cut-off point (10 points) was used [12, 13, 35].
Unexpectedly, the specificity of the PHQ-9 in our study
was much lower than reported in previous studies, sug-
gesting more false positive diagnoses of MDD. Increas-
ing the cut-off point to 12 resulted in a slight decrease
in sensitivity but specificity improved to a more satisfac-
tory value, yielding a more acceptable trade-off. At the
