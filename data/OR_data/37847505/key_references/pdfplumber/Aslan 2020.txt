DISCUSSION
In this study, the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 and
their usefulness as a depressive disorder screening instrument
areanalyzedinasampleofolderChileanadults.Althoughthis
is not the only study of the functioning of the PHQ-9 that has
been organized in Chile (23, 24), to our knowledge, it is the
first study targeted at the older adult population, using a large
sample of older adults who attend PHC centers. In addition, it
has the advantage of having used the CIDI as a gold standard,
whichisaninstrumentwidelyappliedinepidemiologicalstudies
due to its rigorous use of diagnostic criteria for established
mentaldisorders.
The results show an adequate psychometric behavior of the
PHQ-9inthesamplestudied.Althoughtheonedimensionand
two-dimensional solutions showed good a fit and high factor
loadings, the scale appears to be one-dimensional given that
the result of the chi-square difference test and the correlation
between the non-somatic and somatic items was very high
(r=0.97), suggesting an overlap and supporting the notion of
depression being a coherent unidimensional construct (11, 19).
All items demonstrated loads >0.57, and corrected item-total
correlationswere>0.35.Theinternalconsistencyobservedwas
alsoacceptable.
