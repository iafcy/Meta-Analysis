1. Introduction

Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition among the
general population [1,2], and its prevalence is even higher among patients hospitalized due to medical illnesses [3–6]. It has been estimated
that one out of four patients hospitalized for medical illness has a comorbid major depressive episode (MDE) [3].
The presence of depression in a patient hospitalized due to a medical illness worsens the medical prognosis [7], increases symptom
burden [8–10], complicates self-care and treatment-adherence [11–13],
extends the hospitalization stay [14], and inflates the costs of care and
mortality [11,15–17]. Taking into account that patients with depression
can be effectively treated with medication and psychotherapy, early
diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce this burden [18,19].
Despite this, almost 50% of patients who suffer comorbid depression
when hospitalized for medical conditions do not have the condition
detected by clinicians [20]. This is explained, at least in part, by the
lack of quick and sensitive diagnostic tools, especially for use in specific
languages and cultures. Structured clinical interviews such as the
composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI) [21] or the mini
international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) [22] are the gold
standard for diagnosing depression. However, the use of these instruments require administration by trained mental health professionals,
are time-consuming and difficult to systematically apply in routine
clinical practice. This highlights the need for reliable, valid, and easily
applicable self-assessment screening tools to detect depression in patients hospitalized due to a non-psychiatric medical illness. Several selfscreening tools are available for screening, tracking and documenting
depressive symptoms with minimal clinician time, such as the Patient
Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) [23,24], the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [25] and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) [26].


#### T


To our knowledge, no studies have compared, at the same time and
with the same sample, the psychometric properties of these three selfrated questionaries' with a semi-structured clinical interview in patients
hospitalized for non-psychiatric medical illness. To cover this gap, we
designed the present study.
Our aims are to: (1) compare the operating characteristics of PHQ-9,
BDI-II and HADS according to an independent criterion standard for
MDE in patients hospitalized due to non-psychiatric medical illness; (2)
determine the optimum cut-off scores of these self-rating scales for
discriminating between patients with and without MDE in this specific
group of patients. The results of this study will provide general practitioners with highly valuable information to choose an assessment tool
for depression in this subgroup of patients.

2. Methods

2.1. Study design

The present multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted across
three facilities in Buenos Aires, Argentina: Bernardo Houssay Hospital
in the Vicente Lopez district, Eva Perón Hospital in the San Martín
district, and Bernardino Rivadavia Hospital in the Autonomous City
district. The study was conducted between August 2013 and May 2014.
These general hospitals mostly serve low-income patients without
health insurance and are located in the metropolitan area of Buenos
Aires, which has a population of 12.8 million. The study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the participating hospitals, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

2.2. Participants

world, we sampled all consecutive patients hospitalized in these
General Hospitals for any medical illness over six months. Participants
were adult inpatients with at least one primary medical diagnosis according to the ICD-10 [27] classification: infectious (22.0%), neurological (17.0%), metabolic (12.9%), pulmonary (11.1%), cardiovascular
(10.4%), neoplastic (9.13%), urological (9.13%), gastrointestinal
(7.46%) and hematological (4.56%).
Included subjects were: [a] native Spanish speakers, [b] aged
≥18 years old and [c] able to provide written informed consent to
participate. Subjects were excluded if they were: [a] unable to participate in clinical assessments or to complete symptom-ratings because
of illness, medication, sensory or speech impairment, or lack of language fluency, or [b] scored < 25 on a preliminary Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) [28] suggesting dementia or delirium.

2.3. Procedure measures

Participants were interviewed at days 2–6 after admission, and assessed by a psychiatrist or psychiatric resident using the MINI (MINI,
Spanish version 5.0) to look for the presence of an MDE. Then each
participant went through the administration of the following rating
questionaries based on a random sequence in order to limit re-test artifacts: the PHQ-9, the BDI-II, and the HADS. A psychiatrist or psychiatric resident trained for this purpose, held blind to study findings,
examined all study participants, collecting demographic and descriptive
data, and administering the MINI and the three self-rating scales.

2.4. Assessment tools

The PHQ-9 was developed in the mid-1990s for screening depression in a primary care setting and for the detection of this condition in
large epidemiological studies [29–31]. It is a nine-item, self-reporting
measure designed to detect and rate the presence and severity of depression with continuous scoring (0–3/item, a total of 0–27). It has
been extensively validated in many countries and is one of the most
commonly used tools for diagnosis and severity assessment of depression [32]. This instrument is based on DSM- IV-TR [33] criteria for
MDE. Its psychometric properties have been extensively studied in the
general population and clinical settings [32,34]. In Argentina, scores
≥8 are considered consistent with clinical MDE [35].
The BDI-II has been extensively used since 1996 in clinical and research settings; it is a self-reporting questionnaire rating 21 items for
presence and severity (0–3/item) for the previous two weeks and the
current day, with possible scores of 0–63. In Argentina, a cut-off score
of ≥14 is considered positive for depression [36]. The BDI-II differs
from the PHQ-9 in how it asks about the directionality of sleep, appetite, and weight changes; also, the BDI-II asks about additional items
such as punishment feelings, crying, indecisiveness, irritability, and libido.
The HADS differ from the other two questionnaires in important
ways such as the exclusion of somatic symptoms; given that diagnostic
interviews for depression include somatic items, comparison of a diagnostic referent standard with the HADS is essential. The HADS contains two subscales measuring symptoms of depression (HADS-D) and
anxiety (HADS-A) during the previous week. It includes seven statements on each disorder, and each response consists of a four-point
rating scale (0 to 3); a higher score indicates a worse condition. For
each subscale, the total score is at most 21. A score of ≥11 is considered a clinically significant disorder, whereas a score between 8 and
10 suggests a mild disorder [26,37]. This questionnaire has been validated in Argentina [38].

2.5. Statistical analysis

Data distribution was ascertained using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test Concerning descriptive statistics the χ[2] test and the independent

samples t-test were adopted to assess frequency distributions and to
compare continuous outcomes. Data transformations were performed as
necessary in order to avoid non-parametric tests (which may have
limited power compared to the parametric equivalents). Also, Bayes'
factors were reported beyond the sole null-hypothesis statistics. Bayes
factors instead of p-values (only) since they are independent of intentions and sample size, aiding in the critical interpretation of negative pvalues in particular. The ability to consider model uncertainty within a
single framework, although currently underused, is a major advantage
of Bayesian method. Since it is not void of limitations, the canonical
“frequentistic statistics” (“p-values”) were likewise reported as standard
part of the results [39].
Bayesian analyses included the receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curve, which was used to discriminate between groups and to
ascertain the sensitivity (probability of positive test result [PHQ-9[+]])
given that the individual tested actually has the disorder [MDE], and
specificity (the probability of a negative screening at the PHQ-9 [PHQ9[−]]) given that the individual tested does not have the disorder - or
“true negative” rate, analyzed as 1-specificity or “false positive” rate) at
various cut-off scores. The same ROC analyses were applied to the BDIII and the HADS in order to compare the psychometric properties of the
PHQ-9 among general medicine Argentinean inpatients.
Additional analyses included calculation of the area-under-thecurve (AUC) and of positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative
predictive value (NPV), defined as “the probability of having the disorder when given a positive test result” and “the probability of not
having the disorder when given a negative test result” respectively. The
following values were considered for the AUC: “0.9 = high accuracy,
0.7–0.9 = moderate accuracy, 0.5–0.7 = low accuracy, and 0.5 a
chance result.” [40]. A principal component analysis using oblique
(promax) rotation was used for the PHQ-9 [41]. The Kaiser-MeyerOlkin (KMO) measure verified how suited the data were for the PCA.
The test measures sampling adequacy for each variable in the model
and for the complete model. The KMO statistic is a measure of the
proportion of variance among variables that might be common variance; the Bartlett's test of sphericity assessed the degree of inter-correlation between variables, also selecting the “anti-image” option and
the Anderson-Rubin method. Eigenvalues > 1 were initially retained
(Kaiser's criterion). The Scree-plot output and clinical considerations
decided the final number of factors to retain. Items having an absolute
loading score substantially overlapping across two or more factors were
then disregarded in a second-passage PCA. The internal consistency of
the PHQ-9 was determined using Cronbach's alpha (“split-half”
method). The level of significance was set at 0.05 (two-tailed) using
95% confidence intervals (CI) across the analyses. Missing data were
excluded pairwise. Finally, data were analyzed using the Microsoft
Windows® versions v.25 of both IBM SPSS Statistics®.

3. Results

3.1. General characteristics of the sample

A total of 754 participants were screened consecutively, and 365
were classified as potentially eligible. From these, 15 were excluded as
they were younger than 18 years, 7 were excluded as they were unable
to communicate, 33 refused to consent, and 4 were discharged from the
hospital before personnel could invite them. Forty-nine additional
participants were excluded due to incomplete outcome data, leaving a
total of 257 participants for analysis. Each participating center recruited about the same number of participants.
Subjects included 152 (59.1%) men and 105 (40.9%) women, with
an average age of 54.15 ± 16.57 years. Essential demographic and
clinical data of the sample have been outlined in Table 1. From the
sample, 69 participants (26.85%) were considered to have current MDE
by expert clinical assessment using MINI. The observed prevalence of
MDE across different medical illnesses is described in Table 1 and

3.2. ROC curve analysis and predictive values

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of the performance of PHQ-9 in discriminating between “MDE (PHQ-9[+])” vs. nondepressed (PHQ-9[-])” across inpatients is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1.
The AUC was 0.87 ± 0.02, p ≤ .001; 95% C.I. (lower bound = 0.83;
upper bound = 0.91) with an optimal cut-off 10 (sensitivity = 81%;
specificity = 79%; PPV = 59% and NPV = 92%).
When analyzing the operating characteristic of the BDI-II, the
AUC = 0.83 ± 0.03, p ≤ .001; 95% C.I. (lower bound = 0.77; upper
bound = 0.88), Supplemental Fig. 3) with an optimal cut-off of 16
(sensitivity = 77%; specificity = 78%; PPV = 56% and NPV = 90%).
For the HADS, the AUC = 0.86 ± 0.02, p ≤ .001; 95% C.I. (lower
bound = 0.81; upper bound = 0.90) with an optimal cut-off of 15
(sensitivity = 83%; specificity = 75%; PPV = 55% and NPV = 92%).
In order to ease the interpretation of the change in sensitivity and
specificity at various cut-offs for these questionnaires, a scatter dot plot
of cut-off scores against sensitivity and specificity was also provided
(Supplemental Figs. 1–4).
When comparing the AUC between the varying scales, the PHQ-9
performed slightly better than the BDI-II and the HADS (Table 2).

3.3. Reliability analysis

The internal consistency of the PHQ-9 was good [42], with a
Cronbach's α value of 0.86. Comparably, the BD-II and the depression
subscale of the HADS, and the total HADS (anxiety and depression
modules altogether) had 0.90, 0.74, and 0.84 as Cronbach's α values,
respectively.

3.4. Factor analysis

A principal component analysis (PCA) was initially conducted on all
nine items of the PHQ-9 using an oblique (promax) rotation method.
Four components had eigenvalues over Kaiser's criterion of 1 and,
overall, explained 71.23% of the variance. The scree plot could have
allotted for a two- (most likely) or multiple-components solutions

[Fig. 2]. However, despite the chance of a “researcher-controlled bias,”
owing to clinical interpretability issues, and consistency issues with
previous reports, a second-passage PCA using promax rotation was
conducted forcing a two-factor solution, owing to interpretability issues
(Table 3).

4. Discussion

The present study is the first to compare the psychometric properties of three widely used screening tools for depression (PHQ-9, BDI-II
and HADS) against each other at the same time and with the same
sample, using an independent criterion for the diagnosis of an MDE
among patients hospitalized for non-psychiatric medical conditions. We
observed that the PHQ-9 with an optimal cut-off score equal to ten
performs better than the BDI-II and HADS in detecting MDE in this


specific group of patients. Moreover, the Argentine version of the PHQ9 questionnaire showed very good validity and reliability for the
screening of MDEs in these patients.
Depression among patients hospitalized for non-psychiatric medical
conditions is highly relevant not only for its frequency but also because
of its clinical and economic burden on the health system [4,5,11,15].
However, depression and anxiety often co-occur even in non-psychiatric medical outpatients [43].
Validated self-assessment questionnaires are needed for the early
detection of comorbid depressive symptoms in patients hospitalized for
clinical illness. Several self-rating questionnaires such as the PHQ-9,
BDI-II and HADS are available for depression screening; however, for
most of these the psychometric properties and cut-off scores were estimated in the general population or outpatient psychiatric settings, so
data regarding their properties in this specific group of patients are
scarce [44]. In patients hospitalized for non-psychiatric medical conditions, symptoms of their clinical illness may overlap with the somatic
symptoms of depression. This means that extrapolating cut-off scores
calculated in the general population or outpatient clinical settings may
give a high number of false positives.
In the present study, we compared data obtained at the same time
and from the same sample, evaluating the psychometric properties of
three widely used self-rating questionnaires with semi-structural clinical interviews in patients hospitalized for medical conditions. When
comparing the AUC, the PHQ-9 performed better with an AUC value of
0.87 ± 0.02, which suggests a high diagnostic accuracy. The sensitivity at the cut-off score of ten was 82%, and the specificity was 79%.
This cut-off score is higher than the score of eight previously reported in
Argentina in a psychiatric ambulatory setting (35), however, it is within
the range reported in a meta-analysis; the adequate cut-off score for
diagnosing MDE with the PHQ-9 ranged from eight to eleven [46,47].
Previous studies using the PHQ-9 in different settings reported a
Cronbach's α that ranged from 0.67 to 0.89 [48–54]. It has been suggested that a Cronbach's α of 0.70 or higher should be regarded as
acceptable for a self-reported instrument [55]. The present study
showed that the PHQ-9 has a Cronbach's α of 0.86, which is within the
highest level of the range. Although the PHQ-9 attempts to measure one
construct, the depressive syndrome, previous results of factorial analysis of this instrument revealed different factorial solutions of 1 or 2
factorial structure [41,56–59]. In the present study, the factor analysis
of PHQ-9 identified a two-factorial structure, which was consistent with
previous studies [41,56,57,59,60]. Specifically, component 1 comprised the following items: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8; component 2 comprised 2, 6, 7,
9. We interpreted component 1 as: “somatic/neuro-vegetative” core of
depression (which we hypothesized to be underpinned by the primary
medical illness), and we interpreted component 2 as: “psychological/
cognitive” component of depression. Confirmatory factor analysis
likewise suggested the satisfactory goodness-of-fit of PHQ-9.
Consistent with previous studies carried out on patients in the primary care setting, the present study demonstrated that PHQ-9 is a valid
and reliable screening tool for depression in medically hospitalized
patients, and the optimal sensibility and specificity for the best detection of MDE are observed with a cut-off score equal to ten. This is of
great importance since the PHQ-9 is well-known and used widely by

clinical practitioners, allows quick evaluations (it requires about 1 min
to complete) and can be used free of charge.
The HADS is a questionary designed to measure depression and
anxiety in patients with physical illness since this instrument excludes
somatic symptoms that may overlap with psychological/cognitive
symptoms. The HADS contains two subscales measuring symptoms of
depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A). When comparing the operating characteristic of the complete scale (HADS) vs. depression
subscale (HADS-D) we observed that the full scale performed better in
terms of sensitivity and specificity than the sole depression module of
the HADS-D. A possible explanation for this finding is that when considering anxiety items, numerous patients with anxious depression
cross the detection threshold and are included as positive for depression. This suggests that depression in the medical setting is


characterized by prominent anxiety features. Similar findings have been
previously reported in cardiac patients [61] and in hemodialysis patients [62]. Although “anxious depression” is more frequently observed
among the bipolar spectrum, in the present study we do not have the
information of which cases of MDE correspond to unipolar and bipolar
patients to answer this question, but future studies could explore it.
Future studies should also include instruments specifically developed
for the detection of either sub- or full-threshold bipolarity, with the aim
of better instructing therapeutic choices, even among patients primarily
hospitalized for a non-psychiatric medical condition. Furthermore,
these results suggest that taking the MINI as the gold standard for MDE
in patients with non-psychiatric medical conditions allows the inclusion
of more subjects with depression and prominent anxiety symptoms. The
results of the present study could also explain why MINI rated a higher

proportion of people as depressed in comparison with other fully
structured diagnostic interviews [63].
Finally, the BDI-II was the questionary with the lowest performance
for the detection of MDE in patients with non-psychiatric medical
conditions.

4.1. Strengths and limitations

One of the strengths of the study is that depression was assessed
with two different methods, a self-rating scale and a structural clinical
interview conducted face-to-face with the participant on the same day
as screening with the questionnaires, and the researchers were blinded
to the results of the questionnaires. Furthermore, the study was performed in three different metropolitan General Hospitals and with
different medical conditions, which makes the sample more representative of daily practice.
A limitation of the study is that these are General Hospitals that
serve low-income patients without health insurance, factors that might
contribute to a higher risk of depression, so inferences should be made
with caution. Moreover, we have no information about comorbid psychiatric diagnoses among participants with an MDE. Finally, medical
diagnoses/categories were mutually exclusive, hindering the appreciation of medical comorbidities.
