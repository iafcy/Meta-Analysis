### Background: This study aimed to assess the measurement properties (reliability, factor structure, and criterion validity) of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as an instrument for screening major depressive disorder (MDD) in elderly primary care users in Chile.

 Method: About 582 participants aged between 65 and 80 years were enrolled from primary care centers. They completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a survey with sociodemographic characteristics and the PHQ-9.
 Results: The PHQ-9 revealed an acceptable internal consistency (ω = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.75–0.80] and α = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.75–0.81]); confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a good fit for both 1- and 2-factor solutions. The chi-square difference test (χ [2] = 0.61, gl = 1, p = 0.43) and correlation between the somatic and the cognitive-effective latent factors were very high (r = 0.97, p < 0.001), indicating that the 1 factor model was more parsimonious. Utilizing the CIDI as the gold standard, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88 (SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.84–0.90). The optimal cut-off score of ≥ 6 yielded good sensitivity and specificity for detecting MDD (0.95 and 0.76, respectively). However, considering the clinical utility index, the cut-off score of ≥9 proved to be a more effective marker for discarding cases of MDD.

 Conclusion: The PHQ-9 has adequate psychometric properties for elderly primary care users. In clinical settings, it showed its greatest utility in ruling out the presence of an MDD, however, its clinical value for identifying possible cases of MDD is limited. In cases above the cut-off point, it is recommended to perform a more thorough evaluation.

## INTRODUCTION

Late-life depression is one of the most frequent mental health disorders in older adults and is
associated with poorer physical health, more limited social functioning, increased suicide risk, and
higher overall mortality. It is also associated with other mental health problems and disorders such
as anxiety disorders, substance and medication abuse as well as cognitive deficits (1). Unfortunately,


-----

it is frequently under-recognized, mainly because its clinical
indicators, such as depression, sadness, tiredness, anhedonia,
sleep disturbances, hypochondriasis, subjective cognitive
complaints (e.g., poor concentration and memory) are
confounded with normal expressions related to the aging
process (2).
Preventing, identifying, and treating depression in a timely
and adequate manner in older adults are relevant health
objectives. Primary health care (PHC) plays an important role in
the early detection and treatment of depressive disorders. Chilean
national studies report a 24.4% annual prevalence for common
mental disorders in PHC center users in the south-central area
of the country, where major depressive disorder (MDD) was
present in 13.4% of users (3). However, few studies estimate the
prevalence of depression in older adults in PHC and, although
this would be somewhat lower than in other age groups, it is still
high (4).
Although clinical interviews are indispensable for proper
diagnosis and evaluation of the symptoms associated with
depressive disorders, simple and brief questionnaires are
beneficial for screening and monitoring the trajectory of
symptoms over time (5). Screening instruments need to
demonstrate evidence of their reliability and validity in various
contexts of use, without which their scores are unintelligible (6).
The Patient Health Questionnaire (7) (PHQ-9) is one of the
most popular depression measures internationally, in clinical and
population based settings (8). Despite its brevity it has proven
its ability to identify symptoms of depressive disorders, high
screening capacity, and sensitivity to change in monitoring the
treatment response (9, 10).
Various studies have analyzed the psychometric properties of
the PHQ-9 in the elderly. There are studies in the United States
(11, 12), China (13–15), Taiwan (16), United Kingdom (17, 18),
Germany (19), Netherlands (20), Australia (21), and Brazil (22).
The PHQ-9 uses as an original recommendation—a cutoff score of 10—to detect a depressive disorder in the general
population. Nevertheless, recent evidence regarding the optimal
cut-off score for screening depression found that scores between
8 and 11 had satisfactory properties (8). In Chile, the PHQ9 has been used in PHC contexts, showing evidence of good
reliability and screening accuracy, with the original and lower
cut-off scores (23, 24). Some authors argue that in the elderly, a
lower cut-off score in the PHQ-9 would augment both sensitivity
and specificity (20).
Concerning the structural validity of the PHQ-9, there is
evidence corroborating the unidimensional structure of the
scale (11, 24–30). However, some evidence has been found
supporting a two-dimensional solution (16, 18, 19, 31). In
these studies, one factor of the PHQ-9 represents non-somatic
(cognitive and affective) depression symptoms, and another the
somatic symptoms.
To our knowledge, the PHQ-9 screening characteristics have
not yet been validated with the Chilean elderly in PHC. The
objective of this study is to analyse the psychometric properties
of the PHQ-9 in a Chilean elderly sample, in a PHC setting.
Specifically, this investigation focuses on reliability among the
PHQ-9 items (internal consistency), the dimensionality of the


test (structural validity), and its convergence with a reference
to a gold standard in identifying elderly patients with MDD
(criterion validity).

## METHODS

 Subjects and Procedure
This study adopted a descriptive, cross-sectional design.The
study subject data were obtained to perform a sub analysis of the
baseline sample of a larger study (32). The sample was recruited
from July to August 2018, consisting of self-dependent men
and women between the ages of 65 and 80, attending 15 PHC
centers in two catchment areas in the central-southern part of
Chile (Concepción and Talcahuano). The potential participants
(N = 1,220) were contacted and invited during a home visit;
582 accepted (a 52.3% rejection rate), and an interview was
coordinated for data collection. Those who agreed to participate
provided written informed consent.
The inclusion criteria of our study were as follows: (1)
aged between 65 and 80, (2) self-dependent and (3) user
of a PHC center. Exclusion criteria were the following: (1)
presence of a severe mental disorder (psychosis or bipolar
disorder), (2) mental disability or dementia or (3) a disability
preventing communication. The assessment of these criteria was
made from the health records using a standardized instrument
(EMPAM) (33).
Data collection was done over a 1-month period, through
40-min-long face-to-face interviews by trained research
assistants at home visits. The survey included sociodemographic
characteristics, the PHQ-9, the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and other measures not related to
this study. The participants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for
MDD were referred to their PHC center.

## MEASURES

 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
The PHQ-9 is a self-questionnaire consisting of nine items
that assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms
based on the DSM-IV criteria for MDD (34). It refers to
symptoms experienced by patients during the 2 weeks preceding
to the interview. In this study, the Spanish version of the
scale was employed (35). The PHQ-9 scoring consists of a
Likert scale: 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than
half the days), and 3 (nearly every day). Total scores range
from 0 to 27. The severity of symptoms can be organized into
four categories: 0–4 (minimum), 5–9 (mild) 10–14 (moderate),
15–19 (moderate to severe), 20–27 (serious) (7). The PHQ9 was developed as a screening tool, with recommended
cut-off scores between 8 and 11 for a probable case of
MDD (8).

## Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
The CIDI (36) is a structured diagnostic interview developed
by the World Health Organization (WHO). It has been used
in epidemiological studies in the general population, with high


-----

inter-rater and test-retest reliability, and is a valid gold standard
for MDD diagnosis (37, 38), with evidence of validity in
multiple international studies, including Chile (4, 39, 40). The
CIDI can be administered by lay interviewers, thus overcoming
the limitations of interviews conducted only by professionals,
maintaining the objective that the diagnoses strictly adhere
to the established diagnostic criteria (41). CIDI 2.1 delivers
diagnoses following the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria, for a lifelong disorder, for last 12 months, and for the last 30 days (36, 42).
For this study, the diagnoses were used according to DSMIV criteria and their presence was evaluated during the last 6
months. Sections A (sociodemographic data) and E (depression)
were used in this study.

## Data Analysis
For descriptive data and internal consistency analyses (measured
by Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega coefficient) JASP
software (43) was utilized. For criterion validity, we assessed
the PHQ-9 performance in comparison to the gold standard
using MedCalc 14.8 (44). The CIDI, which is used for the
diagnosis of an MDD, was used as a criterion standard. The
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under
the curve (AUC) were constructed against the presence of
MDD by the CIDI. The following test characteristics of the
PHQ-9 were compared with the CIDI: sensitivity, specificity,
predictive values, likelihood ratios, clinical utility index, and
the Youden J index. For the confirmatory factorial analysis
(CFA), Mplus 8.4 software (45) was used. A unifactorial
and bifactorial model were postulated, using the robust
weighted least squares estimator (WLSMV), which does not
assume the normality of the variables and is considered
the best option to model categorical or ordinal data (46).
A chi-square difference test was performed to determine
which of the models has a best fit to the data using the
DIFFTEST command.

## RESULTS

 Participant Characteristics
We excluded from the study 5 of the 582 respondents due
to incomplete data. The remaining 577 (99.14%) cases were
included in the analyses. The mean age of the 577 participants
was 71.77 years (SD = 4.13). Table 1 ilustrates the demographic
characteristics of the sample. There were 374 women (64.8%) and
203 men (35.2%); 302 respondents were married (52.3%), 213
were bereaved or divorced (36.9%), and 62 (10.7%) were never
married; 114 (19.9%) of the participants had worked in the last
12 months, 84 (14.6%) lived alone and 366 (63.7%) had <12 years
of education.
The mean score of the 577 participants was 3.99 (SD =
4.31), with a range of 0 to 24. The median score was 3, with a
skewness of 1.51 (SE = 0.10) and kurtosis of 2.20 (SE = 0.20).
The distribution of the PHQ-9 scores is shown in Table 2. Most
of the participants (87.9%) had a PHQ-9 score under the most
common cut-off score (< 10), and only 4.3% had a score of 15
or higher.

## Item Analysis and Reliability
Mean scores for all PHQ-9 items are depicted in Table 3. The
two items reported most frequently were sleep problems and
low energy. The least-recognized item was suicidal ideation,
which also had the least corrected item-total correlation
(0.35). Corrected item-total correlation was in the range
of 0.35–0.59. As indicators of internal consistency, both
McDonald’s coefficient (ω), more suitable for scales with few
response options, and Cronbach’s coefficient (α), were calculated.
Both indicators were acceptable: ω = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.75–
0.80] and α = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.75–0.81], respectively. All
items, if deleted, would decrease both coefficients for the
total scale.

## Structural Validity
One- and two-factor models of the PHQ-9 were assessed using
CFA; the 1-factor solution indicated a good fit of the model
to the data, (χ [2] = 51.91, gl = 27, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.99;
TLI = 0.98; RMSEA = 0.04 [90% I.C. 0.02–0.06]); the 2-factor
solution with three somatic items and six cognitive-affective
items also indicated a good fit (χ [2] = 51.12, gl = 26, p < 0.001;
CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.98; RMSEA = 0.04 [90% I.C. 0.02–0.06]). In
both models, although the chi-square value was significant, given
the sample size, it is an expected result; CFI, TLI, and RMSEA
values are within the recommended standards (i.e., CFI > 0.95,
TLI > 0.95, RMSEA < 0.08) (47). A chi-square difference test
was also performed to determine which of the two models has
the best fit to the data. The nested comparison shows that the


difference between both models was not significant (χ [2] = 0.61,
gl = 1, p = 0.43), suggesting that the more parsimonious 1 factor
solution should be retained. Figure 1 shows the PHQ-9 factor
structure for the 1-factor solution, where all the factor loadings
were significant (p < 0.001) and >0.572. Figure 1 also reveals
the PHQ-9 factor structure for the 2-factor solution, where all
factor loadings were also significant (p < 0.001) and >0.578. The
correlation between the somatic and the cognitive-affective latent
factors was very high (r = 0.973, p < 0.001), suggesting that both
factors would be overlapping.

## Criterion Validity
According to the CIDI, 21 patients (3.6%) met the criteria
for diagnosis of MDD in the last 6 months. Significant


-----

differences were observed in the average PHQ-9 scores
between the participants with and without diagnosis
(M = 11.19, DT = 4.89; M = 3.72, DT = 4.05, t
(575) = 8.22, p < 0.001, r = 0.32). Figure 2 illustrates
the ROC curve showing PHQ-9 performance in the
identification of patients with MDD. The AUC was 0.88
(SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.85–0.90), which accounts for moderate
accuracy (48).
**Table 4 shows the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), Youden**
J index, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive
value (NPV), clinical utility index (CUI) and the likelihood
ratio (LR) of different cut-off PHQ-9 scores in the diagnosis
of MDD. The six-point cut-off score maximizes sensitivity and
specificity values based on the Youden J index (sensitivity of
0.95 and specificity of 0.76). With this cut-off score, the PPV
is 0.13 and the NPV is 0.99, and the positive and negative
likelihood ratios are 3.95 and 0.06, respectively. Some authors
(49–51) have pointed out limitations of the usual indicators
used to estimate cut-off scores and have suggested alternatives
such as the clinical utility index, which combines measures of
occurrence and discrimination (52). This clinically relevant rule
in accuracy is estimated by the clinical utility index positive
(Se × PPV), and rule out accuracy is estimated through the
clinical utility index negative (Sp × NPV). These measure
the clinical value of a diagnostic test when applied in a
specific setting, and can be graded using the following scale:
< 0.5 poor, ≥ 0.5 < 0.64 fair, ≥ 0.64 < 0.81 good and
≥ 0.81 ≤ 1 excellent.


## DISCUSSION

In this study, the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 and
their usefulness as a depressive disorder screening instrument
are analyzed in a sample of older Chilean adults. Although this
is not the only study of the functioning of the PHQ-9 that has
been organized in Chile (23, 24), to our knowledge, it is the
first study targeted at the older adult population, using a large
sample of older adults who attend PHC centers. In addition, it
has the advantage of having used the CIDI as a gold standard,
which is an instrument widely applied in epidemiological studies
due to its rigorous use of diagnostic criteria for established
mental disorders.
The results show an adequate psychometric behavior of the
PHQ-9 in the sample studied. Although the one dimension and
two-dimensional solutions showed good a fit and high factor
loadings, the scale appears to be one-dimensional given that
the result of the chi-square difference test and the correlation
between the non-somatic and somatic items was very high
(r = 0.97), suggesting an overlap and supporting the notion of
depression being a coherent unidimensional construct (11, 19).
All items demonstrated loads >0.57, and corrected item-total
correlations were >0.35. The internal consistency observed was
also acceptable.
The PHQ-9 also reflected adequate sensibility and specificity
values, comparable to those obtained in other studies (13, 16, 20).
As is common with screening instruments used in contexts with
low prevalence rates of the disorder (3.6% in this study), the
best outcome of the PHQ-9 was in ruling out the presence of a
depressive disorder rather than to positively confirm its presence.
The PPV and NPV of scores between 6 and 11 are in the range
of 0.13–0.22 and 0.99–0.98, respectively. These results suggest
that in the population studied, a PHQ-9 high score should not
be considered an indicator of probable a positive diagnosis but
as an indication of the suitability of a new and more thorough
evaluation; conversely, a low score confirms that the presence of
an MDD is unlikely.
The cut-off score must be based on the objectives of those
who use the instrument and the need to maximize detection or
reduce the number of false positives (53, 54). Various indicators
are considered for these purposes. One of the most used is
the Youden index, which seeks to estimate the score that best
combines sensitivity and specificity. In this study, the highest
Youden J value is for the 6 cut-off score, which is in the lower
range compared to other studies in elderly people (10, 13, 14,
17, 22). Nonetheless, some studies have presented similar results
in elderly populations (16, 20, 21). It is not clear to us what
to attribute this result to. Most of the studies mentioned above
have been done with more specific samples of chronic patients
than in this study, and with a higher prevalence of depressive
disorder; these could be influencing factors. Cultural aspects
may also play a relevant role, but it is unclear to which degree
they affect this result. It should be considered that the Youden
index is not necessarily the best criterion to select the cut-off
point, since it does not consider the effect of prevalence and,
therefore, the predictive value of the scores (52). Considering
the clinical utility index, which combines measures of occurrence

(Se/Sp) and discrimination (PPV/NPV), the best cut-off score
should be higher. The results of this study suggest that the
clinical utility index+ (adequate identification of cases) of the
PHQ-9 in this simple is very low; in contrast, the clinical utility
index- (discarding non-cases) is excellent, especially from 8
points onwards.
This study has some limitations. First, the performance of
the PHQ-9 was limited by the low prevalence rate of MDD
in the target population. However, it was slightly higher than
that observed in the only Chilean epidemiological study of
national scope, where the 12-month prevalence of MDD in
the general population was 2.9% in those over 65 years of
age, 1.6% among those of 65–75 and higher than 5.2% after
75 (4). The lower prevalence a of depressive disorder in older
people, compared to that observed in other ages, has been
confirmed in various studies (55). However, this does not
diminish its clinical relevance, but, on the contrary, accentuates
the challenge of its adequate detection and treatment. Second,
the analysis in this study was done by contrasting two specific
measures over time (PHQ-9 and CIDI) and assuming that
the use of the CIDI as a gold standard and the DSM-IV
diagnostic criteria in older adults results in the detection of
“authentic” depressive disorders. This is questionable. The DSMIV criteria may overestimate if they are used out of context
(56, 57). On the other hand, the DSM-IV criteria (and those
of the current DSM-V) do not facilitate the recognition of
the specificities that depression can manifest in elderly people.
There is some debate about the PHQ-9’s applicability in persons
suffering from multimorbidity, such as the elderly, where
the somatic symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance, and poor
appetite) may also be attributable to pain or another disease,
and as a result may produce an overestimation of depression
because of symptom overlap (58). The differential diagnosis
between medical comorbidities and depressive symptoms was
not considered in this study.
In summary, the results obtained indicate that the PHQ9 is an instrument with adequate psychometric properties


in elderly PHC users. In clinical settings, it should be
considered that its greatest utility in this study population
was to rule out the presence of depressive disorders rather
than to identify possible cases. In people with scores above
the cut-off point, it is essential to perform a new and more
thorough evaluation.
