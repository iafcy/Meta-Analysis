Background
Major Depressive Episodes (MDE) are one of the leading
causes of the global disease burden [1]. In severe cases,
depression can lead to suicide, which is associated with
the loss of about 850,000 lives each year [2]. Mental disorders are disabling and often co-morbid with chronic
physical diseases, such as cardiovascular disease [3–5].
It has been estimated that about 20% of adults in low
and middle-income countries (LMIC) suffer from mental
health or substance use disorder each year [6]. In Latin
America, depressive disorders are the leading cause of
DALYs (disability-adjusted life year) among women and

the fourth cause of DALYs among men [7]. Specifically,
in Argentina, the age-standardized DALY rate due to depressive disorders reached 795.7 per 100.000 in 2013 [8].
A review of epidemiological studies in general population of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru
and Puerto Rico, during the last 20 years, has shown a
12-month prevalence of major depression of 4.9% [7].
Despite its relevance to public health, depression is often
unrecognized and untreated in primary care [9–11].
There is a variety of available instruments to assess
depressive symptoms, but most of them have been developed in high-income countries and have not been
cross-culturally adapted or validated for their use in
LMIC [12]. The nine-item PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire), extensively validated in many countries, is
one of the most commonly used tools for diagnosis and

severity assessment of depression [13]. However, it has
not been validated for its use in Argentina.
The PHQ-9 is a short, self-administered questionnaire,
widely used for screening of depression in primary care
settings [14], and detection of this condition in large epidemiological studies [15–18]. Because this instrument is
based on DSM- IV criteria, those scoring high are often
cases with Major Depressive Episode (MDE). Further, it
can also be used to assess the severity of depression by
identifying from mild to severe cases. However, there is
growing evidence that cut-off points for determining the
degree of severity may vary depending on different contexts [19–22].
Although there is a cross-culturally adapted version of
the PHQ-9 in Spanish for Argentina [23], this version
has not been formally validated. Additionally, the appropriate cut-off points were not ascertained to assess
the severity of symptoms. Thus, the aim of this study
was to validate and calibrate the PHQ-9 to determine
the appropriate cut-off points to assess different degrees of severity of depression in the adult population
of Argentina.

Methods
Participants
A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on
adults with different degrees of severity of depression as
well as individuals with no depressive symptoms. The
study sample was obtained between December 2013 and
March 2014. Patients were recruited from two primary
care clinics and two specialty mental health outpatient
facilities, both from the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
The out-patient facilities were: 1) the “Dr. Braulio A.
Moyano” Hospital, which is a public neuropsychiatric
hospital serving a large urban catchment area predominantly of low-income, uninsured patients; and 2) the
“Foro Foundation”, a private outpatient facility treating
high-income patients. The primary care clinics were: 1)
The “Cooperativa de Grupo de Práctica de Medicina Familiar”, a private primary care center that treats middleincome insured patients from anywhere in Buenos Aires;
and 2) the “Centro HORUS”, a private institution specialized in mental health with a multidisciplinary approach serving middle-income patients.
A purposeful quota sampling approach of persons attending these facilities was used in the study. Participants were recruited from two sources: 1) Patients
referred by physicians because of the previous diagnosis
of depression, and 2) patients who asked for an appointment for other health problems were approached
and invited to participate. In both cases, all patients
were invited to participate and asked for their signed
informed consent.


Patients were recruited until the fulfillment of four
quotas defined as follows: (no depression, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression), according to
the Beck Depression Inventory described below. A minimum of thirty patients per category was set for quota
sampling.
Patients were included if they were able and willing to
consent, aged 21 years or older, and were native speakers
of Spanish. Exclusion criteria only applied to patients
who were illiterate.

Study instruments
Patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9)
We used the existing Argentinian version of the PHQ-9
instrument, which went through a full cross-cultural
adaptation process [23].
This is a nine-item self-reported scale, developed to
diagnose the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in primary care and the community. It is based on
the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Major Depression
Episode and it has the potential to be a dual-purpose instrument that can establish a tentative diagnosis of a depressive episode as well as depressive symptoms severity

[24]. Each question in the scale has four response
choices: “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the
days,” and “nearly every day.”
In the present study, we will validate and calibrate the
PHQ-9 as a continuous measure.
The continuous measure is a summary score ranging
from 0 to 27 and is calculated by adding up the responses to the nine questions, which allows assessing
the presence and severity of a depressive episode [24].
The initial cut-off points proposed by the authors for
the US population were as follows: ≥10 for diagnosis of
MDE. Regarding severity, PHQ-9 comprises five categories, where a cut-off point of 0–4 indicates no depressive
symptoms, 5–9 mild depressive symptoms, 10–14 moderate depressive symptoms, 15–19 moderately-severe depressive symptoms, and 20–27 severe depressive
symptoms [25].

MINI-international neuropsychiatric interview Spanish
version 5.0 (henceforth MINI): 6
The Spanish version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [26] was used as the gold
standard for identifying the presence or absence of
major depressive episode. The MINI interview is a validated tool used to diagnose minor and major depression
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), and is similar to the SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIV) in operation and principle [27]. This short structured
diagnostic interview explores the major Axis I psychiatric disorders in DSM-IV and ICD-10. Studies of


-----

validity and reliability have been conducted comparing
the MINI to the SCID-P for DSM-III-R and CIDI (a
structured interview developed by the World Health
Organization for non-clinical interviewers for ICD-10).
The results of these studies have shown that not only
the MINI score has acceptably high validity and reliability, but also it can be administered in a much shorter
period (18.7 ± 11.6 min, average 15 min) compared to
the instruments mentioned above [28]. Direct clinical
examination by a psychiatrist administering the Major
Depressive Episode (MDE) and Dysthymia modules of
the MINI was undertaken. The MDE module determined the standard diagnostic practice for the present
study, while the Dysthymia module just helped us to
capture the patients with lower levels of depressive
symptomatology but who did not meet the MDE
criteria.

Beck depression inventory second edition (hereafter BDI-II)
The locally validated version of the Beck Depression Inventory Second edition (BDI-II) was used as an instrument to ascertain symptom severity [29]. The BDI-II can
be used as a self-reported questionnaire or administered
by a physician. This questionnaire comprises 21 items,
where each symptom is rated for the past two weeks, including the present-day on a four-point rating scale (0–
3). The sum score ranges from 0 to 63. The following
four severity levels are suggested: scores between 0 and
13 indicate minimal symptoms, from 14 to 19 mild, between 20 and 28 moderate, and from 29 to 63 severe
symptoms of depression [29]. BDI-II has shown good
psychometric properties across several settings [30, 31].
In our study, the BDI-II questionnaire was administered
by trained clinicians.
We decided to address the inherent difficulty given by
the fact that PHQ-9 defines five categories of depression
while the BDI-II defines only four, because to our knowledge BDI-II was the unique instrument for depression
screening validated in Argentina at the beginning of the
study. So, in our study, the moderately severe and severe
categories of the original PHQ-9 were expected to correspond to the severe category of BDI-II.

Data collection
The PHQ-9 was self-administered, while a trained clinician conducted a structured interview (MDE, or MDE
and Dysthymia modules of MINI) and applied the BDIII questionnaire. Only those individuals who did not
meet criteria for MDE received the Dysthymia module,
as we wanted to ascertain how many of those classified
as ‘no depressed’ could present low levels of depressive
symptomatology. To minimize a possible response bias
induced by the sequence of administration of the instruments, two random sequences were used as follows: a)


MINI, BDI-II and PHQ-9, and b) PHQ-9, MINI, and
BDI-II. All the clinicians who conducted the interviews
were blinded to the results of the PHQ-9.
Additionally, we collected information on age, gender,
level of education, marital status, employment, and
health coverage.

Statistical analysis
Considering expected values of sensitivity between 85
and 88%, and specificity between 92 and 95%, we calculated a minimum sample size required of 40 participants
for each level of severity of depression and 30 healthy
subjects with no depressive symptoms. For the sample
size calculation we used the “Epidat 4.1”, free statistical
software developed by Dirección Xeral de Innovación e
Xestión da Saúde Pública de la Consellería de Sanidade
(Xunta de Galicia) and funded by PAHO and WHO.
Criterion validity was evaluated through the comparison of the scores obtained with the PHQ-9 with the
MINI interview for diagnosis, and BDI-II for the severity
of depression. We calculated sensitivity, specificity and
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive
value (NPV).
To determine the most appropriate cut-off points for
PHQ-9 receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves
were generated and Youden index was calculated using
the PHQ-9 summary score, where the results for depression diagnosis and severity were obtained from MINI
and BDI-II respectively. All estimates were given with
95% confidence intervals.
To determine the optimal cut-off points, the area
under the curve (AUC) and the PPV and NPP were evaluated and compared to the original cut-off points suggested by the authors of the original scale [25]. The
AUC for different cut-off points were compared using
the non-parametric statistical method described by
Hanley & McNeil [32]. Youden’s index was calculated as
(sensitivity + specificity – 1) [33]. The most accurate
cut-off point for diagnosis and for each category of depression severity was ascertained. The Cronbach Alpha
coefficient was used for measuring reliability. All data
analyses were done with STATA 12.0 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX, USA).
The data were analyzed with dysthymia cases included
as “not depressed” and also excluding them to evaluate
eventual changes in the results.

Results
A total sample of 169 subjects was recruited, 102 women
(60.4%) and 67 men (39.6%). The mean age was 47.4 (SD
14.8 years). Thirty-eight percent of them were secondary
school graduates, and 14.8% were unemployed. Thirty
percent of participants were married or had a partner,
and 77% had social or private health insurance (Table 1).

Criterion validity analysis for diagnosis of depression
against MINI
We examined the performance of PHQ-9 against the
diagnosis of MDE by MINI as the gold standard. According to MINI, 102 patients (60.36%) met the diagnosis of DSM-IV MDE. The mean PHQ-9 score for these
patients was 14.76 (SD = 5.65), whereas the mean score
for patients without diagnosis of MDE was 4.16 (SD =
4.01).
The validity of the PHQ-9 score as a continuous
measure was also assessed. Table 2 depicts the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and positive and negative
likelihood ratio for different thresholds for diagnosing
MDE against MINI. At the cut-off score of 8 or
higher, the sensitivity was 88.2%, and the specificity


was 86.6% (see Table 2). In addition, at this cut-off
point of 8, we obtained a Youden index of J = 0.75
and 87.6% of subjects were correctly classified. An
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% CI 0.82;
0.92) also suggests good accuracy. (See Fig. 1: ROC
Curve for diagnosis of MDE according to the MINI
compared with the PHQ-9).
We analyze the data with dysthymia cases included as
“not depressed” first and excluding them from the analysis subsequently but the results were unaltered either
way, most likely because there were only few cases (n =
16) of dysthymia.
Finally, the total score of PHQ-9 was compared with
the BDI-II score. Pearson’s correlation coefficient between PHQ-9 and BDI-II was 0.88 (p < 0.01) indicating a
positive and strong correlation between both instruments. (See Fig. 2: Correlation between BDI-II and
PHQ-9 scores).

Criterion validity analysis for depression severity
assessment against BDI-II
As recommended for the Argentinean version of the
BDI-II, the following categories of severity were considered: 0–13 for minimal symptoms/no depression, 14–19
for mild symptoms, 20–28 for moderate symptoms and
29–63 for severe symptoms [28].
The performance of the PHQ-9 against the different
categories of severity of depressive symptoms using BDI-II
as a criterion standard can be seen in Tables 3, 4, and 5.
The optimal cut-off points were 6–8 for mild, 9–14 for
moderate and 15 or higher for severe depressive symptoms, respectively. These thresholds showed good sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and positive and negative
likelihood ratio for each category. Sensitivity ranged between 82.4% for severe symptoms to 95.3% for moderate
symptoms. Specificity varied from 80.9% (moderate) to
90.4% (mild).
High AUC estimates were also seen for all categories.
AUC for mild, moderate and severe depressive symptoms was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.96), 0.88 (95% CI 0.83
to 0.93) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.92) respectively (See
Fig. 1): ROC Curve- Mild symptoms of depression with
PHQ-9 compared to BDI-II; Fig. 1: ROC Curve- Moderate symptoms of depression with PHQ-9 compared to
BDI-II, and Fig. 1: ROC Curve- Severe symptoms of depression with PHQ-9 compared to BDI-II).
For measuring mild symptoms of depression, a cut-off
of 6 or higher showed high sensitivity (91.5%) and specificity (90.4%) and yielded a Youden index of J = 0.82 that
represented 91.12% of subjects correctly classified. When
comparing AUC for a cut-off point of 6 and for a cutoff point of 5 (recommended by the original authors) the
difference was not statistically significant (CI overlapped). A cut-off point of 5 showed an AUC 0.85 (95%
CI 0.79–0.91) whereas a cut-off point of 6 showed an
AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.86–0.95).
Regarding moderate symptoms of depression, at the
cut-off point of 9, the sensitivity was high (95.3%) but
the specificity was lower but still adequate (81.0%) and
the Youden index was J = 0.76. This classification yielded
88.17% of subjects correctly classified. When comparing
AUC for a cut-off point of 9 and for a cut- off point of
10 (recommended by the original authors) the difference
was not statistically significant (CI overlapped). A cut-off


point of 9 showed an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.83–0.93)
whereas a cut-off point of 10 showed an AUC of 0.87
(95% CI 0.82–0.92).
Finally, the best cut-off point to measure severe depressive symptoms was 15 or higher, with a sensitivity of
82.4% and a specificity of 89.0%. Using that cut-off point,
we obtained a Youden index of J = 0.71 and the PHQ-9
questionnaire correctly classified 86.98% of the subjects.
In this case, as a comparison of both ROC curves for the
cut-off point of 15 and the cut- off point of 20 (the recommended by original authors) a significant difference
was obtained. Cut-off point of 15 showed AUC 0.86
(95% CI 0.80–0.92) and cut-off point of 20 showed AUC
0.67 (95% CI 0.60–0.74). Optimal cut-off points for the
Argentinian version of PHQ-9 are shown in Table 6.
Regarding internal consistency, the Cronbach’s alpha
for the total PHQ-9 scale was 0.87.

Discussion
There is a large body of evidence on PHQ-9 validation
against MDE diagnosis from different countries and
populations [19, 34–41]. However, there are few studies
assessing calibration on severity categories [20, 21], despite a strong recommendation to explore score severity
thresholds across diverse populations. [19, 22]. To our
knowledge, this is the first validation and calibration
study of the PHQ-9 in Argentina.
The internal consistency of PHQ-9 in this study was
high and similar to the values found in other studies,
which ranged from 0.67 to 0.89 [42–50]. It has been suggested that a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.70 or greater should be
regarded as acceptable for a self-reported instrument [51].
When the PHQ-9 was examined for detecting MDE as
a continuous measure, its validity was supported by an
AUC value of 0.87, which suggests a high diagnostic accuracy. The sensitivity at the cut-off value of 8 or higher
was 88.2%, and the specificity was 86.6%. These values,
in particular, the specificity, are higher than those reported in two meta-analyses using PHQ-9 as a continuous measure for diagnosis of major depressive episodes

[52, 53]. Furthermore, according to another recent
meta-analysis, the adequate cut-off points for diagnosing
MDE ranged from 8 to 11 [53]. These results, together
with the cut-off point of 8 or higher suggested by another study [20] are also consistent with our results. A

cut-off point of 8 showed an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.82–
0.93) whereas a cut-off point of 10 showed an AUC of
0.85 (95% CI 0.80–0.90). However, as expected, the sensitivity obtained with a lower threshold was higher, which
becomes relevant since this instrument is intended to be
used in primary care settings and population-based
research.
For the present study, the MDE module of the MINI
(time frame of two weeks) determined the standard diagnostic practice. While the use of Dysthymia module of
the MINI (time frame of two years) just helped us to
capture the patients with lower levels of depressive
symptomatology but who do not reach MDE criteria. As
we explained before, only those individuals who did not
meet criteria for MDE received the Dysthymia module.
We found that including or excluding these patients did
not alter the results at all, something that was expected
as there were few cases of dysthymia.
Of note, the PHQ-9 score was highly correlated with
the BDI-II score. This correlation was even higher than
that reported by Kneipp et al. (Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.80) when comparing the same instruments
in low-income female populations [44]. Our results indicate a positive, strong association between both instruments, which further support the validity of the PHQ-9
measurements in this population.
Regarding the comparison of categories of severity and
despite the inherent difficulty given by the fact that
PHQ-9 defines five categories of depression while the
BDI-II defines only four, the optimal cut-off points for
the Argentine version of PHQ-9 generated the same four
categories, as found in other studies (see Table 6)

[11, 12]. These categories are also defined according
to the DSM-IV. The thresholds for all four categories,
6–8 for mild, 9–14 for moderate and 15 or higher for
severe depressive symptoms respectively showed good


sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and positive and
negative likelihood ratio. Of note, in the Argentinean
version, the moderately severe and severe categories
of PHQ-9 correspond to or could be included in the
severe category of BDI-II. Since, the therapeutic approach
for both, moderate-severe or severe patients, it is similar;
although this misalignment of the scale categories is not
ideal, it doesn’t have a relevant impact for screening or
therapeutic approach purposes.
This validation study of the PHQ-9 for the Argentinean
population has several strengths. First, it was rigorously
designed to have an adequate representation of all the
stages of severity of depression, including patients with
non-depressive symptoms, which is key to ensure not only
its validity for diagnosis of depression but also its calibration for different categories of severity; Secondly, we chose
a criterion tool that is shorter than other diagnostic tools
available in Argentina for identifying depressive cases [25],
something that is important in primary care. Thirdly, the
PHQ-9 is useful to assess not only the presence of clinical
depression but also its degree of severity. Specifically, for
severity measures, this Argentine version provides locally
adjusted thresholds and follows recommendations to
adapt the instrument to the context and setting where the
tool is aimed to be implemented [19, 22]. Finally, its use is
increasingly being valued in epidemiological research because it is brief and can be scored in a very simple way,
providing a continuous measure that is easier to interpret
in large epidemiological studies [15–18].
Our study presents some limitations. First, since this
study has focused mainly on the city dwellers of Buenos
Aires and its surroundings, its extrapolation to rural settings should be taken with caution. Yet, its usability seems
to be enhanced by the fact that 90% of the Argentine
population lives in urban areas. Second, the sample composition is heterogeneous with patients coming from

primary and secondary care settings as well as private and
state sectors. Nonetheless, this might allow us to extrapolate findings to other clinical populations. Third, we administered the instruments in a different order to avoid
eventually bias, but we have not done additional analyses
to ascertain if this had an impact on results. Fourth, since
the PHQ-9 defines five categories of depression while the
BDI-II defines only four, the optimal cut-off points for the
Argentine version of PHQ-9 generated the same four categories. However, it may not have a relevant impact on
screening or intervention purposes because it doesn’t condition the therapeutic approach.

Conclusions
The Argentine version of the PHQ-9 questionnaire has
shown acceptable validity and reliability for both screenings of Major Depressive Episodes and severity assessment
of depressive symptoms. A definite diagnosis would ideally
be attained; however, with a complementary psychiatric
interview; a tool that is not always available in primary
care settings. Therefore, this validated and calibrated tool
could improve and facilitate the detection, classification
and monitoring of depressive disorders in Argentina, particularly in the primary care setting, where depression still
goes unnoticed and therefore undertreated.
