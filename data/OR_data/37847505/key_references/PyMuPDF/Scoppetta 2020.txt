Abstract 
Background: The PHQ-2 is a screening test for major depressive disorder (MDD) 
derived from PHQ-9, which has shown to be useful in the detection of cases of clinical 
         
         

significance in previous studies. The psychometric properties of PHQ-2 in the Colombian 
population are unknown. 
Methods: PHQ-2 were assessed in 243 patients in general medical consultations 
using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as the gold standard. 
Internal consistency, convergent validity and criterion validity were calculated by analyzing 
the Receptor Operating Characteristics (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC).  
Results: Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald's omega coefficients were 0.71. 
Spearman’s rho coefficients for correlations with PHQ-9 and HADS-D scores were 0.63 
and 0.59 (p<0.01). AUC  was 0.89. The optimal cut point was ≥2 with the following 
indicators: sensitivity 0.87 specificity 0.74; Youden index 0.60; PPV 0.47; NPV 0.95; 
(LR+) 3.24; (LR-) 0.18 (95% CI 0.09-0.37). Kappa coefficient between PHQ-2 and MINI 
for depression was .458 and 0.46 for HADS-D. 
Limitations: Since this study was done with people attending hospital, which could 
has implications for the prevalence of depression, affecting the validity indicators of the 
instrument. 
Conclusions: PHQ-2 show an acceptable test performance in the context of the 
study.  However, the test could yield a considerable amount of false positives that would 
require specialized evaluation to establish a reliable diagnosis.

1. Introduction 
Major depressive disorder  (MDD) is a major public health problem that 
significantly contributes to the global burden of the disease worldwide (König et al., 2019; 
Steel et al., 2018). The prevalence of MDD is significantly higher in primary care (PC) than 
in the general population (Mitchell et al., 2009). Thus, the lifetime prevalence of a major 
depressive episode (MDE) is 11.2% in the general population (Kessler et al., 2015), while it 
can be as high as 48% in PC (Wang et al., 2017). In Colombia, last-month prevalence of 
MDE in users of PC services was 21.1%, which was assessed using clinical interviews 
(Cassiani-Miranda et al., 2020).  
The highest number of MDE cases is managed in PC centers (Ferenchick et al., 
2019). Only the most complicated cases, with little response or comorbidity, reach other 
levels of health care (Spijker et al., 2002). It has been estimated that more than 8 million 
medical consultations are for MDE in the United States and more than half of them are 
delivered at PC centers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). Similarly, 
around 7% of all PC consultations are for MDE worldwide (Shah, 1992).  
Most MDE cases are treated by general practitioners (Harman et al., 2006). 
However, PC physicians often fail to make an accurate diagnosis. Consequently, symptoms 
may be underestimated leading to a high proportion of unidentified and untreated cases 
(Demyttenaere et al., 2004; Zastrow et al., 2008), with negative consequences on the 
service users’ quality of life, costs to the healthcare system and country productivity (Luo 
et al., 2010). Failing at identifying MDE is partly due to the lack of trained professionals on 
         
         

mental health issues and appropriate screening instruments (Campo-Arias and Barliza, 
2018; Patel et al., 2008; Patel and Sartorius, 2008)  
Available evidence suggests that the routine use of screening instruments can 
potentially improve case detection and treatment delivery for MDE cases at PC (Johnson et 
al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2016; Romera et al., 2013; Thombs et al., 2017). 
The use of short questionnaires (< 5 minutes) and ultra-short questionnaires (< 2 
minutes) may improve MDE case detection at PC (Mitchell et al., 2011; Mitchell and 
Coyne, 2007). The growing interest in the use of these short instruments to detect 
depression is due to the advantages that these can offer in overcrowded PC settings where 
consultation time is limited (Mitchell and Coyne, 2007). 
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is the instrument of choice for assessing 
depression at PC (Ferenchick et al., 2019), showing excellent reliability, validity and great 
acceptance in different cultural contexts (El-Den et al., 2018; Pettersson et al., 2015), with a 
sensitivity and specificity of 78% (CI95% 0.70-0.84) and 87% (CI95% 0.84-0.90), 
respectively, at a cut-off point (CP) of ≥10 (Moriarty et al., 2015). 
The Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2) is composed of the first two items of 
PHQ-9 which represent the cardinal signs for the diagnosis of MDE according to the DSM 
(depressed mood or anhedonia) (Kroenke et al., 2003). Like PHQ-9, the PHQ-2 has also 
shown to be an excellent screening instrument for detecting depression in different settings; 
with a sensitivity of 91% (CI 95% 0.85-0.94) and a sensitivity of 70% (CI 95% 0.64-0.76) 
for CP ≥ 2 (Manea et al., 2016). However, it has been poorly evaluated in low-and middle-
income countries (LAMIC) (Hanlon et al., 2015; Lino et al., 2014). It should be also 
considered that the performance of screening instruments may vary according to the 
demographic, social and cultural characteristics of the population. Therefore, it is always 
         
         

necessary to first make adjustments to achieve greater linguistic equivalence (Ramada-
Rodilla et al., 2013) and secondly, to make modifications to the cut-off point since the 
sensitivity and specificity of the instruments gets affected by the prevalence of the problem 
at stake in a particular context (Brenner and Gefeller, 1997; Lange and Lippa, 2017).  
There are no data published in Colombia about the psychometric properties of PHQ-
2. Under the assumption that the PHQ-2 shows adequate validity, PC healthcare 
professionals in Colombia will have a valid, reliable, and easy-to-use strategy that helps 
better identify MDE at PC. Therefore, this study is aimed at evaluating the performance of 
the PHQ-2 against the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) in PC adult 
users in Bucaramanga, Colombia. 
2. Methods 
An observational analytical study of criterion validity was conducted using a gold 
standard scale and following the recommendations of the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment 
of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool (Whiting et al., 2011). 
This manuscript is part of an instrument validation study to identify common mental 
disorders at PC (Cassiani et al, 2020). 
 
2.1. Participants 
The sample size was calculated to evaluate the proportion difference between the 
characteristics of a new test and a recognized gold standard (Sánchez and Echeverry, 2001). 
The statistical details of the sample size calculation have been previously published 
(Cassiani et al, 2020). 243 adults of both sexes attending primary care centers in 
Bucaramanga, Colombia were included. Several reasons were considered to choose primary 
care centers to carry out this study: Most care for depression is delivered by general 
         
         

practitioners (GPs) in primary care and many GPs have considerable experience in 
managing depression (Harman et al., 2006) Yet, clinicians find it challenging to diagnose 
depression accurately and often overestimate or underestimate levels of distress of their 
patients that sometimes result in false-positive or false-negative diagnoses (Zastrow et al., 
2008). Indeed, GPs are typically able to detect about half of true cases of depression in a 
one-off consultation and once diagnosed, not all depressed patients receive adequate and 
timely care (Duhoux et al., 2012; Takayanagi et al., 2015). 
Patients with psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment, delirium or intellectual 
disability that may hinder response to the instruments were excluded, as well as being 
under the effects of psychoactive substances, with functional alteration of vision or hearing 
that prevented the understanding the content of the questionnaire and those who did not 
understand Spanish. To identify patients with psychotic symptoms, the psychotic disorders 
module of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (Sheehan et al., 1998) 
(Lecrubier et al., 1997) was applied, and to detect those with cognitive impairment, the 
Colombian version of the Mini Mental State Examination was used (Rosselli et al., 2000). 
 
2.2. Procedure  
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Santander, 
following the international World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (2013) and 
the national standards (Ministry of Health, 1993) applicable for human subject research. 
The PHQ-2 was translated and adapted following the recommendations for 
adaptation of self-report tests (Beaton et al., 2000). 
The research team was trained on the structured psychiatric interview (MINI) and 
hetero-application of the PHQ-2. Healthcare professionals with clinical experience (four 
         
         

psychologists, two family medicine fellows and a psychiatrist) were responsible for 
applying the structured scales and interviews, they also received eight hours of training 
with theoretical-practical sessions, role-playing, observation of pilot interviews with 
feedback. Study participants were contacted in the waiting room as they arrived for 
outpatient consultation for any cause with a general practitioner. After completing the 
PHQ-2, the participants were evaluated on the same day in another office by another 
trained team member (psychologist or psychiatrist), who was unaware of the result of the 
PHQ-2, to apply the MINI MDE module. 
 
2.3. Instruments 
 
2.3.1. PHQ-9 
The PHQ-9 is a screening scale that measures the presence and severity of 
depressive symptoms (Kroenke et al., 2001). It comprises the nine symptoms of DSM-IV 
Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (Kocalevent et al., 2013; Spitzer et al., 1999). These 
nine items are arranged in a Likert response format that evaluates the presence of the 
symptom over the last two weeks ("not at all", "several days", "more than half of the days" 
and "almost every day"), which score from 0 to 3, getting a total score from 0 to 27 (Spitzer 
et al., 2000). The psychometric characteristics of the PHQ-9, according to Kroenke et al., 
present a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 88%, an adequate internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86-0.89), a test-retest score of 0.84, a concordance between the self-
determined test vs. the test performed by the evaluator of 84% and an area under the curve 
of 0.95 (Kroenke et al., 2001). The process of adapting the version used in this study has 
been previously described in other studies (Cassiani-Miranda et al., 2019). 
         
         

 
2.3.2. Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) 
The PHQ-2 consists of the first two items of the PHQ-9. The scoring formula is 
equal to that of PHQ-9 and the scoring range is 0 to 6 (Kroenke et al., 2003). In the PC 
context, the PHQ-2 showed a sensitivity of 86% and 61%, a specificity of 78% and 92% for 
CPs of ≥2 and ≥3 respectively (Arroll et al., 2010; Manea et al., 2016). Its clinical 
usefulness lies in the fact that it reduces the length of regular PC consultations, which are 
usually busy, considering that general practitioners have limited time (Inagaki et al., 2013). 
Considering the cited authors, the cut-off point of ≥ 2 was established to identify patients 
experiencing depressive symptoms with clinical importance (DSCI) in the current work, 
following the recommendations by Mitchell et al. (Mitchell et al., 2016). Although there is 
a previous version of PHQ-9 and, therefore, of PHQ-2 used in Colombia (Cassiani-Miranda 
et al. 2018), a new adaptation was considered for this study since the previously used 
version was taken from Pfizer website with prior permission (http: // 
www.phqscreeners.com/). Besides, there was no evidence of a translation and back-
translation process recommended by international standards for cross-cultural adaptation of 
health assessment tools (Ortiz-Gutiérrez and Cruz-Avelar 2018; Ramada-Rodilla et al., 
2013). 
Despite having Spanish-language versions (Rodríguez-Muñoz et al., 2017; Saldivia 
et al. 2019), the questionnaire was completely translated since there may be minimal 
linguistic details that can affect its validity (Ortiz-Gutiérrez and Cruz-Avelar, 2018). 
 
2.3.3. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)  
         
         

The HADS was designed by Zigmond and Snaith for the detection of affective 
disorders associated with somatic symptoms, which consists of 14 items with a subscale of 
anxiety (odd items) and depression (even items). Each item is evaluated based on a four-
point scale of frequency ranging from 0 to 3 (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983). The HADS has 
been translated into most European languages, Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Japanese, and 
Chinese (Snaith, 1992) and has demonstrated reliability and validity in numerous studies 
(Moorey et al., 1991). In Colombia, it was validated in oncological patients showing an 
adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85) and a CP of 8 for the anxiety 
subscale and 9 for the depression subscale (Rico et al., 2005). These findings were 
confirmed through a population sample (n 1500) conducted in several cities in Colombia 
(Hinz et al., 2014). The adapted version elaborated by Rico et al. was used in this research 
(Rico et al., 2005). 
 
2.3.4. Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 
The MINI is a brief structured diagnostic interview that explores the diagnostic 
categories of DSM-IV and ICD-10. Its original version was developed by Sheehan 
(Sheehan et al., 1998) and Lecrubier (Lecrubier et al., 1997) in the United States and 
France, which contains 130 questions organized into modules evaluating 16 DSM-IV axis I 
disorders and a personality disorder. The original English version showed a range of 
sensitivity between 0.46 and 0.94 and specificity between 0.72 and 0.97 (Sheehan et al., 
1998), a good interrater reliability (Kappa 0.70) and test-retest and moderate criterion 
validity compared to CIDI and SCID-P (Lecrubier et al., 1997; Sheehan et al., 1998). The 
MINI has gained rapid international acceptance (Balázs et al., 2003; Pinninti et al., 2003), 
has been translated into 43 languages (Sheehan et al., 1998) and its reliability and validity 
         
         

has been explored in different countries (de Azevedo Marques and Zuardi, 2008; Mordal et 
al., 2010; Otsubo et al., 2005).  
The average administration time is 18.7±11.6 minutes with an average of 15 
minutes (Sheehan et al., 1998). The MINI along with CIDI and SCID-I are considered gold 
standards that are globally accepted for the diagnosis of mental disorders in clinical and 
research settings (Tejada et al., 2014). 
 
2.4. Statistical Analysis 
A descriptive analysis of qualitative and quantitative variables was conducted. The 
following indicators were calculated: Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald's coefficient omega 
for internal consistency. The lowest acceptable value for the test is 0.70 (Ventura-León and 
Caycho-Rodríguez, 2017; Watkins, 2017). 
Spearman's non-parametric correlation coefficients were calculated as convergent 
validity indicators concerning the PHQ-9 and HADS-D tests since the PHQ-2 scores 
showed an asymmetric distribution. The existence of convergent validity was accepted, 
provided that the value of rs was higher than 0.60 (Post, 2016). 
For criterion validity, the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) 
curve was calculated, which compared the PHQ-2 scores to the presence of an MDE in a 
MINI interview to determine the probability that a participant who met the criteria for MDE 
was correctly classified and to choose the cut-off point with the corresponding indicators. 
Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and positive and negative 
likelihood ratios were calculated with the respective 95% confidence intervals, 95% CI 
(Hanley and McNeil, 1982). The probability of concordance between PHQ-2 and MINI 
beyond chance was calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960).  
         
         

In order to determine a more precise CP, the CP that achieved a better balance 
within the other indicators was chosen, according to the Youden index, which corresponds 
to the difference between correct positive responses and incorrect positive responses, and 
whose maximum value is usually reached with the best balance between sensitivity and 
specificity (Cerda and Cifuentes, 2012; Youden, 1950).  
The analyses were carried out using the STATA® statistical software version 13 
and the application of formulas in spreadsheets. 
 
3. Results 
 
3.1. Sample Characteristics 
The sample consisted of 243 participants of whom 184 (75.7%) were female. The 
average age was 34.1 years (median 31.0 and SD=12.5). The average was 33.6 for men 
(SD=12.9) and 34.2 for women (SD=12.4) (table 1). 
3.2. Prevalence of Depression Diagnoses 
 
PHQ-9 scores ranged between 0 and 25 with an average of 5.4 (SD=5.2) and a 
median of 4.0. PHQ-2 scores ranged between 0 and 6 with an average of 1.2 (SD =1.7). 
Twenty-one percent of participants (21.4%) met the criteria for MDE according 
to the MINI.  There was a significant difference between depression rates in men (15.2%) 
and in women (23.4%). According to the PHQ-9, 33.7% of the participants met criteria for 
DSCI) (37.5% for women and 22.0% for men). The prevalence of DSCI using PHQ-2 
was 33.7% for the entire group of participants (38.0% for women and 20.3% for men).  
3.3. Internal Consistency 
         
         

In the analysis of internal consistency by calculating the Cronbach’s alpha and 
McDonald's omega coefficient, a value of 0.71 was obtained in both cases. 
 
3.4. Convergent Validity 
To assess convergent validity, Spearman’s rho coefficients (suitable for non-
parametric correlation tests) were calculated for correlations with total PHQ-9 and HADS-
D scores of 0.63 and 0.59, respectively (p<0.01). 
 
3.4. Criterion Validity 
The area under the ROC curve was 0.89 (95% CI 0.84-0.93). The estimated optimal 
CP was ≥2 with the following indicators: sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.74-0.94); specificity 
of 0.74 (95% CI 0.66-0.79); Youden index of 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.66); positive predictive 
value of 0.47 (95% CI 0.37-0.57); negative predictive value of 0.95 (95% CI 0.90-0.98); 
positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 3.24 (95% CI 2.50-4.20); negative likelihood ratio (LR-) 
of 0.18 (95% CI 0.09-0.37). The Kappa coefficient between PHQ-2 and MINI for 
depression was .458 and 0.46 for HADS-D. 
4. Discussion 
Broadly speaking, the PHQ-2 is profiled as an acceptable screening instrument for 
the rapid identification of MDE cases. The instrument shows acceptable convergent validity 
and modest performance indicators against the structured clinical interview. 
Internal consistency was 0.71 (coefficient alpha and coefficient omega) in this 
study, similar to the PHQ-2 for the Russian version (0.79) (Rancans et al., 2018) and the 
Hong-Kong’s version (0.76) (Yu et al. 2011). For a self-report instrument to be reliable, it 
         
         

is suggested that Cronbach’s alpha be at least 0.70 (Kottner & Streiner, 2010; Ventura-
León, 2018; De Vet et al., 2017). 
A sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.90 for an optimal CP ≥ 3 was found in the 
original PHQ-2 validity study (Kroenke, Spitzer & Williams 2003). In the current study, 
the sensitivity and specificity of PHQ-2 were 0.87 and 0.74 respectively (for optimal PC ≥ 
2), which indicate comparable results in sensitivity, although a substantial difference in 
specificity is observed in favor of the original version by Kroenke et al. (Kroenke, Spitzer 
& Williams 2003). These differences are consistent with the findings of the systematic 
review conducted by Manea et al., (Manea et al. 2016), suggesting that the accuracy of the 
PHQ-2 is lower in the involved studies than in the original validity study (Kroenke, Spitzer 
& Williams 2003). 
Furthermore, the diagnostic meta-analysis of primary care studies (Arroll et al. 
2010; Kroenke et al. 2003; Phelan et al. 2010; Zuithoff et al. 2010) found a pooled 
sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI = 0.80-0.88) and a pooled specificity of 0.76 (95% CI = 074–
0.79). The sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-2 in this study (Se =0.87; Sp = 0.74) 
exceed the sensitivity being very close to the specificity of the PC studies included in the 
meta-analysis conducted by Manea et al. (Se= 0.84, Sp = 0.76) (Manea et al. 2016). These 
differences in the PHQ-2 psychometric indices may be due to different CPs, different 
prevalence in the target population and the response pattern of each population (Keszei, 
Novak & Streiner, 2010; Mitchell et al., 2016). This response pattern of each population 
can is determined by cultural, cognitive, educational, and sociodemographic factors of the 
population, variables that can vary from one country to another or even within the same 
country (Keszei et al., 2010). 
         
         

Moreover, the LR+ for PHQ-2 was 3.24 and the LR- was 0.18. This means that, in a 
similar clinical setting, MDE patients are 3.24 times more likely to have PHQ-2 ≥ 2 scores 
compared to patients without MDE. Similarly, patients without MDE are 5.5 (1/0.18) more 
likely to have a negative result in PHQ-2 compared to those with MDE. This LR-value is 
considered desirable for a screening test (Moratalla Rodríguez, 2015).  
The AUC found in this study was 0.89 which is comparable to the original version 
(0.93) (Kroenke et al. 2003; Mitchell et al. 2016).  This indicates that the PHQ-2 showed 
adequate well discriminant validity (Staples et al. 2019). 
Strengths and Weaknesses 
To our knowledge, this is the first study that analyzes the validity of the PHQ-2 in 
Colombia, starting from the adaptation of the language, the comparison with a standard and 
the calculation of the complete set of indicators related to criterion validity.  
Test application procedures were given in the context of methodological healthcare, 
which included the training of those responsible for test application and its detailed 
monitoring. 
However, this study has some limitations to be considered when interpreting the 
results. 
First, the MINI, the structured interview used as the gold standard, does not have a 
formal validation study in Colombia, which may compromise the validity of the results. 
However, since the MINI is widely used in international settings as calibration in Spanish-
speaking countries (Tejada et al., 2014) (Shehan et al., 1998), this limitation was mitigated 
to some extent. 
 
         
         

Secondly, compared to the MINI, the total of correctly classified cases using the 
PHQ-2 was 76.1%, assuming the cut-off point as ≥ 2. In raw data, 2.9% of the total of 
patients was classified as negative but met the criteria for MDE  according to the MINI and 
21% was classified as positive but according to the MINI did not meet the MDE criteria. In 
this regard, it cannot be ensured that when using ultrashort screening instruments such as 
the PHQ-2, patients who scored negative screening are true negatives and do not need any 
follow-up (Mulvaney-Day et al. 2018). While among the patients classified as positive, a 
significant proportion may not be cases of MDE, therefore they require a subsequent 
specialized evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, reducing the usefulness of a screening 
instrument. 
This is why we advocate for highly sensitive instruments or for a more equal 
sensitivity/specificity balance for the detection of MDE in PC such as the PHQ-9 (Cassiani-
Miranda et al. 2020; Mitchell et al. 2016). Screening instruments are helpful in identifying 
potential cases of major depressive disorders, and these are never a substitute for 
professional clinical evaluation. Due to the positive and negative predictive values obtained 
with PHQ-2, positive cases are unlikely to be lost without evaluation and treatment.  
Future research 
Developing tests is a long-term process that involves adaptations of the instrument 
to the changing social and cultural conditions. Therefore, considering that this is the first 
time that an analysis of the PHQ-2 properties is conducted in Colombia, it is necessary to 
study its behavior in other populations, for example, in a general outpatient population. 
It is also important to emphasize that reliability is not a fixed property of a scale. 
Rather, reliability is a function of the instrument, the group with which it is being used, and 
its circumstances. It would be incorrect to state that the reliability of a scale is opposed to 
         
         

the reliability of a scale used with a specific population for a given purpose (Keszei et al. 
2010). 
One of the public health implications of studies such as this one is the revival of the 
discussion about the impact of screening for depressive symptoms in PC. In this regard, 
despite the fact that some entities have recommended routine screening for depression in 
PC settings, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) and the UK 
National Screening Committee (UKNSC) (Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care 
et al. 2013; UK National Screening Committee s. f.) do not recommend routine screening 
for depression arguing lack of evidence of health benefits (Keshavarz et al. 2013; Thombs 
et al. 2014). 
Thombs et al., 2014 warned about the harm of detecting depression in asymptomatic 
individuals such as the presence of a significant proportion of false positives and 
unnecessary treatment. Additionally, stigma and medicalization are situations to consider 
when rapidly detecting depression using a self-report scale (Smithson & Pignone, 2017). 
However, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (Siu et al., 2016) and the 
American Academy of Family Physicians (Maurer, 2012) recommended routine screening 
for depression to all adults as long as there are health system measures to ensure an 
subsequent accurate diagnosis, effective treatment and appropriate follow-up. 
Thus, the harm of screening for depression in adults is small or null for the USPSTF 
(Siu et al., 2016). The controversy on this topic continues (Thombs et al., 2017) so ongoing 
studies are expected to provide more robust evidence on the routine evaluation of MDE in 
PC (Hamel et al., 2019). 
On the other hand, the PHQ-2 did not classify five participants who showed suicidal 
behavior as people with depression when answering the question "Have you thought you 
         
         

would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way?" at the highest degree of 
response ("almost every day"). It must be said that with the MINI, seven participants with 
this type of manifestation were no longer classified as depressed, two of them in the highest 
degree of response. It is interesting that with the PHQ-9, only one participant with suicidal 
ideation was left out of the depression classification. 
Although suicidal behavior without depression is likely to occur, the weight of 
suicidal behavior on depression assessment instruments is an issue that requires further 
research, given the rising rates of suicide in the country (Instituto Nacional de Medicina 
Legal y Ciencias Forenses, 2019) and its proven association with depression (Hawton et al., 
2013; Rotenstein et al., 2016). 
 
5. Conclusion 
The Colombian version of PHQ-2 has acceptable psychometric performance for 
MDE screening in adult PC users, with a CP greater than or equal to 2. However, the 
instrument may misclassify a significant number of patients, most of them false positives.
