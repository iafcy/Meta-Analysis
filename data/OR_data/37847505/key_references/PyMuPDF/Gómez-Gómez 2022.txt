Abstract
Background. Primary health care (PHC) professionals may play a crucial role in improving
early diagnosis of depressive disorders. However, only 50% of cases are detected in PHC.
The most widely used screening instrument for major depression is the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ), including the two-, eight- and nine-item versions. Surprisingly, there
is neither enough evidence about the validity of PHQ in PHC patients in Spain nor indica-
tions about how to interpret the total scores. This study aimed to gather validity evidence
to support the use of the three PHQ versions to screen for major depression in PHC in
Spain. Additionally, the present study provided information for helping professionals to
choose the best PHQ version according to the context.
Methods. The sample was composed of 2579 participants from 22 Spanish PHC centers
participating in the EIRA-3 study. The reliability and validity of the three PHQ versions
for Spanish PHC patients were assessed based on responses to the questionnaire.
Results. The PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 showed high internal consistency. The results obtained con-
firm the theoretically expected relationship between PHQ results and anxiety, social support
and health-related QoL. A single-factor solution was confirmed. Regarding to the level of
agreement with the CIDI interview (used as the criterion), our results indicate that the
PHQ has a good discrimination power. The optimal cut-off values were: ⩾2 for PHQ-2,
⩾7 for PHQ-8 and ⩾8 for PHQ-9.
Conclusions. PHQ is a good and valuable tool for detecting major depression in PHC patients
in Spain.
Introduction
Depression is a common mental disorder affecting a high percentage of the population. In 2019,
5.02% of the world population suffered from depression (Institute of Health Metrics &
Evaluation, 2019), with this rate having increased considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic
(Bueno-Notivol et al., 2021). PHC professionals may play a crucial role in improving early diag-
nosis and management of depressive disorders for two reasons. Firstly, major depression is the
mental disorder with the highest prevalence (around 10%) among Primary Health Care patients
(PHC) (Craven & Bland, 2013; Serrano-Blanco et al., 2010). Secondly, around 83% of the popu-
lation had used PHC services over the last 12 months (Macinko, de Andrade, de Souza Junior, &
Lima-Costa, 2019). Spain is the country with the largest volume of PHC visits in Europe. In
Spain, PHC is organized into around 3000 PHC centers (Government of Spain, 2021).
However, it has been estimated that only 22–31% of patients with major depression received
a correct diagnosis in Primary Health Care (Aznar-Lou et al., 2018; Fernández et al., 2010).

Having in mind this scenario and the current situation of satur-
ation of mental health services, it is crucial that PHC professionals
are provided with the instruments necessary to detect depression in
PHC patients (Ferenchick, Ramanuj, & Pincus, 2019).
Among the available tools, semi-structured or structured inter-
views are the most accurate instruments for detecting depression
(Brugha, Bebbington, & Jenkins, 1999). However, this is a time-
consuming tool not useful in routine PHC practice. In addition,
the final diagnosis may vary according to the screening instru-
ment employed. Thus, according to the results reported by
Levis et al. (2018), patients undergoing the Mini-International
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (Sheehan et al., 1998) were
more likely to receive a diagnosis of major depression than
those who underwent the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (CIDI) (WHO, 1997), although the CIDI provided a
deeper diagnosis of depression.
With regard to questionnaires, the most widely used screening tool
for detecting major depression in PHC is the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ) (Ferenchick et al., 2019; Maurer, Raymond, &
Davis, 2018). The PHQ is derived from the New Procedure for
Diagnosing Mental Disorders in Primary Care (PRIME-MD
study), which was originally developed to detect depression, anx-
iety, alcohol abuse, somatoform disorder, and eating disorders in
PHC (Spitzer et al., 1994). The PHQ was originally a nine-item
questionnaire that was developed to assess major depression in
PHC patients in the UK, showing adequate internal consistency
(α = 0.89; Kroenke, Spitzer, and Williams, 2001). According to
the authors, total scores can be interpreted using two different
strategies: a cut-off value, which determines whether the person
has or not a diagnosis of depression, or a diagnostic algorithm,
which requires a score ⩾2 in five items, including item 1 or 2.
However, according to previous studies, the algorithm has poorer
psychometric properties (pooled sensitivity 35%, pooled specificity
95%), as compared to the PHQ-9 cut-off point ⩾10 (He et al., 2020).
Since PHQ-9 was created, many studies, including systematic
reviews and meta-analyses, have been published to evaluate its
utility from different perspectives (Aslan et al., 2020; Costantini
et al., 2021; Diez-Quevedo, Rangil, Sanchez-Planell, Kroenke, &
Spitzer, 2001; Gelaye et al., 2013; He et al., 2020; Levis et al.,
2017, 2020; Manea, Gilbody, & McMillan, 2012; Muñoz-Navarro
et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020). Most studies were aimed at establish-
ing the optimal cut-off point for detecting major depression. For
instance, an individual participant data meta-analysis showed
that the most widely used cut-off point (PHQ-9 ⩾10) had a
pooled sensitivity of 67% and a pooled specificity of 86% (He
et al., 2020). However, evidence about the validity of these cut-off
values is not consistent. A meta-analysis based on 18 validation
studies did not reveal substantial differences in the pooled sensi-
tivity and specificity of the different PHQ-9 cut-off points (8 to
11) when using different standardized interviews based on DSM
or ICD-10 for diagnosis of depression as a criterion (Manea
et al., 2012). In that sense, the authors of PHQ-9 recommend
using a different cut-off point based on the population to be
assessed (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, & Löwe, 2010). This recom-
mendation is consistent with current consensus about validity,
where validation is described as a continuous process of gathering
evidence to support the interpretation of scores for the specific
purposes of the test (American Educational Research Association,
American
Psychological
Association,
National
Council
on
Measurement in Education, 2014).
Shorter versions of the PHQ-9 have also been used in PHC:
PHQ-2 (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2003) and PHQ-8
(Kroenke et al., 2009). PHQ-2 contains the first two items of
PHQ-9 (depressed mood and anhedonia) and is a very brief pre-
screening tool. The PHQ-8 consists of the first eight items of the
PHQ-9 (omitting the item about suicidal ideation) in an attempt
to avoid the problems reported about the inaccuracy of this item
in assessing suicide risk, especially in non-psychiatric populations
(Razykov, Ziegelstein, Whooley, & Thombs, 2012; Walker et al.,
2011). Both, PHQ-2 (cut-off >3: sensitivity 83%, specificity
92%) and PHQ-8 (cut-off ⩾10: sensitivity of 100%, specificity
95%) showed adequate validity evidence regarding the relation-
ship with a criterion in the American population (Kroenke
et al., 2003, 2009).
Despite the range of studies available on the utility of PHQ,
few studies have explored the psychometric properties of the
Spanish versions of PHQ-2, PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 in PHC in
Spain. The Spanish version of PHQ-9 showed good sensitivity
(84%) and specificity (92%) in hospitalized patients in Spain, as
compared to the diagnosis established by a mental health profes-
sional (Diez-Quevedo et al., 2001). Two additional studies con-
firmed the utility of PHQ-9 in assessing depression in PHC
when administered telephonically (Pinto-Meza, Serrano-Blanco,
Peñarrubia, Blanco, & Haro, 2005), and when the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID-I) is used as a criter-
ion (Muñoz-Navarro et al., 2017). The studies conducted in other
Spanish-speaking populations in Latin America raise concern
about linguistic and cultural differences (Aslan et al., 2020;
Baader et al., 2012; Urtasun et al., 2019; Wulsin, Somoza, &
Heck, 2002). Regarding PHQ-2, a study of Spanish pregnant
women who attended in PHC concluded that PHQ-2 (cut-off
point ⩾2) had a good sensitivity (84.5%) and specificity
(79.5%), taking PHQ-9 as a criterion (Rodríguez-Muñoz et al.,
2017). No studies were found assessing the psychometric proper-
ties of PHQ-8 in the Spanish population. Therefore, further valid-
ity evidence is needed to support the use of PHQ-2, PHQ-8 and
PHQ-9 to assess major depression and establish the optimal cut-
off points for PHC patients in Spain. This would allow PHC pro-
fessionals identify patients at risk of depression using a rapid,
easy-to-use method. The purpose of screening is to ensure the
adequate management of depression, which is performed based
on a stepped care and collaboration model between primary
care and mental health services (Ministry of Health, Social
Services & Equality, 2014).
This study aimed to gather validity evidence supporting the
use of PHQ-2, PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 as a tool for assessing major
depression in the Spanish PHC population. To such purpose, a
validation study was conducted where different sources of validity
were combined and integrated to evaluate whether or not the total
scores obtained in the three PHQ versions could be interpreted to
detect major depression in PHC.
Methods
Design and study setting
A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 22 PHC
centers in six regions of Spain. PHC centers were recruited in
the context of the EIRA-3 study (Zabaleta-del-Olmo et al.,
2021), a randomized controlled hybrid type II preventive trial
conducted in 25 PHC centers from seven regions of Spain. The
centers included in the EIRA-3 study were located in Andalusia
(n = 2); the Basque country (n = 3); Aragon (n = 4); the Balearic
Islands (n = 4); Castile and Leon (n = 4); Catalonia (n = 4) and;

Irene Gómez‐Gómez et al.

Galicia (n = 4). However, three PHC centers from the Basque
country were excluded from the study since they did not screen
for baseline depression using a CIDI interview.
Participants
Participants were recruited from PHC centers between February
2017 and January 2018. Eligible participants included subjects
aged 45–75 years with at least two lifestyle risk factors (low phys-
ical activity, smoking consumption and/or unhealthy diet).
Participants were excluded if they had severe mental illness or
cognitive impairment, advanced serious physical illness, were
not autonomous for daily activities, were involved in a home
health care program, were receiving cancer treatment or palliative
care, and did not live in the area during the study.
A total of 4387 participants were assessed for eligibility. Of
them, 69.9% (n = 3062) provided informed consent and met the
inclusion criteria. In total, 2.5% of participants (n = 78) were
excluded due to incomplete PHQ-9 responses and 13.2% (n =
405) due to incomplete CIDI responses. The final sample was
composed of 2579 participants. The total sample was randomly
divided into three subsamples to conduct separate analysis for
PHQ-2, PHQ-8 and PHQ-9. Subsamples were composed of
859, 860 and 860 participants for PHQ-2, PHQ-8 and PHQ-9,
respectively. For PHQ-8 and PHQ-9, the two latter subsamples
were additionally and randomly divided into two groups for
crossed validation; it is detailed below in the description of the
analysis conducted for assessing dimensionality. Table 1 shows
the sociodemographic characteristic of each subsample, which
were not significantly across groups.
Procedure
Participants were recruited by PHC professionals during routine
visits or by telephone, and by informative posters and local adver-
tisements displayed in the waiting room of PHC centers. The par-
ticipants who met the inclusion criteria and were interested in
participating in the study read the information sheet and signed
informed consent. Then, participants were invited telephonically
to attend an assessment session. All data were collected all in
once at baseline by local trained personnel, coordinated at central
level, through a face-to-face interview (60 min approximately)
which was recorded in an electronic data collection booklet spe-
cifically created for the EIRA-3 study.
The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of the IDIAP Jordi Gol (approval number P16/025)
and the local ethics committees of each participating Autonomous
Communities. The protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT03136211.
Instruments
Sociodemographic data
The sociodemographic questionnaire collected information about
sex, age, education level, marital status, and employment status.
PHQ-9
The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-administered questionnaire (Kroenke
et al., 2001; Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002) created according to the
diagnostic criteria for major depression disorder proposed in
the 4th version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). PHQ-9 explores the presence of
the symptoms described in Table 2 over the past two weeks.
Each PHQ-9 item contains four Likert-response categories, ran-
ging from 0 ‘Not at all’ to 3 ‘Nearly every day’. The total score
ranges between 0 to 27 points, with the original cut-off point
set at ⩾10 to determine the presence of major depression
(Kroenke et al., 2001). Higher scores indicate more depressive
symptoms. McDonald’s omega coefficient for the PHQ-9 was
0.89 in PHC Spanish patients (Muñoz-Navarro et al., 2017).
PHQ-9 has also been proposed as a diagnostic tool based on a
diagnostic algorithm (Kroenke et al., 2001).
PHQ-2
The PHQ-2 consists of the first two items of PHQ-9 exploring the
presence of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past two
weeks, scoring from 0 ‘not at all’ to 3 ‘nearly every day’
(Kroenke et al., 2003). Total score ranges from 0 to 6. The

Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the Spanish version was 0.71 in
Colombian PHC patients (Scoppetta, Cassiani-Miranda, Arocha-
Díaz, Cabanzo-Arenas, & Campo-Arias, 2021). The cut-off point
⩾3 has been proposed as the value confirming the presence of
major depression (Manea et al., 2016).
PHQ-8
The PHQ-8 contains the first eight items of the PHQ-9 (Kroenke
& Spitzer, 2002), exploring the presence of depressive symptoms
over the past two weeks with each item scoring from 0 ‘not at all’
to 3 ‘nearly every day’. Total score ranges from 0 to 24 with a pro-
posed cut-off point ⩾10 to detect major depression (Wu et al.,
2020). Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.81 for outpatients
recruited at three major public hospitals in Bolivia (Schantz
et al., 2017) and 0.92 for the general population of Puerto Rican
adults (Pagán-Torres, González-Rivera, & Rosario-Hernández,
2020).
The CIDI – Module E
The CIDI-module E is a standardized diagnostic interview created
by the WHO to assesses major depression (WHO, 1997). The
CIDI includes the first two screening questions assessing
anhedonia and depressive mood during the last 12 months for
a period of two consecutive weeks. When at least one of these
two screening questions is affirmatively answered, 31 additional
items are asked including both yes/no and free-text answers.
According to a recent systematic review, the CIDI is the second
most common diagnostic interview used in primary care to screen
for depression using the PHQ-9 (Costantini et al., 2021). The
CIDI showed excellent inter-rater reliability (> 0.90) in most of
the diagnoses. Test-retest reliability reached good-to-excellent
Kappa indexes for most of the CIDI modules, including the
depression module (Wittchen, 1994). The CIDI-depression mod-
ule showed an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.75, a sensitivity
of 53.3%, and a specificity of 93.7% using SCID as a criterion
(Haro et al., 2006).
The 25-item version of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25)
The HSCL-25 is a self-administered 25-item questionnaire
(Nabbe et al., 2019) that assesses anxiety (items 1–10) and depres-
sion (items 11–25). Each item offers four Likert response options,
ranging from 1 ‘Not at all’ to 4 ‘Extremely’. The total score is cal-
culated by dividing the sum of the scores of all items by 25 (all
items), 10 (anxiety dimension) or 15 (depression dimension);

total scores range from 1 to 4 points. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient
was 0.92 in Spanish PHC patients (Rodríguez-Barragán et al.,
2021).
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)
The GAD-7 is a 7-item scale measuring symptoms of generalized
anxiety (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Löwe, 2006). Each GAD-7
item contains four Likert-response options, ranging from 0 ‘Not
at all’ to 3 ‘Nearly every day’. Total score ranges from 0 to 21
points. Higher scores indicate more symptoms of anxiety.
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.94 in the Spanish general
population (Garcia-Campayo et al., 2010).
Functional social support questionnaire (DUKE-UNC-11)
The DUKE-UNC-11 is a multidimensional questionnaire assess-
ing functional social support (Broadhead, Gehlbach, de Gruy, &
Kaplan, 1988). The DUKE-UNC-11 consists of 11 items with
five Likert-response options ranging from 1 ‘much less than I
want’ to 5 ‘as much as I want’. The total score ranges from 11
to 55 points, where higher scores indicate more functional social
support. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.92 for Spanish PHC
patients (Bellón, Delgado Sánchez, Luna del Castillo, & Lardelli
Claret, 1996).
Health-related Quality of Life (EQ-5D-3L)
The EQ-5D-3L is a multi-attribute instrument for assessing
health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) (Rabin & De Charro,
2001; Szende, Oppe, & Devlin, 2007). EQ-5D-3L evaluates pro-
blems in different dimensions (mobility, self-care, daily activities,
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and self-rated health
status. We used a single summary HR-QoL index calculated
based on a scoring algorithm for the Spanish population
(EuroQol Research Foundation, 2018; Szende et al., 2007).

All statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical pack-
age SPSS (V 26) and JASP software (V 0.14.1.0). To evaluate the
psychometric properties of PHQ-2, PHQ-8 and PHQ-9, the total
sample was randomly divided into three subsamples. The internal
consistency of PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 scores was assessed according
to McDonald’s omega coefficient and the 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI). Validity evidence based on internal structure and on
relations
to
other
variables
was
collected
following
the
Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing guidelines
(AERA et al., 2014). First, the dimensionality of the instrument
was explored by conducting an exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). For such pur-
pose, the PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 subsamples were randomly divided
into two with the same number of participants to perform crossed
validation among samples. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and
Bartlett’s tests were used to assess the appropriateness of applying
EFA to PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 data sets. Principal Axis Factoring
extraction method and Varimax rotation were used to perform
EFA. Parallel analysis was used to decide the number of factors
to be extracted. Regarding CFA, it was performed using the max-
imum likelihood method. The Goodness of Fix Index (GFI), the
Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the Root Mean Square Error
of
Approximation
(RMSEA)
were
used
to
estimate
the
goodness-of-fit of the model. Values of GFI and CFI higher
than 0.90, and of RMSEA lower than 0.05 were considered appro-
priate
(Hu
&
Bentler,
1999;
McDonald
&
Ho,
2002).
Measurement invariance was assessed by multi-group analysis,
where participants were compared according to variables previ-
ously described in the literature as potential sources of bias
when using PHQ. Specifically, the structure of the construct
was compared across groups according to sex, age and educational
level (Bellón et al., 2011; González-Blanch et al., 2018; Patel et al.,
2019). To assess invariance between groups, the change in chi-
square value (Δχ2) and its p value, CFI (ΔCFI) and RMSEA
(ΔRMSEA) values were calculated. Four models were tested
sequentially, from the least to the most restrictive level of invari-
ance (configural, metrics, strong and, strict). Invariance between
groups was settled when the p value of Δχ2 was non-significant,
and when the change of the RMSEA and CFI values was lower
than 0.015 and 0.01 respectively (Chen, 2007). Associations
with other variables were explored by: (i) obtaining evidence
about convergence between variables by calculating correlations
between the three versions of the PHQ and the theoretically
related
variables
(HCLS-25,
GAD-7,
DUKE-UNC-11
and
EQ-5D-3); and (ii) analyzing the level of agreement between the
scores obtained in the three versions of the PHQ and in the cri-
terion (the CIDI) through Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) curve analysis. We expected a positive correlation between
the different PHQ versions and the instrument measuring similar
constructs (HCLS-25 and GAD-7), as well as a negative correl-
ation between PHQ versions and the other instruments measur-
ing
related
but
distinct
variables
(DUKE-UNC-11
and
EQ-5D-3). AUC was calculated and interpreted as follows: 0.5–
0.6 ‘no discrimination’; 0.6−0.7 ‘low discrimination’; 0.7–0.8
‘acceptable discrimination’; 0.8–0.9 ‘good discrimination’; > 0.9
‘excellent discrimination’ (Muñiz, 2018). Moreover, sensitivity
rates, specificity rates, positive and negative likelihood ratios,
and positive and negative predictive values were extracted.
Youden’s index was calculated to determine the optimal cut-off
value for a good sensitivity/specificity balance (Youden, 1950).
Convergence between the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm and the
optimal PHQ-9 cut-off according to Youden’s index was calcu-
lated using Cohen’s kappa coefficient index (Cohen, 1960).
Results
Descriptive statistics and internal consistency
Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for PHQ-2, PHQ-8 and
PHQ-9. McDonald’s omega coefficient (ω) was 0.83 (95% CI
0.81–0.84) for the PHQ-8 and 0.84 (95% CI 0.82–0.85) for the
PHQ-9. The items in the two versions showed discrimination
indexes above the established minimum, which was 0.30.
Validity evidence based on internal structure for PHQ-8 and
PHQ-9
KMO (greater than 0.7) and Bartlett’s test ( p < 0.001) indicated
the
adequacy
of
applying
EFA
to
PHQ-8
and
PHQ-9.
Regarding AFE, a one-factor solution was extracted based on par-
allel analysis calculated over the first half of each subsample (see
Table 3). Using the second half of each subsample, the one-factor
model showed a reasonable fit of the model to the data for both
PHQ-8 (GFI = 0.936; CFI = 0.899; RMSEA = 0.10) and PHQ-9
(GFI = 0.947; CFI = 0.932; RMSEA = 0.08). Regarding to multi-
group analysis by sex, age and educational level, results confirmed
invariance between groups in all cases, at least at configural level
(see online Supplementary Tables A1 and A2 in supplementary
Psychological Medicine

material). It is worth noting that χ2 becomes usually significant
due to its sensitivity to sample size.
Convergence between PHQ-2, PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 and related
variables
The postulated relationship between the three PHQ versions and
theoretically related variables was confirmed. Correlation between
the three versions and both HSCL-25 and GAD-7 were positive
(⩾0.50) and significant (see Table 4). Correlations with DUKE-
UNC-11 and HR-QoL index were negative (ranging from −0.30
to −0.50) and significant. PHQ-2 was the version with the highest
correlation with theoretically related variables.
Validity evidence on the relationships with the gold-standard
CIDI
According to the CIDI, the prevalence of major depression in
the last 12 months was 4.8% (n = 123) for the total sample,
5.1% (n = 44) for the PHQ-2 subsample, 5.1% (n = 44) for the
PHQ-8 subsample and 4.1% (n = 35) for the PHQ-9 subsample.
ROC curve analysis showed that PHQ-2, PHQ-8 and PHQ-9
had an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.816–0.889; S.E. = 0.019; p < 0.001);
0.90 (95% CI 0.846–0.953; S.E. = 0.027; p < 0.001) and 0.91 (95%
CI 0.874–0.949; S.E. = 0.019; p < 0.001) respectively, which indicates
good discrimination (see online Supplementary material).
Table 5 shows sensitivity, specificity, Youden’s index, positive
and negative likelihood ratios, and positive and predictive value of
different cut-off scores for PHQ-2, PHQ-9 and PHQ-8, as com-
pared against the CIDI. According to Youden’s index, the optimal
cut-off values were ⩾2 (J = 0.57) for PHQ-2, with a sensitivity of
88% and a specificity of 70%; ⩾7 (J = 0.68) for PHQ-8, with a
sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 81%; and ⩾8 (J = 0.68)
for PHQ-9, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 82%.
Inconsistencies between PHQ-9 cut-off points and the CIDI
There were five participants with major depression according to
the CIDI and PHQ-9 scores lower than 6. Exploration of these
inconsistencies indicated that differences in final diagnosis derived
from two situations: participants who answered ‘not at all’ to a
specific item in PHQ-9 but ‘yes’ to the equivalent item in CIDI,
i.e. participants who were not consistent in their responses; and
participants who answered ‘several days’ to a specific item of
PHQ-9 and ‘yes’ in the equivalent items of the CIDI. To confirm
the conclusions formulated, analyses were replicated by excluding
participants with inconsistent diagnoses. Results did not change
for the PHQ-9 except for ROC analysis, where the AUC increased
to 0.95 (95% CI 0.931–0.970; S.E. = 0.010; p < 0.0001). According
to Youden’s index, the optimal cut-off value was the same
(PHQ-9 ⩾8) but sensitivity increased (J = 0.82; sensitivity 100%;
specificity 82%).
The PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm
The scores obtained from the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm indi-
cated a fair convergence with the CIDI (Cohen κ = 0.36; 95% CI
0.193–0.527) and with the proposed cut-off value for PHQ-9
(⩾8) (Cohen κ = 0.40; 95% CI 0.300–0.495). When the CIDI
was used as a criterion, the algorithm showed an AUC of
0.72 indicating acceptable discrimination (95% CI 0.615–0.828;
S.E. = 0.054, p < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 49% and a specificity
of 96%. When the algorithm was compared with the cut-off
value ⩾8, the AUC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.596–0.698; S.E. = 0.026,
p < 0.001) indicating low discrimination, low sensitivity (29%),
and adequate specificity (71%).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to gather val-
idity evidence supporting the use of PHQ-2, PHQ-8, and PHQ-9
as a tool to detect major depression in the Spanish PHC popula-
tion. The present study suggests the optimal cut-off value for a
good sensitivity/specificity balance were ⩾2 for PHQ-2, ⩾7 for
PHQ-8 and ⩾8 for PHQ-9.
Considering the information provided by the CIDI, the preva-
lence of major depression in our sample was 4.8%, which is con-
sistent with a recent study in PHC attendees in Spain (Vieta et al.,
2021) but lower than rates found in other studies focused on PHC
(Craven & Bland, 2013; Serrano-Blanco et al., 2010). However, as
the aim of the present study was to collect validity evidence to

support the use of PHQ, we cannot formulate conclusions about
the prevalence, which will be addressed in future research studies.
In terms of psychometric properties, the PHQ-8 and the
PHQ-9 showed high reliability as measured by the internal con-
sistency of their scores, which is consistent with the results of pre-
vious studies assessing the validity of PHQ-9 in PHC in Spain
(Muñoz-Navarro et al., 2017) and other Spanish-speaking coun-
tries from Latin America (Aslan et al., 2020; Schantz et al.,
2017; Scoppetta et al., 2021).
Regarding validity evidence based on internal structure, a
single-factor solution structure was supported, which is in agree-
ment with previous studies in PHC patients in Spain (González-
Blanch et al., 2018) and other Spanish-speaking populations
(Alpizar, Laganá, Plunkett, & French, 2018; Aslan et al., 2020;
Pagán-Torres et al., 2020). The one-factor solution was suggested
in the exploratory phase of the analysis and confirmed in the con-
firmatory phase, where it showed reasonable goodness-of-fit
indexes of the model in relation to data for both the PHQ-8
and PHQ-9. These results are similar to those reported in previ-
ous studies (González-Blanch et al., 2018; Patel et al., 2019). In
addition, invariance across groups divided by sex, age and educa-
tional
was confirmed,
as it occurred in previous
studies
(González-Blanch et al., 2018; Patel et al., 2019). Validity evidence
based on relationships with other variables confirmed the
expected results, i.e. positive and significant relationships with
anxiety and depression, and negative and significant associations
with social support and H-RQoL. Additionally, ROC curve ana-
lysis allowed to establish, with good discrimination values, the
optimal cut-off point using the CIDI as the criterion. According
to the results, the optimal cut-off value for PHQ-2 is ⩾2, detect-
ing 88% of PHC patients with major depressive disorders.
Although the original validation study recommended a cut-off
point ⩾3 (sensitivity 86%, specificity 90%), the authors used in
that case an independent structured mental health professional

interview as a criterion (Kroenke et al., 2003). In contrast, previ-
ous studies establish ⩾2 as the optimal cut-off values as well
(Arroll et al., 2010; Rodríguez-Muñoz et al., 2017). In the present
study, the originally proposed cut-off point (⩾3) had lower
sensitivity (68%) and specificity (85%), as compared to the
cut-off point of the original validation study. Thus, the cut-off
point ⩾2 might be more effective in detecting major depression
in the PHC setting, considering the CIDI as the criterion.
With regard to PHQ-8, the optimal cut-off point in the present
study was ⩾7 (sensitivity 86%, specificity 81%). This cut-off point
detects 86% of cases of major depressive disorders. A recent
meta-analysis based on fully-structured interviews as the criterion
proposed the cut-off points of ⩾7 and ⩾8 as the values with the
optimal sensitivity/specificity balance (Wu et al., 2020). Using the
CIDI as the criterion, Arroll et al. (2010) also pointed to the need
of considering a cut-off value lower than 10.
Regarding the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm, our results are in
line with previous studies revealing high specificity but low sensi-
tivity (Manea, Gilbody, & McMillan, 2015). In that case, results
also converge with previous findings of the present study and sug-
gest lower cut-off values than in studies conducted by other
authors. This could be explained by the criterion used: the
CIDI. According to previous studies, the CIDI yields a deeper
diagnosis of major depression compared to the MINI interview,
which diagnoses twice as many cases of major depression than
the CIDI (Levis et al., 2018). Taking into account that PHQ is
used to detect major depression in clinical practice, the cut-off
values employed must maximize sensitivity with an adequate
specifity.
The study has several strengths. First, the large size and hetero-
geneity of the sample, as participants were recruited from diverse
PHC centers over the country, which guarantees the representa-
tiveness of the sample. Second, a rigorous methodology was
used based on the Standards for Educational and Psychological
Testing (AERA et al., 2014). Third, it should be emphasized
that participants were evaluated by an external unit and that all
instruments were administered the same day. Regarding limita-
tions, on the one hand, participants were recruited in the context
of the EIRA-3 study, which is focused on contacting participants
with unhealthy behaviors. Thus, our study sample differs from
that used in the validation study of the original version of the
PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001) in two main aspects. The first
one is co-occurrence of unhealthy behaviors, and the second
the age of participants, which were older in our study (45–75).
Although this could have increased the probability that patients
suffered from depression, the prevalence of depression was similar
or even lower than expected (Institute of Health Metrics &
Evaluation, 2019). In addition, the health behaviors evaluated
are the most common in PHC, so participants were representative
of the Spanish PHC population (Government of Spain, 2021;
Gómez-Gómez et al., 2020). However, the scope of our study
goes beyond estimating the prevalence of depression. Thus, this
study also aimed at assessing the utility of the PHQ and providing
evidence supporting its utility by showing its convergence with
CIDI results. Hence, diagnoses established based on the CIDI
were generally confirmed by the PHQ, independently of the char-
acteristics and/or age of patients (which potential influence, if
exists, would be true and not a bias as shown by invariance
results). On the other hand, the instruments were administered
by adjusting the model to the specific needs of each PHC center,
using both, self-administered questionnaires and face-to-face
interviews.
Implications for practice
Having in mind the results of the study, and considering both, the
adequate psychometric properties of the three versions and the
context of the Spanish health system, where the opportunities of
assessment are limited, our recommendations are: (1) using
PHQ-2 with a cut-off point ⩾2 as a pre-screening instrument;
(2) when PHQ-2 indicates major depression, applying PHQ-8
(with a cut-off point ⩾7) or PHQ-9 (with a cut-off point ⩾8).
The decision of using PHQ-8 or PHQ-9 should be made consider-
ing that the only difference between them is item 9, which was cre-
ated to assess suicidal ideation and self-harm. In the psychiatric
setting, item 9 is used as an indicator of suicide risk (Wu et al.,
2020), as it is considered a strong predictor of suicide attempt in
psychiatry practice (Simon et al., 2016). However, several studies
have found that it overestimates suicide risk in different populations
and settings (Na et al., 2018; Razykov et al., 2012, 2013; Suarez
et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2011). For instance, a study conducted
in 841 patients with depression revealed that item 9 detected almost
three times more patients at risk of suicide (41.1%) than a specific
scale created to assess suicide risk (13.4%) (Na et al., 2018). Similar
results were found in non-psychiatric patients such as veterans
attended in PHC (Corson, Gerrity, & Dobscha, 2004) and in
patients with medical conditions such as heart disease (Razykov
et al., 2012; Suarez et al., 2015); cancer (Walker et al., 2011); and
systemic sclerosis (Razykov, Hudson, Baron, & Thombs, 2013).
In all these studies, only a small proportion of participants respond-
ing affirmatively to item 9 had suicidal ideation or planned to com-
mit suicide. Considering that item 9 has a high rate of false
positives, especially in non-psychiatric populations, it can be con-
cluded that PHQ-8 is more effective in assessing major depression
in non-psychiatric settings, in large population surveys or large epi-
demiological studies in which the study staff or the researchers can-
not cope with affirmative responses, and in clinical and research
settings where follow-up of positive responses may be delayed
(Kroenke et al., 2010). However, PHQ-9 would be an adequate
choice on suspicion of suicidal ideation in a personal evaluation
where the professional could intervene somehow. Finally, we do
not recommend the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm to be used to
assess major depression in the Spanish PHC setting as it only
detects 29 to 49% of cases of major depression.
Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded
that PHQ is a good and valuable tool for screening and assessing
major depression in PHC patients in Spain. Having adequate
tools for detecting major depression could contribute to the
early detection, implementation of prevention policies and pro-
grams, and administration of adequate and early treatments.
Future studies could use a mixed methods approach to collect
qualitative evidence related to the response processes developed
by participants to respond the questionnaire.
