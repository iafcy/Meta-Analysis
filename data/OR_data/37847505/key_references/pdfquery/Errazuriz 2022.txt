The Validity and Reliability of the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 on 
Screening for Major Depression in Spanish Speaking 
Immigrants in Chile: A Cross-Sectional Study 









Abstract: Background: The study aimed to explore the psychometric properties of two versions of 
the Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9 and PHQ-2) on screening for Major Depressive Disorder 
(MDD) among Spanish-speaking Latin American adult immigrants in Santiago, and to explore factors 
associated with a higher risk of occurrence of MDD among them. Methods: A representative sample 
of 897 Spanish-speaking immigrants completed the PHQ-9. The Composite International Diagnostic 
Interview (CIDI) was employed to evaluate MDD. Internal consistency and structural validity were 
evaluated using Cronbach’s α coefﬁcient and conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA). Convergent validity 
with the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was assessed using Spearman’s correlations. 
Sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive predictive values, and area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve were calculated for different cut-off points. Logistic regression analysis was used to 
identify factors associated with the risk of MDD. Results: Cronbach’s α coefﬁcient of the PHQ-9 was 
0.90; item-total correlation coefﬁcients ranged from 0.61 to 0.76 and correlation with the GAD-7 was 
moderate (r = 0.625; p < 0.001). CFA on three alternative models suggests a plausible ﬁt in the 
overall sample and among two of the subsamples: Peruvians and Venezuelans. Taking the results 
of CIDI as the gold standard for MDD, the area under the ROC curve was 0.91 (95% conﬁdence 
interval (CI): 0.83~1.0). When the cut-off score was equal to 5, values of sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and 
Youden’s index were 0.85, 0.90, and 0.75, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses 
showed that the inﬂuence of having three or more children (OR = 3.91, 95% CI: 1.20~12.81; p < 0.05), 
residency in Chile of up to three years (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.07~3.00; p < 0.05), active debt (OR = 2.74, 
95% CI: 1.60~4.70; p < 0.001), a one (OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.03~3.94; p < 0.05) and two or more events of 
adversity during childhood (OR = 5.25, 95% CI: 1.93~14.3; p < 0.01) on the occurrence of MDD was 
statistically signiﬁcant. Reliability (α = 0.62), convergent (r = 0.534; p < 0.01) and criterion (AUC = 0.85, 
95% CI: 0.67~1.00) validity coefﬁcients of the PHQ-2 were weaker than for the PHQ-9. Conclusions: 
The PHQ-2 and the PHQ-9 are reliable and valid instruments for use as screeners for MDD among 
Spanish-speaking populations of Latin America.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent mental health condi- 
tions in the general population [1], globally affecting an estimated 4.7% of individuals in 
the community [2]. It is also the most common psychiatric condition in people who die 




























International Journal of 
Environmental Research 
and Public Health 



from suicide [3] and one of the leading causes of burden [4]. MDD, however, is frequently 
untreated, particularly in low- and middle-income countries [5]. 
The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is one of the most widely used 
screening questionnaires for MDD [6] and has been translated into more than 80 languages [7]. 
Its accuracy has been shown to be greater than unaided clinician diagnoses with much 
higher sensitivity (0.80) and speciﬁcity (0.92) [8] than the sensitivity (0.50) and speciﬁcity 
(0.81) of primary care providers’ diagnoses [9]. 
The Spanish version of the PHQ-9 [10] has been validated in some Latin American 
populations. Its psychometric properties and convergent validity with a structured clin- 
ical interview as a reference gold standard have been documented in clinical settings in 
Argentina [11,12], Colombia [13], Peru [14], and Chile [15,16] and its factor structure has 
been studied among several non-clinical subpopulations: college students in Colombia [17], 
Ecuador [18] and Peru [19], and teachers [20] and rural communities in Mexico [21]. The 
performance of the ﬁrst two items of the PHQ (i.e., PHQ-2) versus all nine items has also 
been assessed in primary care in Colombia [22] and among non-clinical populations in 
Chile [23] and Mexico [21]. 
Chile has been increasingly receiving economic immigrants in the last decade. In 
2017, the estimated number of immigrants was 700,000, representing 4.4% of the total 
population [24]. A large majority of immigrants (76%) originate from Spanish-speaking 
Latin American countries, with Peruvians, Colombians, and Venezuelans forming the ﬁrst, 
second, and third largest groups (50.4% of all immigrants [24]). While a lower prevalence 
of MDD among immigrants compared to the native-born population has been documented 
in high-income countries [25–28], evidence suggests that, in some cases, the migration 
experience may have a negative impact on mental health [29,30]. 
Because of the growth in the number of Latin American immigrants arriving in Chile, 
and the layers of vulnerability they experience [31], it is important to understand if the 
available screening measures for MDD are valid to use among them. 
To our knowledge, the Spanish version of the PHQ-9 has not been validated in non- 
clinical populations of Latin America with a reference gold standard and no studies have 
validated its screening characteristics among Spanish-speaking immigrants in Chile. To 
cover this gap, we designed the present study which analyses the psychometric properties 
of the PHQ-9 among a representative sample of native Spanish-speaking adult immigrants 
in Santiago, Chile. The primary aim focuses on the reliability of items (internal consis- 
tency), the dimensionality (structural validity), and convergence with a reference gold 
standard in identifying respondents with MDD (criterion validity). Secondary aims include 
(i) identifying factors associated with a higher risk of the occurrence of MDD in the Spanish- 
speaking immigrant population in Chile, and (ii) exploring the psychometric properties of 
the PHQ-2 among this population. The results of this study will provide evidence about 
the quality of this screening tool for MDD for this speciﬁc immigrant population as well as 
information about the prevalence of depressive symptoms and associated factors to MDD 
among them. 
2. Material and Methods 
2.1. Design 
The Santiago Immigrant Wellbeing Study (STRING) is a population-based cross- 
sectional household mental health survey of 1115 ﬁrst-generation adult immigrants residing 
in the Santiago Metropolitan Region (Región Metropolitana; RM) of Chile. The study was 
prospectively registered (ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT04114565; ISRCTN96875479) and 
approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Pontiﬁcia Universidad 
Catolica de Chile (No. 170519004). Data was collected between August and October 2019. 

The sampling framework of the Chilean National Institute of Statistics was used. 
Multi-stage random probability sampling, comparable to that of other household survey 


designs conducted in developing countries was employed [32]. Based on (i) the number of 
immigrants recorded in the RM in the 2017 Chilean Population Census [33], distributed in 
120 conglomerates (i.e., clusters of 200 households with a mean number of 9.2 immigrants), 
and (ii) the density of the immigrant population in the RM, the minimum sample size 
to generate statistical inferences was set at 1104. The ﬁnal sample was composed of 
1115 participants, of which 1091 were interviewed in Spanish and 24 in Creole. To be 
eligible, participants had to: (i) be a community-residing adult (18+ years), (ii) be able to 
read and write, (iii) have been born outside of Chile (self-reported and providing a National 
ID number), and (iv) have been residing in Chile for at least six months. 
This study aimed to explore the psychometric properties of the nine- and two-item 
Patient Health Questionnaires (i.e., PHQ-9 and PHQ-2) on screening for depression among 
the subsample of participants of the STRING study interviewed in Spanish and born in 
Spanish-speaking Latin American countries (n = 897). 


The PHQ-9 is a nine-item self-reporting questionnaire that assesses the presence and 
severity of depressive symptoms (i. anhedonia, ii. depressed mood, iii. sleep problems, 
iv. 
low self-esteem, vii. concentration difﬁculty, 
viii. psychomotor agitation or retardation and ix. suicidal ideation) in the last two weeks 
based on the DSM-IV criteria for MDD. Using a Likert scale, each item can be rated from 0 
(not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) with total scores ranging from 0 to 27. Five categories 
of symptom severity have been proposed: 0–4 (minimum), 5–9 (mild), 10–14 (moderate), 
15–19 (moderate to severe), 20–27 (serious) [6] and cut-off scores between 8 and 11 have 
been recommended for a probable case of MDD [34]. In this study, the Spanish version of 
the questionnaire was employed [10] and administered face-to-face. 
The PHQ-2 is an ultra-brief version of the PHQ-9 which includes the ﬁrst two items 
(i. anhedonia, ii. depressed mood). Total scores range from 0 to 6 and the recommended 
cut-off point for administering the full PHQ-9 or conducting a clinical interview to assess 
for MDD is a score of 3 or greater [35]. 
Symptoms of anxiety during the 2 weeks preceding the interview were assessed using 
the Spanish version of the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder (GAD–7) scale [36]. DSM-IV 
MDD in the last 12 months was assessed using two modules of the WHO Composite 
International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI) (CAPI 3.0): depression, and mania [37]. 
The WHO-CIDI is a gold standard for MDD diagnosis which has been used extensively 
in major epidemiological studies in Argentina [38], Chile [39,40], Colombia [5,41–47], 
Guatemala [48], Mexico [5,49–51] and Peru [5,52]. 
Childhood trauma was measured using the Spanish-translated version of the Adverse 
Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) [53] and coded into 0, 1, or 
2 or more adverse events. 
Participants’ gender, age, country of birth, number of children aged under 18 years, 
duration of residency in Chile (up to 3 years; more than 3 years), highest educational level 
(primary: 8 years or less; secondary: 9 to 12 years; or higher: >12 years), employment 
status (unemployed or economically inactive versus employed), active debt status (with or 
without) was recorded. 

To characterize the representative immigrant population of Santiago, sampling weights 
assigned to the subjects were applied. For descriptive statistics, means, standard deviations, 
and frequencies were calculated for demographic and economic factors and for the number 
of childhood adversity events. 
The normality distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. When 
variables were not found to have a normal distribution, Spearman’s Rho was used. For 
reliability, the internal consistency of the PHQ-9 was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha 
(α) coefﬁcients and item-total correlations. For the PHQ-2, Spearman–Brown coefﬁcients 


were calculated as an additional measure of reliability. Alpha coefﬁcients above 0.70–0.80 
were considered indicative of good internal consistency [54]. Correlations above 0.90, 
between 0.70 and 0.90, and between 0.50 and 0.70 were considered very high, high, and 
moderate, respectively [55]. 
To investigate the factor structure of the PHQ-9 items, Conﬁrmatory factor analysis 
(CFA) with the maximum-likelihood procedure was conducted. Using CFA, three alterna- 
tive models of the structure of the PHQ-9 were tested to understand the dimensionality of 
the scale: (i) the original one-factor model hypothesized by Kroenke [6], (ii) a two-factor 
model suggested by Krause [56] where three items (i.e., ‘sleep problems’, ‘low energy’ 
and ‘appetite changes’) are loaded on a somatic factor, and (iii) another two-factor model 
derived by Richardson and Richard [57] where the somatic factor also includes ‘concentra- 
tion difﬁculties’ and ‘psychomotor agitation/retardation’ (Figure S1). In addition to the 
chi-square (χ2) and its degrees of freedom (df), models were compared using the following 
three model ﬁt indices and their criteria: (i) the robust comparative ﬁt index (CFI) with a 
value greater than 0.95 indicating a good model ﬁt and values larger than 0.90 indicating a 
plausible model ﬁt [58], (ii) the robust root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) 
and its 90% conﬁdence interval with a value lower than 0.05 indicating a good ﬁt and 
values lower than 0.08 indicating a plausible ﬁt [59], and (iii) the standardized root mean 
square residual (SRMR) with values less than 0.05 indicating a good ﬁt well and values 
lower than 0.08 indicating a plausible ﬁt [60]. A model was considered to ﬁt well if two of 
the three criteria were met. 
The convergent validity of the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 was assessed using Spearman’s 
correlations with the GAD-7. To assess the accuracy of both forms of the PHQ as screening 
tools compared to the CIDI, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and AUC were 
analyzed. The optimum cut-off point for the PHQ-9 was determined considering validity 
indices: sensitivity (Se), speciﬁcity (Sp), positive and negative predictive value (PPV; NPV), 
Youden’s index, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR), and ROC curve/AUC analysis. 
Two additional indices were used: clinically relevant rule in accuracy as estimated by the 
clinical utility index positive (CUI+) and rule out accuracy as estimated by the clinical 
utility index negative (CUI) [61]. 
To evaluate the association between demographic, economic, and adversity charac- 
teristics and a total PHQ-9 total score over the deﬁned optimum cut-off point, age, and 
gender-adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted. 
The statistical analysis, excluding CFA, was performed using SPSS for Windows, 
version 20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). CFA was conducted using R 3.5.1 software 
(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A p-value < 0.05 was 
considered signiﬁcant. 
3. Results 
3.1. Sample Characteristics 
Table 1 illustrates the sociodemographic, economic, and childhood adversity char- 
acteristics of the ﬁnal sample (n = 897). The mean age of participants was 36.6 years 
(SD = 11.5); 478 (53.6%) had no children under the age of 18, 217 (22.7%) had one, 144 (16.2%) 
had two and 55 (7.5%) had three or more children. There were 509 women (53.8%) and 
388 men (46.2%); 94 respondents had been born in Colombia (13.2%), 333 in Peru (26.6%), 
375 in Venezuela (33.3%), and 95 (26.9%) in other Spanish-speaking Latin American coun- 
tries (Bolivia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Mexico); 444 (50.3%) participants 
had migrated in the last three years and 453 (49.7%) more than three years ago. 
Few participants (7.6%) were unemployed or economically inactive; 72 (7.2%) respon- 
dents had ≤8 years of education, 351 (41.6%) had between 9 and 12, and 471 (51.2%) had 
more than 12 years, and 201 (22.4%) held at least one debt at the moment of the interview. 
No events of childhood adversity were reported by most participants (68.6%), one event 
was reported by 15.7%, and two or more events by 15.7% of participants.

6 (0.7%) participants met the criteria for DSM-IV MDD in the last 12 months (Table 2). Results 
for specific immigrant groups showed the proportion of PHQ-9 total scores ≥ 10 ranged from 
1.7% among Venezuelans to 7.1% among Peruvians, and the proportion of PHQ-2 scores ≥ 3 
ranged from 1.4% among other Latin Americans to 8.1% among Colombians (Table S1).

Values of the reliability coefﬁcient Cronbach’s α for the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 were 
0.904 and 0.746, indicating acceptable reliability. For both PHQ forms, corrected item- 
total correlations ranged from moderate to high (0.604–0.760), and the internal consis- 
tency of the PHQ-9 would not have improved with the deletion of later scale items. The 
Spearman–Brown between-item correlation coefﬁcient for the PHQ-2 was signiﬁcant but 
moderate (r = 0.62; p < 0.001) (Table S2). The reliability of the PHQ-9 was acceptable across 
immigrant groups (all α > 0.7) and corrected item-total correlations ranged from low to 
high (0.451–0.845), (Table S3). The reliability of the PHQ-2 was only acceptable for the 
Peruvian and other Latin American subsamples (all α > 0.7 and r > 0.70; p < 0.001) (Table S4). 

Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) on three alternative models was performed: a 
one-factor model (model 1) and two two-factor models (models 2a and 2b). The goodness 
of ﬁt indices suggest a plausible ﬁt for the three models for the overall sample and the 
Peruvian subsample and for model 2a for the Venezuelan subsample, with CFI values larger 
than 0.90 and SRMS values lower than 0.08. The goodness of ﬁt indices for the Colombian 
and the other Latin American subsamples demonstrate inadequate ﬁt of all three models 
(Table S5). Overall results from the two-factor models showed that the somatic and affective 
factors were highly correlated (all p < 0.001). 

In the overall sample, the PHQ-9 was moderately and positively correlated with the 
GAD-7 (r = 0.625; p < 0.001), which measures anxiety symptoms. Correlation between 
PHQ-2 and GAD-7 scores was weaker, but signiﬁcant (r = 0.534; p < 0.01). Across immi- 
grant groups, correlations between the GAD-7 and the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 were moderate 
(all r ≥ 0.60; p < 0.001) and low-to-moderate (all r ≥ 0.44; p < 0.001), respectively. Convergent 
validity was, therefore, satisfied for both forms of the PHQ with our sample (Table S6). 

The performance of the two versions of the PHQ was examined against the diagnosis of 
MDD according to the WHO-CIDI as a gold standard. The mean PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 scores 
for participants meeting the criteria for MDD were 9.14 (SD = 5.36) and 2.19 (SD = 1.39), 
respectively, whereas the mean scores for participants not meeting the criteria for MDD 
were 1.71 (SD = 3.68) and 0.38 (SD = 0.98), respectively. 
Table 3 summarizes the operating characteristics of the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 at different 
cut-off points for diagnosing MDD against the WHO-CIDI. For the PHQ-9, the cut-off of 
5 yielded the best diagnostic performance in terms of maximizing sensitivity and speciﬁcity 
values based on the Youden J index (sensitivity = 85%; speciﬁcity 90%). Despite the excellent 
rule-out accuracy (CU− = 0.90) and NPV (NPV = 1.00) for this cut-off score, negative and 
positive likelihood ratios were moderate (LR+ = 8.73; LR− = 0.17) and PPV and rule-in 
accuracy were very poor (PPV = 0.06; CUI+ = 0.05). The ROC curve analysis estimated the 
area under the curve (AUC) for the PHQ-9 was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83–1.00) (Figure 1), which 
accounts for outstanding classiﬁcation accuracy. 
For the PHQ-2, optimal diagnostic performance was achieved at a cut-off score of 1, 
which best balances sensitivity and speciﬁcity (sensitivity = 73%; speciﬁcity 89%). Despite 
the high NPV (NPV = 1.00) and excellent rule-out accuracy (CU− = 0.89) for this cut- 
off score, likelihood ratios were moderate (LR+ = 6.58; LR− = 0.30) and PPV and rule- 
in accuracy were very poor (PPV = 0.04; CUI+ = 0.89). The AUC of PHQ-2 was 0.85 
(95% CI: 0.67–1.00) which accounts for excellent accuracy [62].

As presented in Table 4, a total PHQ-9 score over the optimal cut-off score (i.e., ≥5) 
was strongly associated with the experience of adversity during childhood. Compared to 
participants reporting no childhood adversity, those reporting one or two or more events of 
adversity were twice (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.03–3.94) and ﬁve times (OR 5.25, 95% CI 1.93–14.34) 
more likely to score ≥ 5 in the PHQ-9, respectively. A PHQ-9 score ≥ 5 was also associated 


with length of residency, active debt, and the number of children. The odds of reporting 
a score above the cut-off were higher among those who had immigrated in the last three 
years (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.07–3.00) versus those who had been residing in Chile for over 
three years, among those reporting active debt (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.07–3.00) and among 
those with three or more children (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.20–12.81).

The present study is the ﬁrst to analyze the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 and 
PHQ-2 in a representative sample of Spanish-speaking adult immigrants in Chile. Its results 
expand the evidence of the validity, reliability, and accuracy of both versions of the PHQ to 
a speciﬁc non-clinical population and contribute to the literature about the prevalence of 
depressive and anxiety symptoms and associated factors among economic immigrants. 
Consistent with ﬁndings from available primary care studies in Chile [15,16,64,65], 
good internal consistency of the PHQ-9 in the overall sample and across immigrant groups 
was demonstrated. As expected [66], the correlation between the PHQ-9 with the GAD- 
7 was signiﬁcant but moderate indicating convergent validity and supporting the growing 
body of literature about the coexistence and comorbidity of depression and anxiety [67,68]. 


Contrary to Latin American validation studies of the PHQ-9 among clinical [16,66,69] 
and non-clinical populations [17,19–21], which have demonstrated a good ﬁt for both one- 
and two-factor solutions using conﬁrmatory factor analysis, the goodness of ﬁt indices 
for the three models tested in this study only indicate a plausible ﬁt in the overall sample 
and in two of the four subsamples: Peruvians and Venezuelans. Some studies in the US 
have reported a poor ﬁt of the PHQ-9 among Hispanic participants [70] but the pattern of a 
plausible ﬁt across models in the overall sample and an inadequate ﬁt in the Colombian 
and other Latin American subsamples observed in this study indicate the need to expand 
research about the structure of the Spanish version of the PHQ-9 among non-clinical 
populations in Latin America. 
The PHQ-9 demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and adequate sensibility and 
speciﬁcity values, comparable to those reported in studies conducted in clinical populations 
in Chile using the CIDI as a gold standard [15,16]. As expected of a screener for a low 
prevalence condition, it performed better at correctly identifying individuals without MDD 
than at conﬁrming the presence of MDD, with negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive 
values for scores between 5 and 10 in the range of 0.99–1.00 and 0.06–0.04, respectively. The 
low PPV suggests that rather than indicate a probable MDD diagnosis, a high PHQ-9 score 
should be regarded as an indication of the need for a more thorough evaluation. 
The optimal PHQ-9 cut-off score for detecting MDD in the present study was ≥5. This 
score is lower than the original cut-off score (≥10) [6]. It is also lower than reported in a 
recent individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA) based on data from 100 studies 
which concluded that a cut-off score of ≥8 maximized combined sensitivity and speciﬁcity 
for fully structured reference standards [71]. However, the comparison of these values is 
limited considering the questionnaire was originally developed using data from primary 
care [6], and the number of studies from non-clinical samples included in the recent meta- 
analysis is low (15%) [71]. 
Across parameters and subsamples, the PHQ-9 demonstrated better performance 
than the PHQ-2: higher internal consistency, stronger convergent validity with the GAD-7, 
better accuracy with regard to a gold standard, and higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity for 
the proposed cut-off scores. However, taking into account the brevity of the PHQ-2 and in 
consistency with ﬁndings from studies among clinical [22] and non-clinical [21] populations 
in Latin America, results from this study suggest its performance is acceptable. 
Findings from this study suggest that the prevalence of depressive symptoms and 
MDD among and across Spanish-speaking immigrant groups is lower than among the 
native population of Chile and other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries, inde- 
pendent of the assessment method used. Results from general population studies using 
structured clinical interviews in Chile [39,40,72], Colombia [5,42,43], and Peru [73] have 
consistently reported a higher prevalence of MDD than observed in the present study. 
Results from a general population study conducted in Chile using the PHQ-9 [23] also 
report a higher prevalence of MDD than reported in the current study. This lower risk for 
MDD represents a mental health advantage similar to that observed among ﬁrst-generation 
immigrants from Latin America in the United States [74] and may partly be explained by 
their high labor force participation and low level of exposure to adversity during childhood. 
Four factors predicted an increased risk of MDD among immigrants: the number of 
children (≤18 yrs), short length of residency in Chile (≤3 yrs), active debt, and exposure to 
childhood adversity. Contrary to evidence suggesting that an increase in the length of resi- 
dency in the host country is associated with a higher risk of MDD among immigrants [75], 
the risk of MDD in this immigrant population was not predicted by a longer duration of 
residency. This lack of ﬁnding may be related to (i) the small proportion of participants 
who have been exposed to the prolonged effects of migration (only 12% have been residing 
in Chile for over 10 years), or (ii) the characteristics of the acculturation process shaped 
by high levels of cultural contiguity between Chile and other Latin American Spanish- 
speaking countries at the linguistic, religious, and ethnic level. Findings from this study 
support the well-established relationships between unsecured debt and mental health [76] 


and between adversity during childhood [77], having three or more children [78], and 
depression in adulthood. 
Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, the generalizability 
of the ﬁndings regarding the psychometric properties of both versions of the PHQ to non- 
native Spanish-speaking immigrants may be limited. Second, the generalizability regarding 
the prevalence of depressive symptoms and MDD and associated factors to non-economic 
migrants, migrants from high-income countries, from outside the Latin American region, or 
refugees may be limited because of differential exposure to stress throughout the migration 
process. Replication with more heterogeneous samples of immigrants such as individuals 
with a longer duration of residency in Chile, with clinical conditions, or service users is 
thus needed. 

Findings from the present study indicate that both the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 are psycho- 
metrically sound measures of depression for use among Spanish-speaking populations in 
Latin America. These results add to the evidence that they are brief, easy to use, and valid 
depression measures for use in clinical and non-clinical settings.
