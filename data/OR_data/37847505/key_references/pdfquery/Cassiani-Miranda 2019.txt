Depression is a major public health problem worldwide1 and 
has a signiﬁcant impact on quality of life,2 high morbid- 
ity levels,3 reduced life expectancy4 and excess mortality.5 
The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDE) 
is 11.2%.6 Prevalences tend to be higher in low and middle 
income countries such as Pakistan, where depression preva- 
lences of 45.9% have been reported.7 In primary care (PC), the 
prevalence of MDE varies signiﬁcantly in a range from 4.5% to 
47.8%.8 
In the 2015 Colombian National Mental Health Survey, the 
prevalence of major depression in the general population was 
5.4 (95% CI: 4.6–6.4), 2.3 (95% CI: 1.8–2.9) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5–1.3) 
for lifetime, the last year and the last month, respectively.9 In 
Bucaramanga, the prevalence of clinically signiﬁcant depres- 
sive symptoms (CSDS) was 22.3% (95% CI: 20.0–24.6) and 11.2% 
for major depressive disorder (MDD) (95% CI: 9.7–12.9%).10 
A 
 later population study in adults living in Bucaramanga 
(N = 266), using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV 
Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), reported a prevalence of 16.5% (95% 
CI: 12.3–21.6),11 which conﬁrms the high prevalence of depres- 
sion in this region. 
In spite of its high burden, chronicity and recurrent nature, 
depression is underdiagnosed in PC, as approximately 50% of 
patients who present depression will not be detected.12 This 
diagnostic gulf could be explained by the fact that more than 
75% of patients with depression initially consult a family or PC 
physician with little training in the identiﬁcation of depressive 
disorders,13 time constraints in busy PC environments14 and 
the lack of validated screening tools in low and middle income 
countries.15 
Because of the above, programmes have been developed 
to recognise depression,16,17 which recommend standardised 
tools. A number of tools exist to identify cases of depression; 
however, their beneﬁts have not been fully determined and the 
literature reveals contradictory results.18 A recent systematic 
review suggests that of the screening tools, only the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) attains the optimum accu- 
racy level for depression.19 The PHQ-9 is an adjectival scale 
derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders 
(PRIME-MD) to assess depressive symptoms using the DSM-IV 
criteria.20 The PHQ-9 is shorter than most of the depression 
screening scales21,22 and is considered the best screening tool 
for depression in PC due to its accuracy, brevity, being in the 
public domain and multipurpose, and ease of administration, 
scoring and interpretation.19,23 The PHQ-9 has been translated 
into more than 20 languages and used in many countries and

the health centres until a maximum number of subjects above 
214 had been surveyed. 

The study was approved the ethics committee of ISABU and 
the Universidad de Santander [University of Santander], tak- 
ing into account the current international31 and national 
norms32 for research with human subjects. 
The PHQ-9 was translated following the recommendations 
for adaptation of self-reporting tests.33 A direct translation 
from the original scale was performed by two independent 
certiﬁed bilingual translators; discrepancies between the two 
translations were discussed, then a backtranslation was done 
into English, which was reviewed by the research team to 
assess its closeness to the original scale. The translated scale 
was then reviewed by 10 psychiatrists with research exper- 
tise or clinical experience to verify whether the items were 
consistent with the construct of depression, who also com- 
mented on the comprehension and wording of the items. Ten 
people from the general population with a history of depres- 
sion also gave their opinions on the comprehension of the 
questions. The research group analysed and incorporated the 
patients’ and experts’ observations to obtain the new Colom- 
bian version (Fig. 1). With the new version of the scale, a pilot 
test was conducted with 21 subjects with characteristics sim- 
ilar to the study subjects but in other centres. They answered 
the questions without difﬁculties and no adjustments to the 
grammatical structure were needed. 
The research team was trained in the structured psychi- 
atric interview (MINI) and hetero-administration of the PHQ-9. 
The people responsible for administering the scales and struc- 
ture interviews were professionals with clinical experience 
(four psychologists, two general practice residents and one 
psychiatrist) who received eight hours of training by the lead 
author, with theoretical and practical sessions, role play- 
ing, and observation of pilot interviews with feedback. The 
study participants were contacted in the waiting room as they 
arrived for outpatient appointments with a general practi- 
tioner for any reason. One member of the research group 
explained the nature of the study and gave them the informed 
consent form. The screening scales were read by trained 
members of the research team. After completing the PHQ-9, 
each participant was assessed on the same day in another 
consulting room by a different trained member of the team 
(psychologist or psychiatrist) who did not know their PHQ-9 
result, to administer the MINI depression module. The ques- 
tionnaires were reviewed by two independent reviewers and 
saved in a form generated in Excel. 

PHQ-9 
The PHQ-9 is a screening scale that measures the presence and 
severity of depressive symptoms.34 The PHQ-935 is made up 
of the nine symptoms from DSM-IV MDE criterion A.20 These 
nine items are arranged in the form of an adjectival scale that 
assesses the presence of the symptom in the last two weeks 
(“not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days” and 
contexts.24 In PC, the sensitivity of the PHQ-9 was between 0.71 
and 0.84 (mean 0.77) and its speciﬁcity was between 0.90 and 
0.97 (mean 0.94),25 conﬁrming its adequate psychometric per- 
formance in PC, albeit with some variations in the cut-off point 
(COP) and psychometric parameters that can be explained by 
the inﬂuence of cultural aspects in the response pattern.23 Its 
broad use is also supported by the ﬁndings of Williams et al., 
who concluded, in an analysis of more than 38 studies with 
more than 32,000 PC patients, that the PHQ-9 was equal or 
superior to other measures of depression.22 In addition, the 
DSM-5 MDD working group and the NICE guidelines consider 
the PHQ-9 the preferred measure to assess the presence of the 
depression and quantify its severity.21,22,26 
The PHQ-9 has been evaluated in Colombia in university 
students27: however, it was not compared to a gold standard. 
The PHQ-9 criteria therefore need to be validated in PC in 
Colombia against a gold standard, in particular due to the 
opportunity PC services represent in the early detection of 
depression.28 As a result, this study’s objective was to assess 
the validity of the PHQ-9 criteria, comparing it with the Mini- 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for screening 
for depressive symptoms in adult PC users in the Bucara- 
manga metropolitan area. 
This study was designed and analysed based on the recom- 
mendations of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy 
Studies (QUADAS-2) declaration.29 An analytical observational 
study of the validity of a scale’s criteria was conducted using 
reference criteria. 

Local PC users of both genders, aged 18–65 years were 
included. The PC centres belong to the Instituto de Salud de 
Bucaramanga [Bucaramanga Health institute] (ISABU), a State 
social enterprise that coordinates primary health care services 
in the Bucaramanga metropolitan area. 
Subjects with psychoactive symptoms, cognitive decline, 
delirium or an intellectual disability that might prevent them 
from responding to the tools, those under the effects of psy- 
choactive substances, with functional changes in vision or 
hearing that might prevent them from understanding the con- 
tent of the survey, and those who did not understand Spanish 
were excluded. The sample size was calculated to evaluate the 
hypothesis regarding the characteristics of a diagnostic test30:

excellent inter-rater (kappa 0.70) and test–retest reliability, and 
moderate validity of criteria compared to the Composite Inter- 
national Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the SCID-P.39,40 The 
MINI quickly gained international acceptance,41–43 has trans- 
lated versions in 43 languages39 and its reliability and validity 
have been explored in its Italian,44 Japanese,45 Norwegian,46 
Moroccan47 and Portuguese48 versions. The average admin- 
11.6 min, with a mean of 15 min.39 
istration time is 18.7 
Together with the CIDI and the SCID-I, the MINI is considered 
a 
 globally accepted gold standard for the diagnosis of mental 
disorders in clinical and research settings.49 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS) was 
designed by Zigmond and Snaith in 198350 to detect mood dis- 
orders, especially those associated with somatic symptoms. It 
consists of 14 items, with an anxiety subscale (odd items) and 
 depression subscale (even items). Each item is graded on a 
a 
four-point frequency scale from 0 to 3. The HADS has been 
translated into most European languages, Arabic, Hebrew, 
Urdu, Japanese and Chinese51 and its reliability and validity 
has been demonstrated in numerous studies.52 In Colombia, 
it was validated in cancer patients, ﬁnding adequate internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s 
of 0.85), a COP of 8 for the anxiety 
subscale and 9 for the depression subscale.53 These psycho- 
metric properties were conﬁrmed in a populational sample 
“nearly every day”), scored from 0 to 3 to give a score between 
 and 27.36 
0 
It can be self- or hetero-administered and is used both 
algorithmically to make a probable diagnosis of MDE or as 
 continuous measure of scores from 0 to 27 with cut-off 
a 
points (COP) at 5, 10, 15 and 20 representing levels of depres- 
sive symptoms, i.e. mild, moderate, moderately severe and 
severe.34 The scores can also be used dichotomously based on 
 COP to classify subjects with or without CSDS.37 According 
a 
to Kroenke et al., the psychometric characteristics of the PHQ- 
 have a sensitivity of 88% and a speciﬁcity of 88%, adequate 
9 
internal consistency (Cronbach’s 
of 0.86–0.89), a test–retest 
score of 0.84, a concordance between self-administered and 
evaluator-administered tests of 84% and an area under the 
curve (AUC) of 0.95.34 In this study a COP of 8 or more was 
used to identify cases of CSDS, based on the meta-analysis by 
Manea et al.23 and the study by Rancans et al. in PC.38 
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview 
The MINI 
interview that 
is a brief structured diagnostic 
explores the diagnostic categories of the DSM-IV and the ICD- 
10.39 Its original version was developed by Sheehan et al.39 and 
Lecrubier et al.40 in the United States and France. It contains 
130 questions organised into modules that assess 16 disor- 
ders from axis 
of the DSM-IV and one personality disorder. 
The original version in English has a sensitivity range between 
0.46 and 0.94 and a speciﬁcity between 0.72 and 0.97,39,40

The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to establish the nor- 
mality of the variables, for the purpose of deciding the type 
of test to use for the concurrent validity analysis of the 
PHQ-9 against the PHQ-2 and the HADS depression subscale 
(HADS-D). These variables were not found to have a normal 
distribution, to Spearman’s Rho was used. The Spearman’s 
Rho was 0.646 for the HADS-D (P < 0.010) and 0.701 for the 
PHQ-2 (P < 0.010). 
(n = 1500) in several cities in Colombia.54 In this work, the ver- 
sion adapted by Rico et al. was used.53 
Patient Health Questionnaire-2 
The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) consists of the 
ﬁrst two items of the PHQ-9, which are necessary to suspect 
the presence of depression according to the DSM-IV criteria.55 
The scoring system is the same as for the PHQ-9 and scores 
range from 0 to 6. A COP of 3 is optimal for screening, but a 
recent meta-analysis suggests that a COP of 2 may increase 
its sensitivity.56 Patients who score positive for CSDS should 
be evaluated with the PHQ-9 to determine whether they meet 
the MDE criteria.57 Its clinical utility stems from the fact that 
it reduces the time taken in normal PC consultations, which 
are usually busy.58 The PHQ-2 has been found to have psy- 
chometric performance comparable to the PHQ-9, with good 
reliability, validity and sensitivity to change.56 In this work, a 
COP of 2 or above was used to identify patients with CSDS.59 
The data were analysed in SPSS version 20.0,60 carefully 
veriﬁed and reviewed twice. A descriptive analysis of the qual- 
˛ 
itative and quantitative variables was performed. Cronbach’s 
coefﬁcients were calculated to assess inter- 
and McDonald’s 
nal consistency; for concurrent validity, Spearman or Pearson 
correlations were estimated depending on the distribution 
of the variables. To assess the accuracy of the PHQ-9 as a 
screening tool compared to the MINI, the receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) and AUC were analysed. The optimum 
COP for the PHQ-9 was determined taking into account validity 
indices: sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive predictive value (PPV), 
negative predictive value (NPV), positive and negative likeli- 
hood ratios (LR), Youden’s index and ROC curve/AUC analysis. 



Three hundred and eighty-four users were contacted, of 
whom 95 did not agree to participate. Of the surveys con- 
ducted, 46 were discarded due to missing and inconsistent 
data; the analysis therefore included 243 participants, of 
whom 184 (75.7%) were female. The average age was 34.05 
years with a standard deviation (SD) of 12.47 years. For male 
participants the average age was 33.59 years with a SD of 
12.89 years, while for female participants the average was 
34.20 years with a SD of 12.37 years. The sociodemographic 
characteristics of the sample can be seen in Table 1. 
The prevalence of CSDS was 27.2% according to the results 
of the PHQ-9 and 21.8% according to the MINI structured inter- 
view. 



A 
coefﬁcient of 0.81 
were obtained. The overall internal consistency of the scale if 
each item is eliminated is shown in Table 2.

with the MINI as a reference standard, establishing the PHQ-9’s 
adequate criterion validity. The comparison of PHQ-9 scores 
coefﬁcients 
against those from the HADS-D and the 
demonstrated good convergent validity and adequate internal 
consistency. 

The percentage of subjects classiﬁed as having CSDS based 
on the PHQ-9 with the pre-established COP was 27.2% (95% 
CI: 26.3–28.9), higher than the prevalence of 22.3% (95% CI: 
20.0–24.6) found in Bucaramanga using the Zung Self-rating 
Depression Scale.10 This difference can be explained by the 
poor diagnostic performance of the Zung scale in the Colom- 
bian population.61 With regard to the prevalence of MDE based 
on the MINI, in this sample it was 21.8% (95% CI: 20.8–23.5), 
which is within the expected range based on a meta-analysis 
of 41 studies in PC with an adjusted global prevalence of 
19.5% (95% CI: 15.7–23.7).62 However, the prevalence of MDE in 
this study is a little higher than the 16.5% (95% CI: 12.3–21.6) 
reported in previous studies in the general population in 
Bucaramanga,11 which can be explained by the fact that this 
study was conducted in people attending PC centres, where 
the prevalence of depression is higher than in the general 
population63 and by the large proportion of women.64 
coefﬁcient was 0.80 and McDonald’s 
coefﬁ- 

cient was 0.81, indicating good internal consistency.65,66 For a 
and McDonald’s 
self-reporting tool to be reliable, Cronbach’s 
need to be at least 0.70.67 The internal consistency found in 
this study is in keeping with a previous study in Colombia37 
and with others conducted in different languages, whose coef- 
ﬁcients ranged from 0.79 to 0.89.68,70,71 
Previous studies have demonstrated that the PHQ-9 has 
adequate concurrent validity with various measured, includ- 
ing the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), short 
health assessment forms and even the PHQ-2.72 In our study, 
total PHQ-9 scores showed a statistically signiﬁcant positive 
correlation with HADS-D and PHQ-2 scores (Spearman’s Rho of 
0.64 [P < 0.01] for HAM-D and 0.70 [P < 0.01] for PHQ-2), in keep- 
ing with previous studies in which the Pearson’s coefﬁcients 
for the PHQ-9 with the HAM-D and the Beck Depression Inven- 
tory (BDI) were 0.52 and 0.76, respectively.68,73–75 Meanwhile, 
 study of patients with Parkinson’s disease showed that 
a 
the PHQ-9 correlated positively with the Self-rating Depres- 
sion Scale and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, with

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study on PHQ-9 
criterion validity in PC in Colombia. The prevalence of MDE 
in this study was 21.8%. The Colombian version of the PHQ-9 
demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance as a depres- 
sion screening tool, as can be seen from the ROC curve and 
AUC. The PHQ-9 also demonstrated an adequate balance of

if ﬁve times more common in a patient with depression than 
in one without depression, while a subject with a negative 
result would have a likelihood of having depression of less 
than 2%.95 These results are comparable with those obtained 
≥7, 
in the Chinese version of the PHQ-9, which with a COP of 
had an LR+ and LR- of 5.99 and 0.17, respectively.93 
The AUC of this Colombian version of the PHQ-9 for PC was 
0.92, which indicates a high degree of accuracy96 and is consis- 
tent with previous studies in PC and other populations.69,71,93 
This study’s main strengths include the use of a clinical 
reference criterion to assess the PHQ-9 validity criterion, the 
adequate participant response rate (75.3%), adequate train- 
ing of interviewers, adherence to the QUADAS-2 guidelines29 
and the execution of a rigorous analysis plan. In addition, the 
PHQ-9 was translated in accordance with the standardised 
guidelines for transcultural adaptation of scales. The linguistic 
adaptation was supported by a group of experts, guaranteeing 
appropriate content validity. 
This study has several limitations. Firstly, our study was 
conducted in a PC context, therefore the results cannot be 
generalised to the general population, whose characteris- 
tics would produce a different response pattern.84 Secondly, 
the study was 
is growing evi- 
limited to adults. There 
dence that adolescents are particularly affected by depressive 
disorders,97 so future studies in Colombia would need to 
assess the psychometric performance of the PHQ-9 in this 
population. Thirdly, this was a cross-sectional study, and as 
 consequence there will be a need, in the future, to design 
a 
longitudinal studies to establish the sensitivity to change of 
the PHQ-9 in the Colombian population, as works exist that 
have used in to assess response to treatment of depression.98 
Fourthly, the fact that the sample was predominantly female 
(75%) could affect the estimates of accuracy indices, as the 
prevalence of depression is higher in women than in men, 
giving a higher number of positive cases of depression.99 And 
ﬁfthly, one relative weakness in the sample size, which was 
calculated following the recommendations of Sanchez et al. 
for comparing the sensitivity of a screening test with a refer- 
ence standard.30 However, other authors, such as Buderer100 
and Obuchowski101 demand larger samples. On the other 
hand, following Bean’s criteria for comparing the sensitivity 
or speciﬁcity of two diagnostic tests, sample sizes similar to 
ours are obtained.102 
In keeping with global results, the Colombian version of 
the PHQ-9 for PC has excellent psychometric performance 
as a screening test, which guarantees that it can be used 
in contexts with few resources and with weaknesses in the 
healthcare system, where the availability of psychiatrists is 
limited.103 Among the strategies to limit the burden of men- 
tal health disorders in low and middle income countries is 
integration of mental health in PC.104 One of the major bar- 
riers to achieving this goal is the lack of easy-to-administer 
and validated screening tools to detect depression. The val- 
idation of instruments such as the PHQ-9 in these contexts 
can help to solve this problem.105 It is known that just screen- 
ing for depression is insufﬁcient to mitigate the growing care 
needs for mental health disorders in low and middle income 
countries; nevertheless, given that depression contributes sig- 
niﬁcantly to the burden of disease, having validated screening 
tools is the ﬁrst step towards solving this problem.106 In 
 Spearman’s coefﬁcient of 0.63 in both cases.76 The corre- 
a 
lation coefﬁcients found in this study conﬁrm the convergent 
validity of the PHQ-9, with Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcients 
between 0.60 and 0.80 indicating a good or considerable posi- 
tive correlation.77 
With regard to the COP, various studies have recommended 
 COP of 10 in the PHQ-9 for the identiﬁcation of MDE.34 For 
a 
example, in a study of PC users in China, an optimum COP 
of 10 produced a sensitivity of 0.87 and a speciﬁcity of 0.8.69 
However, a recent meta-analysis of 18 studies demonstrated 
that the optimum COP of the PHQ-9 could range from 8 to 11, 
depending on the population studied; nevertheless, the bal- 
ance of sensitivity and speciﬁcity is maintained for a COP of 
 (5 of the 18 studies included).23 In our study, the COP of 7 
7 
appears to have given the optimum balance between sensi- 
tivity and speciﬁcity, which was conﬁrmed with an additional 
measure of accuracy: Youden’s index,78 deﬁned as the max- 
imum vertical distance between the ROC curve and the 45 
degree line, as an indicator of how far the curve is from an 
uninformative test.79 Youden’s index is a function of sensi- 
tivity (Se) and speciﬁcity (Sp); it is calculated as (Se + Sp-1)80 
and should be considered alongside the ROC curve as they are 
usually related.81 The range is 0–100 when converted into a 
percentage. Values >50% are generally considered acceptable 
for diagnostic accuracy.82 
The values associated with the COP in our study are con- 
sistent with a study in older adults in PC, in whom PHQ-9 
criterion validity was assessed by administering the MINI, in 
which an optimum COP 
 (sensitivity 0.92; speciﬁcity 0.78) 
demonstrated the best psychometric characteristics.83 Nev- 
ertheless, this COP of 7 is lower than that found in most 
studies with the PHQ-9 in other populations. The cultural and 
demographic characteristics of the samples may be the rea- 
son for this difference.84 Stigma is an important aspect that 
can also inﬂuence people’s response pattern to depression 
screening scales in our population, causing shame in peo- 
ple with mental illnesses, which limits the identiﬁcation of 
psychopathological phenomena.85,86 It is worth noting that 
PHQ-9 COPs tend to be lower in middle and low income 
countries87–89 compared with high income countries.75,90,91 
However, there are no studies looking at this phenomenon. 
This difference in optimum COP highlights the importance 
of validating screening tools in different social and cultural 
contexts.92 


≥7, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the PHQ-9 
in this sample were 90% and 83%, respectively. These ﬁnd- 
ings are consistent with the study by Wang et al., in which the 
≥7 allowed an adequate balance between sensitivity 
COP of 
and speciﬁcity (sensitivity 85%; speciﬁcity 86%).93 The accu- 
racy indices in our study are therefore considered appropriate, 
as the screening tool is considered good when its sensitivity is 
between 79% and 97% and its speciﬁcity is between 63% and 
86%.94 Wittkampf et al. systematically reviewed the psycho- 
metric properties of the PHQ-9 and found a sensitivity of 77% 
(71–84%) and speciﬁcity of 94% (90–97%), including studies in 
subgroups with a high prevalence of depression, such as PC 
users.25 
The LR+ and LR− 
 of the PHQ-9 in our sample, for a COP 
≥7, were 4.93 and 0.12, respectively. This means that, in a 
7) 
of 
similar clinical context, a positive result in the PHQ-9 (COP 
some low income countries, there are cost-effective depres- 
sion intervention programmes, in which screening tools can 
be used to identify appropriate participants.107 One of the 
main components of effective mental health interventions in 
PC is monitoring depressive symptoms using simple, brief and 
easy-to-administer questionnaire such as the PHQ-9.108 



the PHQ-9, 
researchers in Colombia now have valid and reliable psycho- 
metric information about depression screening in PC, which 
will enable the PHQ-9 to be used in studies where it is nec- 
essary to identify depressive symptoms with an appropriate 
COP. 
In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the 
Colombian version of the PHQ-9 is a valid and reliable tool 
for screening for depression in a PC context in Bucaramanga, 
with a COP of 7 or above. The psychometric properties of this 
version of the PHQ-9 will need to be evaluated in different 
populations and other regions of the country. Future studies 
in Colombia should assess the PHQ-9’s sensitivity to change.
