Background: The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Spanish primary care (PC) centres is high. However, 
MDD is frequently underdiagnosed and consequently only some patients receive the appropriate treatment. The present 
study aims to determine the utility of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to identify MDD in a subset of PC 
patients participating in the large PsicAP study. 
Methods: A total of 178 patients completed the full PHQ test, including the depression module (PHQ-9). Also, a Spanish 
version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was implemented by clinical psychologists 
that were blinded to the PHQ-9 results. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 as a screening tool as 
compared to the SCID-I as a reference standard. 
Results: The psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 for a cut-off value of 10 points were as follows: sensitivity, 0.95; 
specificity, 0.67. Using a cut-off of 12 points, the values were: sensitivity, 0.84; specificity, 0.78. Finally, using the diagnostic 
algorithm for depression (DSM-IV criteria), the sensitivity was 0.88 and the specificity 0.80. 
Conclusions: As a screening instrument, the PHQ-9 performed better with a cut-off value of 12 versus the standard cut- 
off of 10. However, the best psychometric properties were obtained with the DSM-IV diagnostic algorithm for depression. 
These findings indicate that the PHQ-9 is a highly satisfactory tool that can be used for screening MDD in the PC setting.

Background 
Major depressive disorder in Spanish primary care 
The vast majority of mental disorders in Spain are diag- 
nosed in primary care (PC), which serves as a gateway to 
treatment and to the entire public health system [1]. In 
this context, emotional disorders are often misdiagnosed, 
with rates of up to 78% for depression, 71% for generalized 
anxiety disorder (GAD), and 86% for panic disorder [2]. 
Moreover, even among patients who are correctly diag- 
nosed, only 35.8% of those with depression and 30.7% of 
those with any anxiety disorder receive adequate treatment 
[3] (i.e., most patients receive primarily pharmacological

guidelines [4]). These mental disorders impose an import- 
ant economic and societal burden on European countries, 
including Spain [5, 6]. 
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent 
in Spanish PC centres, with 9.6% of attendees suffering 
from this disorder each year [7], although this figure is 
lower than the mean prevalence rate (19%) in European 
countries [8]. Nevertheless, due to the absence of 
systematic screening tests, general practitioners (GPs) 
only recognize about 60% of cases of MDD [3], partly 
because this condition is frequently comorbid with other 
physical, somatic, and/or psychological problems such as 
anxiety disorders or alcohol abuse [9]. Based on inter- 
national guideline recommendations (such as the NICE)

assessment methods (for both screening and diagnosis) 
are needed to improve MDD identification in order to 
refer these individuals to the appropriate therapeutic 
intervention [10]. For this reason, screening tests are 
very helpful to obtain a quick, initial identification of a 
possible case of MDD; however, such tools are not 
sufficiently reliable to be used as the sole detection in- 
strument [10, 11]. Thus, clinical interviews are required 
as a second step to confirm diagnoses. The use of these 
screening tools followed by clinical interviews should in- 
crease the efficiency of PC centres and improve overall 
public health outcomes for MDD. 
One screening test that could be used in PC centres to 
identify MDD is the PHQ-9 [12]. This self-report instru- 
ment is derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of 
Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), which was originally 
developed to identify five mental disorders: depression, 
anxiety, alcohol abuse, somatoform disorder, and eating 
disorder. A systematic review of 16 studies that were 
carried out to identify depression [13] concluded that al- 
though there are many valid tools, the PHQ-9 is equal 
or superior to other instruments. In this context, given 
that the operating characteristics of these instruments 
are similar, selection of the optimal tool to identify 
MDD should depend on its feasibility, administration 
and scoring times, and the capability of the instrument 
to serve additional purposes, such as monitoring depres- 
sion severity or response to therapy. Indeed, several 
meta-analyses recommended the PHQ-9 to identify de- 
pression in the PC setting because, it can be adminis- 
tered easily, quickly, and in a wide range of clinical 
contexts [14, 15]. For instance, Gilbody et al. 
[14] 
analysed 17 validation studies (> 5000 participants), con- 
cluding that the PHQ-9 has good psychometric proper- 
ties (sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.92) using either the ≥10 
cut-off score or the “diagnostic algorithm” method. 
Manea, Gilbody and Mcmillan [15] analysed a total of 
18 studies (7180 patients, 927 with MDD confirmed by 
diagnostic interviews), concluding that the PHQ-9 shows 
acceptable psychometric properties for MDD. In that 
study, using the widely-recommended cut-off score of 
10, sensitivity was 0.85 and specificity 0.89, with no sub- 
stantial differences in pooled sensitivity and specificity 
for cut-off scores ranging from 8 to 11. 
The PHQ-9 items closely follow the nine criteria speci- 
fied in the DSM-IV diagnostic manual (the core criteria 
for MDD have not changed in the DSM-5). Patients use 
Likert scales to rate the presence of symptoms in the prior 
two weeks. Depending on frequency (“not at all”, “several 
days”, “more than half of the days”, and “almost every 
day”), the nine items are scored from 0 to 3 points (total 
severity scores range from 0 to 27 points). Total scores of 
10–14 points, 15–19 points, and 20–27 points indicate, 
respectively, moderate, moderately severe, and severe 
levels of depressive symptoms. When the PHQ-9 is used 
as a screening test, the most widely recommended cut-off 
value is 10, as previous research has demonstrated that 
this cut-off value provides the best combination of sensi- 
tivity (0.88) and specificity (0.88) [12]. The PHQ-9 has also 
been proposed for use as a diagnostic tool using a specific 
coding algorithm based on the DSM-IV criteria for MDD 
in which MDD is diagnosed if at least one of the two first 
symptoms (items) is rated with a 2 (more than half of the 
days) or a 3 (most days) and four of the remaining items 
are also rated with a score of 2 or 3 (with the exception of 
item 9 [suicide], in which a rating of 1 is sufficient). How- 
ever, the general consensus is that the PHQ-9 can be used 
as a screening test but not as a diagnostic test [12–15]. 
The construct validity of the PHQ-9 has been demon- 
strated in PC patients in many countries, 
including 
[17], China [18], East-Africa [19], 
Spain [16], Brazil 
Holland [20], South-Africa [21], the US [22] and others. 
These studies indicate that the PHQ has a high conver- 
gent validity with other depression measures. However, 
questions have been raised with regard to the optimal 
cut-off scores for screening to obtain the most accurate 
results on the PHQ-9. For example, a meta-analysis [12] 
suggested that 
the PHQ-9 presented good screening 
properties with both the ≥10 cut-off and the “diagnostic 
algorithm” method, but that the cut-off point may be in- 
creased to ≥11 or ≥12 to obtain optimum specificity in 
some community-based studies. 
In a recent review, 
Kroenke et al. [23] argued against using an inflexible ad- 
herence to a single cut-off score; rather, those authors 
argue that the cut-off should be adjusted to the target 
population. Manea et al. [15] found no significant differ- 
ences in sensitivity or specificity between a cut-off score 
of 10 and other cut-off scores (ranging from 8 to 11), 
but suggested that a cut-off of 11 may represent the best 
trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Although 
is controversial and may 
the optimal cut-off point 
depend on the target population, the PHQ-9 presents a 
reasonably good sensitivity and specificity when used as 
a screening tool, regardless of the precise cut-off point. 
By contrast, in studies conducted to assess the validity of 
the “diagnostic algorithm”, results have been more am- 
biguous. A recent meta-analyses performed to assess 27 
validation studies of 
the PHQ-9 algorithm scoring 
method in various settings concluded that—in most 
cases—sensitivity was low but specificity was good [24]. 
Similarly, Mitchell et al. [25] conducted a meta-analysis 
of 26 publications reporting on 40 individual studies 
(n = 26,902 patients), finding that the best estimates of 
sensitivity and specificity for the PHQ-9 algorithm were 
0.57 and 0.93, respectively. So, the PHQ-9 can be used 
as a screening test using different cut-off scores but the 
psychometric properties of the “diagnostic algorithm” 
were not as good. 


Few studies have evaluated the Spanish version of the 
PHQ-9. The first study by Diez-Quevedo et al. [26] was 
conducted to validate the Spanish version of the whole 
in an 
PHQ (including the 9 items for depression) 
inpatient setting, finding that this 9-item part of the 
PHQ-9 yielded satisfactory sensitivity (0.84) and excel- 
lent specificity (0.92) for MDD compared to the gold 
standard at that time (i.e., the Structured Clinical Inter- 
view for DSM-III-R). However, the profile of patients in 
PC centres is likely to differ substantially from those 
treated in a psychiatric inpatient setting. A Spanish 
version of the PHQ-9 has also been evaluated for use in 
PC centres in Honduras, with all of the linguistic and 
cultural differences implied by that setting [27]. How- 
ever, only one study has focused on a Spanish version of 
the PHQ-9 for Spain [16]. In that study, although the 
the 
sample was obtained from Spanish PC centres, 
PHQ-9 was administered by telephone, and thus re- 
ported internal consistency of the PHQ-9 applies only to 
telephone administration. Consequently, little is known 
about how the PHQ9 performs in Spanish PC centres, 
nor do we know the optimal cut-off criteria that would 
be most appropriate in this context in Spain. 
Objectives 
The aim of the present study was to assess the utility of 
the PHQ-9 as a screening test to identify MDD in 
patients at Spanish PC centres. We performed psycho- 
metric analyses to identify the sensitivity and specificity 
of the PHQ-9 total score to obtain the optimal cut-off 
value based on diagnoses obtained with the standardized 
clinical 
Interview for 
DSM-IV Axis I Disorders; SCID-I). Additionally, we 
the “diagnostic 
tested sensitivity and specificity of 
algorithm”. 

Methods 
Setting 
The study was conducted from January to December 
2014 at five PC centres participating in the larger PsicAP 
study [28], a clinical 
trial designed to evaluate the 
diagnosis and treatment of emotional disorders among 
PC patients in Spain. The centres are located in several 
cities in Spain (two in Valencia, and one each in 
Albacete, Vizcaya, and Mallorca). 
Instruments 
Patient health questionnaire (PHQ) 
The PHQ is a self-report screening test derived from the 
PRIME-MD test [29]. The PHQ also includes modules 
to assess somatization (PHQ-15), depressive disorder 
(PHQ-9), panic disorder (PHQ-PD), generalized anxiety 
disorder (GAD-7), eating disorders, and alcohol-related 
disorders. In this study, we used the Spanish GAD-7 
validation by García-Campayo et al. [30], which contains 
the 7 GAD items. 
PHQ-9 
The PHQ-9 [12] is part of the PHQ and consists of nine 
items to assess for the presence of the nine diagnostic 
criteria for major depression according to DSM-IV. The 
PHQ-9 evaluates the presence of the following symp- 
toms over the previous two-week period: (a) depressed 
mood; (b) anhedonia; (c) sleep problems; (d) feelings of 
tiredness; (e) changes in appetite or weight; (f ) feelings 
of guilt or worthlessness; (g) difficulty concentrating; (h) 
feelings of sluggishness or worry; (i) suicidal 
ideation. 
Items are answered on a four-point Likert scale from 0 
to 3 as follows: 0 (never), 1 (several days), 2 (more than 
half of the days), and 3 (most days). Internal consistency 
was satisfactory in the current sample (McDonald’s 
ω = .89) and all 
item-test correlations were >.40. A 
public version of the PHQ-9, written in Spanish for use 
in Spain, provided by the authors of the PHQ was used 
in this study. 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders 
(SCID-I) 
The Spanish Version of this semi-structured interview 
[31] was conducted by clinical psychologists (7 in total) 
who had received intensive training by an expert clinical 
psychologist 
for more 
details). The interview sessions were supervised by the 
same clinical psychologist for the duration of the study. 
Patients were diagnosed with MDD when they presented 
at least five of the DSM-IV criteria during the last two 
weeks: that is ≥ one of the first two symptoms and ≥ 
four of the remaining symptoms. 


Procedure 
Patients with anxious, depressive or physical symptoms 
without a clear biological basis were asked by the GPs to 
participate in the PsicAP clinical trial (see Cano-Vindel 
et al. [28]). They received the Patient Information Sheet 
and provided informed consent. Next, an individual 
meeting was arranged to review the study details with 
the participants and to complete the PHQ and the other 
tests. Computerized versions of these tests were used in 
most cases. Patients with impaired vision received help 
in completing the questionnaires. Paper versions of the 
measures were provided to patients with difficulties 
using the computer. After completing the PHQ-9, 
participants were asked to participate in the SCID-I 
interview, which was then scheduled within a maximum 
of 2 weeks from completion of the PHQ-9. Prior to ad- 
ministration of the SCID-I, all participants received a 
Patient Information Sheet of this sub-study and signed 
form. All clinical psychologists 
an informed consent 


conducting the interviews were blinded to the results of 
the PHQ-9. 
This study was approved by the Corporate Clinical 
Research Ethics Committee of Primary Care of Valencia 
(CEIC-APCV) (as the national research ethics committee 
coordinator) and the Spanish Medicines and Health 
Products Agency (AEMPS) (N EUDRACT: 2013–001955- 
11 and Protocol Code: ISRCTN58437086). 
Data analysis 
A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
was performed using data from the 178 patients that 
completed the PHQ-9 and were interviewed with the 
SCID-I; this statistical analysis was performed using the 
pROC package [32] for the statistical programming en- 
vironment R [33]. The following ratios were calculated: 
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive 
values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios. To 
evaluate the test’s screening properties, we used the sum 
scores of the PHQ-9 and the “diagnostic algorithm”. The 
optimal cut-off value to balance sensitivity and specifi- 
city was defined as the value corresponding to the 
maximum value of the Youden’s index, calculated as 
(sensitivity + specificity – 1) [34]. 
Results 
Study sample 
All patients between 18 and 65 years (inclusive) who 
presented at one of these five PC centres for somatic or 
psychological complaints during the study inclusion 
period were invited to participate (n = 298). Of these, 
260 participants (186 females) completed the PHQ and 
178 (125 females) were interviewed using the SCID-I. In 
terms of socio-demographic variables, no differences 
were observed between the whole sample and the subset 
of participants who completed the SCID-I interview (as 
indicated by t-tests or chi-squared tests, depending on 
variable type; all p ≥ .35). The Vizcaya centre, however, 
had a slightly higher dropout rate. Table 1 shows the 
socio-demographic variables and data on prescription 
medications taken by the patients. 
SCID-I-based prevalence 
Of the 260 patients included in our study, 178 com- 
pleted the clinical 
interviews with the SCID-I. The 
prevalence of MDD seen in our PC population was high: 
129 of 178 patients (72.5%) met the criteria for MDD on 
the SCID-I, while 49 patients (27.5%) did not fulfil these 
criteria. 
PHQ-based prevalence 
Of the 260 patients who completed the PHQ, 141 (54%) 
met the criteria for somatization disorder (SD; (PHQ- 
15 ≥ 5), 68% for MDD (n = 178) according to the DSM- 
IV “diagnostic algorithm” or 78% PHQ-9 for scores ≥10 
(n = 203) and 69% for GAD (GAD-7 ≥ 10; n = 180). 110 
participants (42%) met the criteria for panic disorder ac- 
cording to the modified algorithm of the PHQ-PD and 
22% (n = 57) met panic disorder criteria according to 
the original algorithm of 
the PHQ-PD. Finally, 17% 
(n = 45) met criteria for eating disorder) and 14% 
(n = 38) for alcohol-related disorder. As expected, co- 
morbidity between disorders was high, particularly for 
comorbid MDD and GAD (n = 150; 57%), SD and 
MDD (n = 115; 44%), and GAD and SD (n = 117; 
45%). Overall, 40% of the participants with MDD pre- 
sented comorbidity with either GAD or SD (n = 104). 
We found no differences between the total sample of 
PHQ-9 respondents (n = 260) and the subsample of 
PHQ-9 and SCID-I respondents (n = 178) in terms of 
the proportion of participants that met criteria for 
one or more of 
the aforementioned disorders, nor 
with regard to comorbidities (all p > .61). See Table 2 
for details. 
Operating characteristics of the PHQ-9 using different 
cut-off scores 
The ROC curve analysis showed that the PHQ-9 had an 
area under the curve of 0.89 (Fig. 1). The most widely 
used cut-off value for correctly identifying cases with 
MMD is ≥10. In our study, of the patients diagnosed 
with MDD according to SCID-I, 95% had scores >10 on 
the PHQ-9 while 67% of patients without a SCID-I diag- 
nosis of MDD scored below the cut-off level (< 10). As a 
result, the PHQ-9 had a sensitivity of 0.95, a specificity 
of 0.67, positive and negative predictive values of 0.88 
and 0.83, respectively, and positive and negative likeli- 
hood ratios, respectively, of 2.90 and 0.08. Increasing the 
PHQ-9 cut-off point to 12 yielded the following values: 
sensitivity, 0.84; specificity, 0.78; positive and negative 
predictive values of 0.91 and 0.66, respectively; and 
positive and negative likelihood ratios of 3.76 and 0.20, 
respectively. Most 
(84%) depressed patients (SCID-I 
diagnosis) had scores of 12 or higher, whereas 78% of 
patients without a depression diagnosis scored below the 
cut-off point. Moreover, according to the Youden’s 
index, which offers the optimal cut-off value balancing 
sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity + specificity – 1), 
the most appropriate cut-off value was 14 (J = 0.66), 
whereas these values were lower when other cut-off 
scores were used, as follows: 10 (J = 0.62), 11 (J = 0.63), 
12 (J = 0.62). With a cut-off score of 14, the PHQ-9 
showed the following psychometric properties: sensitiv- 
ity, 0.78; specificity, 0.88; positive and negative predictive 
values, 0.94 and 0.60, respectively; and positive and 
negative likelihood ratios, 6.33 and 0.26, respectively 
(Table 3 shows other possible cut-off points and confi- 
dence intervals).

Discussion 
In this study, we assessed the utility of the PHQ-9 as a 
screening tool to identify MDD in users of Spanish PC 
services. The main appeal of the PHQ-9 is that it is an 
easy to administer and inexpensive self-report measure. 
Our main finding is that the PHQ-9 is of value in identi- 
fying MDD in patients at Spanish PC centres, but our 
findings suggest that a higher cut-off value (12 or more) 
or the “diagnostic algorithm” might be better than the 
standard 10-point cut-off value in order to improve 
specificity in this patient population. 
Our results show that the PHQ-9 is a sensitive screen- 
ing instrument for MDD, and in most cases it correctly 
identified individuals with MDD when the most 
common cut-off point (10 points) was used [12, 13, 35]. 
Unexpectedly, the specificity of the PHQ-9 in our study 
was much lower than reported in previous studies, sug- 
gesting more false positive diagnoses of MDD. Increas- 
ing the cut-off point to 12 resulted in a slight decrease 
in sensitivity but specificity improved to a more satisfac- 
tory value, yielding a more acceptable trade-off. At the 
12-point cut-off, the positive predictive value increased 
while the negative predictive value decreased. According 
to the Youden’s index, the most appropriate cut-off score 
was 14 (J = 0.66) compared to a cut-off score of 10 
(J = 0.62), 11 (J = 0.63), 12 (J = 0.62). Using a cut-off 
point of 14, the sensitivity was 0.78 and the specificity 
0.88. To reduce false negatives, an important character- 
istic of a good screening tool is a high sensitivity. For 
this reason, we suggest a cut-off score of 12 in the 
context of Spanish PC centres due to the high sensitivity 
(0.84) achieved with this cut-off level. However, the opti- 
mal cut-off in other populations may vary and other 
authors have recommended adjusting the cut-off point 
to suit the target population [13, 14]. Given that sensitiv- 
ity is vital in the PC setting, we believe that a moderate 
specificity (found in the cut-off score of 10) is accept- 
able. Thus, rather than strictly following the Youden’s 

Operating characteristics of the PHQ-9 using the “diagnostic 
algorithm” 
Of the patients with a SCID-I diagnosis of MDD, 88% 
were 
also identified as having major depression 
according to the PHQ-9 “diagnostic algorithm”. By 
contrast, 80% of non-depressed patients (SCID-I) did 
not reach the diagnostic cut-off point. Based on these 
data, 
the PHQ-9 presented a sensitivity of 0.88, a 
specificity of 0.80, positive and negative predictive 
values, respectively, of 0.92 and 0.72, and positive and 
negative likelihood ratios of 4.33 and 0.15, respect- 
ively. The highest value for 
index 
(J = 0.68) was obtained for the PHQ-9 “diagnostic 
algorithm”. (Table 3 provides mores details, including 
confidence intervals and alternative cut-off points).

index, we believe that our recommendations are more 
appropriate for clinicians in this setting. 

Using the original DSM-IV algorithm to identify 
MDD, the results of the PHQ-9 were satisfactory, with a 
very high sensitivity (0.88) and good specificity (0.80). 
Consequently, the positive predictive value was quite 
high, the negative predictive value was acceptable, and 
the positive and negative likelihood ratios were, there- 
fore, also good. Moreover, the Youden’s index showed 
the best index value (J = 0.68) when using the “diagnos- 
tic algorithm” compared to other cut-off scores. Overall, 
these results indicate that, from a psychometric perspec- 
tive, the DSM-IV “diagnostic algorithm” is superior to 
most common cut-off 
the other 
suggested values (ranging from 12 to 14 points), with an 
excellent ability to correctly differentiate between de- 
pressed and non-depressed individuals. Furthermore, the 
satisfactory positive and negative predictive values of the 
PHQ-9 show that the test is excellent for ruling out 
non-MDD cases but can also adequately confirm MDD. 
These findings are also consistent with the Spanish val- 
idation study [26], which also found high sensitivity and 
specificity under these conditions, as the “diagnostic 
algorithm” was used in the depression section. Based on 
these findings, we believe the DSM-IV algorithm should 
be used with the PHQ-9. In contrast to some previous 
research [24, 25, 36], these results suggest that the PHQ- 
9 can be used as a screening test when the DSM-IV 
“diagnostic algorithm” is used. That said, it is important 
to stress that the “diagnostic algorithm” used for screen- 
ing purposes should not be confused with a diagnosis of 
MDD. We agree with Mitchell et al. [25] that the PHQ-9 
should not be used as the only source of information to 
confirm a clinical diagnosis. Thus, the “diagnostic algo- 
rithm” for the PHQ-9 may serve as a useful screening 
method to quickly and efficiently identify MDD or other 
in the PC setting. However, 
depressive symptoms 
patients with suspected MDD should be referred for a 
clinical 
an experienced 
clinician to confirm the diagnosis and to determine 
secondary causes. 


This study presents some limitations that may have 
contributed to the discrepant results compared with 
other studies. To start with, patient recruitment required 
a referral by the GP, who informed patients about this 
clinical trial involving psychological treatment. This re- 
cruitment approach likely resulted in some degree of 
selection bias, which may have partially affected our re- 
sults. This influence may have been negative because it 
seems probable that the low specificity of the PHQ-9 ob- 
served in our sample using a 10-point cut-off value may 
be attributable to some participants exaggerating their 
symptoms on the questionnaire to ensure eligibility for 
treatment. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that 

many patients with scores >20 (indicative of severe 
depression) were diagnosed as only mildly depressed on 
the SCID-I interview. Additionally, in previous studies, 
patients scoring >20 on that test did not present severe 
MDD [37]. In fact, based on those findings, Zimmerman 
et al. [37] called for caution in using the PHQ-9 to guide 
treatment selection until the thresholds to define sever- 
ity ranges have been empirically established. Importantly, 
based on these findings, we have since modified the 
protocol of the PsicAP study [28] to prevent misuse: pa- 
tients with PHQ-9 scores above 20 are automatically 
interviewed with the SCID-I to confirm the severity of 
their depression. Another 
that many 
patients that participated in our study presented symp- 
toms of other emotional disorders, such as anxiety, 
somatizations, and mood disorders. Given that anxiety 
and depression share common features [38], this may 
explain the high rates of comorbidity. Thus, it is possible 
that patients suffering from anxiety or somatizations 
may have depressive symptoms that did not meet DSM- 
IV criteria for MDD on the SCID-I. In turn, this would 
have affected specificity estimates in our data. In fact, it 
is possible that the “diagnostic algorithm” performed 
better than other cut-off values because it is better 
typically 
circumstances 
adapted to these 
observed in the applied clinical setting. Therefore, the 
PHQ-9 may have some ecological validity for PC set- 
tings, where comorbidity is high and resources and avail- 
able time are scarce. However, more studies are needed 
in Spanish PC centres to replicate these results and to 
identify possible boundary 
conditions. Additionally, 
given that the DSM-5 and DSM-IV use the same algo- 
rithm to diagnose MDD, a fertile area for future research 
would be to investigate the relationship between the 
PHQ and the restructured broader diagnoses of DSM-5 
affective disorders. 

Conclusions 
This is the first study to assess the PHQ-9 to obtain the 
optimal cut-off values for screening patients with MDD 
in the PC setting in Spain. The findings presented in this 
study indicate that the PHQ-9 is a valuable tool to help 
to identify suspected cases of MDD among patients 
treated at Spanish PC centres. Based on our results, in 
this population we recommend using a cut-off value of 
12 or the DSM-IV “diagnostic algorithm” instead of the 
most common cut-off value of 10. Patients identified 
by the PHQ-9 screening tool with suspected MDD 
must be referred to specialised clinicians to confirm 
the diagnosis with other diagnostic measures and/or 
clinical interviews.
