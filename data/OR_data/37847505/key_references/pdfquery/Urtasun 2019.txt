Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a brief tool to assess the presence and severity of 
depressive symptoms. This study aimed to validate and calibrate the PHQ-9 to determine appropriate cut-off points 
for different degrees of severity of depression in Argentina. 
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on an intentional sample of adult ambulatory care patients with 
different degrees of severity of depression. All patients who completed the PHQ-9 were further interviewed by a 
trained clinician with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II 
(BDI-II). Reliability and validity tests, including receiver operating curve analysis, were performed. 
Results: One hundred sixty-nine patients were recruited with a mean age of 47.4 years (SD = 14.8), of whom 102 
were females (60.4%). The local PHQ-9 had high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87) and satisfactory 
convergent validity with the BDI-II scale [Pearson’s correlation = 0.88 (p < 0.01)]. For the diagnosis of Major 
Depressive Episode (MDE) according to the MINI, a PHQ-9 ≥ 8 was the optimal cut-off point found (sensitivity 
88.2%, specificity 86.6%, PPV 90.91%). The local version of PHQ-9 showed good ability to discriminate among 
depression severity categories according to the BDI-II scale. The best cut off points were 6–8 for mild cases, 9–14 
for moderate and 15 or more for severe depressive symptoms respectively. 
Conclusions: The Argentine version of the PHQ-9 questionnaire has shown acceptable validity and reliability for 
both screening and severity assessment of depressive symptoms.

Background 
Major Depressive Episodes (MDE) are one of the leading 
causes of the global disease burden [1]. In severe cases, 
depression can lead to suicide, which is associated with 
the loss of about 850,000 lives each year [2]. Mental dis- 
orders are disabling and often co-morbid with chronic 
physical diseases, such as cardiovascular disease [3–5]. 
It has been estimated that about 20% of adults in low 
and middle-income countries (LMIC) suffer from mental 
health or substance use disorder each year [6]. In Latin 
America, depressive disorders are the leading cause of 
DALYs (disability-adjusted life year) among women and

the fourth cause of DALYs among men [7]. Specifically, 
in Argentina, the age-standardized DALY rate due to de- 
pressive disorders reached 795.7 per 100.000 in 2013 [8]. 
A review of epidemiological studies in general popula- 
tion of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru 
and Puerto Rico, during the last 20 years, has shown a 
12-month prevalence of major depression of 4.9% [7]. 
Despite its relevance to public health, depression is often 
unrecognized and untreated in primary care [9–11]. 
There is a variety of available instruments to assess 
depressive symptoms, but most of them have been de- 
veloped in high-income countries and have not been 
cross-culturally adapted or validated for their use in 
LMIC [12]. The nine-item PHQ-9 (Patient Health Ques- 
is 
tionnaire), extensively validated in many countries, 
one of the most commonly used tools for diagnosis and

severity assessment of depression [13]. However, it has 
not been validated for its use in Argentina. 
The PHQ-9 is a short, self-administered questionnaire, 
widely used for screening of depression in primary care 
settings [14], and detection of this condition in large epi- 
demiological studies [15–18]. Because this instrument is 
based on DSM- IV criteria, those scoring high are often 
cases with Major Depressive Episode (MDE). Further, it 
can also be used to assess the severity of depression by 
identifying from mild to severe cases. However, there is 
growing evidence that cut-off points for determining the 
degree of severity may vary depending on different con- 
texts [19–22]. 
Although there is a cross-culturally adapted version of 
the PHQ-9 in Spanish for Argentina [23], this version 
has not been formally validated. Additionally, the ap- 
propriate cut-off points were not ascertained to assess 
the severity of symptoms. Thus, the aim of this study 
was to validate and calibrate the PHQ-9 to determine 
the appropriate cut-off points to assess different de- 
grees of severity of depression in the adult population 
of Argentina. 
Methods 
Participants 
A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 
adults with different degrees of severity of depression as 
well as individuals with no depressive symptoms. The 
study sample was obtained between December 2013 and 
March 2014. Patients were recruited from two primary 
care clinics and two specialty mental health outpatient 
facilities, both from the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
The out-patient facilities were: 1) the “Dr. Braulio A. 
Moyano” Hospital, which is a public neuropsychiatric 
hospital serving a large urban catchment area predomin- 
the 
antly of 
“Foro Foundation”, a private outpatient facility treating 
high-income patients. The primary care clinics were: 1) 
The “Cooperativa de Grupo de Práctica de Medicina Fa- 
miliar”, a private primary care center that treats middle- 
income insured patients from anywhere in Buenos Aires; 
and 2) the “Centro HORUS”, a private institution spe- 
cialized in mental health with a multidisciplinary ap- 
proach serving middle-income patients. 

A purposeful quota sampling approach of persons at- 
tending these facilities was used in the study. Partici- 
pants were recruited from two sources: 1) Patients 
referred by physicians because of the previous diagnosis 
of depression, and 2) patients who asked for an ap- 
pointment for other health problems were approached 
and invited to participate. In both cases, all patients 
were invited to participate and asked for their signed 
informed consent. 
Patients were recruited until the fulfillment of four 
quotas defined as follows: (no depression, mild, moder- 
ate, and severe symptoms of depression), according to 
the Beck Depression Inventory described below. A mini- 
mum of thirty patients per category was set for quota 
sampling. 
Patients were included if they were able and willing to 
consent, aged 21 years or older, and were native speakers 
of Spanish. Exclusion criteria only applied to patients 
who were illiterate. 
Study instruments 
Patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) 
We used the existing Argentinian version of the PHQ-9 
instrument, which went through a full cross-cultural 
adaptation process [23]. 
This is a nine-item self-reported scale, developed to 
diagnose the presence and severity of depressive symp- 
toms in primary care and the community. It is based on 
the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Major Depression 
Episode and it has the potential to be a dual-purpose in- 
strument that can establish a tentative diagnosis of a de- 
pressive episode as well as depressive symptoms severity 
[24]. Each question in the scale has four response 
choices: “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the 
days,” and “nearly every day.” 


The continuous measure is a summary score ranging 
from 0 to 27 and is calculated by adding up the re- 
sponses to the nine questions, which allows assessing 
the presence and severity of a depressive episode [24]. 
The initial cut-off points proposed by the authors for 
the US population were as follows: ≥10 for diagnosis of 
MDE. Regarding severity, PHQ-9 comprises five categor- 
ies, where a cut-off point of 0–4 indicates no depressive 
symptoms, 5–9 mild depressive symptoms, 10–14 mod- 
erate depressive symptoms, 15–19 moderately-severe de- 
and 20–27 
pressive 
severe depressive 
symptoms [25]. 

MINI-international neuropsychiatric interview Spanish 
version 5.0 (henceforth MINI): 6 
The Spanish version of the Mini International Neuro- 
psychiatric Interview (MINI) [26] was used as the gold 
standard for identifying the presence or absence of 
major depressive episode. The MINI interview is a vali- 
dated tool used to diagnose minor and major depression 
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), and is simi- 
lar to the SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM- 
IV) in operation and principle [27]. This short structured 
diagnostic interview explores the major Axis I psychi- 
atric disorders in DSM-IV and ICD-10. Studies of 


validity and reliability have been conducted comparing 
the MINI to the SCID-P for DSM-III-R and CIDI (a 
structured interview developed by the World Health 
Organization for non-clinical interviewers for ICD-10). 
The results of these studies have shown that not only 
the MINI score has acceptably high validity and reliabil- 
ity, but also it can be administered in a much shorter 
period (18.7 ± 11.6 min, average 15 min) compared to 
the instruments mentioned above [28]. Direct clinical 
examination by a psychiatrist administering the Major 
Depressive Episode (MDE) and Dysthymia modules of 
the MINI was undertaken. The MDE module deter- 
mined the standard diagnostic practice for the present 
study, while the Dysthymia module just helped us to 
capture the patients with lower levels of depressive 
symptomatology but who did not meet 
the MDE 
criteria. 
Beck depression inventory second edition (hereafter BDI-II) 
The locally validated version of the Beck Depression In- 
ventory Second edition (BDI-II) was used as an instru- 
ment to ascertain symptom severity [29]. The BDI-II can 
be used as a self-reported questionnaire or administered 
by a physician. This questionnaire comprises 21 items, 
where each symptom is rated for the past two weeks, in- 
cluding the present-day on a four-point rating scale (0– 
3). The sum score ranges from 0 to 63. The following 
four severity levels are suggested: scores between 0 and 
13 indicate minimal symptoms, from 14 to 19 mild, be- 
tween 20 and 28 moderate, and from 29 to 63 severe 
symptoms of depression [29]. BDI-II has shown good 
psychometric properties across several settings [30, 31]. 
In our study, the BDI-II questionnaire was administered 
by trained clinicians. 
We decided to address the inherent difficulty given by 
the fact that PHQ-9 defines five categories of depression 
while the BDI-II defines only four, because to our know- 
ledge BDI-II was the unique instrument for depression 
screening validated in Argentina at the beginning of the 
study. So, in our study, the moderately severe and severe 
categories of the original PHQ-9 were expected to cor- 
respond to the severe category of BDI-II. 
Data collection 
The PHQ-9 was self-administered, while a trained clin- 
ician conducted a structured interview (MDE, or MDE 
and Dysthymia modules of MINI) and applied the BDI- 
II questionnaire. Only those individuals who did not 
meet criteria for MDE received the Dysthymia module, 
as we wanted to ascertain how many of those classified 
as ‘no depressed’ could present low levels of depressive 
symptomatology. To minimize a possible response bias 
induced by the sequence of administration of the instru- 
ments, two random sequences were used as follows: a) 
MINI, BDI-II and PHQ-9, and b) PHQ-9, MINI, and 
BDI-II. All the clinicians who conducted the interviews 
were blinded to the results of the PHQ-9. 
Additionally, we collected information on age, gender, 
level of education, marital status, employment, and 
health coverage. 
Statistical analysis 
Considering expected values of sensitivity between 85 
and 88%, and specificity between 92 and 95%, we calcu- 
lated a minimum sample size required of 40 participants 
for each level of severity of depression and 30 healthy 
subjects with no depressive symptoms. For the sample 
size calculation we used the “Epidat 4.1”, free statistical 
software developed by Dirección Xeral de Innovación e 
Xestión da Saúde Pública de la Consellería de Sanidade 
(Xunta de Galicia) and funded by PAHO and WHO. 
Criterion validity was evaluated through the compari- 
son of the scores obtained with the PHQ-9 with the 
MINI interview for diagnosis, and BDI-II for the severity 
of depression. We calculated sensitivity, specificity and 
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive 
value (NPV). 
To determine the most appropriate cut-off points for 
PHQ-9 receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves 
were generated and Youden index was calculated using 
the PHQ-9 summary score, where the results for depres- 
sion diagnosis and severity were obtained from MINI 
and BDI-II respectively. All estimates were given with 
95% confidence intervals. 

the area 
under the curve (AUC) and the PPV and NPP were eval- 
uated and compared to the original cut-off points sug- 
gested by the authors of the original scale [25]. The 
AUC for different cut-off points were compared using 
the non-parametric statistical method described by 
Hanley & McNeil [32]. Youden’s index was calculated as 
(sensitivity + specificity – 1) [33]. The most accurate 
cut-off point for diagnosis and for each category of de- 
pression severity was ascertained. The Cronbach Alpha 
coefficient was used for measuring reliability. All data 
analyses were done with STATA 12.0 (StataCorp LP, 
College Station, TX, USA). 
The data were analyzed with dysthymia cases included 
as “not depressed” and also excluding them to evaluate 
eventual changes in the results. 
Results 
A total sample of 169 subjects was recruited, 102 women 
(60.4%) and 67 men (39.6%). The mean age was 47.4 (SD 
14.8 years). Thirty-eight percent of them were secondary 
school graduates, and 14.8% were unemployed. Thirty 
percent of participants were married or had a partner, 
and 77% had social or private health insurance (Table 1).

The mean BDI-II score was 21 (SD = 13.4) with a me-

Criterion validity analysis for diagnosis of depression 
against MINI 
We examined the performance of PHQ-9 against the 
diagnosis of MDE by MINI as the gold standard. Ac- 
cording to MINI, 102 patients (60.36%) met the diagno- 
sis of DSM-IV MDE. The mean PHQ-9 score for these 
patients was 14.76 (SD = 5.65), whereas the mean score 
for patients without diagnosis of MDE was 4.16 (SD = 
4.01). 
The validity of the PHQ-9 score as a continuous 
measure was also assessed. Table 2 depicts the sensi- 
tivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and positive and negative 
likelihood ratio for different thresholds for diagnosing 
MDE against MINI. At 
the cut-off score of 8 or 
higher, the sensitivity was 88.2%, and the specificity 
was 86.6% (see Table 2). In addition, at this cut-off 
point of 8, we obtained a Youden index of J = 0.75 
and 87.6% of subjects were correctly classified. An 
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% CI 0.82; 
0.92) also suggests good accuracy. (See Fig. 1: ROC 
Curve for diagnosis of MDE according to the MINI 
compared with the PHQ-9). 
We analyze the data with dysthymia cases included as 
“not depressed” first and excluding them from the ana- 
lysis subsequently but the results were unaltered either 
way, most likely because there were only few cases (n = 
16) of dysthymia. 
Finally, the total score of PHQ-9 was compared with 
the BDI-II score. Pearson’s correlation coefficient be- 
tween PHQ-9 and BDI-II was 0.88 (p < 0.01) indicating a 
positive and strong correlation between both instru- 
ments. 
(See Fig. 2: Correlation between BDI-II and 
PHQ-9 scores). 























































Criterion validity analysis for depression severity 
assessment against BDI-II 
As recommended for the Argentinean version of the 
BDI-II, the following categories of severity were consid- 
ered: 0–13 for minimal symptoms/no depression, 14–19 
for mild symptoms, 20–28 for moderate symptoms and 
29–63 for severe symptoms [28]. 
The performance of the PHQ-9 against the different 
categories of severity of depressive symptoms using BDI-II 
as a criterion standard can be seen in Tables 3, 4, and 5. 
The optimal cut-off points were 6–8 for mild, 9–14 for 
moderate and 15 or higher for severe depressive symp- 
toms, respectively. These thresholds showed good sensi- 
tivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and positive and negative 
likelihood ratio for each category. Sensitivity ranged be- 
tween 82.4% for severe symptoms to 95.3% for moderate 
symptoms. Specificity varied from 80.9% (moderate) to 
90.4% (mild). 
High AUC estimates were also seen for all categories. 
AUC for mild, moderate and severe depressive symp- 
toms was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.96), 0.88 (95% CI 0.83 
to 0.93) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.92) respectively (See 
Fig. 1): ROC Curve- Mild symptoms of depression with 
PHQ-9 compared to BDI-II; Fig. 1: ROC Curve- Moder- 
ate symptoms of depression with PHQ-9 compared to 
BDI-II, and Fig. 1: ROC Curve- Severe symptoms of de- 
pression with PHQ-9 compared to BDI-II). 
For measuring mild symptoms of depression, a cut-off 
of 6 or higher showed high sensitivity (91.5%) and speci- 
ficity (90.4%) and yielded a Youden index of J = 0.82 that 
represented 91.12% of subjects correctly classified. When 
comparing AUC for a cut-off point of 6 and for a cut- 
off point of 5 (recommended by the original authors) the 
difference was not statistically significant 
(CI over- 
lapped). A cut-off point of 5 showed an AUC 0.85 (95% 
CI 0.79–0.91) whereas a cut-off point of 6 showed an 
AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.86–0.95). 
Regarding moderate symptoms of depression, at the 
cut-off point of 9, the sensitivity was high (95.3%) but 
the specificity was lower but still adequate (81.0%) and 
the Youden index was J = 0.76. This classification yielded 
88.17% of subjects correctly classified. When comparing 
AUC for a cut-off point of 9 and for a cut- off point of 
10 (recommended by the original authors) the difference 
was not statistically significant (CI overlapped). A cut-off 
point of 9 showed an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.83–0.93) 
whereas a cut-off point of 10 showed an AUC of 0.87 
(95% CI 0.82–0.92). 
Finally, the best cut-off point to measure severe de- 
pressive symptoms was 15 or higher, with a sensitivity of 
82.4% and a specificity of 89.0%. Using that cut-off point, 
we obtained a Youden index of J = 0.71 and the PHQ-9 
questionnaire correctly classified 86.98% of the subjects. 
In this case, as a comparison of both ROC curves for the 
cut-off point of 15 and the cut- off point of 20 (the rec- 
ommended by original authors) a significant difference 
was obtained. Cut-off point of 15 showed AUC 0.86 
(95% CI 0.80–0.92) and cut-off point of 20 showed AUC 
0.67 (95% CI 0.60–0.74). Optimal cut-off points for the 
Argentinian version of PHQ-9 are shown in Table 6. 


Discussion 
There is a large body of evidence on PHQ-9 validation 
against MDE diagnosis from different countries and 
populations [19, 34–41]. However, there are few studies 
assessing calibration on severity categories [20, 21], des- 
pite a strong recommendation to explore score severity 
thresholds across diverse populations. [19, 22]. To our 
knowledge, this is the first validation and calibration 
study of the PHQ-9 in Argentina. 
The internal consistency of PHQ-9 in this study was 
high and similar to the values found in other studies, 
which ranged from 0.67 to 0.89 [42–50]. It has been sug- 
gested that a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.70 or greater should be 
regarded as acceptable for a self-reported instrument [51]. 
When the PHQ-9 was examined for detecting MDE as 
a continuous measure, its validity was supported by an 
AUC value of 0.87, which suggests a high diagnostic ac- 
curacy. The sensitivity at the cut-off value of 8 or higher 
was 88.2%, and the specificity was 86.6%. These values, 
in particular, the specificity, are higher than those re- 
ported in two meta-analyses using PHQ-9 as a continu- 
ous measure for diagnosis of major depressive episodes 
[52, 53]. Furthermore, according to another 
recent 
meta-analysis, the adequate cut-off points for diagnosing 
MDE ranged from 8 to 11 [53]. These results, together 
with the cut-off point of 8 or higher suggested by an- 
other study [20] are also consistent with our results. A

cut-off point of 8 showed an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.82– 
0.93) whereas a cut-off point of 10 showed an AUC of 
0.85 (95% CI 0.80–0.90). However, as expected, the sensi- 
tivity obtained with a lower threshold was higher, which 
becomes relevant since this instrument is intended to be 
used in primary care settings and population-based 
research. 
For the present study, the MDE module of the MINI 
(time frame of two weeks) determined the standard diag- 
nostic practice. While the use of Dysthymia module of 
the MINI (time frame of two years) just helped us to 
capture the patients with lower levels of depressive 
symptomatology but who do not reach MDE criteria. As 
we explained before, only those individuals who did not 
meet criteria for MDE received the Dysthymia module. 
We found that including or excluding these patients did 
not alter the results at all, something that was expected 
as there were few cases of dysthymia. 
Of note, the PHQ-9 score was highly correlated with 
the BDI-II score. This correlation was even higher than 
that reported by Kneipp et al. (Pearson Correlation Co- 
efficient = 0.80) when comparing the same instruments 
in low-income female populations [44]. Our results indi- 
cate a positive, strong association between both instru- 
ments, which further support the validity of the PHQ-9 
measurements in this population. 
Regarding the comparison of categories of severity and 
despite the inherent difficulty given by the fact that 
PHQ-9 defines five categories of depression while the 
BDI-II defines only four, the optimal cut-off points for 
the Argentine version of PHQ-9 generated the same four 
categories, as found in other studies (see Table 6) 
[11, 12]. These categories are also defined according 
to the DSM-IV. The thresholds for all four categories, 
6–8 for mild, 9–14 for moderate and 15 or higher for 
severe depressive symptoms respectively showed good 
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and positive and 
negative likelihood ratio. Of note, in the Argentinean 
version, the moderately severe and severe categories 
of PHQ-9 correspond to or could be included in the 
severe category of BDI-II. Since, the therapeutic approach 
for both, moderate-severe or severe patients, it is similar; 
although this misalignment of the scale categories is not 
ideal, it doesn’t have a relevant impact for screening or 
therapeutic approach purposes. 
This validation study of the PHQ-9 for the Argentinean 
population has several strengths. First, it was rigorously 
designed to have an adequate representation of all the 
stages of severity of depression, including patients with 
non-depressive symptoms, which is key to ensure not only 
its validity for diagnosis of depression but also its calibra- 
tion for different categories of severity; Secondly, we chose 
a criterion tool that is shorter than other diagnostic tools 
available in Argentina for identifying depressive cases [25], 
something that is important in primary care. Thirdly, the 
PHQ-9 is useful to assess not only the presence of clinical 
depression but also its degree of severity. Specifically, for 
severity measures, this Argentine version provides locally 
adjusted thresholds and follows recommendations to 
adapt the instrument to the context and setting where the 
tool is aimed to be implemented [19, 22]. Finally, its use is 
increasingly being valued in epidemiological research be- 
cause it is brief and can be scored in a very simple way, 
providing a continuous measure that is easier to interpret 
in large epidemiological studies [15–18]. 
Our study presents some limitations. First, since this 
study has focused mainly on the city dwellers of Buenos 
Aires and its surroundings, its extrapolation to rural set- 
tings should be taken with caution. Yet, its usability seems 
to be enhanced by the fact that 90% of the Argentine 
population lives in urban areas. Second, the sample com- 
position is heterogeneous with patients coming from

primary and secondary care settings as well as private and 
state sectors. Nonetheless, this might allow us to extrapo- 
late findings to other clinical populations. Third, we ad- 
ministered the instruments in a different order to avoid 
eventually bias, but we have not done additional analyses 
to ascertain if this had an impact on results. Fourth, since 
the PHQ-9 defines five categories of depression while the 
BDI-II defines only four, the optimal cut-off points for the 
Argentine version of PHQ-9 generated the same four cat- 
egories. However, it may not have a relevant impact on 
screening or intervention purposes because it doesn’t con- 
dition the therapeutic approach. 
Conclusions 
The Argentine version of the PHQ-9 questionnaire has 
shown acceptable validity and reliability for both screen- 
ings of Major Depressive Episodes and severity assessment 
of depressive symptoms. A definite diagnosis would ideally 
be attained; however, with a complementary psychiatric 
interview; a tool that is not always available in primary 
care settings. Therefore, this validated and calibrated tool 
could improve and facilitate the detection, classification 
and monitoring of depressive disorders in Argentina, par- 
ticularly in the primary care setting, where depression still 
goes unnoticed and therefore undertreated.
