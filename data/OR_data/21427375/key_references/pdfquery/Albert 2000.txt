Background 
Retrospective and cross-sectional data 
suggest that vigorous exertion can trigger cardiac ar- 
rest or sudden death and that habitual exercise may 
diminish this risk. However, the role of physical ac- 
tivity in precipitating or preventing sudden death from 
cardiac causes has not been assessed prospectively 
in a large number of subjects. 
Methods 
We used a prospective, nested case–cross- 
over design within the Physicians’ Health Study to 
compare the risk of sudden death during and up to 
30 minutes after an episode of vigorous exertion with 
that during periods of lighter exertion or none. We 
then evaluated whether habitual vigorous exercise 
modified the risk of sudden death that was associat- 
ed with vigorous exertion. In addition, the relation of 
vigorous exercise to the overall risk of sudden death 
and nonsudden death from coronary heart disease 
was assessed. 

During 12 years of follow-up, 122 sudden 
deaths were confirmed among the 21,481 male phy- 
sicians who were initially free of self-reported car- 
diovascular disease and who provided information 
on their habitual level of exercise at base line. The 
relative risk of sudden death during and up to 30 
minutes after vigorous exertion was 16.9 (95 percent 
confidence interval, 10.5 to 27.0; P<0.001). However, 
the absolute risk of sudden death during any partic- 
ular episode of vigorous exertion was extremely low 
(1 sudden death per 1.51 million episodes of exer- 
tion). Habitual vigorous exercise attenuated the rela- 
tive risk of sudden death that was associated with 
an episode of vigorous exertion (P value for trend= 
0.006). The base-line level of exercise was not asso- 
ciated with the overall risk of subsequent sudden 
death. 
Conclusions 
These prospective data from a study 
of U.S. male physicians suggest that habitual vigorous 
exercise diminishes the risk of sudden death during 
vigorous exertion. (N Engl J Med 2000;343:1355-61.)

studies, both vigorous physical activity and 
moderate activity are consistently associated 
with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. 
 How- 
ever, it is also recognized that sudden death from car- 
diac causes seems to occur with an unusually high 
frequency during or shortly after vigorous exertion.

Approximately 6 to 17 percent of all sudden deaths

idence to suggest that vigorous exertion simultaneous- 
ly triggers and protects against sudden death. 
 How- 
ever, the role of vigorous exertion in precipitating or 
preventing sudden death has not been assessed pro- 
spectively in a large number of subjects. The prospec- 
tive data compiled in the Physicians’ Health Study pre- 
sented a unique opportunity to determine whether 
vigorous exertion triggers sudden death and wheth- 
er habitual vigorous exercise diminishes the risk. 



The methods of the Physicians’ Health Study have been de- 
scribed in detail elsewhere. 
 Briefly, 22,071 male physicians who 
were from 40 to 84 years of age in 1982 and had no history of 
myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, or cancer 
were assigned to receive aspirin, beta carotene, or both, according 
to a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-by-two factorial de- 
sign. At base line, the physicians completed questionnaires on 
their cardiovascular risk factors, intake of selected foods, and fre- 
quency of vigorous exercise. In this investigation, we excluded 
590 men who reported having angina or having undergone cor- 
onary revascularization, or for whom data on physical activity 
were missing, at base line, leaving 21,481 participants as the base 
population for the analysis. 

We used a nested case–crossover design to quantify the relative 
risk of sudden death from cardiac causes during or up to 30 min- 
utes after an episode of vigorous exertion as compared with the 
risk during periods of lighter exertion or none (Fig. 1). The case– 
crossover study design permits the assessment of change in the 
risk of an event during a brief “hazard period” during and after 
exposure to a transient risk factor. 
 For each subject who had an 
event (i.e., who died), the prospectively determined habitual fre- 
quency of exertion for that subject served as the control informa- 
tion, and each such subject therefore served as his own control in 
this “self-matched” analysis. 



At base line, the subjects were asked, “How often do you ex- 
ercise vigorously enough to work up a sweat?” The possible re- 
sponses were rarely or never, one to three times a month, once a 
week, two to four times a week, five or six times a week, or daily. 
This measure of physical activity correlates with maximal oxygen

 Design of Nested Case–Crossover Analysis. 
Figure 1. 
The hatched portion of the time line represents the 60-minute 
hazard period (30 minutes during and 30 minutes after vigo- 
rous exertion). If a sudden death occurred during this period, 
there was considered to have been exposure to vigorous exer- 
tion. If a sudden death occurred during the shaded portion of 
the time line, there was considered to have been no exposure 
to vigorous exertion. 




 and the

high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. 
 The midpoint value 
was assigned to each response category and multiplied by 52 to 
estimate the usual annual frequency. Subjects were not asked 
about the average duration of exertion at base line, but the ques- 
tion was asked of those who reported engaging in a regular pro- 
gram of exercise in a questionnaire administered at 36 months 
(59 percent of the total cohort). The median duration reported 
(30 minutes) was used as an estimate of the usual duration of vig- 
orous exercise at base line. In our primary analysis we assessed the 
risk of sudden death during and 30 minutes after exertion (Fig. 
1). We therefore assumed that each episode of exertion was asso- 
ciated with 60 minutes of exposure time. To calculate the unex- 
posed person-time, the person-time of exposure (in hours) was 
subtracted from the number of hours in a year. 

The specific activity in which the subject was engaged at the 
time of sudden death and for one hour before death was ascer- 
tained from the medical record or from the next of kin. The de- 
gree of physical exertion was quantified on a scale of 1 to 8 met- 
abolic equivalents (MET). 
 The subject was considered to have 
been exposed to vigorous exertion if the activity was estimated 
as 6 MET or more. If the activity was unknown or was at a level 
of less than 6 MET, there was considered to have been no ex- 
posure. 


An end-points committee of physicians confirmed all events by 
review of medical records. Deaths for which there was evidence 
of coronary heart disease at or before death and no evidence of a 
noncoronary cause were classified as due to cardiac causes. To 
identify sudden deaths, medical records and reports from the next 
of kin for all subjects who had died from cardiac causes were re- 
viewed again by two cardiologists, and agreement was reached on 
whether the death was sudden. 
Sudden death was defined as death within one hour after the 
onset of symptoms or death after a witnessed cardiac arrest or 
abrupt collapse that was not preceded by symptoms lasting more 
than one hour. Information from the death certificate was not 
used to determine the timing of death. To increase the specificity 
of our method for identifying death from arrhythmia, we exclud- 
ed anyone who had evidence of circulatory collapse (hypotension, 
exacerbation of congestive heart failure, or altered mental status) 
before the disappearance of the pulse. 





Each physician’s reported frequency of vigorous exertion at base 
line (episodes per week) was multiplied by the follow-up time in 
weeks to generate an estimate of the total number of episodes of 
vigorous exertion in the population, and the absolute risk of sud- 
den death associated with an episode of vigorous exertion was 
calculated. This risk was then compared with the incidence of sud- 
den death during lighter physical activity, and the difference in ab- 
solute risk was estimated. 

The analysis of case–crossover data is similar to that of a cross- 
over experiment in which the risk to each subject is assessed dur- 
ing periods of exposure and nonexposure. The ratio of the observed 
frequency of exposure in the 60-minute hazard period (Fig. 1) to 
the frequency of exposure expected on the basis of the usual fre- 
quency of exercise reported at base line was used to calculate an 
odds ratio as a measure of relative risk. 
 The data were then 
stratified for each subject and analyzed by methods for cohort 
studies with sparse data in each stratum. 
 Modification of the rel- 
ative risk by habitual vigorous exertion was assessed by compari- 
son of the relative risks for three categories of habitual vigorous 
exertion (less than once, one to four times, and five or more times 
per week), and a test for linear trend 
 was performed. The effect 
of the time of day on the relative risk of sudden death was as- 
sessed by stratification of the analysis according to the time of 
death, followed by comparison of the relative risks by means of a 
test for homogeneity. 






Three sensitivity analyses were performed. First, to examine the 
sensitivity of the results to the hazard period chosen, we consid- 
ered only the period during vigorous exertion (the labeled por- 
tion in Fig. 1) as the period of exposure and reexamined the rel- 
ative risk of sudden death during this 30-minute hazard period. 
Second, we examined the sensitivity of the results to changes in 
our estimate of the usual duration of vigorous exertion. Third, we 
examined the sensitivity of the results to our definition of sudden 
death, which, although specific for death from arrhythmia, exclud- 
ed most unwitnessed deaths and deaths during sleep. Some of 
these deaths could have been sudden, and their systematic exclu- 
sion could have biased our results toward a positive association 
between death and vigorous exercise. Therefore, in this analysis, 
we included unwitnessed deaths with an autopsy result consistent 
with an arrhythmic cause and those that occurred during sleep 
without preceding symptoms as sudden deaths. 
Overall Risk of Sudden and Nonsudden Death 
from Cardiac Causes 
The base-line information on the usual frequency of vigorous 
exertion was modeled in four categories (less than once, once, 
two to four times, and five or more times per week), and the rel- 
ative risks of sudden death and nonsudden death from coronary 
heart disease for the base population of 21,481 men were com- 
puted with use of Cox proportional-hazards models 
 with simul- 
taneous control for potential confounders. 


During 12 years of follow-up, 122 sudden deaths 
from cardiac causes occurred among the 21,481 par- 
ticipants. The age-adjusted risk factors at base line and 
the usual frequency of vigorous exertion for those 
who died suddenly and for the other participants are 
shown in Table 1. The majority of participants report- 
ed exercising vigorously two to four times per week, 
and the distribution of the categories for usual fre-

quency of vigorous exertion did not differ significantly 
between those who died and those who did not. Com- 
plete information on physical activity during the hour 
before death was available for 80 percent of the sudden 
deaths. Seventeen such deaths (13.9 percent) occurred 
during vigorous exertion, and six (4.9 percent) oc- 
curred within 30 minutes after vigorous exertion. The 
majority of the participants were engaged in dynam- 
ic exercise, such as jogging or racquet sports (68 per- 
cent). The rest were involved in other sports (25 per- 
cent) or heavy yardwork or home repairs (7 percent). 
Among the 21,481 men, the incidence of sudden 
death per person-hour was 1 death per 19 million 
hours. The risk of sudden death associated with an ep- 
isode of vigorous exertion was 1 per 1.42 million epi- 
sodes or person-hours at risk. Alternatively, the risk 
of sudden death during periods of lighter exertion or 
none was 1 death per 23 million person-hours. From 
these data, the unadjusted difference in risk associat- 
ed with exposure to vigorous exertion can be estimat- 
ed at 1 excess sudden death per 1.51 million episodes 
of vigorous exertion. On the basis of the case–cross- 
over method, the relative risk of sudden death during 
the one-hour period associated with vigorous exertion 
(Fig. 1), as compared with other time points, was 
significantly elevated at 16.9 (95 percent confidence 
interval, 10.5 to 27.0; P<0.001). 

The results after stratification according to the usu- 
al frequency of vigorous exercise at base line are pre- 
sented in Table 2. The relative risk of sudden death 
associated with an episode of vigorous exertion was 
lower among those who exercised more frequently

ed if exact times of death were not known. 
(P for trend=0.006). Men who rarely engaged in 
vigorous exercise (less than once a week) had a rel- 
ative risk of sudden death of 74.1 in the period dur- 
ing and 30 minutes after exertion. In comparison, 
men who exercised at least five times per week had 
a much lower risk (relative risk, 10.9); however, this 
risk was still significantly higher than that during pe- 
riods of lighter exertion or none. 

It is well known that the incidence of sudden death 
varies according to the time of day. If the subjects 
tended to exercise during the circadian peak in the 
incidence of sudden death (from 6 a.m. to noon), 
24 
this fact could account for part of the increased risk 
associated with exertion. To address this issue, we 
reexamined the relative risks according to the time 
of death (Table 3). The relative risk associated with 
an acute episode of vigorous exertion was not signif- 
icantly modified by the time of death. In addition, 
the relative risk associated with vigorous exertion re- 
mained significantly elevated at times other than the 
circadian peak in sudden death, except for the peri- 
od from midnight to 6 a.m., when exposure to ex- 
ertion was low. 

Seventeen of the 23 sudden deaths that were as- 
sociated with vigorous exertion occurred during the 
exertion. Using the case–crossover method, we found 
the estimated relative risk of sudden death during ex- 
ertion (a 30-minute hazard period) to be higher (rel- 
ative risk, 44.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 26.7 
to 75.4) than that during the 60-minute hazard pe- 
riod, but it was still modified by habitual vigorous ex- 



ercise (P for trend=0.003). When the usual duration 
of vigorous exercise was estimated to be 20 minutes, 
the relative risk of sudden death in the 60-minute 
hazard period was 20.4 (95 percent confidence inter- 
val, 12.7 to 32.7); it was 14.6 (95 percent confidence 
interval, 9.10 to 23.4) when the duration was esti- 
mated to be 40 minutes. Again, modification by usual 
vigorous exercise remained significant (P«0.005). Fi- 
nally, if deaths that occurred during sleep or were 
unwitnessed were included as sudden deaths, the rel- 
ative risk of sudden death in the 60-minute hazard 
period remained elevated (relative risk, 13.8; 95 per- 
cent confidence interval, 8.9 to 21.2), and this ex- 
cess risk was still modified by the frequency of vig- 
orous exercise (P for trend=0.003) (Table 4). 
Overall Risk Associated with Vigorous Exercise 
at Base Line 
The base-line level of vigorous exercise was not sig- 
nificantly associated with the risk of subsequent sud- 
den death, either before or after potential confound- 
ers had been controlled for. In contrast, the risk of 
nonsudden death from coronary heart disease was 
lower among the men who participated in vigorous 
exercise than among those who did not. However, no 
further reduction in risk was observed for a frequen- 
cy of exercise of more than once a week (Table 5). 

In this prospective, nested case–crossover study of 
apparently healthy male physicians, the risk of sud- 
den death was transiently elevated in association with 
an episode of vigorous exertion by a factor of 14 to 
45, as compared with the risk during periods of light- 
er or no exertion. Despite the high relative risk, the

absolute excess risk of sudden death during any par- 
ticular episode of vigorous exertion was extremely low 
(1 death per 1.51 million episodes of vigorous exer- 
tion), similar to that reported in other populations.7,9,11 
As expected, the base-line level of habitual exer- 
cise significantly attenuated the increase in the risk 
of sudden death that was associated with an episode 
of vigorous exertion in both the primary analysis and 
the three sensitivity analyses. Habitually active men 
had a much lower risk of sudden death in association 
with an episode of vigorous exertion than men who 
exercised less than once a week; however, the most 
active men’s risk remained significantly elevated dur- 
ing and after vigorous exertion in all analyses. These 
results are similar to those reported for nonfatal myo- 
cardial infarction17,25 and corroborate those previous- 
ly reported in a population-based, retrospective case– 
control study of victims of cardiac arrest.11 
The effect of vigorous exertion on the sympathet- 
ic nervous system, plaque vulnerability, or both, could 
account for the findings. Acute bouts of exercise ac- 
tivate the sympathetic nervous system and decrease 
vagal activity, leading to an acute increase in suscep- 
tibility to ventricular fibrillation.26 However, habitu- 
al vigorous exertion increases basal vagal tone, re- 
sulting in increased cardiac electrical stability and in 
protection against ventricular fibrillation.27 In addi- 
tion, sympathetic surges associated with acute exer- 
tion may promote plaque rupture,10,28 and habitual 
vigorous exercise could modify this risk through fa- 
vorable effects on lipids or by decreasing the hemo- 
dynamic stress at a given workload. 
Our finding that there was no relation between the 
frequency of vigorous exercise as reported by the 
men at base line and the overall risk of sudden death 
appears to be at odds with the findings of numer- 
ous studies in which regular exercise was associated 
with reductions in the long-term risk of cardiac 
events.4-6,29-32 However, few studies have examined 
sudden death specifically and rigorously, and the re- 
sults of prospective studies have been conflicting. 
The Framingham Study found no relation between 
physical activity and sudden death during 20 years 
of follow-up.33,34 In contrast, the British Regional 
Heart Study35 and the Multiple Risk Factor Inter- 
vention Trial6 found significant reductions in the risk 
of sudden death associated with both moderate and 
vigorous exercise. 
Several factors may explain why we found no as- 
sociation between habitual exercise and the subse- 
quent risk of sudden death. First, we had no infor- 
mation about moderate levels of activity, in which 
the men in our sedentary category could have been 
participating regularly. Moderate physical activity is 
associated with a markedly reduced risk of coronary 
events32,36 and cardiac arrest,37 and therefore it might 
also protect against sudden death. Second, activity lev- 
els may have changed over the course of the study, 
and misclassification of the exposure could have con- 
tributed to the null result. Finally, the effect of vigo- 
rous exercise on the risk of sudden death may actually 
be different from its effect on other cardiovascular end 
points, such as nonsudden death (Table 5). 
Our study has several limitations. First, the meas- 
ure of physical activity that we used is limited in com- 
parison with more objective measures of physical fit-

ness, which have been shown to correlate with rates 
of cardiac events.38 Second, the base-line data on the 
frequency of vigorous exertion were not updated dur- 
ing the study. Since levels of physical activity tend to 
vary over time,39 there is likely to have been misclas- 
sification in our assessment of each person’s level of 
habitual exercise; if such errors were random, this 
factor would tend to bias our results toward a null 
finding. However, if participation in vigorous exercise 
either increased or decreased over time, then our es- 
timates of the relative risk during exertion might have 
been biased toward a positive or negative association, 
respectively. In addition, we lacked information on the 
duration of vigorous exertion. For both of these rea- 
sons, the magnitude of the relative risk associated with 
an acute episode of vigorous exertion should be viewed 
as an estimate. 
Third, the rarity of exertion-related sudden death 
limits the statistical power of the study and tends to 
produce unstable estimates of risk. However, although 
the number is still quite small, the 23 sudden deaths 
that were associated with vigorous exertion in this 
study make up one of the largest series to date. Fi- 
nally, our study and the earlier retrospective study11 
included only men, and therefore these data may not 
apply to women. 
In summary, prospective data on U.S. male physi- 
cians suggest that bouts of vigorous exertion are asso- 
ciated with a transient increase in the risk of sudden 
death and that habitual vigorous exercise diminishes 
this risk. The absolute magnitude of the increase in 
risk associated with vigorous exertion is extremely 
small, and the overall risk of sudden death was not 
increased in association with increasing frequency of 
vigorous exercise. Therefore, these data should not 
discourage participation in an exercise program. The 
benefits of a physically active lifestyle in terms of 
multiple health outcomes, including the frequency of 
all cardiovascular events, clearly outweigh the small 
risks described above. However, further research di- 
rected at the mechanisms underlying sudden death 
during vigorous exertion may lead to innovative strat- 
egies to prevent this rare but devastating event.
