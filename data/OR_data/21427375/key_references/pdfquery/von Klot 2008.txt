An individual’s long-term risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
is determined, at least in part, by ‘traditional’ chronic risk factors, 
such as lipid levels, 
long-term average blood pressure, and 
smoking habits, and ‘novel’ risk factors associated with increased 
vascular inﬂammation, such as C-reactive protein.1 However, con- 
ditional on an individual’s baseline risk, acute events may be preci- 
pitated or triggered by discrete transient exposures including 
physical, psychological, or chemical stressors.2 
It has previously been shown that AMI can be triggered by iso- 
lated bouts of vigorous physical activity.3 – 7 However, whether 
lower levels of physical exertion can also trigger AMI, and the 
exposure–response relationship, have not been examined. 
According to the Council on Clinical Cardiology, cardiovascular 
disease patients should avoid exercise in extremely hot or cold 
environments,8 but to our knowledge no previous case-crossover 
study quantiﬁed an interaction of strenuous exertion with its 
environmental circumstances. 
We conducted a case-crossover study within the Cooperative 
Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) Myocardial 
Infarction Registry in Augsburg, southern Germany, to evaluate 
whether the risk of having AMI triggered by physical exertion exhi- 
bits an exposure –response relationship and whether the risk 
varies by temperature or by whether the physical activity takes 
place indoors or outdoors.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can be precipitated or triggered by discrete transient exposures including physical 
exertion. We evaluated whether the risk of having an AMI triggered by physical exertion exhibits an exposure– 
response relationship, and whether it varies by ambient temperature or by taking place indoors or outdoors.

Methods 
We conducted a case-crossover study within the Myocardial Infarction Registry in Augsburg, Germany in 1999–2003. 
and results 
One thousand three hundred and one patients reported levels of activity and time spent outdoors on the day of AMI 
and three preceding days in an interview. The case-crossover analyses showed an association of physical exertion 
with AMI symptom onset within 2 h, which was strong for strenuous exertion (METs (cid:2) 6) [relative risk (RR) 5.7, 
95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 3.6 –9.0), and still signiﬁcant for moderate exertion (METs ¼ 5) (RR 1.6, 95% CI 
1.2 –2.1) compared to very light or no exertion. Strenuous exertion outside was associated with a four-fold larger 
RR of AMI symptom onset than exertion performed indoors, which was not explained by temperature.

Conclusion 
This study conﬁrms previous results and shows a graded exposure –response relationship between physical exertion 
intensity and triggering of AMI onset. These ﬁndings may have implications for behavioural guidance of people at risk 
of AMI.

Patient population 
Cases were drawn from the complete case series of the population 
based KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry from February 1999 to 
December 2003. Details of the recruitment procedures and data col- 
lection have been described elsewhere.9 
Brieﬂy, hospitalized 24 h survivors of AMI who were 25 – 74 years of 
age and residents of the study area were routinely entered into this 
registry. The diagnosis of AMI was based on symptoms, enzyme 
elevation, and electrocardiogram, by applying the criteria established 
within the MONICA framework.10 Interviews were conducted by 
trained research nurses on the general ward as soon as possible 
after the event (median: 9 days). All patients gave written informed 
consent for participation; the research protocol was approved by 
the KORA review board. After the patient’s discharge from hospital, 
clinical data were abstracted from the medical record according to a 
standardized protocol. The time of onset of the AMI was deﬁned as 
the time of symptom onset (typical symptoms) or the time when 
symptoms were most severe (atypical symptoms).11 
Data on symptoms in connection with the current event, as well as 
socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, and smoking status 
of the patients were collected as part of the registry’s routine inter- 
view. For this speciﬁc study, patients were additionally interviewed 
about their activities on the day of their AMI and the preceding 3 
days using a standardized data collection form (diary interview). 
Patients reported time spent outdoors, means of transportation, pre- 
monitory symptoms, times spent sleeping, and levels of activity while 
awake. Using categories based on the standard MET levels of similar 
activities (Table 1), the maximum activity level was recorded for

activities representing vigorous exertion (6 MET) or higher (Table 1). 
Physical exertion was deﬁned as moderate exertion (5 MET) or 
higher. Patients were not 
the hypothesized hazard 
informed of 
period and equal importance was given to the assessment of activity 
levels across the 4 days. 
Of the total of 2089 cases of conﬁrmed non-fatal AMI who were 
interviewed, there were 1613 cases who were able to and consented 
to participate in the diary interview. Of these, 1560 reported a discrete 
identiﬁable onset of AMI symptoms. One thousand three hundred and 
one provided information on the timing of exposures to activity levels 
and time spent outdoors for the day of AMI onset and the day before. 
Temperature data 
Hourly means of temperature in Augsburg were obtained through the 
Bavarian Air Monitoring Network. Daily midnight to midnight average 
temperatures were calculated. 
Statistical analyses 
For the analysis of triggering by physical exertion, we employed the 
case-crossover approach.6 This approach contrasts exposure in the 
hazard period to exposure in control periods within the same individ- 
ual, using standard methods for matched case – control analysis. Cases 
serve as their own controls, which eliminates potential confounding by 
time invariant factors. For each case, we compared exposure during 
the hazard period immediately preceding onset of infarction symptoms 
with the same subjects’ exposure during two control periods 24 and 
48 h earlier. We did not make any restrictions with regard to duration 
of exposure. By matching on time of day, we controlled for confound- 
ing by circadian pattern. Using conditional logistic regression models 
(in SAS 9.1.3 for Windows), we computed odds ratios as measure 
of relative risk (RR) of having an AMI during periods of exposure to 
moderate or strenuous exertion compared to the risk during 
periods of lower levels of exertion within an individual. We used a 
two-sided alpha level (type I error rate) of 5%. 
We evaluated the empirical induction period of strenuous exertion 
estimating the association of strenuous exertion with AMI onset in the 
hour of symptom onset while controlling for strenuous exertion 
during each of the six 1 h periods before. The risk of AMI symptom 
onset was elevated for a 2 h period immediately following strenuous 
exertion (while being unchanged between 2 and 4 h, and unstable 
beyond 4 h). In a model that included indicators for 5, 6, and 7 and 
higher METs in the hour of AMI and the 6 previous hours, a similar 
pattern for the induction time of moderate and strenuous exertion 
was apparent. Therefore, in all subsequent analyses, we considered a 
2 h hazard period immediately after exposure, and deﬁned the 
maximum activity level within the 2 h case and control periods as 
exposures. 
To examine the exposure– response relationship of exertion inten- 
sity and risk of onset of AMI symptoms, we introduced indicator vari- 
ables for exertion classiﬁed as 5 METs (moderate), 6 METs (vigorous), 
and 7þ METs (heavy and peak), using METs 4 and lower as reference 
group in the model. Based on the results of this model, we included 
moderate (METs 5) and strenuous ((cid:2)METs 6) exertion simultaneously 
into all subsequent models. 
To evaluate whether the effect of moderate and strenuous exertion 
varied over chronic risk factors, we estimated their effects by age, sex, 
comorbidities, medication, smoking status, and frequency of physical 
exertion during control periods (as a measure of habitual exertion). 
We used the likelihood ratio test to assess potential 
interactions 
between these risk factors and exercise intensity. 


We assessed possible interactions between moderate and strenuous 
exertion and being outdoors by including the three exposures and 
their products in the model. The control selection strategy inherent 
in the study design (control periods collected in the diary directly 
precede the case period) prevented us from estimating a main effect 
for temperature, because the control periods for an environmental 
exposure should be chosen farther from the case periods, and bidirec- 
tionally.12 Therefore, in order to examine the interaction of ambient 
temperature and exertion, we stratiﬁed matched sets into cold 
(below ﬁrst quartile), average (between ﬁrst and third quartiles), and 
the 
hot 
matched sets that were discordant with respect to temperature 
category. 


Sensitivity analyses 
We had previously13 shown that time spent in cars, on public trans- 
port, or riding bicycles was associated with onset of non-fatal AMI. 
Since biking is also a form of physical exertion, we included it as poten- 
tial confounder in a multivariate model. We also included an indicator 
for ‘getting out of bed’, since it has been associated with the onset of 
AMI symptoms.14 
We repeated the analyses excluding all 338 subjects who reported 
premonitory symptoms in the diary interview, because there may be a 
null-bias due to both confounding and control selection bias among 
patients with premonitory symptoms. 
We assessed the sensitivity of the results to matching frequency by 
varying the number of control periods to a single control 24 h before 
symptom onset, to three control periods 24, 48, and 72 h before 
symptom onset, or included all potential control periods beginning 
24 up to 72 h before symptom onset and controlled for time of day 
using indicator variables. 
Because subjects may recall and report earlier exposures with less 
ﬁdelity than more proximate exposures, we compared reported phys- 
ical exertion in the ﬁrst control period 24 h before the AMI symptom 
onset to the earlier control periods 48 and 72 h before symptom 
onset. We found that subjects were equally likely to report exposure 
in each of the control periods. 

Patients’ characteristics and activities 
Most of the 1301 cases were men, and the median age was 
61 years (Table 2). They were slightly younger, more healthy, and 
more likely to be German, and reported more often typical AMI 
onset symptoms, than the 788 interviewed cases with insufﬁcient 
diary data or no discrete identiﬁable onset. AMI symptom onset 
occurred more frequently in the morning hours than during 
other times of the day (P , 0.001). 
Figure 1A shows the timing of episodes of strenuous exertion 
and physical exertion over the 4 days prior to AMI symptoms. 
Men were more likely than women to report strenuous exertion 
during the 4 days before AMI symptom onset (20.5 vs. 8.9%, 
P , 0.001). 
Daily mean temperature ranged from 213 to 288C, with the 
cooler quartile below 48C and the warmer quartile being above 
178C.

Association of exertion and onset of acute 
myocardial infarction 
Figure 1B shows that patients reported that they engaged in mod- 
erate or strenuous exertion more frequently in the 2 h before AMI 
symptom onset than at other times. Relative to periods of rest or 
low levels of exertion, the risk of AMI onset was signiﬁcantly 
elevated for moderate, strenuous, and higher levels of exertion 


an isolated bout of physical exertion on AMI onset varied greatly 
by the frequency of physical exertion in the control days. The 
223 subjects who reported an average of more than 3 h recordings 
of physical exertion per control day did not appear to have an 
increased risk of AMI associated with moderate or strenuous exer- 
tion. On the other hand, the 196 subjects who reported infrequent 
or no exertion had 26-fold increase in AMI onset risk associated 
with strenuous exertion and a 3.5-fold increase associated with 
moderate exertion. 
The RR of AMI symptom onset was signiﬁcantly higher when 
strenuous exertion was performed outdoors compared to when 
the same level of exertion was performed indoors (P ¼ 0.008), 
while there was no interaction with moderate exertion (Figure 3). 
The effect of physical exertion was not signiﬁcantly altered by 
outdoor temperature levels (Table 3). Analyses of the interaction 
with times spent outdoors within the temperature strata showed 
no alteration in estimate for the high and average temperature 
groups, and could not be performed for the low temperature 
group because of low numbers (results not shown). 
Sensitivity analyses 
The effect of moderate and strenuous exertion remained 
unchanged when we included biking, and getting out of bed, as 
potential confounders. The estimate for strenuous exertion was 
somewhat higher when we excluded patients with premonitory 
symptoms (RR 7.6, 95% CI 4.4 –13), while the estimate remained 
unchanged for moderate exertion (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 –2.2). Our 
results were not materially altered in analyses in which we used 
one or three instead of two control periods. When using all avail- 
able control periods, the estimated RR for strenuous exertion was 
higher (RR 8.35, 95% CI 6.02, 11.60) while it remained unchanged 
for moderate exertion.

of exertion intensity and AMI symptom onset within 2 h 
afterward. 
(Figure 2), and the RR was observed to increase progressively with 
(Ptrend , 0.001). The risk of AMI 
increasing exertion level 
symptom onset was about ﬁve times higher either during or 
within 2 h of engaging in strenuous exertion than during times of 
very light or no exertion [RR 5.7, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 
3.6 –9.0] (Table 3). Even moderate exertion was associated with 
a higher risk compared to very light or no exertion (RR 1.6, 95% 
CI 1.2 –2.1). 
Table 3 shows that the effect of moderate and strenuous exer- 
tion on AMI onset was relatively constant across history of 
smoking, disease status, and reported use of common cardiovascu- 
lar medications. The effect of strenuous exertion but not of mod- 
erate exertion was stronger among older compared with younger 
subjects. Subjects with hypertension had a two-fold increase in 
AMI onset risk associated with moderate exertion, whereas in sub- 
jects without hypertension the risk was not elevated. The effect of

as the previous authors. The difference, however, may be either 
due to a real difference in the duration of the effect period in 
our population or due to misclassiﬁcation of 
the timing of 
In contrast to the study of Mittleman et al.,3 in this 
exposure. 
study, the timing of activity was ascertained based on hourly bins 
of ‘clock-time’ rather than relative to the timing of MI symptom 
onset. Thus, in the present study, exposures that occurred concur- 
rently with MI onset were recorded in the same hour, whereas 
approximately half of the exposures that occurred earlier, but 
still within 1 h of MI symptoms would have been recorded for 
the preceding hour of ‘clock time’. 
The transient risk of AMI symptom onset within 2 h appeared to 
increase signiﬁcantly with increasing intensity of physical exertion. 
Moderate exertion was associated with AMI symptom onset, par- 
ticularly in persons with hypertension or who reported infrequent 
physical activity. This result emphasizes the importance of increas- 
ing endurance very carefully when introducing a cardio protective 
training program to sedentary or hypertensive patients. 
The results of some of the subgroup analyses were not consist- 
ent and may reﬂect the smaller sample sizes within the subgroups. 
Evaluation of similar subgroup analyses in other studies will be 
required to clarify these results. 
The RR of AMI symptom onset was signiﬁcantly higher when 
strenuous exertion (but not moderate exertion) was performed 
outdoors compared to when it was performed indoors. This 
may be explained by outdoor environmental conditions which 
may play an important role as additional stressors, such as 
outside temperature. Although the results of prior studies are 
not entirely consistent, the risk of myocardial 
infarction and 
sudden cardiac death has been reported to be higher on cold 
days,22 – 24 and extremely hot days25 compared to average temp- 
eratures. Underlying mechanisms for the triggering of AMI by 
low temperature might be (i) an increase in the sympathetic 
tone with elevated heart rate and blood pressure,26,27 (ii) increased 
blood viscosity due to an increase in serum ﬁbrinogen levels, and 
(iii) increased thrombocyte aggregability.28 – 30 Temperature might, 
therefore, release the same internal triggers of AMI as strenuous 
activity and act as an effect modiﬁer. 
In the present study, the temperature stratiﬁed analyses did 
not show any difference in the risk of AMI symptom onset 
after strenuous exertion, nor did it explain the interaction of 
strenuous exertion and time spent outdoors. However, there 
were not enough extremely hot or cold days to evaluate 
whether extremes of temperature alter the risk of AMI associ- 
ated with exertion. We were not able to assess the direct 
effect of temperature on AMI simultaneously with the individual 
exposure effect, because the day to day correlation and trend 
in temperature would lead to biased estimates of association in 
our case-crossover approach.12 
Alternatively, a higher risk of strenuous exertion outdoors may 
be explained by the speciﬁc characteristics of the activities that 
were performed outdoors and that differ from exertion occurring 
indoors. Descriptive statistics showed that the outdoor strenuous 
activities in the control periods were mostly leisure time activities, 
whereas in the case periods they were more likely to be work 
related. The data available are not sufﬁciently detailed to further 
assess this hypothesis. 
Figure 3 Inﬂuence of time spent outdoors on the association 
of moderate and strenuous exertion with AMI symptom onset 
within 2 h afterward. 

In this study, we estimated that an individual’s risk of AMI 
onset was transiently increased 5.7-fold ( 95% CI 3.6 –9.0) within 
2 h of an episode of strenuous exertion and 1.6-fold (95% CI 
1.2 –2.1) within 2 h of moderate exertion compared to periods 
of rest or lower levels of exertion. Regular physical exertion was 
protective against the risk associated with moderate and strenuous 
exertion episodes. 
Interestingly, strenuous activity outside was 
associated with a four-fold larger RR of AMI symptom onset 
than exertion performed indoors. This was not observed for mod- 
erate exertion and was not explained by outdoor temperature. 
The association with strenuous exertion was stronger among 
older compared with younger subjects. We observed no clear evi- 
dence for effect modiﬁcation by medication, comorbidities, or 
smoking habits. 
Our results are consistent with prior studies that have demon- 
strated an increased risk of non-fatal AMI 
in association with 
isolated episodes of vigorous exertion.3 – 5,7,15 Proposed mechan- 
isms include abrupt changes in heart rate and blood pressure 
with subsequent haemodynamic stress and disruption of vulnerable 
atherosclerotic plaques and thrombotic occlusion of a coronary 
vessel;16 platelet activation resulting in enhanced thrombogeni- 
city;17,18 and increased oxygen demand.16 
Furthermore, our results provide further evidence that the 
effect of vigorous exertion on transient AMI risk is much greater 
among sedentary individuals than those who regularly engage in 
vigorous exertion.3 – 5,7,15 This protective effect of regular exercise 
might be due to lower heart rate and peak systolic pressure at a 
given workload,19 beneﬁcial effects on lipid proﬁle, platelet aggreg- 
ability, ﬁbrinolytic potential and arteriosclerosis,19 and mitigated 
inﬂammation20 and thereby decreased plaque vulnerability. 
While previous studies have found that the effect of vigorous 
exertion as a trigger of AMI was limited to the time of exertion 
and extended up to 30– 60 min after the activity,3,4,21 in our data 
the effect persisted up to 2 h following the episode of exertion. 
This was not explained by differences of analytic technique, since 
the 2 h effect period was conﬁrmed when using the same approach 


Strengths and limitations 
While the case-crossover method controls for ﬁxed exposures 
by design, confounding by time-varying factors may still have 
occurred. We controlled for coinciding circadian patterns of exer- 
tion and MI onset by matching on time of day in our main analyses. 
Furthermore, in a sensitivity analysis, we found that the RR of MI 
onset was similar in the morning and at other times of the day. 
This implies that the absolute increment in risk associated with 
exertion may be somewhat higher in the morning than at other 
times of the day. When we additionally adjusted for measured 
potential confounders, attenuation of the main effects did not 
occur. 
Information bias may have occurred with respect to diary data, 
since individuals’ activities were assessed retrospectively in a diary 
interview. Strenuous exertion is a rare exposure and thus relatively 
easy to remember, but memory of the case day may be clearer 
than that of previous days. However, the observed frequency of 
activities during the 4 days preceding the AMI suggested consistent 
reporting over the time. If recall bias were strong, these daily fre- 
quencies would have decreased with increasing time to event. 
Earlier work addressing the role of exertion in triggering AMIs 
included a population-based control group matched for age, sex, 
and precinct.5 The authors found comparable results for strenuous 
exertion when using the case-crossover approach and the case – 
control approach. Overall, recall bias might have lead to an over- 
estimation of the results of this study but cannot explain the 
strong associations. 


This 
results and shows a graded 
exposure – response relationship between physical exertion inten- 
sity and triggering of AMI onset. These ﬁndings may have impli- 
cations for behavioural guidance of people at risk of AMI.

A 51-year-old patient, treated for dental abscess 
3 months ago, was admitted for an acute coronary 
syndrome and fever. He had a fever of 38.58C and a 
diastolic murmur. Blood cultures were positive for 
Streptococcus anginosus. Echocardiography con- 
ﬁrmed an aortic valvular endocarditis with severe 
aortic regurgitation and highly mobile vegetations. 
Because of the vegetations, non-invasive coronary 
angiography using ECG-gated 64-multislice com- 
puted tomography (MSCT) was performed 
instead of conventional angiography. MSCT 
demonstrated two mobile vegetations with a 
length of 5 mm on the left aortic cusp and 
12 mm on the right aortic cusp with systolic pro- 
trusion in the aortic root near the coronary 
artery ostia (Panels A and B). MSCT revealed 
also signiﬁcant lesions on the three major coronary 
arteries and an intraluminal non-calciﬁed soft 
tissue in the proximal 
left anterior descending 
artery (LAD) (Panel C). The patient was referred 
for surgery without complementary invasive cor- 
onary angiography. A triple coronary artery 
bypass grafting and an aortic replacement with a 
Hall Kaster prosthesis were performed. Vegetations were conﬁrmed by the surgeon. Five days later, a second MSCT was performed 
because of increased troponin levels. The three patent coronary artery bypass graft were visualized. Contrary to the previous MSCT, the 
proximal LAD was founded nearly normal without unusual intraluminal soft tissue visualized previously (Panel D). We thought that intracor- 
onary septic embolism was the ﬁrst possible mechanism in view of the association of mobile vegetations near the coronary artery ostia, and 
intracoronary soft tissue with similar attenuation value of 47 + 35 HU which disappear in a few days. Several papers have reported the 
usefulness of MSCT in case of aortic endocarditis, but MSCT evidence of coronary embolism was not reported before. 
Panels A and B. ECG-gated MSCT after intravenous contrast injection reveal a mobile vegetation on the left coronary cusp (broken 
arrow) and a larger vegetation on the right coronary cusp (arrow). Coronal multiplanar reconstruction in systole (Panel A) with 
corresponding virtual angioscopy (Panel B). 
Panels C and D. ECG-gated MSCT before surgery. Curved multiplanar reconstruction of the proximal left anterior descending 
(LAD) artery. Arrow head: unusual non-calciﬁed tissue in the lumen of the proximal LAD (Panel C), but not present 6 days after 
surgery (Panel D), corresponding to the intracoronary embolism.
