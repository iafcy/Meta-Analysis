Objective.\p=m-\Todetermine the relative risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) 
triggered by sexual activity among the general population and in patients with prior 
coronary heart disease. 
Design.\p=m-\Relativerisks and effect modification were calculated by the case\x=req-\ 
crossover method, a new epidemiologic technique designed to quantify the 
transient change in risk following exposure to a potential disease trigger. 
Setting/Participants.\p=m-\Atotal of 1774 patients with MI were interviewed in 45 
hospitals throughout the United States. Data were gathered on potential triggers of 
MI occurring immediately prior to the event and during the previous year. Results 
are presented for the 858 patients who were sexually active in the year prior to the 
Ml, with attention to the 273 patients who had coronary artery disease prior to their 
index Ml, and the effect of regular exertion on risk. 

Results.\p=m-\Ofthe 858 patients, 79 (9%) reported sexual activity in the 24 hours 
preceding Ml, and 27 (3%) reported sexual activity in the 2 hours preceding onset 
of symptoms of MI. The relative risk of MI occurring in the 2 hours after sexual ac- 
tivity was 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.7). The relative risk of triggering 
onset of Ml among patients with a history of prior angina (2.1 [95% CI, 0.8-5.8]) or 
prior Ml (2.9 [95% CI, 1.3-6.5) was not greater than that observed in those without 
prior cardiac disease. Sexual activity was a likely contributor to the onset of Ml 
in 
only 0.9% of cases and regular exertion was associated with decreasing risk. 
Conclusions.\p=m-\Sexualactivity can trigger the onset of MI. However, the relative 
risk is low, and since the absolute hourly risk of MI is extremely low, the absolute 
risk increase caused by sexual activity also is extremely low (1 chance in a million 
for a healthy individual). Moreover, the relative risk is not increased in patients with 
a prior history of cardiac disease and regular exercise appears to prevent trigger- 
ing. These findings should be useful for counseling patients and decreasing the fear 
of sexual activity that often prevents complete rehabilitation from cardiovascular 
disease.

ANECDOTAL case reports suggest that 
sexual activity can trigger myocardial in¬ 
farction (MI),1-3 but the relative risk of MI 
the frequency of 
after sexual activity, 
sexually triggered Mis, and possible meth¬ 
ods of reducing risk have not been stud¬ 
ied. The lack of data on the cardiac risk of 
sexual activity causes a major problem 
for patients who have cardiac disease, their 
spouses, and the health care professionals 
who provide counsel on this topic.4,6 
Development of the field of study of 
triggering of cardiovascular disease has 
provided data and a new epidemiologie 
technique to address these issues.6-10 
Over the past 6 years, members of the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti¬ 
tute-funded Myocardial Infarction On¬ 
set Study interviewed more than 1700 
patients approximately 1 week follow¬ 
ing MI to identify possible triggers, in¬ 
cluding sexual activity. Prior reports 
from this study have quantitated trig¬ 
gering of MI by heavy physical exer¬ 
tion10 and anger,7 and have demonstrated 
that regular physical exertion protects 
against triggering by heavy physical ex¬ 
ertion.10 

The data on sexual activity as a trig¬ 
ger of MI from the Onset Study provide 
information on risk in the subset of pa¬ 
tients known to have coronary artery 
disease prior to the MI for which they 
were interviewed. 
METHODS 
Study Population 
The Onset Study was conducted in 22 
community hospitals and 23 tertiary care 
centers.10 Between August 1989 and 
March 1993, a total of 1774 patients (1236 
men and 538 women, aged 20-92 years) 
were interviewed a median of 4 days 
(range, 0-30 days) following their Mis. 
Interviewers identified eligible pa¬ 
tients by reviewing coronary care unit 
admission logs and patient charts. For 
inclusion, patients were required to meet 
all of the following criteria: an elevated 
creatine kinase level, with positive MB 
isoenzymes; identifiable onset of pain or 
other typical symptoms of MI onset; and 
ability to complete a structured inter- 

view. The protocol was approved by the 
institutional review board at each par¬ 
ticipating center, and informed consent 
was obtained from each patient. 
Interview 
Interviewers were trained by personal 
instruction, a training manual, and an 
instructional videocassette and through 
ongoing feedback from the study coor¬ 
dinator. Approximately one third of the 
interviews were audiotaped for ran¬ 
domly selected quality control checks of 
the coding accuracy. 
The interview identified the time, 
place, and quality ofpain and other symp¬ 
toms of MI and the timing and intensity 
of exposure to potential triggers of MI 
onset. To control for possible confound¬ 
ing due to the co-occurrence of outbursts 
of anger, we classified patients as either 
exposed or not exposed to outbursts of 
anger during the hazard and control pe¬ 
riod, using the onset of anger scale.7 
Sexual intercourse was the activity stud¬ 
ied, and patients were asked the follow¬ 
ing sequence of questions: "When was 
the last time before your heart attack 
that you had sexual intercourse?" Sub¬ 
jects reporting sexual intercourse in the 
preceding 12 months were then asked 
the time of the second occurrence of 
sexual intercourse prior to the MI and 
"On average, over the past year how 
often did you have sexual intercourse?" 
In addition, patients who reported sexual 
intercourse within 26 hours of the onset 
of MI symptoms were asked whether or 
not they had engaged in sexual 
inter¬ 
course during any of the 26 hours before 
their symptoms began. To assess whether 
regular physical exertion could alter the 
risk that sexual activity might trigger an 
MI, we collected data on the usual fre¬ 
quency of heavy exertion as previously 
described.10·11 For the present study, a 
cut point of 6 METs (metabolic equiva¬ 
lents of oxygen consumption) was selected 
prospectively because regular exertion 
at this level has been shown to reduce the 
risk of triggering MI by isolated bouts of 
heavy exertion.10 
Study Design 
A new epidemiologie technique, called 
the case-crossover design (Figure 1), was 
developed for the Onset Study.810 This 
approach was developed to assess the 
change in risk of an acute event during 
a brief "hazard period" following expo¬ 
sure to a potential trigger. With this 
method, control information for each pa¬ 
tient is based on his or her past expo¬ 
sure experience.810 
A 2-hour hazard period immediately 
preceding MI onset was compared with 
2 types of control data obtained from 
the patients: their usual frequency of 
sexual activity during the past year and 
their actual sexual activity in the com¬ 
parable 2-hour "control period" at the 
same time on the day before the MI. To 
help maintain comparability of report¬ 
ing of exposures for the hazard and con¬ 
trol periods, the interview treated the 
26-hour period before MI onset as 1 long 
hazard period. 
Statistical Analysis 
The analysis of case-crossover data is 
a new application of standard methods 
for stratified data analysis.8·9·12,13 In this 
analysis, the stratifying variable is the 
individual patient, as in a crossover ex¬ 
periment. 
The ratio of the observed frequency 
of sexual activity in the hazard period to 
the expected frequency (from the con¬ 
trol information) was used to calculate 
estimates of the odds ratio as a measure 
of relative risk.8·9 The primary method 
of analysis was to determine expected 
frequencies on the basis of usual annual 
frequency ofsexual activity. The amount 
of person-time exposed to sexual activ¬ 
ity was estimated by multiplying the 
reported usual annual frequency of ex¬ 
posure by the duration of the hypoth¬ 
esized hazard period. Unexposed person- 
time was then calculated by subtracting 
the exposed person-time in hours from 
the number of hours in a year. Hazard 
periods of varying durations were ana¬ 
lyzed using methods for cohort studies 
with sparse data in each stratum.8·9·14 
As a secondary method of analysis, 
the expected frequency in the hazard 
period was determined based on the fre¬ 
quency of sexual activity in the control 
period on the day prior to onset. By 
matching on time of day, potential con¬ 
founding by clock time due to the cir- 
cadian variation in MI incidence and the 
timing of sexual activity throughout the 
day was controlled for in this analysis.9 
Relative risks were computed using 
standard methods for matched-pair case- 
control studies. However, instead of con¬ 
cordant and discordant pairs ofsubjects, 
each patient contributed a pair of inter¬ 
vals, ie, a hazard and a control period, 
which were either concordant or discor¬ 
dant for sexual activity.8"10·12 Ninety-five 
percent confidence intervals (CIs) and 
2-sided values were computed using 
exact methods based on the binomial 
distribution.12 Conditional 
logistic re¬ 
gression was used to control for within- 
person confounding.8·9 
Modification of the relative risk was 
assessed by comparing relative risks in 
subgroups, defined by different levels 
of the potential effect modifier. The pa¬ 
tients were divided into 3 age groups 
chosen a priori on the basis ofprior pub¬ 
lications from the Onset Study,7·10 and

Figure 1.—The case-crossover study design. The 
2-hour period prior to myocardial 
infarction (Ml) is 
defined as the hazard period. Comparison 1 con¬

period with the frequency of exposure expected

Heart Association. 
the relative risk within each group was 
estimated. Differences in the relative 
risks between subgroups were compared 
using the 2 test for homogeneity.12 To 
estimate induction time (the length of 
time from sexual activity to the onset of 
MI), we calculated relative risks for each 
1-hour period before MI onset, statisti¬ 
cally controlling for possible exposure 
to subsequent episodes of sexual inter¬ 
course.15 

The characteristics of the patients in¬ 
terviewed are presented in Table 1. Of 
the 1774 patients with MI who were 
interviewed, 141 (8%) chose not to an¬ 
swer the questions regarding sexual ac¬ 
tivity. Of the remaining 1633 patients, 
858 (48%) reported that they were sexu¬ 
ally active in the year preceding MI. 
Included in the group of 1633 patients 
were 643 patients who had a history of 
a prior MI or angina; of these patients, 
273 (42%) were sexually active. 
Because subjects who were not sexu¬ 
ally active did not contribute informa¬ 
tion to the assessment of the relative 
risk of triggering MI onset, all analyses 
of risk are based on the data from the 
858 sexually active patients. Table 2 
shows the distribution of the usual fre¬ 
quency of sexual activity among these 
patients. Of these patients, 79 (9%) re¬ 
ported sexual activity in the 24 hours 
preceding MI, and 27 (3%) reported 
sexual activity in the 2-hour period pre¬ 
ceding symptom onset.

Figure 2 shows the induction time, ie, 
the time from sexual activity to the onset 
of MI, with relative risks for each 1-hour 
period before MI onset, controlling for 
subsequent exposure. The relative risk 
was increased only during the first 2 hours 
after sexual activity, indicating that the 
induction time was less than 2 hours. The 
risk that an MI would begin in the 2-hour 
period immediately following sexual ac¬ 
tivity was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.7-3.7). 
In an analysis using the frequency of 
sexual activity during the equivalent 
2-hour period on the day prior to onset 
as the control information, 27 patients 
had engaged in sexual activity only in 
the 2-hour hazard period, compared with 
8 in the control period (the same 2-hour 
period the day before). None had en¬ 
gaged in sexual activity at both times. 
This analysis yielded a relative risk for 
MI of 3.4 (95% CI, 1.5-8.6). 
Only 2 patients reported both heavy 
exertion of at least 6 METs and an epi¬ 
sode of sexual intercourse during the haz¬ 
ard period. No patients reported expo¬ 
sure to both in the control period. No 
patients reported exposure to both sexual 
activity and outbursts ofanger as assessed 
by the onset of anger scale7 in either the 
hazard or the control period. The relative 
risk associated with sexual activity was 
not materially altered in a conditional lo¬ 
gistic regression analysis that simulta¬ 
neously controlled for exposure to heavy 
physical exertion of at least 6 METs and 
outbursts of anger. 
Potential modifiers of the relative risk 
were examined (Table 3) and a statisti- 
cally significant protective effect of regu¬ 
lar exercise was observed (Figure 3). The 
relative risks of MI onset in the 2 hours 
following sexual activity decreased from 
3.0 to 1.9 to 1.2 for patients who engaged 
in heavy physical exertion (>6 METs) 
once or not at all, twice, and 3 or more 
times per week, respectively (PimKj=.01). 
Among patients with a prior MI, the 
relative risk was 2.9, (95% CI, 1.3-6.5), 
which was similar to that among sub¬ 
jects without such a history (2.5 [95% 
CI, 1.6-3.8]; P=.75). Among patients with 
a history of angina, the relative risk of 
sexual activity triggering MI was 2.1 
(95% CI, 0.8-5.8), and was similar to the 
risk observed among those without an¬ 
gina (2.6 [95% CI, 1.7-3.9]). There were 
too few women who reported sexual ac¬ 
tivity in the 2-hour hazard period pre¬ 
ceding MI to determine if the relative 
risk varied by sex. 
COMMENT 
These findings from the Myocardial 
Infarction Onset Study confirm the im¬ 
pression, based on anecdotal reports,1"3 
that sexual activity can trigger ML The 
relative risk of an MI occurring in the 2 
hours following sexual activity was 2.5 
(95% CI, 1.7-3.7) in patients without prior 
cardiac disease and 2.9 (95% CI, 1.3-6.5) 
in those with a history of prior MI. The 
findings indicate that regular exercise 
can reduce, and possibly eliminate, the 
small and transient increased risk of MI 
associated with sexual activity. 
Additional studies are required to more 
precisely quantify the low risk that ap-

pears to be present. However, the va¬ 
lidity of the main conclusion of the study, 
that the absolute risk of sexual activity 
triggering MI is low, even in patients 
with prior coronary disease, is not threat¬ 
ened by low levels of relative risk. Only 
27 (1.5%) ofthe 1774 patients interviewed 
in the Onset Study reported sexual ac¬ 
tivity in the 2 hours prior to MI. Thus, 
after correction for chance occurrence, 
sexual activity was a likely contributor 
to the onset of MI in only approximately 
0.9% of cases in this study. 
None of the 88 sexually active indi¬ 
viduals aged 70 years or older experi¬ 
enced an occurrence of MI in the 2 hours 
after intercourse. This may be due to 
the relatively small numbers of individu¬ 
als in this age group and their lower 
frequency of sexual activity. On the other 
hand, the risk could actually be lower 
among these patients because of the al¬ 
tered ß-adrenergic sensitivity of the el¬ 
derly.16 
Since the case-crossover design uses 
self-matching for control 
information, 
there is no variability in traditional chronic 
risk factors8"10 for MI within each stra¬ 
tum. Thus, the case-crossover method 
eKminates the possibility of confounding

by these chronic underlying cardiac risk 
factors. However, the method is suscep¬ 
tible to confounding by potential triggers 
that vary over time in each individual 
(eg, morning hours, heavy exertion, an¬ 
ger). An analysis that took into account 
these other well-documented triggers of 
MI onset did not materially alter the re¬ 
sults, indicating that sexual activity can 
trigger the onset of MI independently of 
these other triggers.7 
The present study provides informa¬ 
tion of great value for counseling the 
more than 500 000 patients in the United 
States who survive MI each year and 
the 11 million patients with existing car¬ 
diac disease.17 Prior to the availability of 
these data, there was no published in¬ 
formation on the risk of sexual activity 
in patients with cardiac disease. Coun¬ 
seling, which was often ineffective in 
decreasing fear of triggering a cardiac 
event, was based on the presumed 
"physiological equivalence" ofsexual ac¬ 
tivity and climbing stairs.18 
With these data, health care profes¬ 
sionals counseling patients with cardiac 
disease can reassure them that, although 
their baseline risk of MI is increased, 
sexual activity has been documented to 
have a low likelihood of triggering an 
MI. The risk is particularly low for pa¬ 
tients who engage in regular exercise, 
which has been shown to decrease the 
cardiac work required during sexual ac¬ 
tivity19 and also decrease the risk oftrig¬ 
gering onset of MI. 

information for 
counseling is not the relative risk of a 
potential trigger, but the absolute risk 
difference the activity produces. While 
the Onset Study findings can be used to 
calculate relative risk, they alone are 
not sufficient to determine absolute risk 
because the baseline risk of these pa¬ 
tients, all of whom experienced an MI, 
is not measured. However, data on base¬ 
line risk from previously studied popu¬ 
lations, similar to that from which the 
Onset Study patients originated, can be 
combined with relative risks from the 
Onset Study to estimate absolute risks. 
Data from the Framingham Heart 
Study indicate that the baseline risk that 
a 50-year-old, nonsmoking, nondiabetic 
man will experience an MI is approxi¬ 
mately 1% per year, or approximately 1 
chance in a million per hour.20·21 Since 
the relative risk of MI is approximately 
doubled by sexual activity, by engaging 
in sexual activity such an individual 
would only increase his hourly risk to 2 
Figure 3.—Modification by regular exertion of the

farction (Ml). Error bars indicate 95% confidence 
intervals. The dotted line represents the baseline 
risk. METs indicates metabolic equivalents of oxy¬ 
gen consumption. 
in a million, and only for a 2-hour period. 
The baseline yearly risk of reinfarc- 
tion or death for an individual with a 
prior MI is approximately 10%, and less 
than 3% if the individual can exercise 
beyond 7 METs without symptoms on 
an exercise test.22 For individuals in the 
10% annual risk group, sexual activity 
would transiently double the risk from 
10 in a million per hour to only 20 in a 
million per hour. 
Although sexual activity doubles the 
risk of MI, the effect of sexual activity 
on annual risk is negligible because the 
absolute risk difference is small, the risk 
is transient, and the activity is relatively 
infrequent. For example, for the indi¬ 
vidual free of cardiac disease described 
herein, weekly sexual activity would only 
increase his annual risk of MI from 1% 
to 1.01%. Other potential triggers of MI 
such as heavy exertion and episodes of 
anger may cause a greater increase in 
annual risk because of their more fre¬ 
quent occurrence. 
The present study has several poten¬ 
tial limitations. No data were collected 
on risk during sexual intercourse with 
the patient's usual partner vs another 
partner, or the risk of different sexual 
activities and positions. In addition, be¬ 
cause the data are based on self-report 
by patients, misclassification of expo¬ 
sure may occur. For example, patients 
may be reluctant to report that sexual 
activity occurred prior to their MI. The 
effect of such a bias would be to reduce 
the magnitude of the estimated relative 
risk. In an effort to minimize such re¬ 
porting bias, as well as to maintain pa¬ 
tient confidentiality, efforts were made 
to ensure the patient's privacy during 
the interview. Furthermore, to obtain 

comparable reporting of sexual activity 
for all of the hourly intervals during the 
26 hours preceding the MI, patients were 
not informed of the duration of the hy¬ 
pothesized hazard period. 
Another limitation of this study is the 
potential bias created by the lack of data 
on the possibility that sexual activity 
might be more likely to cause sudden 
death than nonfatal MI. If this were the 
case, the risk of sexual activity trigger¬ 
ing nonfatal MI would be underesti¬ 
mated. In addition, reassurance of pa¬ 
tients requires consideration of 
the 
possibility that sexual activity could trig¬ 
ger either sudden death or nonfatal MI. 
However, for the following reasons, we 
do not believe this potential bias threat¬ 
ens the overall conclusion of the study. 
First, the baseline risk of sudden death 
is much lower than the baseline risk of 
nonfatal MI. Summary data for the 
United States indicate that there are 
1.2 million Mis per year that do not 
cause sudden cardiac death vs approxi¬ 
mately 300000 sudden cardiac deaths, 
indicating that MI not associated with 
sudden death is 4 times more likely than 
sudden cardiac death.17 Second, data for 
the related trigger of heavy exertion do 
not indicate a selective triggering of sud¬ 
den cardiac death over nonfatal MI. The 
increase in risk of nonfatal MI caused by

heavy exertion is similar to the increase 
in risk of sudden death caused by ex¬ 
ertion.10 Third, there are no data sug¬ 
gesting that sexual activity is more likely 
to trigger sudden cardiac death than 
MI. On the contrary, the limited data 
available suggest that sudden cardiac 
death following intercourse is not fre¬ 
quent; in a series of more than 5000 
sudden death cases, less than 0.6% oc¬ 
curred after intercourse.3 Finally, the 
effect of such a bias, if it exists, on the 
overall conclusion of the study is mini¬ 
mal. Even if the absolute risk estimates 
were low by a factor of 10, the total risk 
difference associated with sexual activ¬ 
ity would be quite small. 
Because of the small number of ex¬ 
posed cases and the relatively large 
number of potential modifiers of inter¬ 
est, there were insufficient data to de¬ 
finitively evaluate possible effect modi¬ 
fication by these and other potential 
modifiers. Additional studies are re¬ 
quired to confirm these results. How¬ 
ever, the apparent dose-response effect 
of exercise and the finding in our prior 
study that regular exercise markedly 
reduces the risk of triggering onset of 
MI by heavy exertion suggest that the 
relative protection offered by regular 
exercise is a real effect.

in risk of MI onset following sexual in¬ 
tercourse is altered by these factors is 
of importance for understanding the 
pathophysiology of MI onset. However, 
it has only limited significance for indi¬ 
vidual behavior, because the absolute 
risk produced by the infrequent poten¬ 
tial trigger of sexual activity is too small 
to be of practical significance. 
Based on these data, physicians should 
strongly encourage patients with known 
coronary artery disease to participate 
in a cardiac rehabilitation program and 
perform regular physical exercise. Such 
exercise can decrease the cardiac work 
required for sexual activity and reduce 
the risk of triggering onset of MI. By 
communicating the data on absolute risk, 
it should be possible to improve reha¬ 
bilitation ofpatients following MI and to 
decrease the sexual dysfunction cur¬ 
rently caused by unrealistic fears of re¬ 
sumption of sexual activity.23
