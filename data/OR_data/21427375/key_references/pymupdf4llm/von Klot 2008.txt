## Introduction

An individual’s long-term risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
is determined, at least in part, by ‘traditional’ chronic risk factors,
such as lipid levels, long-term average blood pressure, and
smoking habits, and ‘novel’ risk factors associated with increased
vascular inflammation, such as C-reactive protein.[1] However, conditional on an individual’s baseline risk, acute events may be precipitated or triggered by discrete transient exposures including
physical, psychological, or chemical stressors.[2]

It has previously been shown that AMI can be triggered by isolated bouts of vigorous physical activity.[3–7] However, whether
lower levels of physical exertion can also trigger AMI, and the


exposure–response relationship, have not been examined.
According to the Council on Clinical Cardiology, cardiovascular
disease patients should avoid exercise in extremely hot or cold
environments,[8] but to our knowledge no previous case-crossover
study quantified an interaction of strenuous exertion with its
environmental circumstances.
We conducted a case-crossover study within the Cooperative
Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) Myocardial
Infarction Registry in Augsburg, southern Germany, to evaluate
whether the risk of having AMI triggered by physical exertion exhibits an exposure–response relationship and whether the risk
varies by temperature or by whether the physical activity takes
place indoors or outdoors.

## Methods

###### Patient population


Cases were drawn from the complete case series of the population
based KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry from February 1999 to
December 2003. Details of the recruitment procedures and data collection have been described elsewhere.[9]

Briefly, hospitalized 24 h survivors of AMI who were 25–74 years of
age and residents of the study area were routinely entered into this
registry. The diagnosis of AMI was based on symptoms, enzyme
elevation, and electrocardiogram, by applying the criteria established
within the MONICA framework.[10] Interviews were conducted by
trained research nurses on the general ward as soon as possible
after the event (median: 9 days). All patients gave written informed
consent for participation; the research protocol was approved by
the KORA review board. After the patient’s discharge from hospital,
clinical data were abstracted from the medical record according to a
standardized protocol. The time of onset of the AMI was defined as
the time of symptom onset (typical symptoms) or the time when
symptoms were most severe (atypical symptoms).[11]

Data on symptoms in connection with the current event, as well as
socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, and smoking status
of the patients were collected as part of the registry’s routine interview. For this specific study, patients were additionally interviewed
about their activities on the day of their AMI and the preceding 3
days using a standardized data collection form (diary interview).
Patients reported time spent outdoors, means of transportation, premonitory symptoms, times spent sleeping, and levels of activity while
awake. Using categories based on the standard MET levels of similar
activities (Table 1), the maximum activity level was recorded for


each hour of the day. Strenuous exertion was defined as self-reported
activities representing vigorous exertion (6 MET) or higher (Table 1).
Physical exertion was defined as moderate exertion (5 MET) or
higher. Patients were not informed of the hypothesized hazard
period and equal importance was given to the assessment of activity
levels across the 4 days.
Of the total of 2089 cases of confirmed non-fatal AMI who were
interviewed, there were 1613 cases who were able to and consented
to participate in the diary interview. Of these, 1560 reported a discrete
identifiable onset of AMI symptoms. One thousand three hundred and
one provided information on the timing of exposures to activity levels
and time spent outdoors for the day of AMI onset and the day before.

###### Temperature data


For the analysis of triggering by physical exertion, we employed the
case-crossover approach.[6] This approach contrasts exposure in the
hazard period to exposure in control periods within the same individual, using standard methods for matched case–control analysis. Cases
serve as their own controls, which eliminates potential confounding by
time invariant factors. For each case, we compared exposure during
the hazard period immediately preceding onset of infarction symptoms
with the same subjects’ exposure during two control periods 24 and
48 h earlier. We did not make any restrictions with regard to duration
of exposure. By matching on time of day, we controlled for confounding by circadian pattern. Using conditional logistic regression models
(in SAS 9.1.3 for Windows), we computed odds ratios as measure
of relative risk (RR) of having an AMI during periods of exposure to
moderate or strenuous exertion compared to the risk during
periods of lower levels of exertion within an individual. We used a
two-sided alpha level (type I error rate) of 5%.
We evaluated the empirical induction period of strenuous exertion
estimating the association of strenuous exertion with AMI onset in the
hour of symptom onset while controlling for strenuous exertion
during each of the six 1 h periods before. The risk of AMI symptom
onset was elevated for a 2 h period immediately following strenuous
exertion (while being unchanged between 2 and 4 h, and unstable
beyond 4 h). In a model that included indicators for 5, 6, and 7 and
higher METs in the hour of AMI and the 6 previous hours, a similar
pattern for the induction time of moderate and strenuous exertion
was apparent. Therefore, in all subsequent analyses, we considered a
2 h hazard period immediately after exposure, and defined the
maximum activity level within the 2 h case and control periods as
exposures.
To examine the exposure–response relationship of exertion intensity and risk of onset of AMI symptoms, we introduced indicator variables for exertion classified as 5 METs (moderate), 6 METs (vigorous),
and 7þ METs (heavy and peak), using METs 4 and lower as reference
group in the model. Based on the results of this model, we included
moderate (METs 5) and strenuous (�METs 6) exertion simultaneously
into all subsequent models.
To evaluate whether the effect of moderate and strenuous exertion
varied over chronic risk factors, we estimated their effects by age, sex,
comorbidities, medication, smoking status, and frequency of physical
exertion during control periods (as a measure of habitual exertion).
We used the likelihood ratio test to assess potential interactions
between these risk factors and exercise intensity.


Hourly means of temperature in Augsburg were obtained through the
Bavarian Air Monitoring Network. Daily midnight to midnight average
temperatures were calculated.

Intensity of physical exertion and triggering of myocardial infarction 1883

We assessed possible interactions between moderate and strenuous
exertion and being outdoors by including the three exposures and Table 2 Individual characteristics and temperature
their products in the model. The control selection strategy inherent exposure of acute myocardial infarction survivors
in the study design (control periods collected in the diary directly recruited from the Augsburg Coronary Event Registry
precede the case period) prevented us from estimating a main effect between February 1999 and December 2003

###### Sensitivity analyses

We had previously[13] shown that time spent in cars, on public transport, or riding bicycles was associated with onset of non-fatal AMI.
Since biking is also a form of physical exertion, we included it as potential confounder in a multivariate model. We also included an indicator
for ‘getting out of bed’, since it has been associated with the onset of
AMI symptoms.[14]

We repeated the analyses excluding all 338 subjects who reported
premonitory symptoms in the diary interview, because there may be a
null-bias due to both confounding and control selection bias among
patients with premonitory symptoms.
We assessed the sensitivity of the results to matching frequency by
varying the number of control periods to a single control 24 h before
symptom onset, to three control periods 24, 48, and 72 h before
symptom onset, or included all potential control periods beginning
24 up to 72 h before symptom onset and controlled for time of day
using indicator variables.
Because subjects may recall and report earlier exposures with less
fidelity than more proximate exposures, we compared reported physical exertion in the first control period 24 h before the AMI symptom
onset to the earlier control periods 48 and 72 h before symptom
onset. We found that subjects were equally likely to report exposure
in each of the control periods.

## Results


##### Patients’ characteristics and activities

Most of the 1301 cases were men, and the median age was
61 years (Table 2). They were slightly younger, more healthy, and
more likely to be German, and reported more often typical AMI
onset symptoms, than the 788 interviewed cases with insufficient
diary data or no discrete identifiable onset. AMI symptom onset
occurred more frequently in the morning hours than during
other times of the day (P, 0.001).
Figure 1A shows the timing of episodes of strenuous exertion
and physical exertion over the 4 days prior to AMI symptoms.
Men were more likely than women to report strenuous exertion
during the 4 days before AMI symptom onset (20.5 vs. 8.9%,
P, 0.001).
Daily mean temperature ranged from 213 to 288C, with the
cooler quartile below 48C and the warmer quartile being above
178C.

##### Association of exertion and onset of acute myocardial infarction

Figure 1B shows that patients reported that they engaged in moderate or strenuous exertion more frequently in the 2 h before AMI
symptom onset than at other times. Relative to periods of rest or
low levels of exertion, the risk of AMI onset was significantly
elevated for moderate, strenuous, and higher levels of exertion

(Figure 2), and the RR was observed to increase progressively with
increasing exertion level (Ptrend, 0.001). The risk of AMI
symptom onset was about five times higher either during or
within 2 h of engaging in strenuous exertion than during times of
very light or no exertion [RR 5.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)
3.6–9.0] (Table 3). Even moderate exertion was associated with
a higher risk compared to very light or no exertion (RR 1.6, 95%
CI 1.2–2.1).
Table 3 shows that the effect of moderate and strenuous exertion on AMI onset was relatively constant across history of
smoking, disease status, and reported use of common cardiovascular medications. The effect of strenuous exertion but not of moderate exertion was stronger among older compared with younger
subjects. Subjects with hypertension had a two-fold increase in
AMI onset risk associated with moderate exertion, whereas in subjects without hypertension the risk was not elevated. The effect of


an isolated bout of physical exertion on AMI onset varied greatly
by the frequency of physical exertion in the control days. The
223 subjects who reported an average of more than 3 h recordings
of physical exertion per control day did not appear to have an
increased risk of AMI associated with moderate or strenuous exertion. On the other hand, the 196 subjects who reported infrequent
or no exertion had 26-fold increase in AMI onset risk associated
with strenuous exertion and a 3.5-fold increase associated with
moderate exertion.
The RR of AMI symptom onset was significantly higher when
strenuous exertion was performed outdoors compared to when
the same level of exertion was performed indoors (P ¼ 0.008),
while there was no interaction with moderate exertion (Figure 3).
The effect of physical exertion was not significantly altered by
outdoor temperature levels (Table 3). Analyses of the interaction
with times spent outdoors within the temperature strata showed
no alteration in estimate for the high and average temperature
groups, and could not be performed for the low temperature
group because of low numbers (results not shown).

##### Sensitivity analyses


The effect of moderate and strenuous exertion remained
unchanged when we included biking, and getting out of bed, as
potential confounders. The estimate for strenuous exertion was
somewhat higher when we excluded patients with premonitory
symptoms (RR 7.6, 95% CI 4.4–13), while the estimate remained
unchanged for moderate exertion (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.2). Our
results were not materially altered in analyses in which we used
one or three instead of two control periods. When using all available control periods, the estimated RR for strenuous exertion was
higher (RR 8.35, 95% CI 6.02, 11.60) while it remained unchanged
for moderate exertion.

## Discussion

In this study, we estimated that an individual’s risk of AMI
onset was transiently increased 5.7-fold ( 95% CI 3.6–9.0) within
2 h of an episode of strenuous exertion and 1.6-fold (95% CI
1.2–2.1) within 2 h of moderate exertion compared to periods
of rest or lower levels of exertion. Regular physical exertion was
protective against the risk associated with moderate and strenuous
exertion episodes. Interestingly, strenuous activity outside was
associated with a four-fold larger RR of AMI symptom onset
than exertion performed indoors. This was not observed for moderate exertion and was not explained by outdoor temperature.
The association with strenuous exertion was stronger among
older compared with younger subjects. We observed no clear evidence for effect modification by medication, comorbidities, or
smoking habits.
Our results are consistent with prior studies that have demonstrated an increased risk of non-fatal AMI in association with
isolated episodes of vigorous exertion.[3–5,7,15] Proposed mechanisms include abrupt changes in heart rate and blood pressure
with subsequent haemodynamic stress and disruption of vulnerable
atherosclerotic plaques and thrombotic occlusion of a coronary
vessel;[16] platelet activation resulting in enhanced thrombogenicity;[17,18] and increased oxygen demand.[16]

Furthermore, our results provide further evidence that the
effect of vigorous exertion on transient AMI risk is much greater
among sedentary individuals than those who regularly engage in
vigorous exertion.[3–5,7,15] This protective effect of regular exercise
might be due to lower heart rate and peak systolic pressure at a
given workload,[19] beneficial effects on lipid profile, platelet aggregability, fibrinolytic potential and arteriosclerosis,[19] and mitigated
inflammation[20] and thereby decreased plaque vulnerability.
While previous studies have found that the effect of vigorous
exertion as a trigger of AMI was limited to the time of exertion
and extended up to 30–60 min after the activity,[3,4,21] in our data
the effect persisted up to 2 h following the episode of exertion.
This was not explained by differences of analytic technique, since
the 2 h effect period was confirmed when using the same approach


as the previous authors. The difference, however, may be either
due to a real difference in the duration of the effect period in
our population or due to misclassification of the timing of
exposure. In contrast to the study of Mittleman et al.,[3] in this
study, the timing of activity was ascertained based on hourly bins
of ‘clock-time’ rather than relative to the timing of MI symptom
onset. Thus, in the present study, exposures that occurred concurrently with MI onset were recorded in the same hour, whereas
approximately half of the exposures that occurred earlier, but
still within 1 h of MI symptoms would have been recorded for
the preceding hour of ‘clock time’.
The transient risk of AMI symptom onset within 2 h appeared to
increase significantly with increasing intensity of physical exertion.
Moderate exertion was associated with AMI symptom onset, particularly in persons with hypertension or who reported infrequent
physical activity. This result emphasizes the importance of increasing endurance very carefully when introducing a cardio protective
training program to sedentary or hypertensive patients.
The results of some of the subgroup analyses were not consistent and may reflect the smaller sample sizes within the subgroups.
Evaluation of similar subgroup analyses in other studies will be
required to clarify these results.
The RR of AMI symptom onset was significantly higher when
strenuous exertion (but not moderate exertion) was performed
outdoors compared to when it was performed indoors. This
may be explained by outdoor environmental conditions which
may play an important role as additional stressors, such as
outside temperature. Although the results of prior studies are
not entirely consistent, the risk of myocardial infarction and
sudden cardiac death has been reported to be higher on cold
days,[22–24] and extremely hot days[25] compared to average temperatures. Underlying mechanisms for the triggering of AMI by
low temperature might be (i) an increase in the sympathetic
tone with elevated heart rate and blood pressure,[26,27] (ii) increased
blood viscosity due to an increase in serum fibrinogen levels, and
(iii) increased thrombocyte aggregability.[28–30] Temperature might,
therefore, release the same internal triggers of AMI as strenuous
activity and act as an effect modifier.
In the present study, the temperature stratified analyses did
not show any difference in the risk of AMI symptom onset
after strenuous exertion, nor did it explain the interaction of
strenuous exertion and time spent outdoors. However, there
were not enough extremely hot or cold days to evaluate
whether extremes of temperature alter the risk of AMI associated with exertion. We were not able to assess the direct
effect of temperature on AMI simultaneously with the individual
exposure effect, because the day to day correlation and trend
in temperature would lead to biased estimates of association in
our case-crossover approach.[12]

Alternatively, a higher risk of strenuous exertion outdoors may
be explained by the specific characteristics of the activities that
were performed outdoors and that differ from exertion occurring
indoors. Descriptive statistics showed that the outdoor strenuous
activities in the control periods were mostly leisure time activities,
whereas in the case periods they were more likely to be work
related. The data available are not sufficiently detailed to further
assess this hypothesis.

##### Strengths and limitations

While the case-crossover method controls for fixed exposures
by design, confounding by time-varying factors may still have
occurred. We controlled for coinciding circadian patterns of exertion and MI onset by matching on time of day in our main analyses.
Furthermore, in a sensitivity analysis, we found that the RR of MI
onset was similar in the morning and at other times of the day.
This implies that the absolute increment in risk associated with
exertion may be somewhat higher in the morning than at other
times of the day. When we additionally adjusted for measured
potential confounders, attenuation of the main effects did not
occur.
Information bias may have occurred with respect to diary data,
since individuals’ activities were assessed retrospectively in a diary
interview. Strenuous exertion is a rare exposure and thus relatively
easy to remember, but memory of the case day may be clearer
than that of previous days. However, the observed frequency of
activities during the 4 days preceding the AMI suggested consistent
reporting over the time. If recall bias were strong, these daily frequencies would have decreased with increasing time to event.
Earlier work addressing the role of exertion in triggering AMIs
included a population-based control group matched for age, sex,
and precinct.[5] The authors found comparable results for strenuous
exertion when using the case-crossover approach and the case–
control approach. Overall, recall bias might have lead to an overestimation of the results of this study but cannot explain the
strong associations.


## Conclusion

This study confirms previous results and shows a graded
exposure–response relationship between physical exertion intensity and triggering of AMI onset. These findings may have implications for behavioural guidance of people at risk of AMI.


Conflict of interest: none declared.
