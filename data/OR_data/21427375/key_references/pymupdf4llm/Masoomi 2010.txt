Objective Despite an increasing knowledge of the
importance of triggering in cardiac events and their
mortality and morbidity, awareness concerning the types of
physical and psychological triggers is unsatisfactory. This
study aimed to address the main daily triggers of typical
chest pain as a marker of acute coronary syndrome onset
and assessed the sex-related differences regarding these
triggers among Iranians.

Basic methods A case-crossover study was conducted on
198 consecutive patients with a first event of acute
myocardial infarction admitted to the coronary care unit of
Shafa hospital in Kerman. Patients were interviewed about
the baseline characteristics as well as potential triggers of
chest pain experienced over the day before the diagnosed
onset of disease. The start of diagnostic chest pain was
used as a marker of disease onset. The hazard period was
defined as 12-h period of onset of chest pain.

Main results Among probable triggers, only unsuspected
sudden bad news and sexual activity had significant
relationships with chest pain appearance during the hazard
period. Among patients with the experience of bad news,
the risk of chest pain occurrence during the hazard period
was 6.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5–31.8]. Also,
among those who were exposed to sexual activity, this risk

#### Introduction
The impact of sociodemographic and psychological factors on cardiovascular events is well known in terms of
chronic cardiovascular and ischemic states. Various probable external triggers have been hypothesized as risk
factors for the onset of acute coronary syndrome
(ACS), such as heavy physical activities, emotional stress,
sexual activity, meteorological stress and large meals.
Some of these triggers, such as heavy physical exertion,
can precede approximately half of the onsets of ACS in
men, whereas some others, such as emotional stress, may
play a more important role in triggering ACS in women

[1]. However, it seems that the mental or physical stress
alone is not a common trigger of either silent or symptomatic ischemia, whereas combined physical/mental stress
has a major role for ischemic cardiac events [2]. These
effects of physical and mental triggers may be effectively
induced by several processes. It has been suggested that
cardiac vagal modulation and increased procoagulant


was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1–10.4). Risk of chest pain following bad
news was specific to men with a risk of 9.9 (95% CI 1.1–
87.6) and risk of event following sexual activity was specific
to women with a risk of 13.3 (95% CI 1.4–120.9).

Conclusion Unsuspected sudden bad news can be an
important trigger for acute cardiac events in men, whereas
sexual activity can act as a strong trigger for these events
among women. Counseling in high-risk groups should be
focused on men with considerable sudden emotional
stressors in their lives and also on women during the
ages of active sexual function. J Cardiovasc Med 11:723–

activities have a major role in the onset of acute cardiac
events following physical or psychological stresses [3]. A
number of hypotheses have also been raised to explain
that the appearance of the stresses may lead to plaque
rupture and therefore occlusive coronary thrombosis. In
addition, induction of coagulability or vasoconstriction
triggered by stressors may contribute to complete occlusion of the coronary artery lumen [4,5]. Although the
knowledge of clinicians regarding triggering in cardiac
events and their mortality and morbidity has an increasing trend [6], awareness concerning the types of physical
and psychological triggers is unsatisfactory. This fact
creates the need to identify the acute triggers of ACS
and sudden cardiac death, especially in our population
with notable prevalence of ACS and its potential risk
factors. This paper describes our study to determine the
main daily triggers of typical chest pain as a marker of
ACS onset and to assess the sex-related differences
regarding these triggers among Iranians.

#### Methods
Study population
This was a case-crossover study nested in the Shafa
hospital in Kerman. The details of case-crossover studies
have been described previously [7]. Briefly, in this study,
three types of data are needed: the time of disease onset;
knowledge of whether the trigger was present during a
defined period immediately before onset and the usual
frequency of trigger exposure. It also defined a hazard
period variable that is the period before disease onset
during which the trigger has an effect. The main goal of
this study was to calculate the relative risk of disease after
an episode of its probable trigger.

The study population consisted of 198 consecutive
patients with a first event of acute myocardial infarction
(AMI) who were admitted to the coronary care unit of
Shafa hospital between January and July 2009. Among
200 patients who were eligible in this study, 198 patients
were interviewed. In the current study, patients who
were too sick to be contacted for the onset study and
also those with missing, unreliable or inaccurate information regarding time of disease onset were excluded.
AMI was diagnosed according to the criteria developed
by the European Society of Cardiology and the American
College of Cardiology jointly published guidelines [8].
The start of diagnostic chest pain was used as a marker of
disease onset. Typical chest pain was defined as pressurelike retrosternal pain being exacerbated by exercise and
relieved at rest or with administration of nitroglycerin.
Additionally, if the pain radiated to the neck or left
shoulder or arm, it was classified as typical [9]. The
hazard period was defined as a 12-h period of onset of
chest pain. The Ethical Committee of Kerman University of Medical Sciences approved the study to be carried
out and all patients gave consent for participation in the
scientific study.

Study data
Study information was obtained by interviews conducted
by a trained physician during the first day of admission.
The data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire which included sociodemographic characteristics and medical history as well as information on the
episode of chest pain such as time, type and duration of
pain. Patients were also interviewed about eight potential
triggers of chest pain experienced over the day before the
diagnosed onset of disease. Probable triggers included
severe anger, bad news, emotional stress, heavy physical
activity, being cold, cigarette smoking, opium use/addiction and sexual activity. Exposure to each trigger was
identified in the interview by this question: ‘When was
the last time before your chest pain that you were
exposed to the trigger?’. Opium addiction was defined
on the basis of the DSM-IV Criteria for Substance
Dependence as regular consumption of inhalatory opium
more than three times per week and/or oral opium daily.


However, opium users included all cases with regular or
irregular use of opium [10].

Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean � SD for continuous
variables and percentages for categorical variables. Comparisons of categorical variables across the groups were
performed using an overall chi-square test or Fisher’s
exact test if required, whereas comparisons of continuous
variables were performed using an independent t-test.
For determining the main predictors of chest pain onset,
we first evaluated univariately associations between the
probable triggers for this event (including anger, bad
news, cold situation, heavy physical activity, smoking,
opium use and sexual activity) and appearance of chest
pain as a marker of disease onset by chi-square test.
Then, in the subsequent analysis, factors obtained in
univariate analysis were considered in multivariable
binary logistic regression analyses for determining
relationships between these triggers and onset of pain
as dependant variable in the presence of cofounders such
as age, marital status, education level and history of
coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors. The effect
of triggers was measured as a relative risk, estimated by
the ratio between the observed exposure odds at the time
of disease onset and the expected exposure odds and
presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for OR. Model calibration was estimated
using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistics
that higher x[2] values implied that the model fits the
observed data better. P values of 0.05 or less were
considered statistically significant. All the statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).

#### Results
As shown in Table 1, the mean age of study patients was
59.8 � 12.0 (range 30–88 years) and 62.1% of them were
men. There were significant differences in the overall
incidence rates of social characteristics and risk factors for
CAD between the two sexes, in that a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus was found more in women
than men, whereas education level was significantly

lower in women. With regard to oral medications before
admission, although administration of aspirin and nitrates
were similar between the two sexes, beta-blockers and
calcium-blockers were administered more in men,
whereas ACE inhibitors and diuretics were used more
in women (Table 2). Regarding exposure to triggers
(Table 3), except for cigarette smoking and opium use,
which were more frequent in men, no significant differences were observed in the exposure to other triggers
between the two sexes.

Among eight probable triggers in univariate analysis, only
bad news and sexual activity had significant relationships
with chest pain appearance during the hazard period.
Among patients with the experience of bad news, the risk
of chest pain occurrence during the hazard period was 6.9
(95% CI 1.5–31.8). Also, among those who were exposed
to sexual activity, this risk was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1–10.4).
With regard to the risk of chest pain following trigger
exposure in the two sexes, risk of chest pain following bad
news was specific to men with a risk of 9.9 (95% CI 1.1–

specific to women with a risk of 13.3 (95% CI 1.4–120.9)
(Table 4).

#### Discussion
The current study tried to assess the triggering effects of
some usual physical and emotional stimulators on the
onset of typical cardiac chest pain as a marker of AMI
onset. Our assessment mainly focused on the effects of
these factors in men and women separately. In our study,
although bad news and sexual activity have been identified as the two main risk triggers of cardiac events, the
influence of the first trigger was higher in men and the

other trigger in women. First, we showed that bad news
within the 12 h before chest pain appearance could
increase the risk of event by 9.9 times in men. It seems
that the role of bad news as a trigger of the onset of typical
chest pain is more likely due to the effect of sudden
emotional stress. In fact, bad news can be defined as a
sudden emotional stress. Between 20 and 40% of sudden
cardiac deaths are precipitated by acute emotional stressors [6,11]. Studies in both animal models and humans
confirmed a causal relationship between emotional stress
and coronary atherosclerosis [12,13].

Mental stresses are able to increase the risk for myocardial infarction about two-fold. It has been suggested
that the stress is characterized by an increase in plasma
catecholamines and cortisol associated with a rise in heart
rate and blood pressure. Plasma epinephrine can increase
by a factor of eight through emotional or physical stress

[14]. Some studies have indicated that the effect of acute
emotional stress on the onset of cardiac event was more
common in younger patients and those with lower socioeconomic levels [15]. However, specification of this
relationship in men should be studied further, because
contrary to our study, some researchers have shown that
heavy physical activity and eating were more likely to
precede the infarction onset in men, whereas women
were more likely to report emotional stress [1]. Apart from
this, although in some previous studies it has been mentioned that physical activity and emotional stress are
common triggers of ACS in men and women [1], respectively, we showed that emotional stress was a major trigger
of ACS particularly in men. It seems that men in our
society are more subjected to emotional triggers of typical
chest pain compared to women, and this may be
explained by the prominence of occupational stressors
in the profiles of men that was also previously observed

[16].

Another finding in the present study focused on the
strong trigger effect of sexual activity on the onset of
cardiac chest pain in women, but not in men. It was
revealed that the relative risk of AMI was 2.1 during 1 h
after sexual activity, and the risk among patients with a
sedentary life style was 4.4 [7]. However, it seems that
sexual activity, especially in men, represents a small risk

of triggering an AMI compared with vigorous physical
activity and intense emotional responses. Furthermore,
sexual activity has a moderate stress on the heart in terms
of the responses that impact on myocardial oxygen
requirement [17–20]. Additionally, sexual activity only
once a week can increase the annual risk of myocardial
infarction slightly [7].

The prevalence of opium addiction in our study group
was estimated as 38.4%, which was considerably high for
our society. In a study by Ziaaddini and Ziaaddini [21] it
was suggested that the prevalence of substance abuse in a
rural area in Kerman was 22.5%. Regarding the prevalence of opium addiction among patients with coronary
artery disease, some other studies on the Iranian population confirmed a significantly high prevalence of opium
dependence in those with early-onset CAD in comparison with normal individuals [22]. It seems that cultural
factors and socioeconomic status are the most important
plausible reasons for high opium dependence among the
Kerman population. These effective factors have been
identified on the basis of population-based studies so that
positive attitudes towards drug consumption and faulty
knowledge of the therapeutic use of opium were recognized as factors affecting addiction tendency in the Kerman population [23].

In conclusion, acute emotional stress such as bad news
can be an important trigger for acute cardiac events in
men, whereas sexual activity can be a strong trigger for
these events among women. On the basis of our findings,
counseling in high-risk groups should be focused on men
with considerable emotional stressors in their life and also
on women during the ages of active sexual function.
