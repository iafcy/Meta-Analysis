## ABSTRACT

**_Background_** Retrospective and cross-sectional data
suggest that vigorous exertion can trigger cardiac arrest or sudden death and that habitual exercise may
diminish this risk. However, the role of physical activity in precipitating or preventing sudden death from
cardiac causes has not been assessed prospectively
in a large number of subjects.

**_Methods_** We used a prospective, nested case–crossover design within the Physicians’ Health Study to
compare the risk of sudden death during and up to
30 minutes after an episode of vigorous exertion with
that during periods of lighter exertion or none. We
then evaluated whether habitual vigorous exercise
modified the risk of sudden death that was associated with vigorous exertion. In addition, the relation of
vigorous exercise to the overall risk of sudden death
and nonsudden death from coronary heart disease
was assessed.

**_Results_** During 12 years of follow-up, 122 sudden
deaths were confirmed among the 21,481 male physicians who were initially free of self-reported cardiovascular disease and who provided information
on their habitual level of exercise at base line. The
relative risk of sudden death during and up to 30
minutes after vigorous exertion was 16.9 (95 percent
confidence interval, 10.5 to 27.0; P<0.001). However,
the absolute risk of sudden death during any particular episode of vigorous exertion was extremely low
(1 sudden death per 1.51 million episodes of exertion). Habitual vigorous exercise attenuated the relative risk of sudden death that was associated with
an episode of vigorous exertion (P value for trend=
0.006). The base-line level of exercise was not associated with the overall risk of subsequent sudden
death.

**_Conclusions_** These prospective data from a study
of U.S. male physicians suggest that habitual vigorous
exercise diminishes the risk of sudden death during
vigorous exertion. (N Engl J Med 2000;343:1355-61.)

HYSICAL activity clearly benefits cardiovascular health.[1-3] In prospective epidemiologic
studies, both vigorous physical activity and
moderate activity are consistently associated
# Pwith a reduced risk of coronary heart disease.[4-7] However, it is also recognized that sudden death from cardiac causes seems to occur with an unusually high
frequency during or shortly after vigorous exertion.[7]
Approximately 6 to 17 percent of all sudden deaths
occur in association with exertion,[8-11] and there is ev

idence to suggest that vigorous exertion simultaneously triggers and protects against sudden death.[11] However, the role of vigorous exertion in precipitating or
preventing sudden death has not been assessed prospectively in a large number of subjects. The prospective data compiled in the Physicians’ Health Study presented a unique opportunity to determine whether
vigorous exertion triggers sudden death and whether habitual vigorous exercise diminishes the risk.

**METHODS**

**Study Population**

The methods of the Physicians’ Health Study have been described in detail elsewhere.[12] Briefly, 22,071 male physicians who
were from 40 to 84 years of age in 1982 and had no history of
myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, or cancer
were assigned to receive aspirin, beta carotene, or both, according
to a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-by-two factorial design. At base line, the physicians completed questionnaires on
their cardiovascular risk factors, intake of selected foods, and frequency of vigorous exercise. In this investigation, we excluded
590 men who reported having angina or having undergone coronary revascularization, or for whom data on physical activity
were missing, at base line, leaving 21,481 participants as the base
population for the analysis.

**Study Design**

We used a nested case–crossover design to quantify the relative
risk of sudden death from cardiac causes during or up to 30 minutes after an episode of vigorous exertion as compared with the
risk during periods of lighter exertion or none (Fig. 1). The case–
crossover study design permits the assessment of change in the
risk of an event during a brief “hazard period” during and after
exposure to a transient risk factor.[13] For each subject who had an
event (i.e., who died), the prospectively determined habitual frequency of exertion for that subject served as the control information, and each such subject therefore served as his own control in
this “self-matched” analysis.

**Frequency and Timing of Vigorous Exertion**

**_Frequency of Vigorous Exertion at Base Line_**

At base line, the subjects were asked, “How often do you exercise vigorously enough to work up a sweat?” The possible responses were rarely or never, one to three times a month, once a
week, two to four times a week, five or six times a week, or daily.
This measure of physical activity correlates with maximal oxygen

**Absolute Risk during Vigorous Exertion**

Each physician’s reported frequency of vigorous exertion at base
line (episodes per week) was multiplied by the follow-up time in
weeks to generate an estimate of the total number of episodes of
vigorous exertion in the population, and the absolute risk of sudden death associated with an episode of vigorous exertion was
calculated. This risk was then compared with the incidence of sudden death during lighter physical activity, and the difference in absolute risk was estimated.

**Figure 1. Design of Nested Case–Crossover Analysis.**
The hatched portion of the time line represents the 60-minute
hazard period (30 minutes during and 30 minutes after vigorous exertion). If a sudden death occurred during this period,
there was considered to have been exposure to vigorous exertion. If a sudden death occurred during the shaded portion of

to vigorous exertion.

uptake,[14] time on the treadmill during exercise testing,[15] and the
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.[16] The midpoint value
was assigned to each response category and multiplied by 52 to
estimate the usual annual frequency. Subjects were not asked
about the average duration of exertion at base line, but the question was asked of those who reported engaging in a regular program of exercise in a questionnaire administered at 36 months
(59 percent of the total cohort). The median duration reported
(30 minutes) was used as an estimate of the usual duration of vigorous exercise at base line. In our primary analysis we assessed the
risk of sudden death during and 30 minutes after exertion (Fig.
1). We therefore assumed that each episode of exertion was associated with 60 minutes of exposure time. To calculate the unexposed person-time, the person-time of exposure (in hours) was
subtracted from the number of hours in a year.


**Case–Crossover Analysis**

The analysis of case–crossover data is similar to that of a crossover experiment in which the risk to each subject is assessed during periods of exposure and nonexposure. The ratio of the observed
frequency of exposure in the 60-minute hazard period (Fig. 1) to
the frequency of exposure expected on the basis of the usual frequency of exercise reported at base line was used to calculate an
odds ratio as a measure of relative risk.[13,19] The data were then
stratified for each subject and analyzed by methods for cohort
studies with sparse data in each stratum.[20] Modification of the relative risk by habitual vigorous exertion was assessed by comparison of the relative risks for three categories of habitual vigorous
exertion (less than once, one to four times, and five or more times
per week), and a test for linear trend [21] was performed. The effect
of the time of day on the relative risk of sudden death was assessed by stratification of the analysis according to the time of
death, followed by comparison of the relative risks by means of a
test for homogeneity.[22] All reported P values are two-sided.


**_Activity at the Time of Death_**

The specific activity in which the subject was engaged at the
time of sudden death and for one hour before death was ascertained from the medical record or from the next of kin. The degree of physical exertion was quantified on a scale of 1 to 8 metabolic equivalents (MET).[17] The subject was considered to have
been exposed to vigorous exertion if the activity was estimated
as 6 MET or more. If the activity was unknown or was at a level
of less than 6 MET, there was considered to have been no exposure.


**Sensitivity Analyses**

Three sensitivity analyses were performed. First, to examine the
sensitivity of the results to the hazard period chosen, we considered only the period during vigorous exertion (the labeled portion in Fig. 1) as the period of exposure and reexamined the relative risk of sudden death during this 30-minute hazard period.
Second, we examined the sensitivity of the results to changes in
our estimate of the usual duration of vigorous exertion. Third, we
examined the sensitivity of the results to our definition of sudden
death, which, although specific for death from arrhythmia, excluded most unwitnessed deaths and deaths during sleep. Some of
these deaths could have been sudden, and their systematic exclusion could have biased our results toward a positive association
between death and vigorous exercise. Therefore, in this analysis,
we included unwitnessed deaths with an autopsy result consistent
with an arrhythmic cause and those that occurred during sleep
without preceding symptoms as sudden deaths.


**Definitions**

An end-points committee of physicians confirmed all events by
review of medical records. Deaths for which there was evidence
of coronary heart disease at or before death and no evidence of a
noncoronary cause were classified as due to cardiac causes. To
identify sudden deaths, medical records and reports from the next
of kin for all subjects who had died from cardiac causes were reviewed again by two cardiologists, and agreement was reached on
whether the death was sudden.
Sudden death was defined as death within one hour after the
onset of symptoms or death after a witnessed cardiac arrest or
abrupt collapse that was not preceded by symptoms lasting more
than one hour. Information from the death certificate was not
used to determine the timing of death. To increase the specificity
of our method for identifying death from arrhythmia, we excluded anyone who had evidence of circulatory collapse (hypotension,
exacerbation of congestive heart failure, or altered mental status)
before the disappearance of the pulse.[18]


**Overall Risk of Sudden and Nonsudden Death**
**from Cardiac Causes**

The base-line information on the usual frequency of vigorous
exertion was modeled in four categories (less than once, once,
two to four times, and five or more times per week), and the relative risks of sudden death and nonsudden death from coronary
heart disease for the base population of 21,481 men were computed with use of Cox proportional-hazards models [23] with simultaneous control for potential confounders.


**RESULTS**

During 12 years of follow-up, 122 sudden deaths
from cardiac causes occurred among the 21,481 participants. The age-adjusted risk factors at base line and
the usual frequency of vigorous exertion for those
who died suddenly and for the other participants are
shown in Table 1. The majority of participants reported exercising vigorously two to four times per week,
and the distribution of the categories for usual fre

quency of vigorous exertion did not differ significantly
between those who died and those who did not. Complete information on physical activity during the hour
before death was available for 80 percent of the sudden
deaths. Seventeen such deaths (13.9 percent) occurred
during vigorous exertion, and six (4.9 percent) occurred within 30 minutes after vigorous exertion. The
majority of the participants were engaged in dynamic exercise, such as jogging or racquet sports (68 percent). The rest were involved in other sports (25 percent) or heavy yardwork or home repairs (7 percent).
Among the 21,481 men, the incidence of sudden
death per person-hour was 1 death per 19 million
hours. The risk of sudden death associated with an episode of vigorous exertion was 1 per 1.42 million episodes or person-hours at risk. Alternatively, the risk
of sudden death during periods of lighter exertion or


none was 1 death per 23 million person-hours. From
these data, the unadjusted difference in risk associated with exposure to vigorous exertion can be estimated at 1 excess sudden death per 1.51 million episodes
of vigorous exertion. On the basis of the case–crossover method, the relative risk of sudden death during
the one-hour period associated with vigorous exertion
(Fig. 1), as compared with other time points, was
significantly elevated at 16.9 (95 percent confidence
interval, 10.5 to 27.0; P<0.001).

**Effect of the Frequency of Vigorous Exercise**

The results after stratification according to the usual frequency of vigorous exercise at base line are presented in Table 2. The relative risk of sudden death
associated with an episode of vigorous exertion was
lower among those who exercised more frequently

(P for trend=0.006). Men who rarely engaged in
vigorous exercise (less than once a week) had a relative risk of sudden death of 74.1 in the period during and 30 minutes after exertion. In comparison,
men who exercised at least five times per week had
a much lower risk (relative risk, 10.9); however, this
risk was still significantly higher than that during periods of lighter exertion or none.

**Effect of Time of Death**

It is well known that the incidence of sudden death
varies according to the time of day. If the subjects
tended to exercise during the circadian peak in the
incidence of sudden death (from 6 a.m. to noon),[24]
this fact could account for part of the increased risk
associated with exertion. To address this issue, we
reexamined the relative risks according to the time

**at Base Line**

of death (Table 3). The relative risk associated with
an acute episode of vigorous exertion was not significantly modified by the time of death. In addition,
the relative risk associated with vigorous exertion remained significantly elevated at times other than the
circadian peak in sudden death, except for the period from midnight to 6 a.m., when exposure to exertion was low.

**Sensitivity Analyses**


Seventeen of the 23 sudden deaths that were associated with vigorous exertion occurred during the
exertion. Using the case–crossover method, we found
the estimated relative risk of sudden death during exertion (a 30-minute hazard period) to be higher (relative risk, 44.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 26.7
to 75.4) than that during the 60-minute hazard period, but it was still modified by habitual vigorous ex

**DISCUSSION**
In this prospective, nested case–crossover study of
apparently healthy male physicians, the risk of sudden death was transiently elevated in association with
an episode of vigorous exertion by a factor of 14 to
45, as compared with the risk during periods of lighter or no exertion. Despite the high relative risk, the


-----

absolute excess risk of sudden death during any particular episode of vigorous exertion was extremely low
(1 death per 1.51 million episodes of vigorous exertion), similar to that reported in other populations.[7,9,11]
As expected, the base-line level of habitual exercise significantly attenuated the increase in the risk
of sudden death that was associated with an episode
of vigorous exertion in both the primary analysis and


the three sensitivity analyses. Habitually active men
had a much lower risk of sudden death in association
with an episode of vigorous exertion than men who
exercised less than once a week; however, the most
active men’s risk remained significantly elevated during and after vigorous exertion in all analyses. These
results are similar to those reported for nonfatal myocardial infarction[17,25] and corroborate those previously reported in a population-based, retrospective case–
control study of victims of cardiac arrest.[11]
The effect of vigorous exertion on the sympathetic nervous system, plaque vulnerability, or both, could
account for the findings. Acute bouts of exercise activate the sympathetic nervous system and decrease
vagal activity, leading to an acute increase in susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation.[26] However, habitual vigorous exertion increases basal vagal tone, resulting in increased cardiac electrical stability and in
protection against ventricular fibrillation.[27] In addition, sympathetic surges associated with acute exertion may promote plaque rupture,[10,28] and habitual
vigorous exercise could modify this risk through favorable effects on lipids or by decreasing the hemodynamic stress at a given workload.
Our finding that there was no relation between the
frequency of vigorous exercise as reported by the
men at base line and the overall risk of sudden death
appears to be at odds with the findings of numerous studies in which regular exercise was associated
with reductions in the long-term risk of cardiac
events.[4-6,29-32] However, few studies have examined
sudden death specifically and rigorously, and the results of prospective studies have been conflicting.
The Framingham Study found no relation between
physical activity and sudden death during 20 years
of follow-up.[33,34] In contrast, the British Regional
Heart Study[35] and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial[6] found significant reductions in the risk
of sudden death associated with both moderate and
vigorous exercise.
Several factors may explain why we found no association between habitual exercise and the subsequent risk of sudden death. First, we had no information about moderate levels of activity, in which
the men in our sedentary category could have been
participating regularly. Moderate physical activity is
associated with a markedly reduced risk of coronary
events[32,36] and cardiac arrest,[37] and therefore it might
also protect against sudden death. Second, activity levels may have changed over the course of the study,
and misclassification of the exposure could have contributed to the null result. Finally, the effect of vigorous exercise on the risk of sudden death may actually
be different from its effect on other cardiovascular end
points, such as nonsudden death (Table 5).
Our study has several limitations. First, the measure of physical activity that we used is limited in comparison with more objective measures of physical fit

Several factors may explain why we found no as- sociation between habitual exercise and the subse- quent risk of sudden death. First, we had no infor- mation about moderate levels of activity, in which the men in our sedentary category could have been participating regularly. Moderate physical activity is associated with a markedly reduced risk of coronary events32,36 and cardiac arrest,37 and therefore it might also protect against sudden death. Second, activity lev- els may have changed over the course of the study, and misclassification of the exposure could have con- tributed to the null result. Finally, the effect of vigo- rous exercise on the risk of sudden death may actually be different from its effect on other cardiovascular end points, such as nonsudden death (Table 5).

ness, which have been shown to correlate with rates
of cardiac events.[38] Second, the base-line data on the
frequency of vigorous exertion were not updated during the study. Since levels of physical activity tend to
vary over time,[39] there is likely to have been misclassification in our assessment of each person’s level of
habitual exercise; if such errors were random, this
factor would tend to bias our results toward a null
finding. However, if participation in vigorous exercise
either increased or decreased over time, then our estimates of the relative risk during exertion might have
been biased toward a positive or negative association,
respectively. In addition, we lacked information on the
duration of vigorous exertion. For both of these reasons, the magnitude of the relative risk associated with
an acute episode of vigorous exertion should be viewed
as an estimate.
Third, the rarity of exertion-related sudden death
limits the statistical power of the study and tends to
produce unstable estimates of risk. However, although
the number is still quite small, the 23 sudden deaths
that were associated with vigorous exertion in this
study make up one of the largest series to date. Finally, our study and the earlier retrospective study[11]
included only men, and therefore these data may not
apply to women.
In summary, prospective data on U.S. male physicians suggest that bouts of vigorous exertion are associated with a transient increase in the risk of sudden
death and that habitual vigorous exercise diminishes
this risk. The absolute magnitude of the increase in
risk associated with vigorous exertion is extremely
small, and the overall risk of sudden death was not
increased in association with increasing frequency of
vigorous exercise. Therefore, these data should not
discourage participation in an exercise program. The
benefits of a physically active lifestyle in terms of
multiple health outcomes, including the frequency of
all cardiovascular events, clearly outweigh the small
risks described above. However, further research directed at the mechanisms underlying sudden death
during vigorous exertion may lead to innovative strategies to prevent this rare but devastating event.
