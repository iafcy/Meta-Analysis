###### Out of Hospital Sudden Cardiac Death Among Physically Active and Inactive Married Persons Younger than 65 Years in Slovenia

 J. Šelb Šemerl[1], M. F. Kenda[2]

_Methods: A sedentary life style has been shown to increase the risk of coronary artery disease, a precursor of sudden cardiac_
death, while regular physical activity prevents atherosclerosis. In an out of hospital cardiac death study in Slovenia, case crossover design was used to investigate physical activity as a potential trigger of sudden cardiac death in connection with certain life
style, biological and social risk factors.
_Results: In the study, 206 sudden cardiac deaths were selected: 166 men and 40 women with median age at death 57.8 and 59.0_
years, respectively. The relative risk of dying during or within one hour after terminating physical activity of at least 6 metabolic
equivalents was 3.0 in comparison to time without activity. The relative risk of people who performed 1.5 hours or more
physical activity per week was 2.55 (95 % confidence limits: 1.69–3.84), opposed to 49.90 (confidence limits: 18.73–132.96) for
persons who performed less activity. According to the observed characteristics the risk of dying for inactive sudden cardiac
victims was 17.13 to 25.89 (95 % confidence limits: 11.28–44.60) times higher in comparison to physically active persons.
Persons who drank more than 4 international units of alcohol per day, positive family history, ischaemic heart disease and a heart
rate of more than 90 beats/minute had the highest risk.
_Conclusion: The results confirmed that the risk of dying due to sudden cardiac death during physical activity depends on the_
degree of physical activity regularly performed and the existing risk factors. J _Clin Basic Cardiol 2003; 6: 63–7._

### D

sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a significant public health
problem. Approximately 12 % of all natural deaths occur suddenly, and 88 % of them are of cardiac origin [1–3].
The risk factors associated with SCD are the same as those
with coronary artery disease (CAD) [4]. Among them, sedentary life style has consistently been shown to increase the
risk of CAD [5], while on the other hand regular physical
activity plays a role in both primary and secondary prevention
of atherosclerotic vascular processes. Exercise increases cardiovascular functional capacity and through affecting autonomic nervous system, by increasing vagal activity [6],
decreases myocardial oxygen demands [7–9]. At the same
time heavy physical exertion sometimes immediately precedes and indeed appears to trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction [5, 10].
In the section “Out of Hospital SCD research among persons younger than 65 years in Slovenia”, we tried to determine the risk of dying during or within an hour after terminating physical activity of 6 metabolic equivalents (MET) or
more among physically active and inactive persons. In both
groups we also looked at the risk of triggering SCD according
to various characteristics of the deceased.

###### Methods

**Study Design**
Case crossover study design [11] was used to assess the effect
of 6 or more MET physical activity – measured according to
the Physical Activity Rating Scale [12] – on triggering SCD.
A one-hour hazard period immediately before the onset of
SCD was compared to the total hazard period in the last year


of life computed on the basis of the usual frequency approach

[11, 13]. Cases were deceased subjects who died due to sudden cardiac death during or within an hour after terminating
defined physical activity, and controls were persons who also
died due to SCD, but during a time of less or no physical
activity.

**Study Population**
The study population was selected on the basis of underlying
cause of death from the Death Register of Slovenia. Cases
were residents of the Republic Slovenia in the year 2000 and
in the first months of 2001 who died out of hospital due to
cardiac disease, and were between 20 and 65 years old at the
moment of death.
Data were obtained through two questionnaires. The first
was sent to family members and the second to the attending
physician of the deceased. Only married persons were
included in the study because risk behaviour, usual annual
frequency data and also the profile of risk behaviour in the
last 24 hours of the deceased’s life were needed. We further
divided cases into SCD victims and expected deaths. SCD
was defined as an instantaneous death or a death within an
hour after the onset of cardiac symptoms. When family members were not able to or did not decide whether their relative
had died according to the definition of suddenly or not, we
also considered the death as sudden when the deceased person could perform physical activity of at least 3 MET on the
very last day of his/her life or if SCD was written on any part
of the death certificate. We supposed that an individual who
could perform very light exertion such as personal care or
strolling in the park was not expected to die on the same day.
This last criterion was also used for persons who died during
night sleeping.

Cases were those SCD victims who had died during or
within an hour after termination of at least 6 MET physical
activity, in comparison to controls who also had died of sudden cardiac death but not during heavy physical activity or
within an hour after its termination. Physically active were
those SCD victims who performed physical activity of 6
MET or more at least 1.5 hours a week (78 hours per year), as
opposed to inactive ones who performed less physical activity
of equivalent degree. All subjects were also divided into four
classes according to frequency of physical activity performed
per week.
Chronic stress was defined as retirement or dismissal from
employment in the last year of life or serious disease or death
of a close family member in the same time period [14]. On
the basis of alcoholic beverages usually consumed per day or
per week, the quantity of alcohol consumption measured in
international units (IU) was divided into four classes, as can
be seen in Table 1.
If immediate relatives died, or survived myocardial infarction or died from SCD before the age of 70, the deceased had
a positive family history. Suspected CAD was defined as un

clear signs of ischaemia on the electrocardiogram (ECG), but
when clear signs of ischaemia on the ECG or medically certified coronary disease were found, CAD was defined as confirmed.
As a criterion for medicine currently taken which could
influence the triggering of SCD, we chose those drugs which
spouses reported that the deceased had been taking them in
the last month of their life and not those just prescribed by a
medical doctor.

and duration of physical activity. Unexposed person time was
calculated by subtracting the hazard period in hours from the
number of hours in a year. The ratio of observed non-exposed hours to expected exposed hours was calculated with
confidence intervals (CI) [11]. The calculated ratio reflects
the risk of becoming an SCD victim during a period of heavy
physical activity or within one hour after terminating it in
comparison to the risk during lighter or no activity.
Relative risk was calculated only for those variables which
at least three or more deceased persons had while performing
heavy physical activity. The data were processed on personal
computer using the SPSS.10 for Windows and Excel 97 statistical packages.

###### Results


Our analysis was limited by a small number of inactive
persons who died during or within an hour after terminating
physical activity. Among them the risk of dying during vigorous physical activity was from 17.13 to 25.89 (95 % CI:
11.28–44.6) times higher in comparison to those who were
physically active. At the highest risk were persons who did
not use prescribed acetylsalicylic acid or other anticoagulant
drugs or hypolipaemic drugs 26.89 (CI: 16.21–44.60) and at
the lowest were those with a body mass index (BMI) of more
than 25 kg/m[2 ](Table 3).

276 responses out of 376 mailed questionnaires were received
from widowed spouses, giving a 73.4 % response rate. Among
the 276 responses, 238 SCD were evidenced; 193 men and 45
women with median age at death of 57.5 years (50.8 and 62.2
in 5 % and 75 %) in male and 58.4 years (53.8 and 61.0) in
female. Among the 238 SCD evidenced we received 206
responses on the degree of physical activity performed in the
last year of the deceased’s life, ie hours per day and the frequency
of physical activity per week. The same number of responses,
ie 86.6 % were obtained for the number of hours before death

###### Discussion

SCD is a special life situation [15] and close family members
of SCD victims get over it in very different ways. According
to our experience, some of them are willing to talk about the
terms and circumstances surrounding this stressful event but
others are not. Such a major shock had occurred that some
could not concentrate their thoughts and were able to recall
particular details of the day of the death of their loved one
only a few months later, but others could explain every particular detail at any time. After consultation with a doctor
working at a hospice and another one researching mourning
due to suicides, we decided to collect data from one to three
months after sudden death.
The (in our opinion) good (73.4 %) response rate was the
consequence of strong emotions and tensions of the widowed spouses. Possible questions of guilt due to potential
missing or overlooking of important signs or symptoms of
disease ending with sudden death could also have played a
part. We did not insist on 100 % responses to every particular question because the respondents might not know, not
remember or not want to respond to some questions which
contained unpleasant content for them. Non-participation
was due to personal reasons, connected with negative
emotions to the research, not knowing the answers to numerous questions or simply no response after the second request.
In our country people are not used to participating in
research as interviews, especially not in medical epidemiology research.
We classified data on the amount of regular physical activity performed into two categories. Those deceased who performed at least 78 hours of 6 MET physical activity per year
were assigned to the first one, those who performed less to
the second. We decided to make such broad categories in
order to minimise misclassification concerning frequency
and duration of deceased physical activity, due to proxy
respondents. Physical activity in terms of sports activity or
free time engagement is becoming popular as a way of life
which can protect health, slow down the course of some illnesses and will help after injury or disease [7]. At the same
time physical activity was described as a triggering factor for
acute myocardial infarction or SCD [5, 8, 9, 16, 17]. Paterson
assigned triggering SCD during extreme physical activity to
abnormal regulation of electrolyte and cardiac sympathovagal balance which could increase the incidence of arrhythmia, especially in connection with underlying ischaemia [18].
According to our results SCD victims had a 3-times higher
relative risk of dying during or within an hour after terminating physical activity than in periods without activity, and sufficiently physically active persons had a 19.6 times lower relative risk of dying due to SCD during physical activity than
those who were not sufficiently active.
In their study on the effect of physical activity on the incidence of SCD, Bartels et al. [19] found the relative risk during highly strenuous physical activity compared to inactivity
to be 150 in the sedentary group as opposed to 4.0 in the most
active group. Our results showed lower risk in contrast to
Bartels. Possible explanation could be different grade of
physical activity performed in two groups. Inactive persons in
our research performed either no or a few hours of recommended physical activity; we did not include only the sedentary group as Bartels did. Our results are in accordance with
the Seattle study where a relative risk of 56 was found during
vigorous activity of married men with a low level of habitual
physical activity in comparison to 5 for men with a high level
of habitual activity [20]. We confirmed the thesis that physical activity could trigger SCD. An increasing level of habitual
physical activity was associated with a progressively lower


relative risk of SCD, a type of dose response, the same observation as Mittleman found for triggering acute myocardial
infarction [5]. The difference in the number of physically
active subjects in the categories less or more than 78 hours
per year opposed to frequency per week comes from the
smaller number of answers assigned to specify hours of
physical activity performed per week which we needed to calculate the product hours per year than frequency per week.
Being female appeared to be riskier for becoming a victim
of SCD during intensive physical activity in spite of the same
level of recommended health protective physical activity performed annually. There are some morphological and functional adaptations in the anatomy and physiology of the female
body which could play a special role not only in pregnancy
and childbearing but also in CAD onset in women. Women’s
cardiovascular system is designed to adapt to the extraordinary demands of pregnancy and childbirth by modifying
diastolic cardiac reserve more than systolic [21]. Because of
the above mentioned adaptations, there is a question as to
what extent the female heart is able to compensate, by means
of sympathetic stimulation [22], for the acute extra demands
that physical activity no doubt places on it. In the ATRAMI
study [6] it was found that depressed baroreceptor stimulation (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV) were associated
with female sex. This finding supported the thesis that low
BRS contributes to high risk of cardiac mortality after myocardial infarction. Obesity [23], diabetes [19], tobacco use
and alcoholism [24] are known as risk factors, a higher level
of which are more predictive for sudden cardiac death in
females than in males.
Different extrinsic stimuli may cause similar physiological
changes that subsequently lead to acute pathologic events

[10]. Depression has been found to be associated with
elevated sympathetic tone and decreased vagal tone [10, 25].
This may partly explain the higher relative risk of SCD
among those who had experienced prolonged stress in the
last year of their life such as illness or death of a close family
member or retirement or dismissal from their job.
Heavy drinking increases the risk of SCD [26] with fatal
arrhythmia as the most likely mechanism. Subclinical heart
muscle injury and hyperadrenergic state, electrolyte abnormalities, impaired vagal heart rate control, repolarisation
abnormalities with prolonged QT interval and worsening of
myocardial ischaemia or sleep apnoea may also contribute

[27]. We did not observe linear dose response in the risk of
SCD for physical activity and amount of alcohol consumed
per day, but a U-shaped curve linked the relative risk of sudden cardiac death during physical activity and increasing
amount of alcohol consumed per day. A similar U-shaped
curve was described for alcohol consumption and SCD risk
by Albert [28]. We tried to explain the seemingly paradoxical
situation that people who did not drink alcohol or drank it
rarely had a higher relative risk of dying during physical
activity than those persons who drank four or more units of
alcohol per day. In addition to not drinking alcohol as a consequence of various illnesses, underreporting of alcohol consumption due to abstention or misclassification by respondents into occasional, regular, ex or never drinkers could play a
part.
Taking beta receptor blocking drugs or amiodarone
appeared to be some kind of protection against sudden cardiac death during physical activity. We found that persons
who were not taking these drugs and at the same time performed sufficient regular physical activity had the highest
risk of dying during physical activity than physically active
persons who were taking these drugs. We ascribed this to the
fact that 91 % of SCD victims had had at least one of the
major risk factors for coronary artery disease or CAD had

already been present with them. The antiarrhythmic properties of beta receptor blocking agents possibly reduce the
occurrence of severe arrhythmia in some patients with diuretic induced electrolyte depletion and may prevent adrenaline mediated intracellular loss of potassium during cardiac
ischaemia [29]. Because of the low number of patients in our
analysis who had been prescribed beta blocking agents, we
did not separate different indications for beta blocking
agents. We could not determine whether not taking beta
blocking agents in the case of hypertensive heart or other
heart disease increased the risk of dying during physical
activity.
Our results, whereupon persons who drink more than
4 IU of alcohol per day, had a positive family history, persons
with ischaemic heart disease confirmed by _post mortem_
examination and persons with a heart rate of more than
90 beats per minute had the highest risk of dying during
physical activity are similar to the most important risk factors
for sudden cardiac death described in the Paris study [4].
We calculated the relative risk of dying during physical activity according to the characteristics of the deceased one by
one, and we did not examine the interrelations between different characteristics.
Among the SCD victims there were far fewer inactive
people who died during hard physical activity then active
ones, so we could calculate a relative risk among active as
opposed to inactive persons only for a small number of variables. We are continuing our research in order to strengthen
our present results and to find other interdependencies
between the researched variables.
