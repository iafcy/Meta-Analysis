PIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE
documented that habitual
physical activity reduces the
population incidence of coronary heart disease, including myocar-E
dial infarction (MI) and cardiac death.[1]

On the other hand, vigorous physical
activity can also acutely and transiently increase the risk of both of these
cardiac events.[2-5] Between 4% and 15%
of MIs occur during or soon after vigorous exertion,[6] making exertion one
of the most common triggers of acute
MI. Such events appear more frequent
in patients with diabetes and habitually sedentary individuals,[2] but little else
is known about who develops an exertion-related cardiac event. Most studies of exertion-related sudden death
cannot develop a clinical picture of the
victimsbecauseofsmallsamplesizes.[4,5,7]

The current study compared the clinical characteristics of patients who experienced an exertion-related MI with
those who experienced MI not related
to exertion.

**METHODS**
**Study Design**
The data are derived from the Hartford
Hospital Acute MI Study, which was designed to evaluate prospectively the out

**Context Vigorous physical exertion transiently increases the risk of acute myocar-**
dial infarction (MI), but little is known about the clinical characteristics of exertionrelated MI.

**Objective To compare the clinical and angiographic characteristics of patients who**
had an exertion-related acute MI vs those who experienced an MI not related to exertion.

**Design and Setting Prospective observational cohort study of patients with an acute**
MI referred to a tertiary care hospital for primary angioplasty.

**Patients Of 1048 patients with acute MI, 640 (64 who experienced an exertion-**
related MI and 576 who did not) were selected for treatment with primary angioplasty and admitted between August 1995 and November 1998.

**Main Outcome Measures Clinical characteristics of the patients, including their**
habitual physical activity (determined by the Framingham Physical Activity Index and
the Lipid Research Clinic Physical Activity Questionnaire), angiographic findings during coronary angiography, and the relative risk (RR) of MI during exertion.

**Results Patients who experienced exertion-related MI were more frequently men**
(86% vs 68%), hyperlipidemic (62% vs 40%), and smokers (59% vs 37%), were more
likely to present with ventricular fibrillation (20% vs 11%), Killip classification III or IV
heart failure (44% vs 22%), single-vessel disease (50% vs 28%), and a large thrombus in the infarct artery (64% vs 35%) and were more likely to be classified as having
very low or low activity (84% vs 66%). The RR of experiencing an MI during exertion
was 10.1 times greater than the risk at other times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.665.6), with the highest risk among patients classified as very low active (RR, 30.5; 95%
CI, 4.4-209.9) and low active (RR, 20.9; 95% CI, 3.1-142.1).

**Conclusion These results show that exertion-related MIs occur in habitually inac-**
tive people with multiple cardiac risk factors. These individuals may benefit from modest exercise training and aggressive risk-factor modification before they perform vigorous physical activity.

EXERTION-RELATED ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION


sis was performed using an automated
edge-detection algorithm (CMS Medical Imaging System, version 4.0, Wallingford, Conn)[16,17] to determine the
“normal” or reference diameter of the
infarct artery and the minimal luminal diameter of the culprit lesion. Anterograde flow in the infarct artery was
assessed by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trial grading
system.[18] Lesion morphology was
graded according to American College of Cardiology and American Heart
Association criteria.[19] Intraluminal
thrombus was identified angiographically and graded on a semiquantitative scale (none = 0, possible = 1, definite thrombus �3 mm = 2, definite
thrombus �3 mm = 3).[20] For analysis,
thrombus was categorized as possible
(grades 0 and 1) or definite (grades 2
and 3) based on the largest thrombus
noted before angioplasty.

**Statistical Analyses**
Continuous variables were compared
using 2-tailed t tests. Categorical and
dichotomous variables were analyzed
using the �[2] or Fisher exact tests. A
2-sided P value of �.05 was considered significant. The predictive value of
clinical, lifestyle, and angiographic information for an exertion-related MI
was evaluated by univariate and multivariate stepwise logistic regression
analysis (SPSS 8.0, Chicago, Ill). Logistic regression coefficients and SDs
were converted to odds ratios (ORs)and
95% confidence intervals (CIs).

**RESULTS**
**Clinical Characteristics of Patients**
Of the 640 patients with MI who were
treated by primary angioplasty, 64
(10%) sustained the event during or
within an hour of vigorous physical exertion. This exertion was predominantly aerobic activity such as running and jogging in 26 cases (40.6%),
isometric or heavy lifting in 12 cases
(18.8%), and a mixture of aerobic and
lifting activities in 26 cases (40.6%). Patients with an exertion-related MI were
more likely to have established coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors


Patients were interviewed during the
hospital admission by a study physician using standardized forms. When
patients were unable to be interviewed personally or during the admission, the information was obtained from
interview with the spouse or a cohabiting family member in 26 (4.0%) or by
telephone interview in 62 (9.7%) of the
participants, respectively. Medical records were reviewed by a physician to
obtain clinical characteristics of the patients. Angina was graded by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society criteria.[8] Height and weight were measured
in hospital clothing.
The activity at the onset or 1 hour
before the MI was determined by interview and classified as vigorous (�6
metabolic equivalents [METS]) or not
using standard tables.[9] One MET is defined as the energy expenditure for sitting quietly or approximately 3.5 mL
of oxygen per kilogram of body weight.
An exertion-related MI was defined as
an MI with symptom onset during or
within 1 hour of vigorous exertion.

**Evaluation of Physical Activity**
Both the Framingham Physical Activity Index (PAI)[10] and the Lipid Research Clinics (LRC) Physical Activity
Questionnaire[11] were used to estimate
patients’ usual physical activity. Subjects were asked the average amount of
time in a typical day they spent sleeping, resting, and performing light, moderate, or heavy physical activity during
the past year using a list of leisure and
household activities.[9,12] Patients also
were asked their physical activity during the preceding 24 hours and the past
month. Activities were assigned an estimated caloric requirement using standardized tables[9,13] and multiplied by the
time spent in each activity to estimate
theenergyexpendedduringatypicalday
and the individual’s PAI.[14] Total physical activity was also divided into time
spent on heavy (�6 METS), moderate
(4-6 METS), light (2-4 METS), and sedentary (�2 METS) activities.[12] Patients
were also stratified by physical activity
status into very low, low, moderate, or
high activity groups using the modi

fied scoring scheme of the LRC Physical Activity Questionnaire.[11] Patients
graded their level of physical activity
relative to their peers at work and leisure. Among patients who reported
strenuous physical activity, those grading themselves as more active or equally
active than their peers were classified as
highly active and moderately active, respectively. Among patients who reported no strenuous physical activity,
those grading themselves as equally or
less active than their peers were classified as low active and very low active,
respectively.

**Calculation of the Relative Risk of**
**Exertion-Related MI**
A within-patient, case-crossover technique[15] was used to assess the relative
risk (RR) of an MI during strenuous exertion compared with other times. Applying standard stratified data analysis,
the case-crossover design treats the individual patient as the stratifying variable, as in a crossover experiment. The
amountofperson-timeexposedtoheavy
exertion was estimated by multiplying
the reported annual frequency of physical exertion by its duration. Unexposed person-time was calculated by
subtracting the exposed time from the
numberofhoursinayear.A1-hourhazard period immediately before the onsetoftheMIwascomparedwiththecontrol data obtained from the patient’s
usual frequency of heavy physical exertion (�6 METS) during the past year.[2]
The ratio of the observed frequency of
strenuousexertionduringthehazardperiod to the expected frequency was used
to estimate RR.

**Cardiac Catheterization and**
**Quantitative Angiography**
Coronary angiography and angioplasty were performed using standard
techniques. Cineangiograms were interpreted in duplicate by experienced
angiographers who were unaware of the
patient’s clinical or procedural characteristics. Cineangiographic frames were
selected under uniform optical magnification with standardized illumination. Quantitative angiographic analy

more likely to demonstrate definite angiographic thrombus (grades 2 and 3).
Both the reference section of the infarct artery and the minimal luminal diameter before angioplasty were larger
in the exertion-related MI group, but
there were no other significant differences in the angiographic findings.

**Predictors of Exertion-Related MI**
On univariate analysis, a low or very low
activity level, male sex, obesity, hyperlipidemia,currentcigarettesmoking,and
absence of angina pectoris were predictive of exertion-related MI. In a stepwise logistic regression model that included other relevant demographic,
clinical, and angiographic variables, the
following variables independently con

including male sex, obesity, current
cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, and
hypertension (TABLE 1), and were less
likely to use aspirin or �-blockers and
tended to have less established cardiac disease (P = .06).

**Levels of Habitual Physical Activity**
By multiple measurement criteria, patients who experienced an exertionrelated MI were significantly less physically active than patients with non–
exertion-related MI (Table 1). Fiftyfour (84%) of the exertion-related MI
patients were classified as very low active or low active by LRC criteria, and
only 1 was classified as highly active.
Compared with patients in the group
with MI not related to exertion, the annual Framingham PAI was significantly lower in the exertion-related MI
group,andonly17%ofthepatientswith
exertion-relatedMIengagedinheavyexertion for 20 minutes or more at least
weekly. The Framingham PAI was also
lower during the prior year and 30 days
forthepatientswithexertion-relatedMI,
but was significantly higher for the 24
hours prior to their event, suggesting
that the event occurred in association
with unusual physical activity.

**Relative Risk of MI During**
**Vigorous Exertion**
For all subjects, the RR of MI was 10.1
times greater (95% CI, 1.56-65.63) during vigorous exertion than at other
times. Among the 4 LRC activity
groups, however, the risk was significantly increased only among the very
low active (RR, 30.5; 95% CI, 4.4209.9) and low active subjects (RR,
20.9; 95% CI, 3.1-142.1) and was not
significantly increased among those
classified as moderately active (RR, 2.9;
95% CI, 0.5-15.9) and highly active
(RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.3-5.2).

**Clinical Course of Patients**
Patients with an exertion-related MI
were more likely to develop ventricular fibrillation during the event, to require blood pressure support, and to develop Killip class III and IV heart failure
(TABLE 2). Peak creatine kinase val

ues were also significantly higher in the
exertion-related MI group, but there
were no differences between the 2
groups in other clinical parameters or
in the clinical outcome at 30 days.

**Angiographic Characteristics**
There were no differences in the identity of the infarct-related artery between the 2 patient groups (TABLE 3).
Patients whose MI occurred during exertion were more likely to have singlevessel, and less likely to have triplevessel, CAD. There was no difference
between the 2 groups in infarct-artery
calcification, lesion morphology, the
frequency of total coronary occlusion,
or initial TIMI flow grade, but patients with exertion-related MI were

**COMMENT**
Inthisstudy,10%oftheMIstreatedwith
primary angioplasty occurred during or
within an hour of vigorous exertion. We
do not know how many other patients
had exertion-related MI, but even if we
assumenoadditionalevents,thenatleast
6% of all acute MIs evaluated at our institution were associated with physical
exertion. The RR of experiencing an MI
associated with vigorous physical activity was 10.1 higher than at other times.
This risk was greatest for those individuals classified as very low active orlow active by LRC criteria and was not significantly increased among those classified
asmoderatelyandhighlyactive.Ourdefinition of an exertion-related MI required physical exertion of at least 6
METS,butonly17%ofsubjectswhosustained an exertion-related event routinely performed a similar level of sustained effort. In contrast, subjects who
had an exertion-related MI had higher
levelsofphysicalexertionthancomparison subjects during the 24 hours prior
to the event. This higher energy expenditure is due in part to the requirement
that such subjects be performing physical exertion at the time of the event, but
does suggest that the MI occurred during unaccustomed physical activity.
These results are consistent with
other studies demonstrating that exertion and exercise acutely increase the
risk of cardiac events and that such
events are more common in inactive
people. Joggers in Rhode Island were
7 times more likely to die while jogging than during other activities,[4] and
men in Seattle were 14 times more likely
to develop cardiac arrest during vigorous activity than at other times.[5] In the

lipid-lowering therapy enhances flowmediated brachial artery dilatation,[34] a
surrogate measure of coronary arteryvasomotion,[35] so that cholesterol reduction may reduce exercise-induced coronary vasoconstriction. The observation
that exertion-related events occurred in
subjects with more cardiac risk factors
but less multivessel CAD raises the possibility that modifying CAD risk factors,specificallyhyperlipidemiaandcigarette smoking, is especially important in
inactivepeoplebeforetheyparticipatein
vigorous exercise.
The clinical complications of an exertion-relatedacuteMIinthisstudywere
more severe than nonexertion events.
Despite less triple-vessel CAD, patients
with exertion-related MI were more
likely to present with congestive heart
failureandventricularfibrillation.These
observations require confirmation, but
the cardiac demands of exertion may exacerbate the damage produced by the
acute MI. Despite the more ominous
early course, however, there was no difference in the clinical outcome of patients with exertion-related and non–
exertion-related MIs at 30 days’ followup. Delay in presentation could have
contributed to MI severity because the
time from symptom onset to emergency department admission tended to
be longer in patients with exertionrelated MI (mean [±SD]: 223 [±118] vs
202 [±90] minutes, P = .08), as was the
time to first angioplasty balloon inflation (mean [±SD]: 297 [±122] vs 279

[±94] minutes, P = .15).
This study has several limitations.
Our analysis is based on patients admitted with acute MI who were selected for, and treated with, primary angioplasty. Thirty-eight percent of all
patients with MI were excluded primarily because they were treated with
thrombolytic therapy before transfer to
our hospital. The assessment of physical activity was based on self-report and
it is possible that patients who experienced an exertion-related event underestimated their habitual activity level.
This potential problem is not unique to
this study, however, because all previous studies of exertion-related MI are


Seattle study, the RR of a cardiac arrest during exercise was 56 among the
habitually least active subjects and 5
among the most active men. Other studies have documented that acute MI is
2[3] to 6[2] times more common during vigorous exertion than during less demanding activities, but that the RR decreases from 107 in people who exercise
less than once per week to 2.4 in people
who exercise more than 4 times
weekly.[2] These findings do not impugn the benefits of regular exercise.
Many epidemiological studies demonstrate that habitual physical activity
reduces the incidence of cardiac events,
and there are sufficient data to fulfill
accepted criteria that the physical activity itself, and not some associated
factor, is responsible for the reduced
incidence of CAD.[21]
In addition to being physically inactive, patients who experienced an exertion-related MI were more likely to
be male, obese, current smokers, and
hyperlipidemic than patients who had
MI not related to exertion.
The patients with exertion-related MI
were also more likely to have singlevessel CAD and less likely to have triplevessel disease. They had a significantly larger absolute diameter of the
reference section of the infarct artery
and more frequently had definite
thrombus. The MI in the patients in
whom the event was related to exertion, therefore, was associated with a
larger thrombus burden and less triplevessel disease.
Atherosclerotic plaque rupture and
coronary thrombosis are the immediate precedents of most acute MIs in the
general population. Studies of individuals who develop exertion-related cardiac complications[22] and of athletes
who experience sports-related cardiac
events[23] generally demonstrate the same
pathological process. The mechanisms by which exercise triggers an
acute cardiac event are not clear. Shear
forces that increase the vascular wall
stress may increase plaque fissuring and
rupture. Plaques vulnerable to rupture are often lipid-enriched and covered by a thin fibrous cap.[24] Further

more, plaques that subsequently
produced an acute MI often occluded
less than 70% of the coronary diameter when visualized by angiography
and were regarded as hemodynamically insignificant prior to the event.[25]
Exertion acutely alters both the geometry and hemodynamic forces of the
coronaryarteries.Exerciseincreasessystolic blood pressure and heart rate. Increased blood pressure augments shear
forcesinthecoronaryarteriesandtheelevated heart rate increases the frequencyofthebending,twisting,andflexing motions required of the coronaries
duringcardiaccontraction.[22] Increasesin
leftventricularend-diastolicvolumeand
decreases in end-systolic volume during exercise also increase the excursion
required of the epicardial arteries, which
augments the stress on the less flexible
atherosclerotic segments. Normal coronary arteries dilate during exercise,
whereas atherosclerotic segments may
constrict.[26] Allofthesemechanicalforces
maycontributetoplaquedisruptionduring exertion. Alternatively, spontaneous plaque rupture without subsequent
coronary thrombosis may be a relatively common event in patients with
coronary atherosclerosis,[27] and exertion may acutely increase the risk that
plaque rupture will lead to clinical sequelae especially in sedentary individuals. Exercise increases fibrinolysis[28] and
tissue plasminogen activator levels.[29]

These changes are reduced in sedentary
subjects,whereasexercise-inducedplatelet aggregation is increased.[30]
The higher prevalence of hyperlipidemia and cigarette smoking in patients
with exertion-related MI suggests that
these risk factors may act synergistically with exertion to produce acute cardiac events. This concept has support
fromotherobservations.Cigarettesmoking increases coronary artery vasoconstriction,[31] which may exacerbate exercise-induced vasoconstriction in
atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Both
smoking and hyperlipidemia[32] increase
platelet-thrombus formation in patients with CAD[33] and could potentiate
platelet aggregation during physical exertion in sedentary subjects. Similarly,

factors such as hyperlipidemia and
smoking should be treated aggressively, especially in middle-aged adults
whoexercisevigorously.Althoughother
evidence suggests that moderate exercise is beneficial, the current results suggest that habitually inactive adults with
elevated cardiac risk should avoid unaccustomed vigorous exertion.

these exercise recommendations are below the level of exertion used to define
an exercise-related cardiac complication in this and other studies. Our results also suggest that other cardiac risk

**In Reply. Due to changes in clinical practices over time, the**
data cited by Dr Fung from UNOS center-specific graft and patient survival rates for 1997 are not necessarily comparable with
our data for patients who received transplants during 1990 to
1995. For example, hepatitis B immunoglobulin was not used
routinely by any of the 3 centers during the first years of the
study, and there was little difference among the 3 centers in
the number of patients with hepatitis B. Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis did not differ significantly among the 3 centers; all
centers used regimens that consisted of intravenous ganciclovir, acyclovir, or both; and analyses controlled for donor and
recipient CMV status. Finally, the transfer of patients from the
transplantation hospital to a lower-cost facility rarely occurred in this era. Thus, the differences found in resource use
among the 3 centers were unlikely to have been caused by the
factors suggested by Fung.
Currently, the clinical profile of patients undergoing transplantation in the United States is dictated largely by the criteria used for organ allocation. These criteria represent the efforts of the transplantation community to develop objective
criteria by which suitable patients with the most advanced disease can be identified and given the highest priority for transplantation. The current scheme for prioritizing patients is based
on the Child-Pugh score.[1] In our study, the most important contributor to increased resource use was more advanced liver disease, defined as patients with a Child-Pugh score of at least 10.
In fact, in most parts of the country, few patients with a score
of less than 10 have sufficient priority to be offered livers. Thus,
national policy is already committed to transplanting livers in
patients who are likely to consume greater resources. Moreover, the Institute of Medicine recently acknowledged that if
broader sharing of livers for transplantation were to occur, as
it recommended, then a greater number of transplantations
would be performed in patients with more advanced disease,
and the costs of liver transplantation would increase.[2]


As patients with more advanced disease receive a higher
proportion of transplants, there will be increased pressures
to deliver cost-effective care, which requires that a program
be able to quantify the costs of transplantation, and patient
characteristics and clinical services affect those costs. The
issue is whether we are most effectively and efficiently using
our limited clinical and financial resources for organ transplantation.

(1999;282:637-645).

**Incorrect Wording: In the Original Contribution entitled “Reduction of Vertebral**
Fracture Risk in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis Treated With Raloxifene: Results From a 3-Year Randomized Clinical Trial,” published in the August 18, 1999, issue of THE JOURNAL (1999;282:637-645), there was incorrect wording in 2 tables and 1 figure. On page 640 in Table 2, for study group 1, the relative
risk for raloxifene 120 mg/d that read “0.5” should have read “0.6,” and the total relative risk for raloxifene 120 mg/d that read “0.6” should have read “0.5.”
On page 641 in Table 3, the title that read “Nonvertebral Fractures in 4536 Women
Receiving Raloxifene Hydrochloride Therapy and 2292 Women Receiving Placebo” should have read “Nonvertebral Fractures in 5129 Women Receiving Raloxifene Hydrochloride Therapy and 2576 Women Receiving Placebo.” On page
642 in the legend for Figure 3, the sentence that read “This represents 2292 women
who received placebo and 4536 women who received raloxifene therapy for osteoporosis” should have read “This represents 2576 women who received placebo and 5129 women who received raloxifene therapy for osteoporosis.”

**Incorrect Wording: In the Original Contribution entitled “Clinical and Angio-**
graphic Characteristics of Exertion-Related Acute Myocardial Infarction” published in the November 10, 1999, issue of THE JOURNAL (1999;282:1731-1736),
there was incorrect wording in the last sentence of the “Results” section on pages
1732-1733. The sentence should read as follows: Patients with an exertionrelated MI were more likely to have established coronary artery disease (CAD) risk
factors including male sex, obesity, current cigarette smoking, and hyperlipidemia
(TABLE 1), and were less likely to use aspirin or �-blockers and tended to have less
hypertension (P = .08) and established cardiac disease (P = .06).
