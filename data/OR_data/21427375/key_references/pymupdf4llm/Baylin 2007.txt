PURPOSE: There are no data for factors that could trigger myocardial infarction (MI) in the context of
e
lifestyles in developing countries.
METHODS: Using a case crossover design, we assessed the effect of heavy physical exertion, sexual activity, acute respiratory tract infections, and gastroenteritis as triggers for MI in 530 survivors of a first MI
from Costa Rica.
e e
RESULTS: Relative risks (RRs) for MI in the hour after heavy physical exertion and 2 hours after sexual
activity were 4.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.73 6.54) and 5.47 (95% CI, 2.71 11.02). Risk for MI
after heavy physical exertion was greater for patients with poor physical fitness or elevated underlying car! e e
diovascular risk (p 0.0001 and p Z 0.06, tests of homogeneity). RRs for acute respiratory tract infection
e
and gastroenteritis were 1.48 (95% CI, 0.92 2.38) and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.95 1.69), respectively. Patients
with three or more risk factors had an RR for MI for gastroenteritis of 2.08 (95% CI, 1.31 3.28).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm previous studies in developed countries showing that heavy physical exertion and sexual activity are potential triggers for MI, and their effect is modified by physical fitness
and underlying cardiovascular risk. Additional studies that explore the biologic effects of gastroenteritis as
e
triggers of MI are warranted.

INTRODUCTION

The incidence of coronary heart disease is increasing in developing countries undergoing socioeconomic transition
(1). Lifestyles in many of these countries are dramatically
different from those in Europe and the United States. For example, vigorous physical activity is more likely to be related
to work than to recreational activities (2). The pattern of
acute infections also is distinct, with a greater incidence
than in developed countries. In addition, because transition
countries are characterized by the presence of both infectious and chronic disease (3), the study of gastroenteritis episodes as a trigger of myocardial infarction (MI) is of
particular interest in these countries. Cardiovascular disease
(CVD) as a major health problem was established only

recently in transition societies, and very few studies examined factors affecting CVD in the context of these different
lifestyles (4).
Most epidemiologic studies of CVD focused on long-term
exposures that lead to the onset of disease. However, a more
recent area of research focused on short-term events thate
trigger MI (5). Using the case crossover design, it was established that heavy physical exertion and sexual activitye
are major triggers for MI in Western countries (6 12).
Other known triggers for MI include stress, heavy meals,e
lack of sleep, and hot or cold weather (13 16). Acute respiratory tract and urinary tract infections also were identified
as potential triggers for MI, although data are scarce (17,
18). To date, there are no data on factors that could trigger
MI in the context of lifestyles in developing countries. Confirmation of physical exertion as a trigger for MI in other
countries with different patterns of exposure may support
the causality of the observed relationship in developed
populations. Furthermore, better understanding of the effect
of these and other triggers in developing countries may help
identify strategies for prevention.
The mechanism by which a potential transient exposure
may trigger MI is related to the existence of vulnerable
atherosclerotic plaques. Heavy physical exertion, including
sexual activity, could induce a cascade of events that result
in MI through their effect on the sympathetic nervous system
(19). Conversely, infections can act on plaque vulnerability

through systemic inflammation (17, 18, 20). The effect of
a trigger may be stronger in the presence of predisposing factors because patients with a higher number of risk factors
would have more vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.e
Using a case crossover design, we assessed the effect of
heavy physical exertion, sexual activity, acute respiratory
tract infections, and gastroenteritis as triggers for nonfatal
acute MI and whether physical fitness and underlying cardiovascular risk can modify their triggering effect.

METHODS

Study Population

The study population consists of 530 incident cases of nonfatal acute MI recruited between 1995 and 1998 in the Central Valley of Costa Rica (21). Eligible case subjects were
men and women diagnosed as survivors of a first acute MI
by two independent cardiologists at any of the three recruiting hospitals in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. All cases
met World Health Organization criteria for MI, which require typical symptoms plus either elevated cardiac enzyme
levels or diagnostic changes on electrocardiogram (22). Enrollment was carried out while cases were in the hospital’s
stepdown unit. We screened all survivors of a first nonfatal
MI during the recruitment period (1995 to 1998). Of those,
97% agreed to participate. The main reason for nonparticipation was feeling weak and not willing to undergo extra
tests. All subjects gave informed consent on documents approved by the Human Subjects Committee at the Harvard
School of Public Health and the University of Costa Rica.

Data Collection and Exposure Definition

Sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle history, and
medical history data were collected during an interview by
using a questionnaire with close-ended questions (23). Interviews were carried out by trained personnel who followed
a standardized protocol when asking each relevant question.
Time between exposure and event was collected in hours or
days, depending on the exposure of interest and potential
hazard period (hours for heavy physical exertion and sexual
activity and days for infections). Usual physical activity was
determined by asking subjects the average frequency and
time spent on several occupational and leisure-time activities during the last year. These activities were grouped
into six categories according to their intensity, or metabolic


equivalents (METS). One MET is defined as the energy expenditure for sitting quietly or approximately 1 kcal per kg[�][1]

body weight per h[�][1] (24). Categories included: (i) lying quietly in bed: afternoon siesta (nap or rest) and night sleep (0.9
MET); (ii) sitting (1.0 MET); (iii) light indoor activity (2.4
METS); (iv) moderate outdoor activity, such as gardening,
light agriculture and construction, and walking on flat surfaces (2.5 to 4.5 METS); and (v) vigorous aerobic activity,
such as heavy agriculture and construction, walking uphill,
climbing stairs, jogging, and other sports and strenuous
anaerobic activity, such as carrying, pushing, and lifting
a heavy object (6.0 to 8.5 METS). Time spent on each activity was calculated as the product of frequency (times
per week) and duration (hours per time). Time spent on activities exceeding 6 METS was used to calculate usual heavy
physical exertion. Energy expenditure for each activity was
calculated as the product of frequency, time, and intensity
(METS). This questionnaire was validated by its ability to
predict fitness level measured by the Harvard step test,
plasma lipid levels, and obesity in our previous studies in Puriscal, Costa Rica (25, 26).

Statistical Analysis

Five hundred thirty incident cases of nonfatal MI were recruited for this analysis. Ten people died before collecting
all the necessary information. The number of patients
with complete and consistent information ranges from 470
to 499, depending on the exposure of interest. We usede
a case crossover design in which data were analyzed as
a stratified analysis by the individual patient (5, 27, 28).
Within individual patients, exposure during a hazard period
preceding the MI is compared with the habitual frequency of
exposure during the last year. Hazard periods were selected
based on the literature: within 1 hour for heavy physical exertion (6, 7, 10), within 2 hours for sexual activity (8, 12),
and within 6 days for acute respiratory tract infections (17,
18) and gastroenteritis. Person-time exposed was calculated
by using the habitual frequency of heavy physical exertion
and sexual activity or frequency of infections during the
last year. Person-time not exposed was calculated by subtracting person-time exposed from total hours in 1 year
(8766 h/y) or the total of days in 1 year (365 d/y), depending
on the exposure of interest. Relative risk (RR) was estimated
as the ratio between the observed exposure odds at the time
of MI onset (i.e., during the hazard period) and the expected
exposure odds (i.e., habitual frequency) (5, 27). Confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated by using methods for sparse
follow-up data (29). Chi-square tests of homogeneity of
RR across strata were used to assess effect modification by
stratifying factors (29).
We stratified patients according to both physical fitness
and number of established risk factors for coronary heart

disease. Sedentary people are defined as those expending less
than 10% of their daily energy in the performance of moderate to vigorous activities (at least four times the basal metabolism rate) (30). Because no other cutoff values are
described in the literature to classify people according to energy expenditure ratio, we used 20% and 50%, which correspond to the top quartile and top decile in this population,
respectively. Underlying cardiovascular risk was estimated
as the sum of the following risk factors: history of diabetes,
history of hypertension, history of hypercholesterolemia,
history of angina, smoking status, and waist circumference.
Self-reported diabetes and hypertension were validated by
using the recommended definitions by the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus
(31) and the Third Joint National Committee on Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (32) and
found to be reliable in this population (23). Smoking status
is defined as smoking one or more cigarettes per day. Waist
circumference was measured twice, and the average of the
two measurements was dichotomized according to the Adult
Treatment Panel III definition of metabolic syndrome (33)
O O
( 88 cm for women and 102 cm for men). Because there
are no preestablished cutoff values to classify people at high
risk, we decided to use the top quintile of the distribution of
the sum of risk factors. The top quintile of the distribution
corresponded to patients with three or more risk factors.
We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. Interviewers assigned a credibility
score to every participant based on their evaluation of the
way the participant answered the questionnaire. When deleting people with a low credibility score, results did not
change. Although this measure of credibility was assigned
by the interviewer and therefore is subjective, it may help
identify patients with more reliable information than others.
Other sensitivity analyses performed included deletion of

All analyses were carried out using SAS (version 9.1;
SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and PEPI (V.4.0; Sagebrush Press,
Salt Lake City, UT, 2001).

RESULTS

Table 1 lists general characteristics of study participants. On
average, women had more established MI risk factors than
men (2.15 versus 1.48). Table 2 lists the usual frequencies of
the exposures of interest. The overall prevalence of sedentarism was 66.1%, but was particularly high among women
(89.9%). Moderate to vigorous physical activities were more
work related than recreational. Recreational activities represented on average only 7% of the total time spent in moderate
to vigorous physical activities. Furthermore, the most active
patients (top decile of the expenditure ratio in moderate to
O
vigorous activities, 50%), spent 6 hours 30 minutes daily
(SD Z 2 hours 30 minutes) on average on moderate to vigorous work-related activities, whereas recreational activities
(sports) accounted only for 6 minutes daily (SD Z 30 minutes). Patients from rural areas were more active than patients
from urban areas (49% can be considered sedentary in rural
areas versus 69% in urban areas), also mostly because of
work-related activities (data not shown). Acute respiratory
tract infections were more prevalent than gastroenteritis episodes; 52% experienced at least one episode of acute respiratory tract infection and 28% experienced at least one
episode of gastroenteritis during the last year.
Of 480 patients, 53 reported doing heavy physical exertion within the hour before the onset of MI. RR for MI
in the hour after doing heavy physical exertion was 4.94e
(95% CI, 3.73 6.54; Table 3). Eight of 470 patients reported

expenditure in moderate to vigorous physical activities was
slightly less for patients with three or more risk factors compared with patients with fewer than three risk factors, but
the difference was not statistically significant. Number of
risk factors did not modify the triggering effect of acute respiratory tract infections (p Z 0.51, test of homogeneity),
although RR for patients with three or more risk factors
was slightly higher (Table 4). However, for gastroenteritis
exposure, patients with three or more risk factors (ne Z
101) had an RR for MI of 2.08 (95% CI, 1.31 3.28),
whereas patients with fewer than three risk factors (ne Z
400) had an RR of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.64 1.34; p Z 0.007,
test of homogeneity). Stratification by number of risk factors
for sexual activity was not possible because there were no
cases with three or more risk factors exposed to sexual activity within the 2 hours before the onset of MI. However,
when using two or more risk factors as a cutoff value, risk
for MI was lower among those with fewer than two risk factors, although not statistically significant (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

This study shows that heavy physical exertion and sexual activity are potential triggers for MI in a non-Western country
undergoing socioeconomic transition. The triggering effect
of these factors was modified by physical fitness. The modifying effect of physical fitness on heavy physical exertion was
monotonic, with sedentary people at greatest risk and null


risk for highly active people. The effect of heavy physical exertion was particularly strong for people with three or more
risk factors for coronary heart disease. We did not find a significant effect for acute respiratory tract infections and
gastroenteritis, although gastroenteritis may trigger MI
in patients at high underlying cardiovascular risk.
Our results for heavy physical exertion and sexual activity are consistent with those from previous studiese
(6 12, 34, 35). This is particularly interesting for heavy
physical exertion given that the pattern of physical activity undoubtedly is different in a country such as Costa
Rica, especially for people in rural areas for whom physical activity is mainly in the form of work to earn a living.
As in previous studies (6, 7, 10, 35), risk of heavy physical exertion was modified by a measure of physical fitness
(expenditure ratio in moderate to vigorous physical activities). This measure allowed us to classify people as sedentary if expending less than 10% of their daily energy in
the performance of moderate to vigorous activities (30).
When analyzing different cutoff values for expenditure ratio from 10% (sedentary people) to 50% (highly active
people), risk of heavy physical exertion showed a monotonic trend, with the greatest risk among sedentary peo-e
ple (27.49; 95% CI, 18.64 40.54) and no association
for epeople who are highly active (1.33; 95% CI,
0.63 2.85). Therefore, the high prevalence of sedentarism in Costa Rica, particularly in urban areas and for
women, is a reason for concern. Heavy physical exertion
also was modified by the number of risk factors for

coronary heart disease. People with three or more risk
factors had a greater risk, supporting our hypothesis that
patients with a higher number of risk factors would
have more vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques to the effect
of potential triggers. Modification by usual physical activity was not significant for sexual activity, but there were
only a small number of people exposed during the hazard
period. However, RRs were in the expected direction
(lower for more physically active people), as described
in other studies (8, 12). We could not evaluate the modifying effect of number of risk factors on sexual activity
because there were no people with three or more risk
factors exposed during the hazard period.
The potential triggering effect of infections is less explored in the literature, but is supported by the observation
of a greater incidence of mortality for ischemic heart disease
during the influenza season (36, 37) and the existence of
a plausible biologic mechanism through the effect of systemic inflammation on plaque vulnerability (17, 18, 20)e .
Meir et al. (17) found an RR of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.6 4.7) for
the triggering effect of acute respiratory tract infections in
the 10 days before MI. Smeeth et al. (18) found similar results for acute respiratory tract infections and also for urinary
tract infections, although the risk was lower for the latter.
However, there are no reports of the effect of gastroenteritis.
Interestingly, we found an effect for gastroenteritis for people with three or more risk factors for coronary heart disease.
However, these results should be interpreted with caution
because the information for infections was self-reported
and thus more likely to be misclassified. The question used
to address this issue did not exclude other gastrointestinal
problems that may cause diarrhea and/or vomiting, but are
not related to infections. However, the existence of a biologically plausible hypothesis (i.e., systemic inflammation) and
the high incidence of gastroenteritis episodes in developing
countries make these results attractive enough to deserve
further attention. Although a recent metaanalysis did not
find an effect of antichlamydial antibiotic therapy in reducing cardiovascular events (38), we cannot discard that other
infectious agents may have an effect on MI. Future studies
with better and more reliable information will be necessary
before making definitive conclusions on the role of gastroenteritis as a trigger for MI.e
As in all case crossover studies, the self-matching nature
of the design removes confounding by fixed characteristics,
but does not control for confounders that change over time
(5). Cardiovascular events have a circadian pattern, with
a greater risk peak in the morning and another in the afternoon (19, 39). However, this potential bias by time of day is
unlikely to happen for the studied triggers. Sexual activity
does not coincide with morning and afternoon peak of increased risk for MI (12), and heavy physical activities are
distributed throughout the day. A second limitation is


misclassification of usual activity (sexual or physical) or
usual frequency of infections because of recall bias. We
had a measure of credibility of the answers provided by the
patients, evaluated by the interviewer. When deleting patients who scored low, results were very similar, showing
that the findings are robust. Although we cannot rule out totally the possibility of underreporting, the strength of the association for physical and sexual activity is too high to be
caused exclusively by underreporting of potential triggers
for MI (10). Nevertheless, because physical activities are
hard to classify, we expect some misclassification that may
affect results. Finally, other triggers, such as heavy meals
and stress, which may concur with heavy physical exertion
and sexual activity, may be confounding our associations.
Cases triggered by heavy physical exertion were spread along
the day; therefore, confounding by heavy meals is unlikely.
We asked patients what they thought was the main cause for
their MI. Most people answered stress (40%), followed by
smoking (14%) and general mood before the MI (10%). If
we exclude from analysis those who answered stress or general mood before the MI, results still hold for physical activ-e
ity (RR, 4.02; 95% CI, 2.81e 5.74) and sex (RR, 5.05; 95%
CI, 1.88 13.55). Therefore, confounding by concurrent
stress or anger episodes is unlikely. Nevertheless, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility of other causal pathways,
as in all observational studies.
The most likely mechanism for the triggering effect of
heavy physical exertion and sexual activity is increased sympathetic activity, particularly in nontrained individuals. Increased platelet aggregability and increased coronary
vasomotor tone also may be involved as potential underlying mechanisms (14). Other acute exposures may trigger
MI through different mechanisms. For example, heavy
meals induce a prooxidative state resulting in circulating
biomarkers of inflammation, such as interleukin 6, tumor
necrosis factor a, and adhesion molecules, and producing
acute impairment in endothelial function (16, 40).
In summary, we show the triggering effect of heavy physical exertion and sexual activity on risk for MI in a Costa
Rican population. This effect is stronger for subjects with
poor physical fitness and high underlying cardiovascular
risk. Additional studies that explore the biologic effects of
infections as triggers for MI are warranted.
