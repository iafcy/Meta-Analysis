Out of Hospital Sudden Cardiac Death Among
Physically Active and Inactive Married Persons
Younger than 65 Years in Slovenia

Methods: A sedentary life style has been shown to increase the risk of coronary artery disease, a precursor of sudden cardiac
death, while regular physical activity prevents atherosclerosis. In an out of hospital cardiac death study in Slovenia, case crosso-
ver design was used to investigate physical activity as a potential trigger of sudden cardiac death in connection with certain life
style, biological and social risk factors.
Results: In the study, 206 sudden cardiac deaths were selected: 166 men and 40 women with median age at death 57.8 and 59.0
years, respectively. The relative risk of dying during or within one hour after terminating physical activity of at least 6 metabolic
equivalents was 3.0 in comparison to time without activity. The relative risk of people who performed 1.5 hours or more
physical activity per week was 2.55 (95% confidence limits: 1.69–3.84), opposed to 49.90 (confidence limits: 18.73–132.96) for
persons who performed less activity. According to the observed characteristics the risk of dying for inactive sudden cardiac
victims was 17.13 to 25.89 (95% confidence limits: 11.28–44.60) times higher in comparison to physically active persons.
Persons who drank more than 4 international units of alcohol per day, positive family history, ischaemic heart disease and a heart
rate of more than 90 beats/minute had the highest risk.
Conclusion: The results confirmed that the risk of dying due to sudden cardiac death during physical activity depends on the
degree of physical activity regularly performed and the existing risk factors. J Clin Basic Cardiol 2003; 6: 63–7.

Results
276 responses out of 376 mailed questionnaires were received
from widowed spouses, giving a 73.4% response rate. Among
the 276 responses, 238 SCD were evidenced; 193 men and 45
women with median age at death of 57.5 years (50.8 and 62.2
in 5% and 75%) in male and 58.4 years (53.8 and 61.0) in
female. Among the 238 SCD evidenced we received 206
responses on the degree of physical activity performed in the
last year of the deceased’s life, ie hours per day and the frequency
of physical activity per week. The same number of responses,
ie 86.6 % were obtained for the number of hours before death
