with AMI symptom onset within 2h, which was strong for strenuous exertion (METs(cid:2)6) [relative risk (RR) 5.7,
95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6–9.0), and still significant for moderate exertion (METs¼5) (RR 1.6, 95% CI

as the previous authors. The difference, however, may be either
due to a real difference in the duration of the effect period in
our population or due to misclassification of the timing of
exposure. In contrast to the study of Mittleman et al.,3 in this
study, the timing of activity was ascertained based on hourly bins
of ‘clock-time’ rather than relative to the timing of MI symptom
onset.Thus,inthepresentstudy,exposuresthatoccurredconcur-
rently with MI onset were recorded in the same hour, whereas
approximately half of the exposures that occurred earlier, but
still within 1h of MI symptoms would have been recorded for
the preceding hourof‘clock time’.

Becauseofthevegetations,non-invasivecoronary
angiography usingECG-gated 64-multislicecom-

instead of conventional angiography. MSCT
demonstrated two mobile vegetations with a
length of 5mm on the left aortic cusp and

trusion in the aortic root near the coronary
artery ostia (Panels A and B). MSCT revealed
alsosignificantlesionsonthethreemajorcoronary
arteries and an intraluminal non-calcified soft
tissue in the proximal left anterior descending
artery(LAD)(PanelC).Thepatientwasreferred
forsurgerywithoutcomplementaryinvasivecor-
onary angiography. A triple coronary artery

Hall Kaster prosthesis were performed. Vegetations were confirmed by the surgeon. Five days later, a secondMSCTwasperformed
