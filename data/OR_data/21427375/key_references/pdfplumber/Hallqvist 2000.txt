Does Heavy Physical Exertion Trigger Myocardial Infarction?
A Case-Crossover Analysis Nested in a Population-based Case-referent Study
Johan Hallqvist,1 Jette M6ller,' Anders Ahlbom,2 Finn Diderichsen,1 Christina Reuterwall,2^ and UK de Faire2
To study possible triggering of first events of acute myocardial infarction by heavy physical exertion, the
authors conducted a case-crossover analysis (1993-1994) within a population-based case-referent study in
Stockholm County, Sweden (the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program). Interviews were carried out with 699
myocardial infarction patients after onset of the disease. These cases represented 47 percent of all cases in the
study base, and 70 percent of all nonfatal cases. The relative risk from vigorous exertion was 6.1 (95%
confidence interval: 4.2, 9.0). The rate difference was 1.5 per million person-hours, and the attributable
proportion was 5.7 percent. The risk was modified by physical fitness, with an increased risk being seen among
sedentary subjects as in earlier studies, but the data also suggested a U-shaped association. In addition, the
trigger effect was modified by socioeconomic status. Premonitory symptoms were common, and this implies
risks of reverse causation bias and misclassification of case exposure information that require methodological
consideration. Different techniques (the use of the usual-frequency type of control information, a pair-matched
analysis, and a standard case-referent analysis) were applied to overcome the threat of misclassification of
control exposure information. A case-crossover analysis in a random sample of healthy subjects resulted in a
relative risk close to unity, as expected. Am J Epidemiol 20O0;~\51:459-67.
