Abstract
Objective—Toinvestigatesexualactivityasatriggerofmyocardialinfarctionandthepotential
eVectmodificationofphysicalfitness.
Design—A case-crossover study nested in the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Programme
(SHEEP).
Setting—StockholmCountyfromApril1993toDecember1994.
Patients—Allpatientswithafirstepisodeofnon-fatalacutemyocardialinfarctionadmittedto
coronarycareunitswereeligible,and699patientsparticipatedinaninterview.
Mainoutcomemeasures—Relativeriskswith95%confidenceintervals.
Results—Only1.3%ofthepatientswithoutpremonitorysymptomshadsexualactivityduring
twohoursbeforetheonsetofmyocardialinfarction.Therelativeriskofmyocardialinfarctionwas
2.1(95%confidenceinterval(CI)0.7to6.5)duringonehouraftersexualactivity,andtherisk
amongpatientswithasedentarylifewas4.4(95%CI1.5to12.9).
Conclusions—The increased risk of myocardial infarction after sexual activity and the further
increaseinriskamongthelessphysicallyfitsupportthehypothesisofcausaltriggeringbysexual
activity.However,the absolute risk per hour is very low,and exposure is relatively infrequent.
Thus having sex once a week only increases the annual risk of myocardial infarction slightly.
Counselling should focus on encouraging patients to live a physically active life and not on
abstainingfromsexualactivity.
