Objective: To investigate the role of vigorous physical exertion and anger as triggers of acute coronary
syndromes (ACS) and to identify the clinical and sociodemographic correlates of triggering.
Design: Prospective observational clinical cohort study.
Setting: Four coronary care units in the London area.
Patients: 295 men and women with electrocardiographically and biochemically verified ACS.
Main outcome measures: Physical exertion in the 1 h and anger in the 2 h before symptom onset were
assessed with structured interviews. Control periods were the equivalent hours one day earlier and usual
rates over the past six months. Data were analysed by case-crossover methods.
Results: Physical exertion was reported by 10% and anger by 17.4% of patients in the hazard period. The
risk of ACS onset after physical exertion compared with light or no activity was 3.50 (95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.37 to 10.6). The risk of onset with anger was 2.06 (95% CI 1.12 to 3.92). Physical exertion
during the hazard period was related to an absence of premonitory symptoms, presentation with an ST
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), low socioeconomic deprivation and higher future cardiovascular
risk. Anger during the hazard period was more common in younger, socioeconomically deprived patients
who presented with a STEMI.
Conclusions: Triggers are relevant across the spectrum of ACS. The distinct clinical and sociodemographic
factors associated with physical exertion and anger suggest that different pathophysiological processes
may be involved.
S
ome acute coronary syndromes (ACS) appear to be
triggered by behavioural or emotional states.1 2 Physical
exertion and episodes of anger occurring within 1–2 h of
onset of symptoms have been identified as triggers of acute
myocardial infarction (MI).3–6 Many studies of triggering
were carried out before the development of the modern
concept of ACS, encompassing ST segment elevation MI
(STEMI), non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) and
unstable angina (UA).7 The extent to which physical exertion
or anger triggers different types of ACS is not known.
Triggering of acute MI by physical exertion has been reported
to be more common in men and younger patients in some
studies but not others.8–10 An association between triggering
by anger and low socioeconomic status (SES) was observed
in the Onset11 but not in the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology
Program (SHEEP) study.6 The objective of this study was to
assess the occurrence of triggering by physical exertion or
anger in patients experiencing a broad spectrum of ACS, and
to identify the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics
of patients who experience triggering.
METHODS
Participants
Participants were 295 patients admitted with ACS to four
hospitals in the London area. Patients were included in the
study on the following criteria: a diagnosis of ACS based on
the presence of chest pain plus verification by diagnostic ECG
changes (namely, new ST elevation . 0.2 mV in two
contiguous leads in leads V1, V2 or V3 and . 0.1 mV in
two contiguous other leads, ST depression . 0.1 mV in two
contiguous leads in the absence of any QRS confounders, and
new left branch block or dynamic T wave inversion in more
than one lead), or troponin T measurement . 0.1 mg/l or a
creatine kinase measurement more than twice the upper
range of normal for the measuring laboratory.7 Other
inclusion criteria were ability to recall a specific time of
onset of symptoms, absence of co-morbid conditions that can
influence either symptom presentation or mood (such as
severe psychiatric illness, unexplained anaemia, ongoing
infection or inflammatory conditions, neoplasia and renal
failure), other conditions that can cause troponin positivity12
and ability to complete the research interview in English.
Patients younger than 18 or older than 90 years were
excluded. Data were collected between 2001 and 2004. The
study was approved by the Joint University College London/
University College London Hospital Ethics Committee and
the ethics committees of participating hospitals.
Clinical measures
Information was obtained from medical notes about cardi-
ovascular history, clinical factors during admission, and
management. Admission ECGs were reviewed by a cardiol-
ogist and scrutinised for such presentation as STEMI or
NSTEMI. Discharge ECGs were analysed to assess the
evolution of Q or non-Q wave infarction. The highest
troponin T (86% of patients) and creatine kinase (79% of
patients) concentrations measured during the admission
were recorded. We also computed composite risk scores based
on the algorithm developed in the Global Registry of Acute

Coronary Events (GRACE) study.13 This uses nine criteria
(age, history of congestive heart failure, history of MI,
systolic blood pressure and heart rate on admission, ST
segment depression, initial serum creatinine, raised cardiac
enzymes and no in-hospital percutaneous coronary interven-
tion) to define risk of six-month postdischarge death
applicable to all types of ACS.
Procedure and assessment of triggers
Patients were invited to take part as soon as possible after
admission. The study was explained orally and a patient
information
sheet
was
provided.
Written
consent
was
obtained. A total of 375 patients were potentially eligible
for the study; of these, 48 (12.8%) were discharged or
transferred to other hospitals before the interview could take
place and a further 32 (8.5%) declined participation. The
interviews were carried out an average of 2.56 (SD 1.5) days
after admission, with 95% being completed within five days
of admission.
The structured triggering interview was based on the
procedures used in the Onset and SHEEP studies.3 4 6 14
Patients were questioned in detail about the circumstances
surrounding the onset of acute symptoms. Vigorous physical
exertion was defined as activity of at least six metabolic
equivalents, as used in earlier studies.3 5 14 In the light of
previous literature, we specifically focused on physical
exertion within 1 h of symptom onset3 5 14 and anger within
2 h of symptom onset.4 6 For the pair-matched analysis, data
were obtained for the corresponding period 24 h before
symptom onset. Additionally, we inquired about usual rates
of vigorous physical exertion and anger by assessing the
frequency and duration of exposure over the previous six
months, by using methods applied in previous studies.3 6
Other measures
Patients were asked whether they had experienced any
relevant symptoms (particularly chest pain) over the four
days preceding acute onset and were subsequently cate-
gorised according to whether they had premonitory symp-
toms. Information concerning education, smoking, alcohol
consumption and habitual physical activity was collected by
questionnaire. SES was assessed with a deprivation index of
access to resources on the basis of four criteria: living in a
crowded household (defined as one or more people to a
room), renting as opposed to owning a home, not having use
of a motor vehicle (car or van), and living on state benefits.15
Participants were classified as having a low deprivation
(negative on all items), medium deprivation (one positive)
and high deprivation (2–4 positive).
Statistical analysis
The study used a case-crossover design to assess the risk of
exposure to physical exertion and anger during a ‘‘hazard
period’’ before the onset of ACS.16 Onset was defined as the
time at which the symptoms that led to admission began.
Risk of exposure to anger and physical exertion during the
hazard period was calculated relative to two control periods: a
1 h (exertion) or 2 h (anger) period 24 h before symptom
onset (pair-matched analysis) and the previous six months.17
The pair-matched case-crossover design is analogous to a
matched-pair case-control design, but with participants
serving as their own controls. Frequencies of discordant
and concordant exposure in the control and hazard periods
were therefore used to derive an odds ratio with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). The usual frequency approach
was used to compare exposure during the hazard period with
exposure during the previous six months. This is akin to a
series of retrospective matched follow-up studies of n = 1,
where participants act as their own controls. Data for each

person were pooled, with the person as the stratifying
variable, and analysed by using methods for sparse data in
each stratum on the basis of a Mantel–Haenszel calculation
of relative risk, estimated as the ratio between observed and
expected odds.18 Relative risks were calculated by conditional
logistic regression adjusted for age and sex.
RESULTS
Participants were predominantly men, white and with
limited education (table 1). Men were significantly younger
than women on average and were more likely to be in paid
employment (p , 0.001). Men and women did not differ
significantly in medication, clinical presentation or other
cardiovascular risk factors.
Symptoms were more likely to have started between 06 00
and 18 00 than in the evening or early morning (p , 0.001),
with no difference between sexes. Twenty nine patients were
woken with acute symptoms after sleeping for more than 2 h,
so they could not provide trigger information. Data for the
pair-matched control periods were not available for a further
seven
(physical
exertion)
and
13
(anger)
participants.
Admissions were equally distributed across the year, and
the distribution of events occurring on week days and
weekends did not differ from chance. Premonitory symptoms
over the previous four days were reported by 134 (45.4%)
patients. The average number of diseased vessels was slightly
greater in men (p , 0.05). Men were more likely than
women
to
receive
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
(PTCA)
or
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
(p = 0.035).
Triggering by physical exertion
Twenty six (10%) of the patients who provided information
about the hazard period reported vigorous physical exertion
in the 1 h before symptom onset. Activities included heavy
gardening, lifting during house removal and gym workouts.
Table 2 details the numbers of patients who reported vigorous
exertion during the hazard and control periods. By the pair-
matched case-crossover approach, the odds of ACS starting
after physical exertion compared with light or no activity
were 3.50 (95% CI 1.37 to 10.6). When compared with the
previous six months, the relative risk was 8.62 (95% CI 5.81
to 12.78).
Table 3 summarises the clinical and sociodemographic
characteristics associated with physical exertion in the hazard
period. There was no association with age, sex, ethnicity,
preadmission cardiovascular risk factors, number of diseased
arteries or cardiac history. Time of day had a pronounced
effect; no patients whose symptoms started between mid-
night and 06 00 reported exertion in the hazard period, and
the rate was highest (18.1%) among patients with symptom
onset in the afternoon. Adjusted odds ratios have not been
computed, as the reference group (midnight to 06 00) had no
cases. An inverse relationship with social deprivation was
also observed. More socially deprived participants were less
likely than affluent patients to be physically active in the
hazard period.
Patients whose ACS was apparently triggered by physical
exertion were more likely to develop a Q wave STEMI
(p = 0.019). A strong association with lack of premonitory
symptoms was evident, with 15.8% of patients with no prior
symptoms being physically active during the hazard period
compared with 2.5% of those who had premonitory symp-
toms (p , 0.001). Physical exertion during the hazard period
was associated with greater troponin release (p = 0.014)
and with a raised GRACE risk score
(p = 0.024) in
comparison
with
patients
who
were
sedentary
before
symptom onset.
Triggering by anger
Forty four patients (17.4%) reported anger in the 2 h before
symptom onset. Episodes included arguments with neigh-
bours,
anger
during
commuting
and
family
conflict.
Triggering by physical exertion and triggering by anger did
not overlap significantly, as only four participants reported
both types of trigger. The odds ratio for onset of ACS after
anger compared with no anger in the pair-matched analysis
was 2.06 (95% CI 1.12 to 3.92). The relative risk of anger
occurring in the hazard period compared with the previous
six months was 7.30 (95% CI 5.22 to 10.19).
Anger in the 2 h before symptom onset was not associated

or cardiac history. But anger preceding ACS onset was more
common in younger patients (p = 0.024) and in those of
lower SES as defined by deprivation (p = 0.04): 24% of the
most deprived group reported anger during the hazard period
compared with 12.4% of the least deprived (table 4). Anger
during the hazard period was also more common in patients
presenting with STEMI than with NSTEMI/UA (p = 0.028).
Triggering by anger was not related to the presence of
premonitory symptoms, time of onset, troponin release or
GRACE risk score.
Comparison of patients with exertion and anger
triggers
Patients reporting physical exertion and patients reporting
anger in the hazard period were directly compared, omitting
four participants who experienced both triggers. There were
no differences in sex, age or number of diseased vessels
(table 5). Patients who reported anger during the hazard
period were more likely to be socioeconomically deprived
(p = 0.006) and to have experienced premonitory symptoms
over the previous four days (p = 0.004). Physical exertion
during the hazard period was associated with onset in the
afternoon
(p = 0.002),
higher
troponin
concentrations
(p = 0.034) and raised GRACE risk scores (p = 0.034).
No other differences in lifestyle factors, cardiovascular
history or presentation were observed, although more of
those in the anger than in the exertion trigger groups tended
to have hypertension (non-significant).
DISCUSSION
The purposes of this investigation were to discover whether
the behavioural and emotional stimuli previously identified
as triggers of acute MI are relevant to the broader spectrum of
ACS, and to assess the clinical and sociodemographic
characteristics of patients who report possible triggers during
the hours preceding symptom onset. We used case-crossover
methods
to analyse these transient acute effects. The
advantages of the case-crossover method are that patients
serve as their own referents, leading to efficient control of
fixed
potential
confounders
and
unmeasured
personal
attributes, and an ability to take habitual rates of exposure
into account.16
The proportion of patients who reported vigorous physical
exertion in the 1 h preceding symptom onset was 10%.
Previous studies of acute MI have reported heavy exertion in
4.4%, 6.4% and 7.1%,3 5 14 with moderate or vigorous physical
activity in 18.7% and 27.1%.14 19 The odds ratio of 3.50 from
the pair-matched analysis compares with 4.214 and 5.63 in
previous studies. The relative risk versus habitual exercise
levels of 8.62 compares with risks ranging from 3.3–10.1.1 The
prevalence of anger over the 2 h before symptom onset
(17.4%) was greater than that reported in the Onset and
SHEEP studies, both of which had a prevalence of less than
2.5%.4 6 This is because of our use of broader inclusion criteria
for anger episodes. Previous studies have analysed only high
levels of anger; when the corresponding criterion was applied
to the present data set, prevalence of anger fell to 3.5%, but
the number of cases was too small for further analysis. The
relative risk for anger triggering over the previous six months
of 7.30 compares with 5.7 in the SHEEP study.6 The higher
relative risks when the hazard periods were compared with
usual rates of exposure rather than the pair-matched periods
is probably due to less accurate recall of habitual rates of
exercise and mood, in comparison with recall of specific time
periods.
The patients with ACS in this study sample were relatively
young, with only moderate risk profiles as measured with the

GRACE index.13 The low levels of education are comparable
with attainment in a national sample of men and women of
this age in England.20 There was also a higher proportion of
STEMI than of NSTEMI/UA than that reported in recent
studies,21 probably a result of the requirement that patients
could recall a specific time of onset. We did not observe any
sex difference in presentation with STEMI and NSTEMI/UA,
but as in previous studies women had fewer diseased
coronary arteries.22 Most patients underwent PTCA, but a
higher proportion of women than men were managed
medically, as has previously been described in the literature.23
We identified distinctive profiles of patients who reported
triggering by physical exertion and anger. Physical exertion in
the 1 h before symptom onset was associated with absence of
premonitory symptoms, higher SES as measured by the
deprivation index, development of a Q wave STEMI and a
higher clinical risk score. In contrast, anger during the hazard
period was associated with lower SES, younger age and
presentation with STEMI, and had no relationship with
premonitory symptoms. Direct comparison of the patients
who reported either exertion or anger during the hazard
period confirmed that exertion was associated with less
socioeconomic deprivation, fewer premonitory symptoms,
greater troponin release and higher clinical risk scores than
was anger. The association between lack of premonitory
symptoms and triggering by physical exertion has been
described before14 and is perhaps not surprising, as people
who experience symptoms over several days are unlikely to
voluntarily exert themselves physically. We did not observe a
protective effect of regular physical activity in this study,3 5
and this may have been due to the small sample size or to the
sedentary nature of the population.
Both types of triggering were more commonly associated
with STEMI than with other forms of ACS. Nevertheless,
5.7% of patients admitted with NSTEMI/UA reported physical
exertion and 9.1% experienced anger during the hazard
period, so triggering may occur across the spectrum of ACS.
An interesting difference emerged with respect to the nature
of the STEMI, with associations between the development of
a Q wave infarction and physical exertion but not anger. This
pattern, coupled with the relationship between physical
exertion, troponin release and GRACE risk scores, suggests
that this group of patients has greater myocyte damage and a
raised risk of future morbidity. Silent ischaemia during
ambulatory ECG monitoring has also been associated with
heavy physical exertion.24
The mechanisms underlying these patterns of triggering are
not fully understood. Physical exertion elicits an acute increase
in sympathetic activity, release of catecholamines and haemo-
dynamic
responses
that
may
stimulate
plaque
rupture.
Catecholamines stimulate surface expression of adhesion
molecules, and the concentration of interleukin 6 in the
circulation rises notably.25 Acute mental stress also stimulates
inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte adhesion molecule expres-
sion and platelet activation.26 27 Platelet reactivity to mental
stress has been positively correlated with hostile personality
traits,28 and this may contribute to the association with anger.
Although anger triggering was related to presentation with
STEMI, however, it was not associated with the development of
Q wave infarction, heart failure or the magnitude of troponin T
release.
This
suggests
that
anger
may
have
transiently
influenced physiology and implicates a possible role of vascular
spasm. Boltwood et al29 reported that anger recall during
catheterisation induced coronary vasoconstriction in stenosed
vessels, and this phenomenon may translate into clinical risk of
ACS. Emotional stress has been shown in ambulatory monitor-
ing studies to induce transient myocardial ischaemia.24 Another
relevant mechanism is disturbance of cardiac autonomic
function leading to arrhythmia.30
Anger in the hours immediately preceding symptom onset
was associated with younger age and greater socioeconomic
deprivation. The age effect suggests that people who are
prone to anger are less likely to survive into old age. A
relationship between anger triggering and lower SES defined
by education was described in the Onset study.11 This result is
consistent
with the notion that emotional factors are
responsible in part for the socioeconomic gradient in risk of
coronary heart disease.
This study has some limitations. The sample size was
relatively small and prevented us from dividing out NSTEMI
from UA. Exclusion of patients with co-morbidities that can
affect symptom presentation, mood or cardiac enzymes led to
restriction of the sample to people with relatively low risk.
Patients’ retrospective reports of their experiences before
symptom onset may be biased or influenced by the salience of
the situation, leading to overestimation during the hazard
period.1 The strengths of the investigation include assessment
of different types of ACS, characterisation of patients in
terms of multivariate clinical risk, and measurement of
troponin in the majority of patients. The results indicate that
triggering by exertion and anger is relevant not only to acute
MI but also to other presentations across the range of ACS.
The distinctive clinical and sociodemographic profiles of
triggering by exertion and anger suggest that different
patients are at risk from these factors. It remains to be seen
whether the pathophysiological processes underlying trigger-
ing by physical exertion and anger also vary.

Severe aeroportia in a patient with acute myocardial infarction, complicated by acute ischaemic
bowel syndrome
A
n 83 year old woman presented
with acute anterior myocardial
infarction,
Killip
class
I.
She
received percutaneous coronary inter-
vention for ensuing cardiogenic shock.
An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)
was applied via the right femoral route.
The patient’s haemodynamics became
stable within two hours and all ino-
tropes were discontinued. Further epi-
sodes of hypotension, sinus tachycardia,
metabolic acidosis and acute abdominal
distension developed 12 hours after the
intervention.
The
echocardiogram
showed good left ventricular contracti-
lity, without cardiac tamponade. IABP-
related aortic haemorrhage was sus-
pected initially. Aggressive combination
treatment was implemented with high
dose dopamine, norepinephrine, epi-
nephrine
and
vasopressin.
However,
the shock persisted. Abdominal com-
puted tomography (CT) did not show a
retroperitoneal
haematoma
but
did
reveal extensive bowel dilatation and
massive air in the intrahepatic (panel A)
and
spleno-portal
vein
(aeroportia)
(panel B). Air within the intestinal
submucosa was also noted (pneumato-
sis intestinalis) (panel C). The diagnosis
of acute ischaemic bowel was con-
firmed. The patient died 15 hours after
the initiation of shock, despite aggres-
sive medical treatment.
Pneumatosis intestinalis is an uncom-
mon but important condition in which
gas is found in a linear or cystic form in
the submucosa or subserosa of the
bowel wall. Gas accumulation in the
portomesenteric veins (aeroportia) is
even more rare. The presence of pneu-
matosis
intestinalis
and
aeroportia
caused by bowel ischaemia does not
generally
predict
transmural
bowel
infarction,
because
they
may
be
observed in patients with only partial
ischaemic
bowel
wall
damage.
The
clinical outcome of patients with bowel
ischaemia with these CT findings seems
to depend mainly on the severity and
extent of their underlying disease.
