PIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE
documented that habitual
physical activity reduces the
population incidence of coro-
nary heart disease, including myocar-
dial infarction (MI) and cardiac death.1
On the other hand, vigorous physical
activity can also acutely and tran-
siently increase the risk of both of these
cardiac events.2-5 Between 4% and 15%
of MIs occur during or soon after vig-
orous exertion,6 making exertion one
of the most common triggers of acute
MI. Such events appear more frequent
in patients with diabetes and habitu-
ally sedentary individuals,2 but little else
is known about who develops an exer-
tion-related cardiac event. Most stud-
ies of exertion-related sudden death
cannot develop a clinical picture of the
victimsbecauseofsmallsamplesizes.4,5,7
The current study compared the clini-
cal characteristics of patients who ex-
perienced an exertion-related MI with
those who experienced MI not related
to exertion.
METHODS
Study Design
The data are derived from the Hartford
Hospital Acute MI Study, which was de-
signed to evaluate prospectively the out-
comes of patients with MI treated with
primary angioplasty, the predominant
treatmentmethod for acute MI at our in-
stitution. Between August 1995 and No-
vember 1998, 1048 consecutive pa-
tients with acute MI were hospitalized
within12hoursofsymptomonsetatour
institution. Of the 1048 patients who
presented within the 12-hour time win-
dow, 225 were treated with thromboly-
sis, 12 underwent catheterization but
proceeded immediately to coronary ar-
terybypassgraftsurgery,112weretrans-
ferred from another hospital for rescue
angioplastyafterfailedthrombolytics,42
had vein graft occlusion, 6 had abso-
lute contraindications to coronary in-
tervention, 6 had an unidentifiable in-
farctartery,and5declinedparticipation,
leaving 640 patients for this study. All
patients provided verbal and written in-
formed consent as approved by the in-
stitutional review board.

Context Vigorous physical exertion transiently increases the risk of acute myocar-
dial infarction (MI), but little is known about the clinical characteristics of exertion-
related MI.
Objective To compare the clinical and angiographic characteristics of patients who
had an exertion-related acute MI vs those who experienced an MI not related to ex-
ertion.
Design and Setting Prospective observational cohort study of patients with an acute
MI referred to a tertiary care hospital for primary angioplasty.
Patients Of 1048 patients with acute MI, 640 (64 who experienced an exertion-
related MI and 576 who did not) were selected for treatment with primary angio-
plasty and admitted between August 1995 and November 1998.
Main Outcome Measures Clinical characteristics of the patients, including their
habitual physical activity (determined by the Framingham Physical Activity Index and
the Lipid Research Clinic Physical Activity Questionnaire), angiographic findings dur-
ing coronary angiography, and the relative risk (RR) of MI during exertion.
Results Patients who experienced exertion-related MI were more frequently men
(86% vs 68%), hyperlipidemic (62% vs 40%), and smokers (59% vs 37%), were more
likely to present with ventricular fibrillation (20% vs 11%), Killip classification III or IV
heart failure (44% vs 22%), single-vessel disease (50% vs 28%), and a large throm-
bus in the infarct artery (64% vs 35%) and were more likely to be classified as having
very low or low activity (84% vs 66%). The RR of experiencing an MI during exertion
was 10.1 times greater than the risk at other times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-
65.6), with the highest risk among patients classified as very low active (RR, 30.5; 95%
CI, 4.4-209.9) and low active (RR, 20.9; 95% CI, 3.1-142.1).
Conclusion These results show that exertion-related MIs occur in habitually inac-
tive people with multiple cardiac risk factors. These individuals may benefit from mod-
est exercise training and aggressive risk-factor modification before they perform vig-
orous physical activity.

Patients were interviewed during the
hospital admission by a study physi-
cian using standardized forms. When
patients were unable to be inter-
viewed personally or during the admis-
sion, the information was obtained from
interview with the spouse or a cohab-
iting family member in 26 (4.0%) or by
telephone interview in 62 (9.7%) of the
participants, respectively. Medical rec-
ords were reviewed by a physician to
obtain clinical characteristics of the pa-
tients. Angina was graded by the Ca-
nadian Cardiovascular Society crite-
ria.8 Height and weight were measured
in hospital clothing.
The activity at the onset or 1 hour
before the MI was determined by in-
terview and classified as vigorous (.6
metabolic equivalents [METS]) or not
using standard tables.9 One MET is de-
fined as the energy expenditure for sit-
ting quietly or approximately 3.5 mL
of oxygen per kilogram of body weight.
An exertion-related MI was defined as
an MI with symptom onset during or
within 1 hour of vigorous exertion.
Evaluation of Physical Activity
Both the Framingham Physical Activ-
ity Index (PAI)10 and the Lipid Re-
search Clinics (LRC) Physical Activity
Questionnaire11 were used to estimate
patients’ usual physical activity. Sub-
jects were asked the average amount of
time in a typical day they spent sleep-
ing, resting, and performing light, mod-
erate, or heavy physical activity during
the past year using a list of leisure and
household activities.9,12 Patients also
were asked their physical activity dur-
ing the preceding 24 hours and the past
month. Activities were assigned an es-
timated caloric requirement using stan-
dardized tables9,13 and multiplied by the
time spent in each activity to estimate
theenergyexpendedduringatypicalday
and the individual’s PAI.14 Total physi-
cal activity was also divided into time
spent on heavy (.6 METS), moderate
(4-6 METS), light (2-4 METS), and sed-
entary (,2 METS) activities.12 Patients
were also stratified by physical activity
status into very low, low, moderate, or
high activity groups using the modi-
fied scoring scheme of the LRC Physi-
cal Activity Questionnaire.11 Patients
graded their level of physical activity
relative to their peers at work and lei-
sure. Among patients who reported
strenuous physical activity, those grad-
ing themselves as more active or equally
active than their peers were classified as
highly active and moderately active, re-
spectively. Among patients who re-
ported no strenuous physical activity,
those grading themselves as equally or
less active than their peers were classi-
fied as low active and very low active,
respectively.
Calculation of the Relative Risk of
Exertion-Related MI
A within-patient, case-crossover tech-
nique15 was used to assess the relative
risk (RR) of an MI during strenuous ex-
ertion compared with other times. Ap-
plying standard stratified data analysis,
the case-crossover design treats the in-
dividual patient as the stratifying vari-
able, as in a crossover experiment. The
amountofperson-timeexposedtoheavy
exertion was estimated by multiplying
the reported annual frequency of physi-
cal exertion by its duration. Unex-
posed person-time was calculated by
subtracting the exposed time from the
numberofhoursinayear.A1-hourhaz-
ard period immediately before the on-
setoftheMIwascomparedwiththecon-
trol data obtained from the patient’s
usual frequency of heavy physical exer-
tion (.6 METS) during the past year.2
The ratio of the observed frequency of
strenuousexertionduringthehazardpe-
riod to the expected frequency was used
to estimate RR.
Cardiac Catheterization and
Quantitative Angiography
Coronary angiography and angio-
plasty were performed using standard
techniques. Cineangiograms were in-
terpreted in duplicate by experienced
angiographers who were unaware of the
patient’s clinical or procedural charac-
teristics. Cineangiographic frames were
selected under uniform optical magni-
fication with standardized illumina-
tion. Quantitative angiographic analy-
sis was performed using an automated
edge-detection algorithm (CMS Medi-
cal Imaging System, version 4.0, Wall-
ingford, Conn)16,17 to determine the
“normal” or reference diameter of the
infarct artery and the minimal lumi-
nal diameter of the culprit lesion. An-
terograde flow in the infarct artery was
assessed by the Thrombolysis in Myo-
cardial Infarction (TIMI) trial grading
system.18 Lesion morphology was
graded according to American Col-
lege of Cardiology and American Heart
Association criteria.19 Intraluminal
thrombus was identified angiographi-
cally and graded on a semiquantita-
tive scale (none = 0, possible = 1, defi-
nite thrombus ,3 mm = 2, definite
thrombus $3 mm = 3).20 For analysis,
thrombus was categorized as possible
(grades 0 and 1) or definite (grades 2
and 3) based on the largest thrombus
noted before angioplasty.
Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables were compared
using 2-tailed t tests. Categorical and
dichotomous variables were analyzed
using the x2 or Fisher exact tests. A
2-sided P value of ,.05 was consid-
ered significant. The predictive value of
clinical, lifestyle, and angiographic in-
formation for an exertion-related MI
was evaluated by univariate and mul-
tivariate stepwise logistic regression
analysis (SPSS 8.0, Chicago, Ill). Lo-
gistic regression coefficients and SDs
were converted to odds ratios (ORs)and
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics of Patients
Of the 640 patients with MI who were
treated by primary angioplasty, 64
(10%) sustained the event during or
within an hour of vigorous physical ex-
ertion. This exertion was predomi-
nantly aerobic activity such as run-
ning and jogging in 26 cases (40.6%),
isometric or heavy lifting in 12 cases
(18.8%), and a mixture of aerobic and
lifting activities in 26 cases (40.6%). Pa-
tients with an exertion-related MI were
more likely to have established coro-
nary artery disease (CAD) risk factors

including male sex, obesity, current
cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, and
hypertension (TABLE 1), and were less
likely to use aspirin or b-blockers and
tended to have less established car-
diac disease (P = .06).
Levels of Habitual Physical Activity
By multiple measurement criteria, pa-
tients who experienced an exertion-
related MI were significantly less physi-
cally active than patients with non–
exertion-related MI (Table 1). Fifty-
four (84%) of the exertion-related MI
patients were classified as very low ac-
tive or low active by LRC criteria, and
only 1 was classified as highly active.
Compared with patients in the group
with MI not related to exertion, the an-
nual Framingham PAI was signifi-
cantly lower in the exertion-related MI
group,andonly17%ofthepatientswith
exertion-relatedMIengagedinheavyex-
ertion for 20 minutes or more at least
weekly. The Framingham PAI was also
lower during the prior year and 30 days
forthepatientswithexertion-relatedMI,
but was significantly higher for the 24
hours prior to their event, suggesting
that the event occurred in association
with unusual physical activity.
Relative Risk of MI During
Vigorous Exertion
For all subjects, the RR of MI was 10.1
times greater (95% CI, 1.56-65.63) dur-
ing vigorous exertion than at other
times. Among the 4 LRC activity
groups, however, the risk was signifi-
cantly increased only among the very
low active (RR, 30.5; 95% CI, 4.4-
209.9) and low active subjects (RR,
20.9; 95% CI, 3.1-142.1) and was not
significantly increased among those
classified as moderately active (RR, 2.9;
95% CI, 0.5-15.9) and highly active
(RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.3-5.2).
Clinical Course of Patients
Patients with an exertion-related MI
were more likely to develop ventricu-
lar fibrillation during the event, to re-
quire blood pressure support, and to de-
velop Killip class III and IV heart failure
(TABLE 2). Peak creatine kinase val-
ues were also significantly higher in the
exertion-related MI group, but there
were no differences between the 2
groups in other clinical parameters or
in the clinical outcome at 30 days.
Angiographic Characteristics
There were no differences in the iden-
tity of the infarct-related artery be-
tween the 2 patient groups (TABLE 3).
Patients whose MI occurred during ex-
ertion were more likely to have single-
vessel, and less likely to have triple-
vessel, CAD. There was no difference
between the 2 groups in infarct-artery
calcification, lesion morphology, the
frequency of total coronary occlusion,
or initial TIMI flow grade, but pa-
tients with exertion-related MI were
more likely to demonstrate definite an-
giographic thrombus (grades 2 and 3).
Both the reference section of the in-
farct artery and the minimal luminal di-
ameter before angioplasty were larger
in the exertion-related MI group, but
there were no other significant differ-
ences in the angiographic findings.
Predictors of Exertion-Related MI
On univariate analysis, a low or very low
activity level, male sex, obesity, hyper-
lipidemia,currentcigarettesmoking,and
absence of angina pectoris were predic-
tive of exertion-related MI. In a step-
wise logistic regression model that in-
cluded other relevant demographic,
clinical, and angiographic variables, the
following variables independently con-

COMMENT
Inthisstudy,10%oftheMIstreatedwith
primary angioplasty occurred during or
within an hour of vigorous exertion. We
do not know how many other patients
had exertion-related MI, but even if we
assumenoadditionalevents,thenatleast
6% of all acute MIs evaluated at our in-
stitution were associated with physical
exertion. The RR of experiencing an MI
associated with vigorous physical activ-
ity was 10.1 higher than at other times.
This risk was greatest for those individu-
als classified as very low active orlow ac-
tive by LRC criteria and was not signifi-
cantly increased among those classified
asmoderatelyandhighlyactive.Ourdefi-
nition of an exertion-related MI re-
quired physical exertion of at least 6
METS,butonly17%ofsubjectswhosus-
tained an exertion-related event rou-
tinely performed a similar level of sus-
tained effort. In contrast, subjects who
had an exertion-related MI had higher
levelsofphysicalexertionthancompari-
son subjects during the 24 hours prior
to the event. This higher energy expen-
diture is due in part to the requirement
that such subjects be performing physi-
cal exertion at the time of the event, but
does suggest that the MI occurred dur-
ing unaccustomed physical activity.
These results are consistent with
other studies demonstrating that exer-
tion and exercise acutely increase the
risk of cardiac events and that such
events are more common in inactive
people. Joggers in Rhode Island were
7 times more likely to die while jog-
ging than during other activities,4 and
men in Seattle were 14 times more likely
to develop cardiac arrest during vigor-
ous activity than at other times.5 In the

Seattle study, the RR of a cardiac ar-
rest during exercise was 56 among the
habitually least active subjects and 5
among the most active men. Other stud-
ies have documented that acute MI is
23 to 62 times more common during vig-
orous exertion than during less de-
manding activities, but that the RR de-
creases from 107 in people who exercise
less than once per week to 2.4 in people
who exercise more than 4 times
weekly.2 These findings do not im-
pugn the benefits of regular exercise.
Many epidemiological studies demon-
strate that habitual physical activity
reduces the incidence of cardiac events,
and there are sufficient data to fulfill
accepted criteria that the physical ac-
tivity itself, and not some associated
factor, is responsible for the reduced
incidence of CAD.21
In addition to being physically inac-
tive, patients who experienced an ex-
ertion-related MI were more likely to
be male, obese, current smokers, and
hyperlipidemic than patients who had
MI not related to exertion.
The patients with exertion-related MI
were also more likely to have single-
vessel CAD and less likely to have triple-
vessel disease. They had a signifi-
cantly larger absolute diameter of the
reference section of the infarct artery
and more frequently had definite
thrombus. The MI in the patients in
whom the event was related to exer-
tion, therefore, was associated with a
larger thrombus burden and less triple-
vessel disease.
Atherosclerotic plaque rupture and
coronary thrombosis are the immedi-
ate precedents of most acute MIs in the
general population. Studies of individu-
als who develop exertion-related car-
diac complications22 and of athletes
who experience sports-related cardiac
events23 generally demonstrate the same
pathological process. The mecha-
nisms by which exercise triggers an
acute cardiac event are not clear. Shear
forces that increase the vascular wall
stress may increase plaque fissuring and
rupture. Plaques vulnerable to rup-
ture are often lipid-enriched and cov-
ered by a thin fibrous cap.24 Further-
more, plaques that subsequently
produced an acute MI often occluded
less than 70% of the coronary diam-
eter when visualized by angiography
and were regarded as hemodynami-
cally insignificant prior to the event.25
Exertion acutely alters both the ge-
ometry and hemodynamic forces of the
coronaryarteries.Exerciseincreasessys-
tolic blood pressure and heart rate. In-
creased blood pressure augments shear
forcesinthecoronaryarteriesandtheel-
evated heart rate increases the fre-
quencyofthebending,twisting,andflex-
ing motions required of the coronaries
duringcardiaccontraction.22Increasesin
leftventricularend-diastolicvolumeand
decreases in end-systolic volume dur-
ing exercise also increase the excursion
required of the epicardial arteries, which
augments the stress on the less flexible
atherosclerotic segments. Normal coro-
nary arteries dilate during exercise,
whereas atherosclerotic segments may
constrict.26Allofthesemechanicalforces
maycontributetoplaquedisruptiondur-
ing exertion. Alternatively, spontane-
ous plaque rupture without subsequent
coronary thrombosis may be a rela-
tively common event in patients with
coronary atherosclerosis,27 and exer-
tion may acutely increase the risk that
plaque rupture will lead to clinical se-
quelae especially in sedentary individu-
als. Exercise increases fibrinolysis28 and
tissue plasminogen activator levels.29
These changes are reduced in sedentary
subjects,whereasexercise-inducedplate-
let aggregation is increased.30
The higher prevalence of hyperlipid-
emia and cigarette smoking in patients
with exertion-related MI suggests that
these risk factors may act synergisti-
cally with exertion to produce acute car-
diac events. This concept has support
fromotherobservations.Cigarettesmok-
ing increases coronary artery vasocon-
striction,31 which may exacerbate exer-
cise-induced vasoconstriction in
atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Both
smoking and hyperlipidemia32 increase
platelet-thrombus formation in pa-
tients with CAD33 and could potentiate
platelet aggregation during physical ex-
ertion in sedentary subjects. Similarly,
lipid-lowering therapy enhances flow-
mediated brachial artery dilatation,34 a
surrogate measure of coronary arteryva-
somotion,35 so that cholesterol reduc-
tion may reduce exercise-induced coro-
nary vasoconstriction. The observation
that exertion-related events occurred in
subjects with more cardiac risk factors
but less multivessel CAD raises the pos-
sibility that modifying CAD risk fac-
tors,specificallyhyperlipidemiaandciga-
rette smoking, is especially important in
inactivepeoplebeforetheyparticipatein
vigorous exercise.
The clinical complications of an ex-
ertion-relatedacuteMIinthisstudywere
more severe than nonexertion events.
Despite less triple-vessel CAD, patients
with exertion-related MI were more
likely to present with congestive heart
failureandventricularfibrillation.These
observations require confirmation, but
the cardiac demands of exertion may ex-
acerbate the damage produced by the
acute MI. Despite the more ominous
early course, however, there was no dif-
ference in the clinical outcome of pa-
tients with exertion-related and non–
exertion-related MIs at 30 days’ follow-
up. Delay in presentation could have
contributed to MI severity because the
time from symptom onset to emer-
gency department admission tended to
be longer in patients with exertion-
related MI (mean [±SD]: 223 [±118] vs
202 [±90] minutes, P = .08), as was the
time to first angioplasty balloon infla-
tion (mean [±SD]: 297 [±122] vs 279
[±94] minutes, P = .15).
This study has several limitations.
Our analysis is based on patients ad-
mitted with acute MI who were se-
lected for, and treated with, primary an-
gioplasty. Thirty-eight percent of all
patients with MI were excluded pri-
marily because they were treated with
thrombolytic therapy before transfer to
our hospital. The assessment of physi-
cal activity was based on self-report and
it is possible that patients who experi-
enced an exertion-related event under-
estimated their habitual activity level.
This potential problem is not unique to
this study, however, because all previ-
ous studies of exertion-related MI are

based on subjective reports of ha-
bitual physical activity. Coronary
vessel diameter and the presence of
thrombus is difficult to quantify with
angiographic techniques, but all angio-
graphic studies were interpreted by 2
cardiologists without knowledge of the
patient characteristics and any errors in
angiographic measurements should
have similarly affected the results for
both activity groups.
In conclusion, this study demon-
stratesthatexertion-relatedacuteMIoc-
curs predominantly in habitually inac-
tive individuals during unaccustomed
physical activity. These results should
reassure individuals who exercise regu-
larly and public health advocates of
physical activity. The American Col-
lege of Sports Medicine and the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion recommend physical activity
consisting of 3 to 5 METS of exertion on
most, and preferably all, days of the
week.36 Such recommendations appear
prudent since it is likely that the risk of
exercise increases with intensity and
these exercise recommendations are be-
low the level of exertion used to define
an exercise-related cardiac complica-
tion in this and other studies. Our re-
sults also suggest that other cardiac risk
factors such as hyperlipidemia and
smoking should be treated aggres-
sively, especially in middle-aged adults
whoexercisevigorously.Althoughother
evidence suggests that moderate exer-
cise is beneficial, the current results sug-
gest that habitually inactive adults with
elevated cardiac risk should avoid un-
accustomed vigorous exertion.

In Reply. Due to changes in clinical practices over time, the
data cited by Dr Fung from UNOS center-specific graft and pa-
tient survival rates for 1997 are not necessarily comparable with
our data for patients who received transplants during 1990 to
1995. For example, hepatitis B immunoglobulin was not used
routinely by any of the 3 centers during the first years of the
study, and there was little difference among the 3 centers in
the number of patients with hepatitis B. Cytomegalovirus pro-
phylaxis did not differ significantly among the 3 centers; all
centers used regimens that consisted of intravenous ganciclo-
vir, acyclovir, or both; and analyses controlled for donor and
recipient CMV status. Finally, the transfer of patients from the
transplantation hospital to a lower-cost facility rarely oc-
curred in this era. Thus, the differences found in resource use
among the 3 centers were unlikely to have been caused by the
factors suggested by Fung.
Currently, the clinical profile of patients undergoing trans-
plantation in the United States is dictated largely by the crite-
ria used for organ allocation. These criteria represent the ef-
forts of the transplantation community to develop objective
criteria by which suitable patients with the most advanced dis-
ease can be identified and given the highest priority for trans-
plantation. The current scheme for prioritizing patients is based
on the Child-Pugh score.1 In our study, the most important con-
tributor to increased resource use was more advanced liver dis-
ease, defined as patients with a Child-Pugh score of at least 10.
In fact, in most parts of the country, few patients with a score
of less than 10 have sufficient priority to be offered livers. Thus,
national policy is already committed to transplanting livers in
patients who are likely to consume greater resources. More-
over, the Institute of Medicine recently acknowledged that if
broader sharing of livers for transplantation were to occur, as
it recommended, then a greater number of transplantations
would be performed in patients with more advanced disease,
and the costs of liver transplantation would increase.2
As patients with more advanced disease receive a higher
proportion of transplants, there will be increased pressures
to deliver cost-effective care, which requires that a program
be able to quantify the costs of transplantation, and patient
characteristics and clinical services affect those costs. The
issue is whether we are most effectively and efficiently using
our limited clinical and financial resources for organ trans-
plantation.

CORRECTIONS
Omission of Investigator Names: In the Original Contribution entitled “The Ef-
fect of Raloxifene on Risk of Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women: Results
From the MORE Randomized Trial,” published in the June 16, 1999, issue of THE
JOURNAL (1999;281:2189-2197), the names of the study investigators were inad-
vertently omitted and not acknowledged for their contributions to the article. A
full list of the investigators of the study has been subsequently published in the
Original Contribution entitled “Reduction of Vertebral Fracture Risk in Postmeno-
pausal Women With Osteoporosis Treated With Raloxifene: Results From a 3-Year
Randomized Clinical Trial,” published in the August 18, 1999, issue of THE JOURNAL
(1999;282:637-645).
Incorrect Wording: In the Original Contribution entitled “Reduction of Vertebral
Fracture Risk in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis Treated With Ral-
oxifene: Results From a 3-Year Randomized Clinical Trial,” published in the Au-
gust 18, 1999, issue of THE JOURNAL (1999;282:637-645), there was incorrect word-
ing in 2 tables and 1 figure. On page 640 in Table 2, for study group 1, the relative
risk for raloxifene 120 mg/d that read “0.5” should have read “0.6,” and the to-
tal relative risk for raloxifene 120 mg/d that read “0.6” should have read “0.5.”
On page 641 in Table 3, the title that read “Nonvertebral Fractures in 4536 Women
Receiving Raloxifene Hydrochloride Therapy and 2292 Women Receiving Pla-
cebo” should have read “Nonvertebral Fractures in 5129 Women Receiving Ral-
oxifene Hydrochloride Therapy and 2576 Women Receiving Placebo.” On page
642 in the legend for Figure 3, the sentence that read “This represents 2292 women
who received placebo and 4536 women who received raloxifene therapy for os-
teoporosis” should have read “This represents 2576 women who received pla-
cebo and 5129 women who received raloxifene therapy for osteoporosis.”
Incorrect Wording: In the Original Contribution entitled “Clinical and Angio-
graphic Characteristics of Exertion-Related Acute Myocardial Infarction” pub-
lished in the November 10, 1999, issue of THE JOURNAL (1999;282:1731-1736),
there was incorrect wording in the last sentence of the “Results” section on pages
1732-1733. The sentence should read as follows: Patients with an exertion-
related MI were more likely to have established coronary artery disease (CAD) risk
factors including male sex, obesity, current cigarette smoking, and hyperlipidemia
(TABLE 1), and were less likely to use aspirin or b-blockers and tended to have less
hypertension (P = .08) and established cardiac disease (P = .06).
