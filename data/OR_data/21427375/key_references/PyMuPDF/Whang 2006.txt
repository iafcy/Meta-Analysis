EGULAR EXERCISE HAS NUMER-
ous cardiovascular benefits
and has been associated with
improved cardiovascular and
all-cause mortality.1-6 Current recom-
mendations for healthy adults pre-
scribe at least moderate-intensity physi-
cal activity for 30 minutes or longer
almost daily.7 However, as with any rec-
ommendation, individual physicians
must weigh both the benefits and risks
of exercise for individual patients.8 De-
spite all of the known benefits of exer-
cise, there are also well-documented as-
sociations between acute episodes of
exertion and sudden cardiac death.9-15
Although exertion-related sudden car-
diac deaths are relatively rare com-
pared with other health outcomes, these
deaths commonly occur in an unex-
pected fashion among those who ap-
pear quite healthy,16,17 and therefore,
this risk remains troubling for both phy-
sicians and patients.
Among men, it has been estimated
that approximately 6% to 17% of all
sudden cardiac deaths occur in asso-
ciation with acute exertion,9,10,12,13 and
vigorous exertion has been demon-
strated to simultaneously trigger9,10 and
protect9,10,18-22 against sudden cardiac
death. Prior epidemiological and au-
topsy studies14,23,24 have suggested that
women may have a lower risk of exer-
tion-related sudden cardiac death; how-
ever, to our knowledge, there has been
no large-scale prospective assessment
of this risk. The ongoing Nurses’ Health
Study, a cohort of 121 701 women who
have been intensively followed up for
up to 28 years, presented a unique op-
portunity to quantify the absolute and
relative risk (RR) of exertion-related
sudden cardiac death in women and to
further define the possible role regu-

Context Exercise is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events but may tran-
siently increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Its short-term and long-term asso-
ciations with risk of sudden cardiac death among women are unclear.
Objectives To compare the risk of sudden cardiac death in women during moder-
ate to vigorous exertion with the risk of sudden cardiac death during lighter or no ex-
ertion; and to assess the long-term association between moderate to vigorous exer-
cise and sudden cardiac death.
Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective, nested case-crossover study of 288
cases of sudden cardiac death within the Nurses’ Health Study (1980-2004); and a
prospective cohort analysis of 69 693 participants without prior cardiovascular dis-
ease followed up from 1986-2004.
Main Outcome Measure Risk of sudden cardiac death associated with moderate
to vigorous exertion.
Results The absolute risk of sudden cardiac death associated with moderate to vig-
orous exertion was exceedingly low at 1 per 36.5 million hours of exertion. In case-
crossover analyses, the risk of sudden cardiac death was transiently elevated during
moderate to vigorous exertion (relative risk [RR], 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.23-4.60; P=.01) compared with the risk during lesser or no exertion. Habitual mod-
erate to vigorous exertion modified this transient risk (P=.005 for interaction) and the
risk was no longer significantly elevated among those who exercised 2 or more hours
per week. In the cohort analyses, an increasing amount of moderate to vigorous ex-
ercise was associated with a lower long-term risk of sudden cardiac death in age-
adjusted and multivariable models that excluded biological intermediates (P=.006 for
trend). This relationship was attenuated when biological intermediates were included
(P=.06 for trend); however, the reduction in risk remained significant among women
who exercised 4 or more hours per week (adjusted RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.83; P=.01)
compared with women who did not exercise.
Conclusions These prospective data suggest that sudden cardiac death during ex-
ertion is an extremely rare event in women. Regular exercise may significantly mini-
mize this small transient risk and may lower the overall long-term risk of sudden car-
diac death.

of sudden cardiac death.
METHODS
The Nurses’ Health Study Cohort
The Nurses’ Health Study began in 1976
when 121 701 female registered nurses,
aged 30 to 55 years, completed a ques-
tionnaire about their medical history,
coronary heart disease (CHD) risk fac-
tors, and lifestyle factors. The cohort has
been followed up every 2 years with
mailed questionnaires that update ex-
posure information and inquire about
newly diagnosed medical illnesses.
Deaths are reported by next of kin or
postal authorities or identified through
the National Death Index. Family mem-
bers are asked for permission to ob-
tain further information from medical
records and are interviewed about the
circumstances surrounding the death
if it was not adequately documented in
the medical record. Subjects or family
members provided written, informed
consent, and the study was approved
by the institutional review board of
Partners HealthCare System, Boston,
Mass.
Assessment of Habitual
Physical Activity
In 1980, women were asked to report
the average number of combined hours
spent each week over the past year on
moderate to vigorous activities such as
digging in the garden, vigorous sports,
jogging, brisk walking or striding, bi-
cycling, yard work, and housework. Be-
ginning in 1986, questionnaires in-
quired about the average amount of
time spent briskly walking, jogging,
running, bicycling, lap swimming, play-
ing tennis or squash, or participating
in aerobics or calisthenics per week dur-
ing the past year. Information on other
exertional activities was not collected
on the 1986 or 1988 questionnaires.
From 1992 onward, questionnaires
asked about the average amount of time
spent per week in the activities listed
above, in lower-intensity exercise such
as yoga, and in other exertional activi-
ties such as mowing the lawn. Re-
ported moderate to vigorous activity on
this questionnaire has a correlation of
0.62 with reported exertion in 1-week
activity diaries25; and the physical ac-
tivity score from a similar question-
naire had a correlation of 0.54 with
maximal oxygen consumption.26
Definition of Sudden
Cardiac Death
The main study end point was sudden
cardiac death occurring before June 1,
2004. The specific details regarding the
classification of sudden cardiac death
in this cohort are described in detail
elsewhere.17 Briefly, a cardiac death was
considered sudden if the death or car-
diac arrest that precipitated death oc-
curred within 1 hour of symptom on-
set as documented by medical records
or reports from next of kin. Unwit-
nessed deaths that could have oc-
curred within 1 hour of symptom on-
set and that had autopsy findings
consistent with sudden cardiac death
(n=30; 10.4%) were considered prob-
able sudden cardiac deaths and also
were included in the analysis. Because
the rigorous definition of sudden car-
diac death used excludes most deaths
during sleep (and some of these deaths
may have been sudden), the system-
atic exclusion of these deaths in this
analysis could bias our results toward
a positive association. Therefore, we
also performed sensitivity analyses in-
cluding these deaths.
Assessment of Physical Activity
at Time of Death
The specific activity that the partici-
pant was engaged in at the time of sud-
den cardiac death was ascertained from
the medical record or reports from next
of kin. The degree of physical exer-
tion was then quantified on a scale of
1 to 8 metabolic equivalents (1 meta-
bolic equivalent=3.5 mL/kg per minute
of oxygen consumption), and the par-
ticipant was considered exposed to
moderate to vigorous exertion if the ac-
tivity was estimated to be 5 or more
metabolic equivalents.27 If the activity
was unknown (n=67; 23% of cases) or
known to be less than 5 metabolic
equivalents, the participant was con-
sidered unexposed.
Statistical Analyses
Exertion Analyses. For the exertion
analysis, 84 888 women provided in-
formation on hours per week of usual
moderate to vigorous exertion at base-
line in 1980. Information on exertion
was then updated in 1992, 1996, 1998,
and 2000. The absolute risk of exertion-
related sudden cardiac death (ratio of
exertion-related sudden cardiac deaths
to the total hours of usual moderate to
vigorous exertion in the cohort) was
compared with the incidence of sud-
den cardiac death during lesser activ-
ity. The absolute risk difference also was
calculated.
A nested case-crossover design was
used to quantify the RR of sudden car-
diac death during an episode of mod-
erate to vigorous exertion compared
with the risk during periods of lighter
or no exertion.28 In this type of analy-
sis, the stratifying variable is the indi-
vidual patient, as in a crossover experi-
ment in which each individual serves
as both a case and control (self-
matching). For each case of sudden car-
diac death, the ratio of the observed ex-
posure to moderate to vigorous exertion
at the time of the sudden cardiac death
to that expected based on the usual
amount of exertion reported on the
most recent questionnaire was used to
calculate an odds ratio as a measure of
RR.10,28 To assess modification of the RR
by usual exertion, the analysis was then
stratified by 2 categories of habitual ex-
ertion (2 hours per week, 2 hours
per week) and a 2 test for homogene-
ity was used to compare these esti-
mates of RR. Because this design mini-
mizes but does not completely exclude
interindividual confounding, second-
ary analyses were performed that ex-
cluded women who developed CHD
prior to their sudden cardiac death.
Exercise Analyses. For the exercise
analyses, assessments of usual moder-
ate to vigorous exercise were based on
self-reported time spent per week walk-
ing or hiking outdoors at a pace of 3.0
mph or more, jogging, running, bicy-

cling, lap swimming, playing tennis or
squash, participating in other aerobic
exercise such as dance or using a stair
machine, or participating in lower-
intensity exercise such as yoga. Activi-
ties were reported on the 1986, 1988,
1992, 1996, 1998, and 2000 question-
naires. First, the case-crossover analy-
sis was repeated, limiting the expo-
sures to these activities. Second, to
assess the overall long-term associa-
tion between regular moderate to vig-
orous exercise and sudden cardiac
death, a prospective cohort analysis was
performed. Because the presence of
prior disease may influence physical ac-
tivity, women who had reported CHD,
stroke, or cancer prior to 1986 were ex-
cluded, leaving 69 693 women aged 40
to 65 years with physical activity at
baseline. Proportional hazards models
were used to compute age-adjusted and
multivariable-adjusted hazards ratios as
estimates of RR across 4 categories of
exercise. Exercise and other variables
were updated as time-dependent vari-
ables according to the most recent ques-
tionnaire. Tests for linear trend were
performed by assigning each observa-
tion the median value of its correspond-
ing exercise category and by including
this as a continuous variable in sepa-
rate proportional hazards models. All
reported P values are 2-sided. Statisti-
cal analysis was performed using SAS
software version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
There were 288 sudden cardiac death
cases among 84 888 women who
responded to the 1980 questionnaire
over 1.93 million person-years of
follow-up. Of these, only 9 deaths
(3.1%) occurred during an episode of
moderate to vigorous exertion and
only 3 of these occurred during activi-
ties that would be considered exercise.
The specific activities were yard work
(n=3), swimming (n=2), housework
(n=2), physical therapy (n=1), and
shoveling snow (n=1). The overall
risk of sudden cardiac death associated
with moderate to vigorous exertion
was 1 per 36.5 million hours of risk
compared with an incidence of 1 sud-
den cardiac death per 59.4 million
hours of activity with lesser exertion.
Thus, the unadjusted excess risk was
only 1 excess death per 94.7 million
hours of exertion. The overall risk
during moderate to vigorous exercise
was similar to that during exertion at
1 per 41 million hours of risk.
Using the case-crossover method, the
RR of sudden cardiac death during
moderate to vigorous exertion was
modestly elevated at 2.38 (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 1.23-4.60; P=.01)
compared with risk at other time points.
This transient elevation in risk was
lower and no longer significant among
women who reported 2 or more hours
per week of moderate to vigorous ex-
ertion (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.61-3.61)
compared with women who reported
2 or fewer hours per week of exertion
(RR, 8.98; 95% CI, 3.32-24.30; P for in-
teraction=.005). These results did not
materially differ when unheralded
deaths that occurred during sleep were
included, if the exposure was limited
to exercise, or if women with a prior his-
tory of CHD were excluded.
The relationship between habitual
level of exercise and long-term risk of
sudden cardiac death from 1986 to 2004
also was examined. Among 69 693
women without a history of CHD,
stroke, or cancer at baseline, 22 172
(32%) reported no regular moderate to
vigorousexerciseandonly10680(15%)
reported exercising 4 or more hours per
week (TABLE 1). In age-adjusted analy-

(quintiles), and -linolenic acid intake
(quintiles), the inverse relationship be-
tween amount of moderate to vigorous
exercise and sudden cardiac death risk
was attenuated; however, a trend per-
sisted (P=.06 for trend). If plausible
biological intermediates (hyperten-
sion, diabetes, body mass index, hyper-
cholesterolemia, and CHD) that ex-
istedoroccurredpriortosuddencardiac
deathwereexcludedfromthemodel,the
inverse relationship was again statisti-
cally significant (P=.006 for trend). The
reduction in sudden cardiac death risk
was observed primarily among women
whoexercised4ormorehoursperweek
(RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.83; P=.01 in
the fully adjusted model). Again, these
results were similar when unheralded
deaths that occurred during sleep were
included as sudden cardiac deaths. Us-
ing similar multivariable models, all-
cause mortality also was inversely asso-
ciated with greater amounts of exercise
(Table 2; P.001 for trend). Similar re-
sults for all-cause mortality were noted
when the first 4 years of follow-up were
excluded as a way of reducing the risk
of reverse causality.
COMMENT
In this large prospective cohort of
women, the absolute risk of exertion-
related sudden cardiac death was ex-
ceedingly low (1 per 36 million hours of
risk). Although there was a transient el-
evation in risk associated with exer-
tion, this elevation was modest and was
limited to the less habitually active
women. In addition, the overall long-
termriskofsuddencardiacdeathtended
to be lower among women who partici-
pated in greater amounts of moderate to
vigorous exercise, particularly among
thosewhoexercised4ormorehoursper
weekinwhichtheriskreductionwassig-
nificant.Consistentwithpriorreportson
the Nurses’ Health Study cohort, total
mortality was significantly lower among
women who exercised regularly.5
To our knowledge, this analysis is the
first to prospectively assess both the
transient and long-term risk of sud-
den cardiac death associated with physi-
cal activity among women. Although
our data are consistent with prior analy-
ses in men that suggest that physical ex-
ertion may trigger sudden cardiac death
and that habitual exercise diminishes
this risk,9,10 the magnitude of the risk
is much lower in this cohort of women
compared with a similar cohort of men10
in which the risk was 1 sudden car-
diac death per 1.51 million episodes of
vigorous exertion. Despite lower base-
line absolute risks of sudden cardiac
death in these women, the RR during
an episode of vigorous exertion was ap-
proximately 19-fold higher (RR, 44.9;
95% CI, 26.7-75.4) among men en-
rolled in the Physicians’ Health Study10
than that observed during an episode
of moderate to vigorous exertion in the
Nurses’ Health Study cohort (RR, 2.38;
95% CI, 1.23-4.60). Part of this differ-
ence could be due to the inclusion of
moderate exertion in our exercise mea-
sure. However, a similar sex differ-
ence was observed in smaller retrospec-
tive studies in Finland14 and in the
United States24 where the same mea-
sures of exercise yielded a 9-fold to 14-
fold higher risk of exertion-related sud-
den cardiac death among men.
There are several limitations to our
study. Our study cannot prove causal-
ity, and the association between exer-
cise and sudden cardiac death could at
leastinpartbeduetoresidualconfound-
ing. This is particularly true for the total
mortality result in which prior analy-
ses in this cohort demonstrated that part
of this association is likely due to re-
verse causation (ill health leads to sed-
entary behavior). Because the majority
of women who experience a sudden car-
diac death were previously healthy, the

bias of reverse causation is less prob-
lematic for the primary sudden cardiac
death analysis. Although we attempted
to update physical activity as fre-
quently as possible, there is still the
chance for misclassification between
questionnaire years. If such misclassi-
fication were random, then our results
would be biased toward attenuating the
associationbetweenphysicalactivityand
sudden cardiac death. Finally, al-
though this is the largest prospective
study of exertion-related sudden car-
diac death in women, the rarity of this
event and the resultant small number of
exertion-related sudden cardiac deaths
in the case-crossover analyses limits the
precision of our estimates.
In summary, sudden cardiac death
during exertion is an extremely rare
event in women, and exercising regu-
larly can significantly minimize risk.
Therefore, these data should provide re-
assurance that moderate to vigorous lev-
els of exercise can be prescribed in a safe
fashion to women, and if performed
regularly, exercise may even lower long-
term risk of sudden cardiac death.
