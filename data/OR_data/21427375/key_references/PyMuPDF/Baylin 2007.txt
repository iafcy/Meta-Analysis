PURPOSE: There are no data for factors that could trigger myocardial infarction (MI) in the context of
lifestyles in developing countries.
METHODS: Using a caseecrossover design, we assessed the effect of heavy physical exertion, sexual ac-
tivity, acute respiratory tract infections, and gastroenteritis as triggers for MI in 530 survivors of a ﬁrst MI
from Costa Rica.
RESULTS: Relative risks (RRs) for MI in the hour after heavy physical exertion and 2 hours after sexual
activity were 4.94 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 3.73e6.54) and 5.47 (95% CI, 2.71e11.02). Risk for MI
after heavy physical exertion was greater for patients with poor physical ﬁtness or elevated underlying car-
diovascular risk (p ! 0.0001 and p Z 0.06, tests of homogeneity). RRs for acute respiratory tract infection
and gastroenteritis were 1.48 (95% CI, 0.92e2.38) and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.95e1.69), respectively. Patients
with three or more risk factors had an RR for MI for gastroenteritis of 2.08 (95% CI, 1.31e3.28).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results conﬁrm previous studies in developed countries showing that heavy phys-
ical exertion and sexual activity are potential triggers for MI, and their effect is modiﬁed by physical ﬁtness
and underlying cardiovascular risk. Additional studies that explore the biologic effects of gastroenteritis as
triggers of MI are warranted.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of coronary heart disease is increasing in de-
veloping countries undergoing socioeconomic transition
(1). Lifestyles in many of these countries are dramatically
different from those in Europe and the United States. For ex-
ample, vigorous physical activity is more likely to be related
to work than to recreational activities (2). The pattern of
acute infections also is distinct, with a greater incidence
than in developed countries. In addition, because transition
countries are characterized by the presence of both infec-
tious and chronic disease (3), the study of gastroenteritis ep-
isodes as a trigger of myocardial infarction (MI) is of
particular interest in these countries. Cardiovascular disease
(CVD) as a major health problem was established only
recently in transition societies, and very few studies exam-
ined factors affecting CVD in the context of these different
lifestyles (4).
Most epidemiologic studies of CVD focused on long-term
exposures that lead to the onset of disease. However, a more
recent area of research focused on short-term events that
trigger MI (5). Using the caseecrossover design, it was es-
tablished that heavy physical exertion and sexual activity
are major triggers for MI in Western countries (6e12).
Other known triggers for MI include stress, heavy meals,
lack of sleep, and hot or cold weather (13e16). Acute respi-
ratory tract and urinary tract infections also were identiﬁed
as potential triggers for MI, although data are scarce (17,
18). To date, there are no data on factors that could trigger
MI in the context of lifestyles in developing countries. Con-
ﬁrmation of physical exertion as a trigger for MI in other
countries with different patterns of exposure may support
the causality of the observed relationship in developed
populations. Furthermore, better understanding of the effect
of these and other triggers in developing countries may help
identify strategies for prevention.
The mechanism by which a potential transient exposure
may trigger MI is related to the existence of vulnerable
atherosclerotic plaques. Heavy physical exertion, including
sexual activity, could induce a cascade of events that result
in MI through their effect on the sympathetic nervous system
(19). Conversely, infections can act on plaque vulnerability

a trigger may be stronger in the presence of predisposing fac-
tors because patients with a higher number of risk factors
would have more vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.
Using a caseecrossover design, we assessed the effect of
heavy physical exertion, sexual activity, acute respiratory
tract infections, and gastroenteritis as triggers for nonfatal
acute MI and whether physical ﬁtness and underlying car-
diovascular risk can modify their triggering effect.
METHODS
Study Population
The study population consists of 530 incident cases of non-
fatal acute MI recruited between 1995 and 1998 in the Cen-
tral Valley of Costa Rica (21). Eligible case subjects were
men and women diagnosed as survivors of a ﬁrst acute MI
by two independent cardiologists at any of the three recruit-
ing hospitals in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. All cases
met World Health Organization criteria for MI, which re-
quire typical symptoms plus either elevated cardiac enzyme
levels or diagnostic changes on electrocardiogram (22). En-
rollment was carried out while cases were in the hospital’s
stepdown unit. We screened all survivors of a ﬁrst nonfatal
MI during the recruitment period (1995 to 1998). Of those,
97% agreed to participate. The main reason for nonpartici-
pation was feeling weak and not willing to undergo extra
tests. All subjects gave informed consent on documents ap-
proved by the Human Subjects Committee at the Harvard
School of Public Health and the University of Costa Rica.
Data Collection and Exposure Deﬁnition
Sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle history, and
medical history data were collected during an interview by
using a questionnaire with close-ended questions (23). In-
terviews were carried out by trained personnel who followed
a standardized protocol when asking each relevant question.
Time between exposure and event was collected in hours or
days, depending on the exposure of interest and potential
hazard period (hours for heavy physical exertion and sexual
activity and days for infections). Usual physical activity was
determined by asking subjects the average frequency and
time spent on several occupational and leisure-time activi-
ties during the last year. These activities were grouped
into six categories according to their intensity, or metabolic
equivalents (METS). One MET is deﬁned as the energy ex-
penditure for sitting quietly or approximately 1 kcal per kg1
body weight per h1 (24). Categories included: (i) lying qui-
etly in bed: afternoon siesta (nap or rest) and night sleep (0.9
MET); (ii) sitting (1.0 MET); (iii) light indoor activity (2.4
METS); (iv) moderate outdoor activity, such as gardening,
light agriculture and construction, and walking on ﬂat sur-
faces (2.5 to 4.5 METS); and (v) vigorous aerobic activity,
such as heavy agriculture and construction, walking uphill,
climbing stairs, jogging, and other sports and strenuous
anaerobic activity, such as carrying, pushing, and lifting
a heavy object (6.0 to 8.5 METS). Time spent on each ac-
tivity was calculated as the product of frequency (times
per week) and duration (hours per time). Time spent on ac-
tivities exceeding 6 METS was used to calculate usual heavy
physical exertion. Energy expenditure for each activity was
calculated as the product of frequency, time, and intensity
(METS). This questionnaire was validated by its ability to
predict ﬁtness level measured by the Harvard step test,
plasma lipid levels, and obesity in our previous studies in Pu-
riscal, Costa Rica (25, 26).
Statistical Analysis
Five hundred thirty incident cases of nonfatal MI were re-
cruited for this analysis. Ten people died before collecting
all the necessary information. The number of patients
with complete and consistent information ranges from 470
to 499, depending on the exposure of interest. We used
a caseecrossover design in which data were analyzed as
a stratiﬁed analysis by the individual patient (5, 27, 28).
Within individual patients, exposure during a hazard period
preceding the MI is compared with the habitual frequency of
exposure during the last year. Hazard periods were selected
based on the literature: within 1 hour for heavy physical ex-
ertion (6, 7, 10), within 2 hours for sexual activity (8, 12),
and within 6 days for acute respiratory tract infections (17,
18) and gastroenteritis. Person-time exposed was calculated
by using the habitual frequency of heavy physical exertion
and sexual activity or frequency of infections during the
last year. Person-time not exposed was calculated by sub-
tracting person-time exposed from total hours in 1 year
(8766 h/y) or the total of days in 1 year (365 d/y), depending
on the exposure of interest. Relative risk (RR) was estimated
as the ratio between the observed exposure odds at the time
of MI onset (i.e., during the hazard period) and the expected
exposure odds (i.e., habitual frequency) (5, 27). Conﬁdence
intervals (CIs) were calculated by using methods for sparse
follow-up data (29). Chi-square tests of homogeneity of
RR across strata were used to assess effect modiﬁcation by
stratifying factors (29).
We stratiﬁed patients according to both physical ﬁtness
and number of established risk factors for coronary heart

disease. Sedentary people are deﬁned as those expending less
than 10% of their daily energy in the performance of mod-
erate to vigorous activities (at least four times the basal me-
tabolism rate) (30). Because no other cutoff values are
described in the literature to classify people according to en-
ergy expenditure ratio, we used 20% and 50%, which corre-
spond to the top quartile and top decile in this population,
respectively. Underlying cardiovascular risk was estimated
as the sum of the following risk factors: history of diabetes,
history of hypertension, history of hypercholesterolemia,
history of angina, smoking status, and waist circumference.
Self-reported diabetes and hypertension were validated by
using the recommended deﬁnitions by the Expert Commit-
tee on the Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation of Diabetes Mellitus
(31) and the Third Joint National Committee on Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (32) and
found to be reliable in this population (23). Smoking status
is deﬁned as smoking one or more cigarettes per day. Waist
circumference was measured twice, and the average of the
two measurements was dichotomized according to the Adult
Treatment Panel III deﬁnition of metabolic syndrome (33)
(O88 cm for women and O102 cm for men). Because there
are no preestablished cutoff values to classify people at high
risk, we decided to use the top quintile of the distribution of
the sum of risk factors. The top quintile of the distribution
corresponded to patients with three or more risk factors.
We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess the ro-
bustness of our ﬁndings. Interviewers assigned a credibility
score to every participant based on their evaluation of the
way the participant answered the questionnaire. When de-
leting people with a low credibility score, results did not
change. Although this measure of credibility was assigned
by the interviewer and therefore is subjective, it may help
identify patients with more reliable information than others.
Other sensitivity analyses performed included deletion of
people administered b-blockers. All these sensitivity analy-
ses yielded similar results.
All analyses were carried out using SAS (version 9.1;
SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and PEPI (V.4.0; Sagebrush Press,
Salt Lake City, UT, 2001).
RESULTS
Table 1 lists general characteristics of study participants. On
average, women had more established MI risk factors than
men (2.15 versus 1.48). Table 2 lists the usual frequencies of
the exposures of interest. The overall prevalence of sedentar-
ism was 66.1%, but was particularly high among women
(89.9%). Moderate to vigorous physical activities were more
work related than recreational. Recreational activities repre-
sented on average only 7% of the total time spent in moderate
to vigorous physical activities. Furthermore, the most active
patients (top decile of the expenditure ratio in moderate to
vigorous activities, O50%), spent 6 hours 30 minutes daily
(SD Z 2 hours 30 minutes) on average on moderate to vigor-
ous work-related activities, whereas recreational activities
(sports) accounted only for 6 minutes daily (SD Z 30 min-
utes). Patients from rural areas were more active than patients
from urban areas (49% can be considered sedentary in rural
areas versus 69% in urban areas), also mostly because of
work-related activities (data not shown). Acute respiratory
tract infections were more prevalent than gastroenteritis epi-
sodes; 52% experienced at least one episode of acute respira-
tory tract infection and 28% experienced at least one
episode of gastroenteritis during the last year.
Of 480 patients, 53 reported doing heavy physical exer-
tion within the hour before the onset of MI. RR for MI
in the hour after doing heavy physical exertion was 4.94
(95% CI, 3.73e6.54; Table 3). Eight of 470 patients reported

having sexual activity within the 2 hours before MI, resulting
in an RR of 5.47 (95% CI, 2.71e11.02; Table 3). Seventeen
patients reported having an acute respiratory tract infection
within the 6 days before MI, and 14 patients reported gastro-
enteritis. RRs were 1.48 (95% CI, 0.92e2.38) for experienc-
ing an acute respiratory tract infection within 6 days before
the onset of MI and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.95e1.69) for experienc-
ing gastroenteritis (Table 3).
When stratifying by usual energy expenditure ratio in
moderate to vigorous physical activities, risk for experienc-
ing an MI because of heavy physical exertion was very high
among sedentary patients (RR, 27.49; 95% CI, 18.64e
40.54) and decreased monotonically as energy expenditure
in moderate to vigorous activities increased (p ! 0.0001,
test of homogeneity). Risk for people expending 50% of
their total daily energy expenditure in moderate to vigorous
physical activities (top decile of the population) was 1.33
(95% CI, 0.63e2.85; Table 4). Sedentarism did not modify
the effect of sexual activity as a trigger for MI, although the
number of cases exposed during the hazard period was low
and RR among more active patients was somewhat lower
than that for sedentary patients (5.07 versus 6.06; Table 4).
We next stratiﬁed patients according to number of
established risk factors for coronary heart disease. Patients
with three or more risk factors (n Z 101) had an RR for
MI of 8.22 (95% CI, 4.61e14.67) in the hour after doing
heavy physical exertion. Conversely, RR was 4.37 (95%
CI, 3.17e6.03; p Z 0.06, test of homogeneity) in patients
with fewer than three risk factors (n Z 374). Energy

expenditure in moderate to vigorous physical activities was
slightly less for patients with three or more risk factors com-
pared with patients with fewer than three risk factors, but
the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. Number of
risk factors did not modify the triggering effect of acute re-
spiratory tract infections (p Z 0.51, test of homogeneity),
although RR for patients with three or more risk factors
was slightly higher (Table 4). However, for gastroenteritis
exposure, patients with three or more risk factors (n Z
101) had an RR for MI of 2.08 (95% CI, 1.31e3.28),
whereas patients with fewer than three risk factors (n Z
400) had an RR of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.64e1.34; p Z 0.007,
test of homogeneity). Stratiﬁcation by number of risk factors
for sexual activity was not possible because there were no
cases with three or more risk factors exposed to sexual activ-
ity within the 2 hours before the onset of MI. However,
when using two or more risk factors as a cutoff value, risk
for MI was lower among those with fewer than two risk fac-
tors, although not statistically signiﬁcant (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
This study shows that heavy physical exertion and sexual ac-
tivity are potential triggers for MI in a non-Western country
undergoing socioeconomic transition. The triggering effect
of these factors was modiﬁed by physical ﬁtness. The modi-
fying effect of physical ﬁtness on heavy physical exertion was
monotonic, with sedentary people at greatest risk and null
risk for highly active people. The effect of heavy physical ex-
ertion was particularly strong for people with three or more
risk factors for coronary heart disease. We did not ﬁnd a sig-
niﬁcant effect for acute respiratory tract infections and
gastroenteritis, although gastroenteritis may trigger MI
in patients at high underlying cardiovascular risk.
Our results for heavy physical exertion and sexual ac-
tivity are consistent with those from previous studies
(6e12, 34, 35). This is particularly interesting for heavy
physical exertion given that the pattern of physical activ-
ity undoubtedly is different in a country such as Costa
Rica, especially for people in rural areas for whom phys-
ical activity is mainly in the form of work to earn a living.
As in previous studies (6, 7, 10, 35), risk of heavy phys-
ical exertion was modiﬁed by a measure of physical ﬁtness
(expenditure ratio in moderate to vigorous physical activ-
ities). This measure allowed us to classify people as seden-
tary if expending less than 10% of their daily energy in
the performance of moderate to vigorous activities (30).
When analyzing different cutoff values for expenditure ra-
tio from 10% (sedentary people) to 50% (highly active
people), risk of heavy physical exertion showed a mono-
tonic trend, with the greatest risk among sedentary peo-
ple (27.49; 95% CI, 18.64e40.54) and no association
for

who

highly
active
(1.33;

ism in Costa Rica, particularly in urban areas and for
women, is a reason for concern. Heavy physical exertion
also was modiﬁed by the number of risk factors for

coronary heart disease. People with three or more risk
factors had a greater risk, supporting our hypothesis that
patients with a higher number of risk factors would
have more vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques to the effect
of potential triggers. Modiﬁcation by usual physical activ-
ity was not signiﬁcant for sexual activity, but there were
only a small number of people exposed during the hazard
period. However, RRs were in the expected direction
(lower for more physically active people), as described
in other studies (8, 12). We could not evaluate the mod-
ifying effect of number of risk factors on sexual activity
because there were no people with three or more risk
factors exposed during the hazard period.
The potential triggering effect of infections is less ex-
plored in the literature, but is supported by the observation
of a greater incidence of mortality for ischemic heart disease
during the inﬂuenza season (36, 37) and the existence of
a plausible biologic mechanism through the effect of sys-
temic inﬂammation on plaque vulnerability (17, 18, 20).
Meir et al. (17) found an RR of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.6e4.7) for
the triggering effect of acute respiratory tract infections in
the 10 days before MI. Smeeth et al. (18) found similar re-
sults for acute respiratory tract infections and also for urinary
tract infections, although the risk was lower for the latter.
However, there are no reports of the effect of gastroenteritis.
Interestingly, we found an effect for gastroenteritis for peo-
ple with three or more risk factors for coronary heart disease.
However, these results should be interpreted with caution
because the information for infections was self-reported
and thus more likely to be misclassiﬁed. The question used
to address this issue did not exclude other gastrointestinal
problems that may cause diarrhea and/or vomiting, but are
not related to infections. However, the existence of a biolog-
ically plausible hypothesis (i.e., systemic inﬂammation) and
the high incidence of gastroenteritis episodes in developing
countries make these results attractive enough to deserve
further attention. Although a recent metaanalysis did not
ﬁnd an effect of antichlamydial antibiotic therapy in reduc-
ing cardiovascular events (38), we cannot discard that other
infectious agents may have an effect on MI. Future studies
with better and more reliable information will be necessary
before making deﬁnitive conclusions on the role of gastroen-
teritis as a trigger for MI.
As in all caseecrossover studies, the self-matching nature
of the design removes confounding by ﬁxed characteristics,
but does not control for confounders that change over time
(5). Cardiovascular events have a circadian pattern, with
a greater risk peak in the morning and another in the after-
noon (19, 39). However, this potential bias by time of day is
unlikely to happen for the studied triggers. Sexual activity
does not coincide with morning and afternoon peak of in-
creased risk for MI (12), and heavy physical activities are
distributed throughout the day. A second limitation is
misclassiﬁcation of usual activity (sexual or physical) or
usual frequency of infections because of recall bias. We
had a measure of credibility of the answers provided by the
patients, evaluated by the interviewer. When deleting pa-
tients who scored low, results were very similar, showing
that the ﬁndings are robust. Although we cannot rule out to-
tally the possibility of underreporting, the strength of the as-
sociation for physical and sexual activity is too high to be
caused exclusively by underreporting of potential triggers
for MI (10). Nevertheless, because physical activities are
hard to classify, we expect some misclassiﬁcation that may
affect results. Finally, other triggers, such as heavy meals
and stress, which may concur with heavy physical exertion
and sexual activity, may be confounding our associations.
Cases triggered by heavy physical exertion were spread along
the day; therefore, confounding by heavy meals is unlikely.
We asked patients what they thought was the main cause for
their MI. Most people answered stress (40%), followed by
smoking (14%) and general mood before the MI (10%). If
we exclude from analysis those who answered stress or gen-
eral mood before the MI, results still hold for physical activ-
ity (RR, 4.02; 95% CI, 2.81e5.74) and sex (RR, 5.05; 95%
CI, 1.88e13.55). Therefore, confounding by concurrent
stress or anger episodes is unlikely. Nevertheless, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility of other causal pathways,
as in all observational studies.
The most likely mechanism for the triggering effect of
heavy physical exertion and sexual activity is increased sym-
pathetic activity, particularly in nontrained individuals. In-
creased platelet aggregability and increased coronary
vasomotor tone also may be involved as potential underly-
ing mechanisms (14). Other acute exposures may trigger
MI through different mechanisms. For example, heavy
meals induce a prooxidative state resulting in circulating
biomarkers of inﬂammation, such as interleukin 6, tumor
necrosis factor a, and adhesion molecules, and producing
acute impairment in endothelial function (16, 40).
In summary, we show the triggering effect of heavy phys-
ical exertion and sexual activity on risk for MI in a Costa
Rican population. This effect is stronger for subjects with
poor physical ﬁtness and high underlying cardiovascular
risk. Additional studies that explore the biologic effects of
infections as triggers for MI are warranted.
