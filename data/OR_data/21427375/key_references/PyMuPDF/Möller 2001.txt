Abstract
Objective—To investigate sexual activity as a trigger of myocardial infarction and the potential
eVect modiﬁcation of physical ﬁtness.
Design—A case-crossover study nested in the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Programme
(SHEEP).
Setting—Stockholm County from April 1993 to December 1994.
Patients—All patients with a ﬁrst episode of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction admitted to
coronary care units were eligible, and 699 patients participated in an interview.
Main outcome measures—Relative risks with 95% conﬁdence intervals.
Results—Only 1.3% of the patients without premonitory symptoms had sexual activity during
two hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction was
2.1 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.7 to 6.5) during one hour after sexual activity, and the risk
among patients with a sedentary life was 4.4 (95% CI 1.5 to 12.9).
Conclusions—The increased risk of myocardial infarction after sexual activity and the further
increase in risk among the less physically ﬁt support the hypothesis of causal triggering by sexual
activity. However, the absolute risk per hour is very low, and exposure is relatively infrequent.
Thus having sex once a week only increases the annual risk of myocardial infarction slightly.
Counselling should focus on encouraging patients to live a physically active life and not on
abstaining from sexual activity.

Keywords: myocardial infarction; sexual activity
The issue of whether sexual activity might trig-
ger an infarct is important when counselling
patients at risk of acute coronary disease. Such
patients often have preconceived ideas about
the
risks
involved
in
having
sex.1 2
Until
recently no epidemiological study has been
able to make a valid estimate of the relative risk
with the aid of control data. The advice physi-
cians give, if they give any at all, has therefore
been based largely on case reports and on indi-
rect conclusions drawn from studies of the
physiological strain on the heart during sexual
activity.2–8
The new case-crossover design has proved to
be an important tool in studying the triggering
of disease, oVering more reliable evidence
about
causality
and
a
better
quantitative
estimation of the risk of disease.
9 In the ﬁrst
case-crossover study of sexual activity and
myocardial infarction, Muller and colleagues
reported a relative risk of 2.5 (95% conﬁdence
interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.7) during two hours after
sexual activity, and a further increase in risk
among physically inactive persons.
10 11 How-
ever, the increase in absolute risk was very
small and this has important implications for
any clinical and public health advice that might
be given. This is the second case-crossover
study on this topic. Its objectives were to
analyse whether sexual activity might trigger
the onset of myocardial infarction and whether
the eVect is modiﬁed by physical ﬁtness, and
also to quantify the increase in risk.
Methods
The Swedish onset study is nested in the
Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Programme
(SHEEP), a population based case–control
study of causes of myocardial infarction. The
study base includes all Swedish citizens 45–70
years of age living in Stockholm County, with
no previous myocardial infarction.

The study has a case-crossover design. The
development of this new epidemiological study
design was inspired by “N of 1” trials, in which
a patient serves as his or her own control when
crossing back and forth between periods of
treatment and placebo.14 The case-crossover
design is also based on within individual com-
parisons, although mostly not randomised.
The starting point is that most people in their
daily life cross over between short periods of
exposure to hypothetical triggers and much
longer periods of unexposed time. Three types
of information are needed: the time of disease
onset; knowledge of whether the trigger was
present during a deﬁned period immediately
before onset; and the usual frequency of trigger
exposure (ﬁg 1). The “hazard period” is the
period before disease onset during which the
trigger has an eVect. Whether a case is exposed
to the trigger or not during the hazard period
determines the case information and makes it
possible to calculate the observed exposure
odds. The control information consists of
expected exposure odds, which are based on
the proportion of exposed person–time for
each patient (the usual frequency) during a

By
pooling
individually
matched comparisons a relative risk can be cal-
culated. The relative risk measures the prob-
ability of the onset of the event during a period
of exposure relative to a period of non-
exposure.
The
study
population
consisted
of
all
patients with a ﬁrst event of non-fatal acute
myocardial infarction in the SHEEP study base
from April 1993 to December 1994 who was
admitted to one of the coronary care units in
Stockholm County’s hospitals. In all, 1489
patients with ﬁrst event myocardial infarcts
were eligible in SHEEP during this period, and
of these persons, 699 were interviewed. A
majority of the 790 patients who were not
interviewed (495) had died or were too sick to
be contacted for the Onset study. Myocardial
infarction was diagnosed according to the
criteria developed by the Swedish Society of
Cardiology in 1991. After the exclusion of
cases with missing, unreliable, or inaccurate
information regarding time of disease onset or
exposure, 659 cases remained. Some relevant
characteristics of the Onset study population
are shown in table 1. Details concerning the

Information was obtained by interviews
conducted by specially trained nurses during
the hospital stay or soon after discharge. Each
interviewer obtained information on all epi-
sodes of pain (time, type, duration, and so on)
and other symptoms and circumstances during
the four days before myocardial infarction in
order to determine the precise time of disease
onset. The start of diagnostic chest pain was
used as a marker of disease onset. Premonitory
symptoms were deﬁned as any symptoms
fulﬁlling the criteria of a diagnostic symptom
experienced over the four day period before the
diagnosed onset of disease.
Exposure to sexual activity was identiﬁed in
the interview by the question: “When was the
last time before your infarction that you
engaged in sexual activity?”. Patients could
state their response in terms of how many min-
utes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years ago
the activity took place. The usual annual
frequency was assessed through the question
“How often?”, allowing the patient to answer in
terms of number of times a day, week, month,
or year. Patients having sex more than once a
month were asked an additional question: “At
what time during the day do you usually engage
in sexual intercourse?”. In order to obtain
information on data quality, interviewers made
a judgement about and noted whether or not
the questions regarding sexual activity seemed
to embarrass the patient.
Physical ﬁtness was determined by questions
on the frequency and intensity of the usual level
of physical exercise. Such questions were asked
in the SHEEP questionnaire (answered by
91% of the Onset cases). For the analysis of
eVect modiﬁcation, patients were placed in two
categories: “very little exercise” or “isolated
walks”, and “occasional exercise” or “regular
exercise (at least once a week)”. Other potential
triggers were assessed through the interview as
described in earlier published papers.15 16
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
An episode of sexual activity was assumed to
have a short duration and to occur infrequently
enough for hazard periods not to overlap.
Standard Mantel–Haenszel methods for follow
up studies with sparse data in each stratum
were used for the statistical analysis.17–19 The
eVect was measured as a relative risk, estimated
by the ratio between the observed exposure
odds at the time of disease onset and the
expected exposure odds. Through stratiﬁcation
by potential eVect modiﬁcation of physical ﬁt-
ness, group speciﬁc relative risks were assessed,
and diVerences between groups were examined
by ÷2 tests.
20 Calculations were made using SAS
version 6.12 and Microsoft Excel 7.0.
Results
Premonitory symptoms were experienced by
39.5% of the patients (260/659). As the
premonitory symptoms might lead to a biased
estimation of the relative risk, our main analy-
ses were restricted to the group of patients who
had not had any premonitory symptoms. None
of the patients with experience of a premoni-
tory symptom had been engaged in sexual
activity during the four hours before their
infarction.
Among patients who did not have any
premonitory symptoms, 1.3% (5/399) were
exposed to sexual activity during the two hours
before
their
infarction.
During
the
hour
directly before the infarct (0–60 minutes) a
raised point estimate of 2.1 (95% CI 0.7 to 6.5)
was found, and during the hazard period before
that hour (61–120 minutes) a risk of 1.4 (95%
CI 0.3 to 5.8) remained (table 2). The point
estimate of the relative risk during the total two
hour hazard period was 1.8 (95% CI 0.7 to
4.3) (table 2). In the analyses of all cases, the

increase in relative risk was less pronounced
due to the lack of exposed cases in the group
with premonitory symptoms.
An analysis of potential eVect modiﬁcation
was performed for patients without premoni-
tory symptoms and with a hazard period of two
hours. The analysis
showed
a
substantial
diVerence in trigger risk depending on the
physical exercise pattern of the patient, al-
though this diVerence was not signiﬁcant (÷2
test: p = 0.10). In the group of patients who
normally get very little exercise the relative risk
was 4.4 (95% CI 1.5 to 12.9), compared with
the relative risk of 0.7 (95% CI 0.1 to 5.1) for
patients with a more active exercise pattern.
Discussion
The results of our study are very similar to the
ﬁndings of Muller and colleagues, and support
their conclusion that sexual activity is a poten-
tial trigger of myocardial infarction.10 Our
studies are almost identical in their method-
ology. Muller and colleagues used the case-
crossover study design, had similar question-
naires, and
used
interviews
for
gathering
exposure information.10 There are, however,
also some diVerences. The Stockholm study
was nested in a population based case–control
study, with an age span of subjects of 25 years
(45–70 years), a much shorter interval than the
20–92 years in the Boston study (mean ages
59.1 and 54.9, respectively). The present study
covered only ﬁrst time myocardial infarcts,
whereas Muller and colleagues included pa-
tients with a history of myocardial infarction.
The Boston study was larger, with 1633
patients, of whom 858 (48%) were sexually
active during the year before the infarction,
compared with 659 patients in our study, with
560 (85%) being sexually active. We found
0.9% (5/560) of the sexually active patients
were exposed during the two hour hazard
period (1.4% (5/345) among patients without
premonitory symptoms). The corresponding
percentage for the Boston study was 3.0.10
Muller and colleagues used frequency of
physical exertion per week as a measure of
physical ﬁtness, and found that the trigger risk
of sexual activities decreases with increased
physical activity.10 The result of our analysis of
eVect modiﬁcation also supports the ﬁnding of
Muller and colleagues. Employing usual fre-
quency of physical exertion from the Onset
interview instead of the SHEEP questionnaire
does not alter our conclusions.
The Swedish onset study was designed to
study various potential triggers, not just sexual
activity.15 16 Among our 699 interviewed pa-
tients we could not expect to ﬁnd more than a
small number of cases exposed to sexual activ-
ity before infarction. Our results support the
earlier study but should be interpreted with
caution because of the weakness in precision.
To
avoid
bias, the
ﬁnal
analyses
were
restricted to patients without premonitory
symptoms. If a premonitory symptom indicates
the beginning of disease onset—such as plaque
rupture or early coronary thrombosis—case
exposure would be misclassiﬁed. The hazard
period of interest would be that preceding the
premonitory symptom and not the period
before diagnostic chest pain. The presence of
premonitory symptoms may also cause a
“reverse causation bias”—patients with pre-
monitory symptoms might abstain from the
sexual
activity
they
normally
would
have
undertaken at this time. Accordingly, none of
the patients with premonitory symptoms were
engaged in sexual activity during a period of
four hours before their infarcts. In future stud-
ies the role of premonitory symptoms should
be considered.
The self matching feature of the case-
crossover design eliminates the problem of
confounding eVects of stable risk factors with
long induction periods. The morning peak in
the incidence of myocardial infarction does not
coincide with the peak of sexual activity, as the
sexual activity normally took place in the
evenings or nights. Therefore potential bias by
time of day would not lead to an overestimation
of the true risk. None of the exposed cases had
been exposed to other known triggers, such as
physical exertion and anger, during the same
hazard period as the exposure to sexual activity.
Confounding by other known triggers is there-
fore also excluded.
Misclassiﬁcation of the control information
constitutes an important validity problem in
case-crossover studies.17 The reported usual
frequency of sexual activity might be inﬂu-
enced by several factors, such as recall, estima-
tion problems, shyness, and a desire to report
what is thought to be normal. During the
interview, the interviewer evaluated, and noted
in the questionnaire, whether patients seemed
embarrassed at having to answer questions
about their sex life. Most of the patients (78%;
545/699) did not seem to be bothered at all,
and they reported on average a higher usual
frequency of sexual activity than those who
seemed embarrassed or somewhat disturbed.
Restricting the analyses to patients who did not
seem embarrassed did not substantially change
our results. Overreporting the usual frequency
of sexual activity would lead to an underesti-
mation of the true relative risk. The sexually
active patients in this study reported sexual
activity approximately four times a month. In a
recent, large descriptive survey of the sexual
behaviour of Swedes it was found that in the
age group 50–56 years, men on average had
sexual intercourse about four times per month,
and women about three times a month.

in distinguishing between very low annual fre-
quencies and missing responses. This might
imply some degree of under reporting and lead
to an overestimation of relative risk, but to
eliminate the observed relative risk entirely as
much as half of all the sexual activity must on
average have been unreported. This seems
unlikely. Further, when we conﬁne the analyses
to patients with conﬁdent reports of the usual
frequency, the relative risk did not alter.
The design eliminates the problem of control
selection, but the results may still be biased by
case selection. If cases exposed to sex during or
shortly before their infarction were less in-
clined to participate in the study, participation
bias would result in underestimation. We have,
however, no indication that this was the case.
Also, case selection caused by survival bias can
appear if exposed cases have a worse or a bet-
ter prognosis simply by virtue of the fact that
they were exposed.
In interpreting our results from a public
health perspective, it is important to consider
the absolute risk of myocardial infarction. In
the Stockholm area during the SHEEP study
years the average risk of a ﬁrst myocardial inf-
arct for men and women in the age interval
45–70 years was 0.300/million person–hours,
which
corresponds
to
an
annual
risk
of
0.263%. A man aged 56–60 years having sex
once a week increases his annual risk of
myocardial infarction from 0.464% to 0.468%
(an annual risk ratio of 1.01). That the increase
in annual risk is so small depends on the infre-
quency of sexual activity and the short eVect
period (approximately two hours). The results
of the Boston study suggest a lower trigger risk
for women than for men. An analysis stratiﬁed
by sex was not possible in our study due to lack
of statistical power.
Even among people with a raised baseline
risk, such as those who had had an earlier myo-
cardial infarct, the increase in risk on a yearly
basis is not at all large. In SHEEP, the risk of
reinfarction within one year was 10.5% among
patients surviving the ﬁrst 28 days after the
index infarction. If these patients engaged in
sexual activity once a week it would result in an
annual risk diVerence of 0.24% (calculated on
the basis of a relative risk of 2.9 reported for
patients with a history of infarction10).
Thus we conclude—on the basis of the cur-
rent results, the ﬁndings of the Boston study,
and knowledge of the physiological mecha-
nisms through which physical and mental
stress act22 23—that sexual activity may trigger a
myocardial infarct. However, the increase in
the absolute risk of myocardial infarction after
sexual activity is very small. Physical exercise is
one way of reducing even this small increase in
risk.
The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Council
for Social Research and the Swedish National Institute of Pub-
lic Health.
