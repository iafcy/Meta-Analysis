            "abstract": "We explored possible mechanisms by which recommended intakes of omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the risk for sudden cardiac death in patients with documented coronary heart disease. The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been documented in epidemiologic and randomized controlled trials. These fatty acids are presumed to decrease susceptibility to fatal arrhythmias, but whether this is mediated by classic risk factors or direct cardiac mechanisms is not known. Eighteen white men with a history of myocardial infarction and ejection fractions <40% were randomized to placebo or omega-3 fatty acids (585 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 225 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid) for two 4-month periods in a crossover design. At the end of each period, heart rate (HR), HR variability, and rate of HR recovery after exercise were determined, as were effects on arterial compliance, blood pressure, cardiac function, and fasting serum levels of lipids and inflammatory markers. Omega-3 fatty acids decreased HR at rest from 73 +/- 13 to 68 +/- 13 beats/min (p <0.0001) and improved 1-minute HR recovery after exercise (-27 +/- 10 to -32 +/- 12 beats/min, p <0.01). HR variability in the high-frequency band increased (p <0.02), but no change was noted in overall HR variability. There were no significant effects on blood pressure, arterial compliance, lipids, or inflammatory markers. These changes are consistent with an increase in vagal activity and may in part explain the observed decrease in risk for sudden cardiac death seen with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The morning increase in asymptomatic ambulatory ischemia may be due to heightened coronary tone, increased physical activity, or both. If ambulatory ischemia is primarily due to physical activity, then alterations in the schedule of physical activity should be reflected in a corresponding alteration in the occurrence of ischemia. This study was designed to examine the relation between activity patterns and the frequency of ambulatory ischemic episodes and the effect of nadolol on these relations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of nadolol versus placebo was performed in 20 patients with stable coronary artery disease. At the end of each 2-week treatment phase, patients were hospitalized for 48 hours. In the hospital, there was a regular activity day (awaken and assume normal activities at 8:00 AM) and a delayed activity day (awaken at 8:00 AM, arise at 10:00 AM, and begin normal activity at noon). Ambulatory ECG monitoring was performed throughout the hospitalization. On the regular activity day, there was a morning increase in heart rate and in the number of ischemic episodes during therapy with placebo that began at 8:00 AM. In contrast, on the delayed activity day, there was a 4-hour phase shift of the increases in heart rate and the increase in ischemic episodes (ie, at noon) corresponding to the onset of physical activities. Therapy with nadolol caused a 50% reduction in the total number of ischemic episodes (129 versus 65, placebo versus nadolol; P < .02). During nadolol therapy, there was no discernible circadian peak in the number of ischemic episodes on either activity day. During placebo treatment, 87% of ischemic episodes were preceded by an increase in heart rate > or = 5 beats per minute. Although nadolol caused a significant reduction in the total number of episodes preceded by a heart rate increase compared with placebo (99 versus 38 episodes, P < .04), this therapy was associated with a significant increase in the number of episodes not associated with a heart rate increase (15 versus 21 episodes, P < .002).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The morning increase in ambulatory ischemic episodes is due to physical activity patterns. The majority of ischemic episodes are preceded by a heart rate increase, and it is these episodes that are primarily responsible for the morning increase in ischemia. Therapy with nadolol caused a reduction in the total number of ischemic episodes solely by reducing those episodes preceded by a heart rate increase. In contrast, nadolol caused a significant increase in the number of ischemic episodes not associated with a heart rate increase, perhaps in part because it potentiated coronary vasoconstriction."

In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 healthy men received either an oral dose of 2 mg lorazepam, 0.5 mg alprazolam, 1 mg alprazolam, or a placebo on 4 different days. By means of a portable digital recorder, each day 4 hours of continuous measurements of accelerometer signals and heart rate were performed in a living room in the hospital. Changes in subjective sleepiness were assessed at the beginning, halfway, and at the end of the recording period. A separate validation study of the ambulatory environment was performed in three subjects, in which computer classification of activities based on accelerometry was compared with visual evaluation of simultaneously recorded videotapes. In our validation study, comparison of the computer classification with visual analysis based on videotapes revealed an overall agreement for spontaneous and standardized activities of 88% and 96%, respectively. In our pharmacological study, the subjects spent more time in the lying position (p < 0.01) and less time in the sitting position (p < 0.01) after benzodiazepine administration; the effects were strongest for lorazepam. Motility during static activities was reduced (p < 0.025), with motility after lorazepam administration being lowest. Both lorazepam and alprazolam (0.5 and 1 mg) increased subjective sleepiness (p < 0.01). On average , lorazepam induced an overall increase in mean heart rate of about 6%, whereas alprazolam reduced mean heart rate by 2% versus placebo (p < 0.01); the effects were not dependent on posture. The validation study showed that accelerometry forms a reliable method to quantify aspects of normal daily activities. Our pharmacological study revealed that quantification of body postures, physical activity, and motility by means of ambulatory accelerometry proves to be an objective and promising tool to evaluate the psychological and cardiovascular effects of (psycho) pharmaca in relation to the postural and mobility activities of normal daily life."

            "abstract": "Recent documentation of a circadian variation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) suggests that AMI is not a random event, but may frequently result from identifiable triggering activities. The possible triggers reported by 849 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Investigation of Limitation of Infarct Size were analyzed. Possible triggers were identified by 48.5% of the population; the most common were emotional upset (18.4%) and moderate physical activity (14.1%). Multiple possible triggers were reported by 13% of the population. Younger patients, men and those without diabetes mellitus were more likely to report a possible trigger than were older patients, women and those with diabetes. The likelihood of reporting a trigger was not affected by infarct size. This study suggests that potentially identifiable triggers may play an important role in AMI. Because potential triggering activities are common in persons with coronary artery disease, yet infrequently result in AMI, further studies are needed to identify (1) the circumstances in which a potential trigger may cause an event, (2) the specific nature of potential triggering activites, (3) the frequency of such activities in individuals who do not develop AMI and (4) the presence or absence of identifiable triggers in various subgroups of patients with infarction."

            "abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes often also exhibit additional features of the metabolic syndrome. These include specifically central obesity triggering development and maintenance of diabetes together with arterial hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Chronic therapy of the metabolic syndrome in diabetics after coronary bypass surgery focuses on changes in lifestyle, i.e., cessation of smoking, changes in nutrition and increase in physical activity. Nutrition aims at fat reduction and modification to reduce saturated fatty acids, to allow mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids instead, and moderate alcohol consumption. High fiber and complex carbohydrate diet complete the recommendations. Nutrition therapy connected to increases in physical activity are aimed at reducing weight in overweight and obese subjects, which should reduce their body weight by 5 to 10% within about 6 months. Normal weight subjects benefit from increases in physical activity by lipid and glucose regulation as well as by reduction in mortality.Diabetes-specific therapy aims at normoglycemia including postprandial blood glucose levels, reduces blood pressure supported by ACE inhibitors and aims at weight reduction. Reduction of LDL-cholesterol is the first line therapy, also diminishing small-dense LDL particles. Decreasing triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol are further lipid-regulating aims. Specifically diabetics after coronary bypass surgery need LDL-cholesterol levels below 70 mg/d (1.8 mmol/L) and triglycerides below 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L). In addition, in males HDL-cholesterol should be at least above 40 mg/dl (1 mmol/L), in females above 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L)."

            "abstract": "After conception, the corpus luteum, placenta, and developing embryo release hormones, growth factors, and other substances into the maternal circulation. These substances trigger a cascade of events that transform the functioning of the maternal cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems, which in turn alter the physicochemical determinants of [H(+)]. Following implantation, maternal adaptations fulfill 4 important functions that support fetal growth. Increased availability of substrates and precursors for fetal-placental metabolism and hormone production is mediated by increases in dietary intake, as well as endocrine changes that increase the availability of glucose and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Transport capacity is enhanced by increases in cardiac output, facilitating the transport of substrates and precursors to the placenta, and fetal waste products to maternal organs for disposal. Maternal-fetal exchange is regulated by the placenta after 10-12 weeks gestation, but it may occur through histiotrophic mechanisms before this time. Disposal of additional waste products (heat, carbon dioxide, and metabolic byproducts) occurs through peripheral vasodilation and increases in skin blood flow, ventilation, and renal filtration. The maternal physiological adaptations described above must meet the combined demands of maternal exercise and fetal growth. More research is needed to formulate evidence-based guidelines for healthy physical activity in early pregnancy."

Our aim was to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis including resting and ambulatory blood pressure, blood pressure-regulating mechanisms, and concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. Inclusion criteria of studies were: random allocation to intervention and control; endurance training as the sole intervention; inclusion of healthy sedentary normotensive or hypertensive adults; intervention duration of > or =4 weeks; availability of systolic or diastolic blood pressure; and publication in a peer-reviewed journal up to December 2003. The meta-analysis involved 72 trials, 105 study groups, and 3936 participants. After weighting for the number of trained participants and using a random-effects model, training induced significant net reductions of resting and daytime ambulatory blood pressure of, respectively, 3.0/2.4 mm Hg (P<0.001) and 3.3/3.5 mm Hg (P<0.01). The reduction of resting blood pressure was more pronounced in the 30 hypertensive study groups (-6.9/-4.9) than in the others (-1.9/-1.6; P<0.001 for all). Systemic vascular resistance decreased by 7.1% (P<0.05), plasma norepinephrine by 29% (P<0.001), and plasma renin activity by 20% (P<0.05). Body weight decreased by 1.2 kg (P<0.001), waist circumference by 2.8 cm (P<0.001), percent body fat by 1.4% (P<0.001), and the homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance by 0.31 U (P<0.01); HDL cholesterol increased by 0.032 mmol/L(-1) (P<0.05). In conclusion, aerobic endurance training decreases blood pressure through a reduction of vascular resistance, in which the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system appear to be involved, and favorably affects concomitant cardiovascular risk factors."

Documentation of a prolonged period of time in standard electrocardiography is based on horizontal compression. The value and limitations of a vertical compression with no change in horizontal chronology and waveform morphology are evaluated. The signal taken from a selected surface lead is introduced into an oscilloscope triggered by an electrocardiographic event along the horizontal axis. A continuous vertical monitoring provides a vertical superimposition of the consecutive cycles. The brightness is proportional to the amplitude of the signal and introduces a third dimension. The three-dimensional technique results in an original image allowing report miniaturization at standard 25 or 50 mm/sec paper speed. Appropriate lead selection and use of the brightness as a marker event allow reliable atrial activity identification. In rate responsive pacing evaluation, the procedure is specifically convenient to full disclosure of the chronotropic response. The main limitation is a high sensitivity to noise during recording. Further developments are to be expected based on computer-assisted electrocardiography."

No or little epidemiological data, during primary health care, about symptoms, co-morbidity, nor medical and social consequences of elderlys' disruptive behavior have been gathered or published in the French literature. Thus, in order to describe these disorders, a survey in cooperation with general practitioners (GP) was conducted. A representative sample of 212 French GP's, all with preferential geriatric activity were asked to conduct a study by including retrospectively their two most recent patients older than 65, who had exhibited agitation and/or aggressiveness. From this cross sectional study, 410 patients (female: 61%, male: 39%) were included. The mean age was 81 years (sd: 7.65). The patients suffered from change in verbal behavior (80%), verbal aggressiveness (71%), physical agitation (60%), wandering (48%), and/or physical aggressiveness (31%). The average of disruptive behavior symptoms per patient was 2.9. The symptoms appeared progressively in 81% of patients, the mean duration was two years and it was the first episode in 40% of patients. Disruptive behaviors may be explained in view of organic illness in 62% of patients (cardiovascular disease: 37%, neurologic: 12%, diabetes: 7%, dehydratation: 5%), dementia (Alzheimer disease: 20%, vascular dementia: 18%, mixed dementia: 14%).

After brief treatment with 5-ISMN, dipyridamole-stress echocardiography was negative in 19 of 22 patients (p < 0.001 vs. placebo). During the sustained phase, dipyridamole-stress echocardiography was positive after both placebo and active drug (p = NS vs. placebo). Heart rate variability showed significantly higher values in power of the low frequency (LF) band and low- to high-frequency ratio (L/H), as well as significantly lower values of the power of the high-frequency (HF) band (all p < 0.001) during brief but not during sustained administration of 5-ISMN. Norepinephrine plasma levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) during short-term 5-ISMN administration but not during the sustained phase. Our results indicate that short-term administration of 5-ISMN antagonizes dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia and show the loss of antiischemic efficacy in 95% of patients during sustained treatment, demonstrating that dipyridamole-stress echocardiography is a useful tool to assess the presence of nitrate tolerance. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability and norepinephrine values confirm that brief nitrate administration increases sympathetic activity, a possible crucial trigger event in the development of nitrate tolerance, whereas prolonged nitrate treatment is not associated with prolonged neurohumoral activation."

The endothelium is responsible for the constancy and integrity of the milieu interieur by producing various substances. Endothelial dysfunction occurs when there is imbalance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors, growth factors and their inhibitors, proinflammatory and antiinflammatory agents, prothrombotic and fibrinolytic activities. The reason for this imbalance may be response to vascular endothelial or intimal injury caused by mechanical, physical, chemical, microbiological, immunologic, genetic damage or any of their combination. Endothelial dysfunction occurring on the huge inner surface of the vessels (the endothelium) is responsible for the triggering of atherosclerosis, which is a chronic vascular disease. All the risk factors of vascular pathology are leading to chronic (cardio)vascular diseases by causing endothelial dysfunction. Decreased endogenous antioxidative capacity leads to oxidative stress by free radical reactions of physiological oxidative metabolic processes, ending as the ultimate reason for endothelial dysfunction induced by risk factors. The therapeutic and preventive effects of causal antioxidant treatments having intracellular and mitochondrial effects (statins, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor-blockers, acetylsalicylic acid, and third generation beta-blockers) should be emphasized. It is also important to underline the physiological-pathophysiological-therapeutic consubstantiality and systemic nature of human vasculature and to emphasize the preventive-therapeutic significance of the vascular consequence cascade.

Circadian rhythms, coordinated in part by the parietal hypothalamic-pituitary and adrenal mechanisms, have been reported in almost all variables examined thus far, including the circulation. It is possible that all metabolic functions undergo circadian rhythms. It remains to be explored whether these rhythms may be optimized by Ayurvedic practices. The onsets of myocardial ischemia, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and strokes have been reported to exhibit a circadian variation, with increased frequency in the second quarter of the day. An increased physical and mental load caused by an attempt to prepare for the day may be important in triggering acute cardiovascular events. Depending on their timing, meditation (Ayurvedic practice), n-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, beta-blockers and estrogens may have beneficial effects, whereas progestins and mental load may have adverse effects on heart rate and blood pressure variability, which may be expressed by different circadian patterns. Around the clock serial recordings of blood pressure and heart rate during usual activities and lifestyles may be recorded and may be analyzed by computer-implemented curve fitting to assess the about 24-hour (circadian) variation, among other rhythmic, chaotic, and trend components of the time structure (chronome) of these variables. The new disease risk syndrome circadian hyper-amplitude-tension (CHAT), a condition characterized by an excessive circadian amplitude of blood pressure, cannot be ascertained on the basis of single casual blood pressure measurements.

Eight elite professional America's Cup grinders performed two exercise trials, on an adjustable standing arm-crank ergometer with SRM powercrank, in a cross-over design. Each trial comprised of two 5-min stages at the same work rate ( approximately lactate threshold) with the knee joint splinted or normal movement available. Vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) and knee joint angle were determined from two force plates and sagittal plane video, respectively. Work rate was identical for the two conditions (246 (14) vs. 246 (13) W, p=0.7). Knee joint range of motion and unilateral VGRF amplitude were greater during normal compared with splinted arm-cranking (both p<0.01). There was no difference in VO2 (p=0.2) between the two conditions, however, there was greater VCO2 (8%, p=0.001), RER (11%, p<0.001), V(E) (17%, p<0.001) and HR (7 (3) beats.min(-1), p<0.001) during splinted compared with normal arm-cranking.

            "abstract": "Stroke is the culmination of a heterogeneous group of cerebrovascular diseases that is manifested as ischemia or hemorrhage of one or more blood vessels of the brain. The occurrence of many acute cardiovascular events--such as myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, pulmonary embolism, critical limb ischemia, and aortic aneurysm rupture--exhibits prominent 24 h patterning, with a major morning peak and secondary early evening peak. The incidence of stroke exhibits the same 24 h pattern. Although ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are different entities and are characterized by different pathophysiological mechanisms, they share an identical double-peak 24 h pattern. A constellation of endogenous circadian rhythms and exogenous cyclic factors are involved. The staging of the circadian rhythms in vascular tone, coagulative balance, and blood pressure plus temporal patterns in posture, physical activity, emotional stress, and medication effects play central and/or triggering roles. Features of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure, in terms of their chronic and acute effects on cerebral vessels, and of coagulation are especially important. Clinical medicine has been most concerned with the prevention of stroke in the morning, when population-based studies show it is of greatest risk during the 24 h; however, improved protection of at-risk patients against stroke in the early evening, the second most vulnerable time of cerebrovascular accidents, has received relatively little attention thus far."

            "abstract": "Approximately a third of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy fail to increase blood pressure appropriately during exercise, a consequence of an inappropriate vasodilator response in nonexercising beds, leading to an exaggerated fall in systemic vascular resistance. The precise mechanism responsible for this abnormal vascular control in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is still unclear, but is thought to be secondary to enhanced cardiac baroreceptor activity. However, alternate or synergistic mechanisms, including enhanced release of brain natriuretic peptide, may be involved. Normal exercise blood pressure responses have been shown to have a high (97%) negative predictive accuracy for sudden death during an average follow-up of approximately 3 years, providing considerable reassurance. Patients with abnormal blood pressure responses on exercise were at markedly increased risk of sudden cardiac death, although the positive predictive accuracy during this brief follow-up period was low (15%). It is likely that vascular instability may act as a trigger for sudden cardiac death in patients with an underlying electrophysiologic substrate. Recent evidence suggests that this vascular instability may also result in hypotension during ordinary daily activity, or even at rest, and may be an important cause of syncope in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Further studies are required to identify mechanisms of attenuating or reversing this vascular instability. Such measures might have the potential to improve symptoms of recurrent syncope and perhaps reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death."

After exercise, changes in cardiovascular control impair orthostatic tolerance. The impaired pressure response can be compensated for by chronotropic control of the heart. We studied the effect of midazolam and ephedrine on post-exercise cardiac autonomic chronotropic control in six 21-year-old female volunteers, who received single doses of 15 mg midazolam, 50 mg ephedrine, or placebo orally according to a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design. After exercise, the subjects assumed the supine position for rest, then a -10 degrees head-down position followed by a 70 degrees head-up position. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability for 7 min and steady-state brachial arterial blood pressure were measured in each position. After administration of midazolam, three subjects had an abnormal fall in their arterial blood pressure (with one presyncope) as a response to head-up tilt. Changes in heart rate variability exceeded those seen during placebo treatment (p < 0.01) and involved oscillations, suggesting activation of both sympathetic and parasympathetic dynamics. After ephedrine administration, arterial blood pressure increased during head-down tilt, but parasympathetic dynamics to the heart were dampened. Head-up tilt induced increased sympathetic stimulation of the heart and a sympathicotonic cardiovascular response (p < 0.01). In conclusion, midazolam induced unexpectedly great changes in dynamic cardiac control during cardiovascular stimulation. Ephedrine increased tonic sympathetic activity and stabilized the neural circulatory control of the heart by immobilizing dynamic parasympathetic activation."

In the long-term studies the haemodynamic effect of propranolol was still characterized by cardiodepression and unchanged peripheral resistance. Patients on the long-term treatment with indenolol showed normal cardiac output and reduced total peripheral resistance.

In several, although small-scale studies it could be shown that patients with advanced left ventricular failure were able to take part in training programs without experiencing any ill effects, and that there was a positive shift in the usual typical effects of physical training, such as increase of heart rate, change in respiratory frequency, and maximum oxygen uptake. It could be shown that exercise therapy can result in a shift in the balance between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic tonus in the low- and high-frequency maxima of the R-R interval variability. The pre-training general predominance of the sympathetic tonus over the vagal tonus was changed dramatically by the training, leading to a predominance of the vagal tonus. Recent controlled studies with a randomized and controlled cross-over design and the application of a training program which was carried out regularly and independently have confirmed the positive effect of aerobic fitness training in cases of heart disease. At the end of the exercise phase, the patients experienced a significant improvement of the symptoms of left ventricular failure and of their capacity for exercise; furthermore, the training altered parts of the neurohumoral activation, which count as the main factors in the progression and death rate of patients with chronic cardiac disease."

Eighteen patients (mean +/- SEM; age 52 +/- 2 years), half of them listed for transplant, underwent 3 weeks of exercise training (interval cycle and treadmill walking; 5 x/week) and 3 weeks of activity restriction in a random-order crossover trial. Baseline data were not significantly different for groups with exercise training first and activity restriction first: cardiac index at rest (2.1 +/- 0.1 L/m2/min), maximum cardiac index (3.1 +/- 0.2 L/m2/min) (Fick), and echocardiographic ejection fraction (21 +/- 1%). The same was true for cardiopulmonary exercise data (cycle ergometry; up 12.5 W/min): VO2 at VT (9.3 +/- 0.4 ml/kg/min), maximum VO2 (12.2 +/- 0.7 ml/kg/min), VT in percentage of predicted maximum VO2 (31 +/- 2%), heart rate at VT (95 +/- 4 beats/min), and decrease of dead space-to-tidal volume ratio from rest to VT (33 +/- 1 --> 29 +/- 1). Improvement of VO2 at VT after training (2.2 +/- 0.4 ml/kg/min; p <0.001) was not related to baseline central hemodynamics (r = <0.10 for each), but was greater in patients with a lower baseline VO2 at VT (r = -0.65; p <0.01), peak VO2 (r = -0.66; p <0.01), VT in percentage of predicted maximum VO2 (r = -0.74; p <0.001), heart rate at VT (r = -0.63; p <0.01), and smaller decrease of dead space-to-tidal volume ratio from rest to VT (r = 0.65; p <0.01). Ejection fraction after exercise training (24 +/- 2%) and activity restriction (23 +/- 2%) did not differ significantly compared with baseline, and patient status (heart failure and cardiac rhythm) remained stable. Three parameters accounted for 84% of the variance of improvement in VO2 at VT: VO2 at VT in percent predicted maximum VO2, decrease of dead space-to-tidal volume ratio, and heart rate at VT. The findings suggest that there was a greater increase in VO2 at VT after exercise training in patients with greater peripheral deconditioning at baseline. The improvement was unrelated to central hemodynamics.

            "abstract": "The potassium homeostatic system is very tightly regulated. Recent studies have shed light on the sensing and molecular mechanisms responsible for this tight control. In addition to classic feedback regulation mediated by a rise in extracellular fluid (ECF) [K(+)], there is evidence for a feedforward mechanism: Dietary K(+) intake is sensed in the gut, and an unidentified gut factor is activated to stimulate renal K(+) excretion. This pathway may explain renal and extrarenal responses to altered K(+) intake that occur independently of changes in ECF [K(+)]. Mechanisms for conserving ECF K(+) during fasting or K(+) deprivation have been described: Kidney NADPH oxidase activation initiates a cascade that provokes the retraction of K(+) channels from the cell membrane, and muscle becomes resistant to insulin stimulation of cellular K(+) uptake. How these mechanisms are triggered by K(+) deprivation remains unclear. Cellular AMP kinase-dependent protein kinase activity provokes the acute transfer of K(+) from the ECF to the ICF, which may be important in exercise or ischemia. These recent advances may shed light on the beneficial effects of a high-K(+) diet for the cardiovascular system."

Diagnosis of acute myocardial injury in marathon runners is complicated by elevations of serum creatine kinase MB isoenzyme activity in asymptomatic finishers with normal post-race infarct-avid myocardial scintigraphy. Such isoenzyme elevations can arise from exertional rhabdomyolysis of skeletal muscle biochemically altered by training, from silent injury to the myocardium or from a combined tissue source. To assess silent myocardial cell necrosis in marathon runners, we performed quantitative anti-myosin myocardial scintigraphy after competition with serum immunoassays for creatine kinase MB isoenzyme and troponin T. Therefore, 8 male marathon runners with a mean age of 52 years underwent quantitative antimyosin myocardial scintigraphy immediately following the 1988 and 1993 Boston Marathons. Serum immunoassays for creatine kinase MB isoenzyme by a chemiluminescent method (CLIA) and troponin T by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed in 4 runners after the 1993 race. Quantitative antimyosin myocardial scintigraphy was normal in all runners including 3 who participated after both races 5 years apart. Post-race serum creatine kinase MB isoenzyme and/or troponin T levels were in a range otherwise diagnostic of acute myocardial infarction in 3 of 4 subjects. Normal quantitative antimyosin myocardial imaging in asymptomatic marathon runners excludes silent myocardial cell necrosis as the source of elevated serum protein markers. Such imaging may be the optimal diagnostic modality for detection of myocardial cell necrosis in symptomatic athletes when results of conventional testing are inconclusive."

This fine-tuned balance is disrupted in coronary artery disease (CAD). The impairment of NO production in conjunction with excessive oxidative stress promotes the loss of endothelial cells by apoptosis, leads to a further aggravation of endothelial dysfunction and triggers myocardial ischemia in CAD. In healthy individuals, increased release of NO from the vasculature in response to exercise training results from changes in endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression, phosphorylation, and conformation. However, exercise training has assumed a role in cardiac rehabilitation of patients with CAD, as well, because it reduces mortality and increases myocardial perfusion. This has been largely attributed to exercise training-mediated correction of coronary endothelial dysfunction in CAD. Indeed, regular physical activity restores the balance between NO production and NO inactivation by reactive oxygen species in CAD, thereby enhancing the vasodilatory capacity in different vascular beds. Because endothelial dysfunction has been identified as a predictor of cardiovascular events, the partial reversal of endothelial dysfunction secondary to exercise training might be the most likely mechanism responsible for the exercise training-induced reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CAD."

To test this hypothesis, we studied 20 subjects hopping and 20 others skipping rope for greater than or equal to 10 min while electrocardiographic and force-platform signals were recorded, from which we derived the subjects' exercise and heart rates. The incidence and intensity of apparent coupling in the test subjects were compared with those of cross-over controls, where the heart rate of each subject was related to the hopping or skipping rate of a matched subject.

In comparison to placebo, benazepril reduced arterial blood pressure significantly from 140 +/- 14/90 +/- 11 mm Hg to 125 +/- 16/84 +/- 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma renin activity from 2.19 +/- 3.76 ng/ml/h to 9.62 +/- 8.49 ng/ml/h (p less than 0.005). In contrast, ST-segment depression decreased only slightly and not significantly from 2.09 +/- 1.22 mm to 1.91 +/- 1.00 mm. Benazepril had neither an effect on the frequency of episodes of angina pectoris nor did it reduce the amount of GTN-consumption. Also, work capacity and plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide were not changed in comparison to placebo. Although the significant reduction of blood pressure and the highly significant increase of plasma renin activity demonstrate the specific action of benazepril, a significant anti-ischaemic effect could not be established."

In a randomized, double-blind crossover exercise study, eight healthy volunteers were examined before and 2 1/2 hours after oral administration of 300 mg (R,S)-, 150 mg (R)-, and 150 mg (S)-propafenone hydrochloride. The mean rate pressure product was significantly reduced by (R,S)-propafenone hydrochloride (-5.2%; p = 0.045) and half-dosed (S)-propafenone hydrochloride (-5.9%; p = 0.013), whereas the (R)-enantiomer caused no significant changes. There was a significant difference between the effects of (R)- and (S)-propafenone (p = 0.033). In beta-adrenoceptor-binding inhibition experiments with (S)-(125I)iodocyanopindolol in a sarcolemma-enriched cardiac membrane preparation, the eudismic ratio of (S)- over (R)-propafenone was 54. On the spontaneously beating Langendorff-perfused guinea pig heart, 3 x 10(-6) mol/L of both (R)- and (S)-propafenone resulted in significant changes (p less than 0.01) on His bundle conduction (+79% +/- 27% and +69% +/- 9%), as well as comparable decreases in the maximal rate of pacing with 1:1 conduction of the atrial (-54% +/- 10% and -57% +/- 8%) and ventricular myocardium (-42% +/- 6% and -43% +/- 6%), indicating equal effects in sodium channel-dependent antiarrhythmic class 1 activity. Thus (R)- and (S)-propafenone exert different beta-blocking actions but equal effects on the sodium channel-dependent antiarrhythmic class 1 activity. More specific antiarrhythmic class 1 therapy with reduction of beta-blocking side effects may be attained with optically pure (R)-propafenone hydrochloride instead of the currently used racemic mixture."

Therefore, our aims were to investigate: (a) the influence of CVR on CVW during repeated rest-exercise transitions; and (b) the influence of the sympathetic activity on CVR and CVW. Fifty-eight healthy men (22 ± 4 years) performed 20 rest-exercise transitions interspaced by 30 s. In addition, nine healthy men (24 ± 3 years) ingested either 25 mg of atenolol or placebo, on a crossover, double-blind, randomized design, then performed 20 rest-exercise transitions interspaced by 30 s. Cardiac vagal reactivation was assessed by a HR variability index (RMSSD) and CVW by the HR increase at the onset of a valid and reliable cycling protocol. The CVR and CVW responses were associated (partial r ranged from 0.60 to 0.66; p < 0.05). Participants with higher CVR over transitions maintained their CVW over repeated transitions [first transition (mean ± SEM) = 1.59 ± 0.04 vs. 20th = 1.50 ± 0.03 (a.u.), p = 0.24], while participants with lower CVR had a CVW decrease over repeated transitions [first transition (mean ± SEM) = 1.38 ± 0.04 vs. 20th = 1.19 ± 0.03 (a.u.), p < 0.01). In addition, the CVR and CVW over the rest-exercise transitions were similar during atenolol and placebo (ANCOVA interaction p = 0.12 and p = 0.48, respectively). In conclusion, the CVR among repeated rest-exercise transitions influenced the CVW at the onset of exercise, which was not affected by a partial β(1) cardioselective adrenoceptor blockade."

Eighty cardiac patients participating in a 12-week program completed measures at early, mid- and late treatment. Early-treatment changes in exercise self-efficacy predicted late-treatment changes in activity level, depression, and working alliance, but not vice versa.

The recognition of the morning increase of acute coronary heart disease has convinced many that morning activities can 'trigger' its onset. It is of note, however, that coronary events may occur throughout the day--even if at lower frequency compared with the morning. There is a strong association between external triggers and onset of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death beyond that expected by chance alone. The magnitude of this association (relative risk two- to threefold) is comparable to that of other known long term risk factors of cardiac disease. Trigger factors occur relatively frequently and may play a causative role in up to 20% of cases of acute coronary syndromes. Physical exertion, burst of anger and sexual activity have been proven to have triggering potential. Other possible triggers include external and environmental events such as earthquakes, war threat and climatic factors. The pathophysiological links between external triggers and onset of coronary syndromes are important in addressing the question of a causal relationship between triggers and disease onset and, perhaps, in improving preventive strategies."

In addition to experimental and electrophysiological studies, an opportunity for a better understanding of possible stress-related sudden death (SSD) may be provided by medicolegal autopsies. The goal of our autopsy study was to analyze cardiovascular pathologic findings in cases of SSD and if possible identify mechanisms by which the stressful event (SE) could be the cause. Forty three cases were studied (29 males and 14 females). In all cases, the SE and the death were witnessed. The age range was 22 to 90 years in males (mean, 52) and 30 to 92 years in females (mean, 64). Death occurred in all cases without premonitory symptoms. In 20 cases, death occurred during the SE and in the other 23 cases occurred within 2 h of the event. SE included fear, 15 cases; altercation, 21 cases; sexual activity, 3 cases; police questioning or arrest, 4 cases. According to police reports, in 40 cases (90%), the victims had no previous clinical history of cardiovascular disease. At autopsy, the heart weight in males ranged from 255 to 1000 g with a mean of 517 g and in females the range was 250-700 g with a mean of 417 g. In only 3 cases, gross and microscopic examination of the heart was normal. In 2 of the remaining 40 cases the subjects died of subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 38 cases, a cardiac cause of death was found as follows: coronary heart disease, 27 cases; cardiomyopathy, 6 cases; aortic valvular stenosis, 2 cases and right ventricular dysplasia, 3 cases. A coronary artery thrombosis was found in 8 cases of sudden coronary death. Post myocardial infarction fibrosis was present in 25 cases (92%) of sudden coronary death.

Unilateral chewing of gum or empty chewing was performed for 20 min on the participant's most convenient chewing side at a constant rate of 80 cycles/min. In each session, heart rate and arterial blood pressure were recorded together with electromyographic activity in the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles on the chewing side. Ratings of perceived masticatory fatigue were recorded with visual analogue scales. The heart rate and blood pressure were significantly increased (ANOVA; p < or= 0.01) during the chewing tasks and the increases were, in parallel with the muscle activity, more pronounced the harder the gum. With the very hard gum, heart rate increased by up to 11 beats/min, the systolic blood pressure was 14 mmHg (1.9kPa) higher, and the diastolic blood pressure was 11 mmHg (1.5kPa) higher. The perceived fatigue was proportional to the level of muscle activity. After 10 min of recovery from exercise, heart rate and arterial blood pressures were slightly but still significantly elevated. The results demonstrate that chewing is associated with general circulatory effects proportional to the bolus resistance."

There was no arteriovenous difference in platelet aggregation under resting conditions in patients with versus those without coronary artery disease.

In this study, we reanalyzed the radionuclide ventriculograms using a computer-assisted method of deriving regional ejection fraction. Use of normalized values allowed hypokinetic and normokinetic segments to be identified and examined separately. Pindolol (5-10 mg twice a day) was compared to propranolol (40-80 mg 4 times a day) in 23 patients using a randomized, crossover study design. Supine resting heart rate was reduced less (70 +/- 12 beats/min vs 63 +/- 10 beats/min, p less than 0.01) by pindolol; exercise heart rate was reduced equally by both agents. Derivation of normalized regional LV ejection fractions showed that 17 segments were hypokinetic at rest. Function of these segments increased (p less than 0.02) with pindolol. This improvement was not detected by visual assessment of regional wall motion. Thirty-seven segments were found to be hypokinetic during exercise and a significant (p less than 0.05) improvement in function occurred with pindolol and propranolol. In summary, derivation of normalized regional LV ejection fraction values allows the demonstration of significant improvement in resting LV function with pindolol, but not with propranolol in patients with regional dysfunction due to coronary artery disease. This advantage may provide a rationale for further evaluation of this agent in patients with more widespread ventricular dysfunction."

Experimental studies in animals, as well as case reports in humans, suggest that OT affects different aspects of sexual behaviour and has predominantly facilitating properties for sexual appetence and performance. Using a previously established experimental paradigm of sexual arousal and masturbation-induced orgasm, this study investigated the acute effects of intranasal OT application (24I.U.) on endocrine parameters and measures of sexual appetence and function in healthy men (n=10). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over design, sexual arousal, and orgasm were induced by an erotic film and masturbation. In addition to the continuous recording of endocrine (OT, cortisol, prolactin, epinephrine, norepinephrine) and cardiovascular data (heart rate), parameters of appetitive, consummatory, and refractory sexual behaviour were assessed using the acute sexual experience scale (ASES). OT plasma levels were significantly elevated after intranasal OT throughout the whole experiment (>60 min). In addition, OT treatment induced significantly higher increases in epinephrine plasma levels during sexual activity without affecting cortisol levels, prolactin levels or heart rate. OT treatment did not alter appetitive, consummatory, and refractory sexual behaviour according to the ASES. However, when subjects were asked about their subjective perception of whether OT or placebo had been applied, eight out of 10 subjects in the OT group answered correctly, thus pointing to an altered perception of arousal. In conclusion, intranasally administered OT leads to a marked increase in OT plasma levels together with increased secretion of catecholamines when subjects are engaged in sexual activity in a laboratory setting. As the effects of OT on sexual behaviour were equivocal, future studies should examine possible facilitating effects further by including males, females, and couples in a field setting, taking into account that OT exerts the most prominent behavioural effects in pair bond formations."

ED may also be an early sign of cardiovascular disease. The main risk factors for coronary heart disease (high LDL, smoking, hypertension, diabetes) and ED are the same. ED after the diagnosis of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction is also common.\n    \n\n\n          Cardiovascular effects and risk of sexual activity:\n        \n      \n      Cardiac and metabolic expenditures during sexual intercourse will vary depending on the type of sexual activity. When oxygen uptake was measured in men, an average metabolic expenditure during stimulation and orgasm of 2.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) was found for woman-on-top coitus, and of 3.3 METs for man-on-top coitus (range 2.0-5.4 METs). However, coital death is rare, encompassing only 0.6% of all sudden death cases. A retrospective case-crossover study has shown that although sexual activity can trigger the onset of myocardial infarction, the relative risk in the 2 h after sexual activity was low (2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-3.7). Sexual activity was a likely contributor to the onset of myocardial infarction only 0.9% of the time. Regular exercise appears to prevent triggering. It has to be cautioned that these reassuring data should not be extrapolated to patients taking sildenafil, if they perform at higher cardiac and metabolic expenditures during coitus. The hemodynamic changes associated with sexual activity may be far greater with an unfamiliar partner, in unfamiliar settings, and after excessive eating and drinking. The Princeton Consensus Table for estimation of cardiovascular risk during sexual intercourse gives a first orientation regarding the question which patients can perform sex safely and which subgroup needs further diagnosis and treatment. PHOSPHODIESTERASE-5 INHIBITORS FOR ED TREATMENT: The introduction of sildenafil has been a valuable contribution to the treatment of ED. Sildenafil acts as a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-(cGMP-)specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5), resulting in smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation, and enhanced penile erection. Reported cardiovascular side effects in healthy males are headache, flushing, and < 10% decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Significant hypotension can be found in patients who are concurrently taking nitrates. On the basis of the pharmacokinetic profile of sildenafil, the co-administration of a nitrate within the first 24 h is likely to produce a severe, potentially lifethreatening hypotensive response and is therefore contraindicated. The risk of precipitating a cardiotoxic, hypotensive, or hemorrhagic event secondary to combining sildenafil (a PDE 5 inhibitor) with specific PDE 3 inhibitors such as milrinone and enoximone or with nonspecific PDE inhibitors such as theophylline and pentoxifylline is unlikely. Sildenafil is predominantly metabolized by both the P450 2C9 pathway and the P450 3A4 pathway. Thus, potent inhibitors of the P450 3A4 pathway may increase the plasma concentrations of sildenafil, like cimetidine, erythromycin, digitoxin, and CSE inhibitors (simvastatin, atorvastatin, etc.). A creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min also increases plasma levels of sildenafil.\n    \n\n\n          Safety profile of sildenafil:\n        \n      \n      Sildenafil is safe in healthy subjects. In a postmarketing study on 6,527 males, no increase of cardiovascular events was found. However, in older males with coronary heart disease, the risk of sildenafil and the risk of physical exercise during sexual intercourse contribute both to fatal outcomes. Of 69 cases reported to the FDA, 46 patients might have had a cardiovascular event, and in twelve a possible interaction with nitrate use has been reported. Sildenafil is absolutely contraindicated in patients taking long-acting nitrates, those with severe aortic stenosis, and patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). No nitrates should be used within 24 h of sildenafil use. Caution is necessary in patients with a combination of antihypertensive medications, and in patients with cardiac insufficiency. A \"pre-Viagra\" treadmill test to assess for the presence of stress-induced ischemia can be helpful for both the patient and the physician. If the patient can achieve > or = 5 METs without demonstrating ischemia, the risk of ischemia during coitus is low.\n    \n\n\n          Management of severe adverse events:\n        \n      \n      If severe hypotension occurs, aggressive fluid resuscitation is the first step, followed by administration of vasoactive drugs and, if necessary, by intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. If unstable angina or myocardial infarctions occurs after the use of sildenafil, the patient is treated according to the guidelines, but without nitrates.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Sexual activity is a cornerstone of quality of life. However, giving the incidence of \"occult\" cardiovascular disease in patients with ED and the indications and contraindications of PDE 5 inhibitors in patients with cardiovascular diseases, all patients with ED must be evaluated by a cardiovascular specialist."

            "abstract": "With the use of a three-phase experimental design, the efficacy of oral nitroglycerin has been evaluated in a total of 53 patients with documented angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. The study were a double-blind, randomized, and cross-over comparison of controlled-release nitroglycerin (2.6 mg. tablets administered three times daily) and an indistinguishable placebo. Sixteen patients recorded anginal symptoms by the diary method over a 6 month trial of randomly sequenced 1 month periods of drug or placebo. In 15 patients, ST segments were monitored with a Holter dynamic electrocardiograph for periods of 10 to 12 hours under normal life style and evaluated by matching activities during periods of drug and placebo. In 22 patients, a multistage treadmill exercise test was conducted to an endpoint of anginal pain. The three phases of the investigation were run in succession; each phase was completed before the next one was begun. Oral nitroglycerin reduced the incidence and severity of anginal attacks by 47.2 and 49.4 per cent, respectively, and decreased the number of sublingual nitroglycerin tablets used by 51.1 per cent in comparison to placebo (p less than 0.001). Eleven of 16 patients (69 per cent) decreased their need for sublingual nitroglycerin by over 50 per cent. Based on a polynomial trend analysis over a period of 8 weeks, no tolerance to the therapeutic effects of the drug was found. With DCG monitoring, drug decreased the ST segment depression from 1.76 mm. on placebo to 1.12 mm, with a significant difference of 0.64 mm. (p less than 0.001). ST segment depression was decreased more than 0.5 mm. by drug in comparison to placebo in 10 of 15 patients (66 per cent). Larger depressions of the ST segment noted with placebo at heart rates greater than 80 beats per minute were prevented by administration of the drug. During treadmill exercise, drug delayed the onset of pain by 83 seconds (64 per cent) over placebo (p less than 0.001) and decreased the duration of pain by 70 seconds (49 per cent) in comparison to placebo (p less than 0.001). Drug did not affect heart rate or systolic blood pressure at rest or after exercise, as well as rate-pressure product for production of angina following exercise (p less than 0.05). There was no side effects reported caused by the drug. The data demonstrate that oral nitroglycerin, given as controlled-release tablets, was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in quantities sufficient to provide statistically significant clinical improvement of angina pectoris."

            "abstract": "The pathogenesis of hypertension and its mode of progression are complex, multifactoral and incompletely understood. However, there is accumulating evidence from humans and animal models of hypertension indicating that excessive central sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) plays a pathogenic role in triggering and sustaining the essential hypertensive state (the so-called 'neuroadrenergic hypothesis'). Importantly, augmented central sympathetic outflow has also been implicated in the initiation and progression of a plethora of pathophysiological processes independent of any increase in blood pressure, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, the sympathetic nervous system constitutes an important putative drug target in hypertension. However, traditional pharmacological approaches for the management of essential hypertension appear ineffective in reducing central sympathetic outflow. Recently, several new and promising therapeutic strategies targeting neurogenic hypertension have been developed. The present report will provide a brief update of this topic with a particular emphasis on human studies examining the efficacy of novel pharmacological approaches (central sympatholytics and statins), lifestyle modification (aerobic exercise training, weight loss and stress reduction) and surgical intervention (renal denervation, chronic carotid baroreflex stimulation and deep brain stimulation) in reducing excessive central sympathetic activation in hypertension."

Twenty-two patients, aged 18 to 81 years, had an activity-sensing dual chamber universal rate-responsive (DDDR) pacemaker implanted for treatment of high grade atrioventricular block and chronotropic incompetence. They were randomly programmed to VVIR (ventricular demand rate-responsive), DDIR (dual chamber demand rate-responsive), DDD (dual chamber universal) or DDDR (dual chamber universal rate-responsive) mode and assessed after 4 weeks of out-of-hospital activity. Five patients, all with VVIR pacing, requested early reprogramming. The DDDR mode was preferred by 59% of patients; the VVIR mode was the least acceptable mode in 73%. Perceived \"general well-being,\" exercise capacity, functional status and symptoms were significantly worse in the VVIR than in dual rate-responsive modes. Exercise treadmill time was longer in DDDR mode (p less than 0.01), but similar in all other modes. During standardized daily activities, heart rate in VVIR and DDIR modes underresponded to mental stress. All rate-augmented modes overresponded to staircase descent, whereas the DDD mode significantly underresponded to staircase ascent. Echocardiography revealed no difference in chamber dimensions, left ventricular fractional shortening or pulmonary artery pressure in any mode. Cardiac output was greater at rest in the dual modes than in the VVIR mode (p = 0.006) but was similar at 120 beats/min. Beat to beat variability of cardiac output was greatest in VVIR mode (p less than 0.0001), with DDIR showing greater variability than DDD or DDDR modes (p less than 0.05). Mitral regurgitation estimated by Doppler color flow imaging was similar in all modes, but tricuspid regurgitation was significantly greater in VVIR than in dual modes (p less than 0.03). Subjects who preferred the DDDR mode and those who found the VVIR mode least acceptable had significantly greater increases in stroke volume when paced in the DDD mode than in the ventricular-inhibited (VVI) mode at rest (22%) when compared with subjects who preferred other modes (2%, p = 0.03). No other objective variable was predictive of subjective benefit from any rate-responsive pacing mode. Thus, dual sensor rate-responsive pacing (DDDR) is superior objectively and subjectively to single sensor (VVIR, DDIR and DDD) pacing and subjective benefit from dual chamber rate-augmented pacing is predictable echocardiographically."

Life threatening situations like earthquakes are able to increase the risk for myocardial infarction about sixfold. Anger or sexual activity may double this risk. The occurrence of myocardial infarction is not evenly distributed throughout the day. The highest risk in non-treated, non-smoking patients lies between 6 a.m. and noon with a predominance on Monday morning. High physical stress in untrained persons carries a much greater risk for myocardial infarction than extreme emotional stress. This difference may be due to a greater degree of coronary vasoconstriction induced by the higher levels of norepinephrine in physical exercise compared to those during emotional stress.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A causal relationship between stress and atherosclerosis has not yet been demonstrated in clinical studies.

Approximately half of all MIs have an identifiable clinical trigger. Myocardial ischemia, MI, sudden cardiac death, and thrombotic stroke each occur with circadian variation and peak after waking in the morning. In addition, physical exertion and mental stress are common precipitants of MI. Waking in the morning, physical exertion, and mental stress influence a number of physiologic parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, plasma epinephrine levels, coronary blood flow, platelet aggregability, and endothelial function. Upregulation of sympathetic output and catecholamines increase myocardial oxygen demand and can decrease myocardial oxygen supply and promote thrombosis. Ischemia ensues when myocardial oxygen demand exceeds supply. Increases in blood pressure and ventricular contractility increase intravascular shear stress and may cause vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques to rupture, forming a nidus for thrombosis that can precipitate MI. Numerous clinical triggers of MI have been identified, including blizzards, the Christmas and New Year's holidays, experiencing an earthquake, the threat of violence, job strain, Mondays for the working population, sexual activity, overeating, smoking cigarettes, smoking marijuana, using cocaine, and particulate air pollution. Avoiding clinical triggers or participating in therapies that prevent clinical triggers from precipitating cardiac events could potentially postpone clinical events by several years and improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Direct or indirect evidence suggests that the risk of triggered MIs is reduced with β-blockers, aspirin, statins, stress management, and transcendental meditation."

The occurrence of sudden and premature cardiac deaths in amateur and professional athletes, who appear to embody all of the virtues of health and fitness, ahs raised our consciousness regarding the underlying atherosclerotic or nonatherosclerotic causes, and the need for, and extent of, preparticipation screening in competitive athletes. It appears that strenuous physical activity may trigger acute cardiovascular events in some athletes. Coronary artery disease is the most frequent autopsy finding in those over the age of 35 years who die suddenly. In contrast, structural cardiovascular abnormalities, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and malformations of the coronary arteries, are the major cause of sudden death in younger athletes. This article reviews these issues, with specific reference to the assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness, legal and prohibited performance-altering medications, the pathophysiological basis of exertion-related untoward events, the athlete at risk, limitations of conventional screening programmes and contemporary recommendations to identify latent cardiovascular disease in athletic populations."

            "abstract": "The arrhythmogenic effects of exercise tests are often unpredictable, sometimes paradoxical, and usually poorly reproducible. This explains why they are rather neglected by rhythmologists in studying the mechanisms of arrhythmias and the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs and why their prognostic value is a matter of controversy. At the same time the induced, supposedly ischaemia-related arrhythmias are usually not prevented by revascularization procedures. All these discrepancies are probably explained by the complex interactions between the time-limited stimulation of the sympathetic drive and the arrhythmia mechanisms. During the exercise test the sympathetic drive is increased via the neurogenic and humoral routes, and the post-exercise period is characterized by a vagally-induced deceleration of the heart rate which intervenes in the setting of a persistent high level of sympathetic activity. The arrhythmia components formed by potential triggers (isolated premature beats) and substrates (repetitive activity) do not react in the same way to those different phases. Extrasystoles are mainly rate-dependent, so that they often tend to disappear as the sinus rate accelerates. The repetitive ventricular activity directly depends on the sympathetic drive, but necessitates the presence of the trigger to become manifest. Conceivably, many different situations may result from the complex interplay between these distinct parameters, so that the apparent clinical effect of exercise may be either arrhythmogenic or antiarrhythmic in apparently identical diseases, or even in the same patients."

Interviews were carried out with 699 myocardial infarction patients after onset of the disease. These cases represented 47 percent of all cases in the study base, and 70 percent of all nonfatal cases. The relative risk from vigorous exertion was 6.1 (95% confidence interval: 4.2, 9.0). The rate difference was 1.5 per million person-hours, and the attributable proportion was 5.7 percent. The risk was modified by physical fitness, with an increased risk being seen among sedentary subjects as in earlier studies, but the data also suggested a U-shaped association. In addition, the trigger effect was modified by socioeconomic status. Premonitory symptoms were common, and this implies risks of reverse causation bias and misclassification of case exposure information that require methodological consideration. Different techniques (the use of the usual-frequency type of control information, a pair-matched analysis, and a standard case-referent analysis) were applied to overcome the threat of misclassification of control exposure information.

            "abstract": "A major determinant of myocardial energetics is the ATPase activity of myofibrils. In order to account for chronic changes in myofibrillar ATPase, the state equation of the intertropomyosin-interaction model of Tawada et al. was extended by introducing the rates of cross-bridge cycling of myofibrils composed of V-1 or V-3 and the concentration of the myosin isoenzymes. Cross-bridge cycling rates of 1.0 or 0.7 were derived for myofibrils composed of V-1 or V-3, respectively. Ca2+ responsiveness and positive co-operativity were not significantly affected by the myosin isoenzymes. Redistribution of the myosin isoenzyme population and thus altered myocardial energetics was observed following administration of various drugs and as a result of different functional loads. Besides thyroid hormones, catecholamines had a marked influence on myosin. Reducing the adrenergic drive by administration of atenolol, guanethidine or reserpine led to a shift in the direction of V-3. Since serum T3 levels were not significantly reduced by these interventions, the drugs act most probably at the organ level. The functional states responsible for the increase in the proportion of V-3 (pressure load, intermittent feeding, schedule-induced stress) also did not affect circulating T3 in a manner that could entirely explain the redistribution. Hypertrophy-induced dilution of sympathetic nerve fibres or reduced adrenergic responsiveness most likely play a role in the redistribution. An increase in the proportion of V-1 was observed following swimming exercise but not, however, after spontaneous or enforced running. In the swim-exercised rats, T3 was markedly reduced. Thus, the trigger reactions linked most probably to the high adrenergic drive during swimming have to overcome the lower T3 level. It is concluded that myocardial energetics can be decisively altered by a variety of drugs and functional loads, whereby the trigger reactions leading to an altered gene expression of myosin cannot be accounted for entirely by altered circulating T3 but most probably involve the adrenergic system."

            "abstract": "The fitness of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome to indulge in sporting activities is a practical cardiology problem. The major risk is sudden death due to atrial fibrillation deteriorating to ventricular fibrillation. This risk is small or even theoretical, but signing a fitness certificate engages the clinician's responsibility. Non invasive complementary examinations are useful. Echocardiography may detect a heart disease that would preclude any sport. Exercise tests explore the behaviour of the accessory pathway and rarely trigger off arrhythmias. Holter recordings mainly investigate disorders of the atrial rhythm. The decision concerning fitness may be based on clinical symptoms. Exercise-induced tachycardia is a classical contra-indication to competitive sports. In patients whose tachycardia is unrelated to exercise, fitness may be discussed according to the results of exercise tests and of the electrophysiological study. A refractory period which would be considered as rather prolonged at rest does not protect against fast ventricular rate during passage to atrial fibrillation. If pre-excitation disappears during the exercise test in an asymptomatic patient, then competitive sports can be authorized without limitations. If not, only surgical excision or fulguration would provide full protection against a potentially dangerous fibrillation. It is concluded that Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome contra-indicates competitive sports in most cases. Games played outside competitions remain possible in the absence of symptoms or when arrhythmias are well controlled by medical treatment."

Ambulatory monitoring has its limitations. Since it is an averaging process, the ability to follow the effect of drugs over short periods of time is strictly limited.

In addition to this dysautonomia as part of PD itself, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) can be triggered as a side-effect of drug treatment interacting with the ANS or - if prominent and early - an indication of a different disease such as multiple system atrophy (MSA). Various diagnostic tests are available to demonstrate autonomic failure. While autonomic function tests can differentiate parasympathetic from sympathetic dysfunction, cardiac imaging can define the pathophysiologically involved site of a lesion. Standard tests such as 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurements can identify significant autonomic failure which needs treatment. The most frequent and disturbing symptom of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is orthostatic hypotension. Symptoms include generalized weakness, light-headiness, mental \"clouding\" up to syncope. Factors like heat, food, alcohol, exercise, activities which increase intrathoraric pressure (e.g. defecation, coughing) and certain drugs (e.g. vasodilators) can worsen a probably asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Non-medical and medical therapies can help the patient to cope with a disabling symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Supine hypertension is often associated with orthostatic hypotension.

Despite these findings, suggesting a baroreceptor mechanism of antinociception during systole, pain intensity ratings reported in these studies were not modulated across the cardiac cycle. This discrepancy between the neurophysiological correlates of pain and its subjective experience was the focus of the current study that used a mixed block design to assess the effects of natural arterial baroreceptor activity on both the NFR and pain intensity and unpleasantness reports. Specifically, electrocutaneous stimuli were randomly delivered to the sural nerve at one of five intensities (50% pain threshold, 75% pain threshold, pain threshold, midway between pain threshold and pain tolerance, pain tolerance) at five intervals (0, 150, 300, 450, and 600ms) after the R-wave of the electrocardiogram. Under painful stimulation, intensity and unpleasantness varied in a quadratic manner across the cardiac cycle; pain was highest at R+300ms and lowest at R+0 and R+600ms. Under non-painful stimulation, ratings declined linearly as the cycle progressed. Finally, nociceptive responses did not differ among the R-wave to stimulation intervals for both painful and non-painful intensities. The observed phasic modulation of pain may be explained by a central nervous system alarm/defence reaction triggered by the unpredictability of the potentially damaging stimulation. The absence of systolic attenuation of nociceptive responding is compatible with previous evidence that baroreceptor modulation of the NFR is abolished under conditions of heightened arousal."

In particular, we show that subcellular Ca activity, such as spontaneous Ca sparks and Ca waves, is highly sensitive to coupled gating between RyR channels in clusters. We show that small changes in coupled gating can induce aberrant Ca release activity, which, under Ca overload conditions, can induce delayed afterdepolarization (DAD). We systematically investigate the properties of subcellular Ca during DAD induction and show that the voltage time course during a DAD is dependent on the timing and number of spontaneous Ca sparks that transition to Ca waves.

            "abstract": "Heart failure is a syndrome characterized initially by left ventricular dysfunction that triggers countermeasures aimed to restore cardiac output. These responses are compensatory at first but eventually become part of the disease process itself leading to further worsening cardiac function. Among these responses is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that provides inotropic support to the failing heart increasing stroke volume, and peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain mean arterial perfusion pressure, but eventually accelerates disease progression affecting survival. Activation of SNS has been attributed to withdrawal of normal restraining influences and enhancement of excitatory inputs including changes in: 1) peripheral baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes; 2) chemical mediators that control sympathetic outflow; and 3) central integratory sites. The interface between the sympathetic fibers and the cardiovascular system is formed by the adrenergic receptors (ARs). Dysregulation of cardiac beta(1)-AR signaling and transduction are key features of heart failure progression. In contrast, cardiac beta(2)-ARs and alpha(1)-ARs may function in a compensatory fashion to maintain cardiac inotropy. Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms may have an impact on the adaptive mechanisms, susceptibilities, and pharmacological responses of SNS. The beta-AR blockers and the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis form the mainstay of current medical management of chronic heart failure. Conversely, central sympatholytics have proved harmful, whereas sympathomimetic inotropes are still used in selected patients with hemodynamic instability. This review summarizes the changes in SNS in heart failure and examines how modulation of SNS activity may affect morbidity and mortality from this syndrome."

To investigate the hemodynamic effect of xamoterol in relation to sympathetic nervous activity, hemodynamic variables and plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were measured at rest and during three graded bicycle exercise tests before and after a single intravenous dose of 0.15 mg/kg xamoterol in 10 patients with mild-to-moderate left ventricular dysfunction. Plasma NE increased with increasing grade of exercise and a linear correlation between plasma NE and heart rate was observed at four time points (at rest and three exercise levels) before and after xamoterol. After administration of xamoterol, the slope of the regression line of plasma NE-heart rate relation was significantly less steep than that before drug. Predose and postdose regression lines crossed at 440 pg/ml of plasma NE. Similar effects were observed on the plasma NE-cardiac index and plasma NE-systolic blood pressure relations (regression lines crossed at 380 and 530 pg/ml of plasma NE, respectively). Thus, xamoterol had a dual agonist-antagonist effect in relation to plasma NE, and the crossover point lay approximately between 400 pg/ml and 500 pg/ml. This level of plasma NE was achieved at a low exercise level and at a heart rate of about 100 beats/min. These results indicate that xamoterol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity comparable to relatively low sympathetic activity (400 to 500 pg/ml of plasma NE) and therefore acts as a beta 1-agonist when sympathetic nervous activity is below this level and as an antagonist when sympathetic activity is above this level."

            "abstract": "Methods: A sedentary life style has been shown to increase the risk of coronary artery disease, a precursor of sudden cardiac death, while regular physical activity prevents atherosclerosis. In an out of hospital cardiac death study in Slovenia, case crossover design was used to investigate physical activity as a potential trigger of sudden cardiac death in connection with certain life style, biological and social risk factors.\nResults: In the study, 206 sudden cardiac deaths were selected: 166 men and 40 women with median age at death 57.8 and 59.0 years, respectively. The relative risk of dying during or within one hour after terminating physical activity of at least 6 metabolic equivalents was 3.0 in comparison to time without activity. The relative risk of people who performed 1.5 hours or more physical activity per week was 2.55 (95 % confidence limits: 1.69–3.84), opposed to 49.90 (confidence limits: 18.73–132.96) for persons who performed less activity. According to the observed characteristics the risk of dying for inactive sudden cardiac victims was 17.13 to 25.89 (95 % confidence limits: 11.28–44.60) times higher in comparison to physically active persons. Persons who drank more than 4 international units of alcohol per day, positive family history, ischaemic heart disease and a heart rate of more than 90 beats/minute had the highest risk.\nConclusion: The results confirmed that the risk of dying due to sudden cardiac death during physical activity depends on the degree of physical activity regularly performed and the existing risk factors.

ARVC has been recognized as a cause of sudden death, especially in the young. The purpose of our autopsy study was to examine the clinical characteristics and the pathological patterns in the hearts of 20 people who died suddenly of ARVC. In view of our findings and the literature, we discussed the possible causes and pathogenesis of ARVC, as well as the mechanisms by which sudden death occurs in this disease. During the 7-year study period, 20 hearts from 9 men and 11 women fulfilled the criteria for ARVC. The mean age was 41 years (range, 17 to 80). The disease was unknown prior to death in all cases. Fourteen persons died at rest, and six on effort. In 9 of the 20 cases, the trigger of sudden death was an acute emotional stress, sometimes associated with a moderate physical activity. The mean heart weight was 380 g (range, 280 to 520). Both ventricles were involved in 40% of the cases. Inflammatory infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes were present in 60% of the cases, but myocyte necrosis was found in only one case. ARVC is more likely to result from a degenerative process than a congenital disorder. Genetic factors, viral or autoimmune inflammation or both, and apoptosis are also involved in the degenerative disorder."

            "abstract": "Information obtained during the past decade suggests the need to reexamine the possibility that the onset of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death is frequently triggered by daily activities. The importance of physical or mental stress in triggering onset of coronary thrombosis is supported by the findings that 1) the frequencies of onset of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke show marked circadian variations with parallel increases in the period from 6:00 AM to noon, 2) transient myocardial ischemia shows a similar morning increase, and episodes are often preceded by mental or physical triggers, 3) a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, often nonobstructive by itself, lies at the base of most coronary thrombi, 4) a number of physiologic processes that could lead to plaque rupture, a hypercoagulable state or coronary vasoconstriction, are accentuated in the morning, and 5) aspirin and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, which block certain of these processes, have been shown to prevent disease onset. The hypothesis is presented that occlusive coronary thrombosis occurs when 1) an atherosclerotic plaque becomes vulnerable to rupture, 2) mental or physical stress causes the plaque to rupture, and 3) increases in coagulability or vasoconstriction, triggered by daily activities, contribute to complete occlusion of the coronary artery lumen. Recognition of the circadian variation--and the possibility of frequent triggering--of onset of acute disease suggests the need for pharmacologic protection of patients during vulnerable periods, and provides clues to mechanism, the investigations of which may lead to improved methods of prevention."

Blood samples for catecholamine measurement were taken after 30 min supine, 60 min standing, and at the first silent ischaemic event, triggered by the real-time ECG monitor, by means of an ambulatory blood withdrawal pump. Metoprolol lowered blood pressure and heart rate in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects, and reduced the frequency and duration of silent ischaemic episodes in hypertensive subjects. Plasma noradrenaline measured during silent ischaemia while the patients were resting was significantly higher than the control supine level without ischaemia. These findings suggest that noradrenergic hyperactivity may have a role in coronary vasoconstriction and that treatment which neutralizes sympathetic tone may be especially beneficial in treatment of silent ischaemia in hypertensive patients."

Minute ventilation is sensed in this pacemaker by means of a standard bipolar pacing electrode. Compared with exercise in the constant rate ventricular pacing (VVI) mode at 1 month after pacemaker implantation, rate responsive pacing resulted in an improvement of exercise capacity of 33 +/- 5% (from 437 +/- 42 s in the VVI mode to 593 +/- 57 s in the rate modulated mode, P less than 0.01, Bruce protocol). This improvement was maintained in the seven patients in whom an exercise test was repeated at 3 months after implantation. The pacing rate was significantly correlated with oxygen consumption (r = 0.84 +/- 0.04) and measured minute ventilation (r = 0.76 +/- 0.06). Symptomatology in these patients was assessed by means of self-assessment questionnaires in a double blind, randomized cross-over study in which the pacemaker was alternatively programmed into the VVI and rate modulated modes. Significant improvements in \"shortness of breath\" and \"energy during daily activities\" were documented during rate modulated pacing and \"palpitations\" and \"chest pain\" were not worsened. Most patients preferred the rate modulated mode during the study. In conclusion, rate modulated pacing by sensing minute ventilation resulted in better exercise capacity and symptomatology.

The amplitude of the bradycardic response was highly variable among the subjects and did not differ significantly between conditions, mean values ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 beats.min-1.mmHg-1. In supine rest, the full bradycardic response appeared within < 1 s, i.e., during or immediately after the R-R interval of the first NS pulse.

The previous reports, however, were based primarily on selected patients in clinical studies. The present study has been designed to determine the timing of attacks of angina pectoris in ambulatory patients, the association of wake time and possible external triggers with angina attacks, and the influence of cardiac medication. The European Survey on Circadian Variation of Angina Pectoris is a multicenter international cross-sectional survey of outpatients treated in general medical practice of seven European countries. Inclusion criteria are stable angina pectoris for at least 3 months, average frequency of two or more attacks per week, and treatment with on-demand nitrates. Standardised self-administered questionnaires are provided to all consecutive patients and their physicians. From January to July 1998, 1087 patients (61% male, 64 +/- 9 years; 39% female, 67 +/- 10 years) were enrolled in 196 centers. A total of 3453 angina pectoris attacks were reported, on average 3.2 per patient per week (range 0-48). The occurrence of angina pectoris attacks demonstrates a significant circadian variation (p < 0.001) with a primary morning peak from 9:00 to 12:00 (relative risk 3.0 compared with other times of day) and a secondary afternoon peak from 15:00 to 18:00. Of all attacks, 50% occured within 6 h after awakening. Seventy-four percent of all patients reported possible external triggers of angina such as physical activity or anger. The present multicenter survey in general medical practice demonstrates a marked wake time related circadian variation in angina pectoris attacks. To improve preventive strategies, therefore, type, dosage and particularly timing of cardiac medication appear of importance, as may be behavior modification approaches."

Extracellular potentials of single upper thoracic (T3) spinal neurons were recorded in pentobarbital-anesthetized, paralyzed, ventilated male rats. Gastric distension (GD) (20, 40, 60 mm Hg, 20 seconds) was produced by air inflation of a latex balloon surgically placed in the stomach. A catheter was placed in the pericardial sac to administer bradykinin solution (10 microg/mL, 0.2 mL, 1 minute) as a noxious cardiac stimulus. Noxious GD (> or =40 mm Hg) altered activity of 26 of 31 (84%) spinal neurons receiving cardiac input. Twenty-two (85%) gastrocardiac convergent neurons were excited, and 1 neuron was inhibited by both intrapericardial bradykinin and GD; the remainder exhibited biphasic response patterns. Twenty-three of 26 (88%) gastrocardiac neurons also received convergent somatic input from the chest, triceps, and upper back areas. Bilateral cervical vagotomy did not significantly affect excitatory responses to GD in 5 of 5 neurons tested. Spinal transection at the C1 segment after vagotomy did not affect excitatory responses to GD in 3 of 4 neurons but abolished the GD response in 1 neuron.

Dementia, however, grows even more rapidly, because it increases exponentially after age 65; it will become a great burden if nothing is done. The discussion so far is concentrated on treatment, whereas prevention is neglected. The therapy of dementia, however, has limited effect. Contrary to a widespread opinion prevention is possible. Genetic factors alone dominate the fate of cognition only in about 3 % of the cases. Besides age, lifestyle and the vascular risk factors exercise a great influence. High blood pressure carries a fourfold risk, diabetes more than doubles the risk both of the vascular and of the Alzheimer type; combined even more. Especially cerebral microangiopathy is strongly associated with Alzheimer's dementia, it triggers the vicious circle which leads to amyloid deposition. The importance of the circulation is underestimated, because most of the microvascular cerebral lesions are not perceived by the patient. All the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease after age 65 are also vascular risk factors especially for microangiopathy: Apo-E4, oestrogen deficiency, insulin resistance, diabetes, arterial hypertension, high cholesterol, old age and increased plasma homocystin which is often caused by alcohol consumption even in moderate doses. A healthy life style with daily outdoor activity and a Mediterranean diet not only reduces the risk of dementia, but also of coronary death and cancer. Cognitively stimulating activity protects even more than physical activity against dementia; the basis for this is acquired in youth by education. Therapy with statins is advisable if atherosclerosis cannot be reasonably counteracted by physical activity and diet."

After two control exercise tests, all patients were treated with 120 mg verapamil given every 8 h orally for 4 days. On the 3rd and 4th day of treatment the exercise tests were repeated. The results were that verapamil caused a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias in 13 out of 22 patients. In patients with concomitant significant ST-segment depression, a prophylactic action could be demonstrated in nine out of ten cases. The antiarrhythmic effect was independent of changes in heart rate. In patients with myocardial ischaemia, a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption and direct electrophysiological effects (suppression of the \"slow response\" and/or an increase in the resting potential of the \"depressed fast response\") can be discussed as mechanisms of action.

            "abstract": "Stress is triggered by a variety of unexpected environmental stimuli, such as aggressive behavior, fear, forced physical activity, sudden environmental changes, social isolation or pathological conditions. Stressful experiences during very early life (particularly, maternal stress during fetal ontogeny) can permanently alter the responsiveness of the nervous system, an effect called programming or imprinting. Programming affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, brain neurotransmitter systems, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the cognitive abilities of the offspring, which can alter neural regulation of immune function. Prenatal or early life stress may contribute to the maladaptive immune responses to stress that occur later in life. This review focuses on the effect of maternal and early life stress on immune function in the offspring across life span. It highlights potential mechanisms by which prenatal stress impacts immune functions over life span. The literature discussed in this review suggests that psychosocial stress during pre- and early postnatal life may increase the vulnerability of infants to the effects of immunotoxicants or immune-mediated diseases, with long-term consequences. Neural-immune interactions may provide an indirect route through which immunotoxicants affect the developing immune system. A developmental approach to understanding how immunotoxicants interact with maternal and early life stress-induced changes in immunity is needed, because as the body changes physiologically across life span so do the effects of stress and immunotoxicants. In early and late life, the immune system is more vulnerable to the effects of stress. Stress can mimic the effects of aging and exacerbate age-related changes in immune function. This is important because immune dysregulation in the elderly is more frequently and seriously associated with clinical impairment and death. Aging, exposure to teratogens, and psychological stress interact to increase vulnerability and put the elderly at the greatest risk for disease."

            "abstract": "When exercise starts, various cardiorespiratory adjustments take place for accommodating the greatly increased metabolic requirements. A rapid response in ventilation (Phase I) may be at least useful for preventing oxygen deficiency and for increasing alveolar ventilation, oxygen tension, and oxygen uptake even if it is minimal. But why is the increasing tidal volume and respiratory frequency elicited so quickly just at the onset of exercise? Dose rapid ventilatory response play an important role as a trigger for surviving in exercising man? It has hitherto been reported that phase I response is observed during not only voluntary and passive movement, but also during electrically induced muscle contraction in man. In addition, it was observed that ventilation in phase I is not affected by hypoxia and is not causally linked to cardiac output. Although these mechanisms have extensively been explored by many investigators, they have still remained obscure until now. At present, the causal factors of phase I are classified as central (descending) and peripheral (ascending) neurogenic stimulus, or as both. In the awake condition, abrupt ventilatory increment immediately after voluntary and passive exercise in man could be attributed to the drives from the central command including cortical and hypothalamic activities as well as some peripheral afferent information mainly through group III and IV fibers. However, further investigations to clarify many unsolved problems should be advanced in future."

Although the use of beta-blockers to counteract the adrenergic hyperactivity has been shown to decrease mortality in these patients, there have been no reports on the role of cholinomimetic drugs in the prognosis of patients after myocardial infarction. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of the administration of pyridostigmine bromide, a reversible anti-cholinesterase agent, on cardiac cholinergic activity assessed by the resting and reflex heart rate responses. Eight healthy volunteers were submitted to a conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram to obtain resting heart rate, and to three non-invasive cardiovascular tests: respiratory sinus arrhythmia, Valsalva maneuver and 4-sec exercise test. On two different days and following a randomized cross-over double-blind protocol, the experiments were performed before and 120 min after oral administration of either pyridostigmine bromide (30 mg) or placebo. Pyridostigmine increase (P < 0.05) the duration of the R-R intervals at rest (pre: 898 +/- 30 msec; post: 1019 +/- 45 msec; pre-placebo: 916 +/- 26 msec; post: 956 +/- 28 msec; P > 0.05). Although the duration of the R-R intervals during the autonomic tests was also increased (P < 0.05), the derived indexes of maximal fluctuation during the maneuvers did not change. These results indicate that oral pyridostigmine produces tonic cardiac cholinergic stimulation while exerting no effect on its reflex changes. Further studies are needed to address the potential role of the administration of pyridostigmine in the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction."

            "abstract": "Two hypotheses explain the role of adult progenitor cells in myocardial regeneration. Stem cell plasticity which involves mobilization of stem cells from the bone marrow and other niches, homing to the area of tissue injury and transdifferentiation into functional cardiomyocytes. Alternative hypothesis is based on the observations that bone marrow harbors a heterogenous population of cells positive for CXCR4 - receptor for chemokine SDF-1. This population of non-hematopoietic cells expresses genes specific for early muscle, myocardial and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). These tissue-committed stem cells circulate in the peripheral blood at low numbers and can be mobilized by hematopoietic cytokines in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Endothelial precursors capable of transforming into mature, functional endothelial cells are present in the pool of peripheral mononuclear cells in circulation. Their number significantly increases in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with subsequent decrease after 1 month, as well as in patients with unstable angina in comparison to stable coronary heart disease (CHD). There are numerous physiological and pathological stimuli which influence the number of circulating EPC such as regular physical activity, medications (statins, PPAR-gamma agonists, estrogens), as well as numerous inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines. Mobilization of stem cells in AMI involves not only the endothelial progenitors but also hematopoietic, non-hematopoietic stem cells and most probably the mesenchymal cells. In healthy subjects and patients with stable CHD, small number of circulating CD34+, CXCR4+, CD117+, c-met+ and CD34/CD117+ stem cells can be detected. In patients with AMI, a significant increase in CD34+/CXCR4+, CD117+, c-met+ and CD34/CD117+ stem cell number the in peripheral blood was demonstrated with parallel increase in mRNA expression for early cardiac, muscle and endothelial markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The maximum number of stem cells was found early in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (<12 hours) with subsequent decrease through the 7-day follow-up and with concomitant changes in the levels of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response and stem cell recruitment. Moreover, peak expression of cardiac muscle and endothelial markers occurred at the same time as the most significant increase in CD34/CXCR4+ stem cell number. The SDF-1/CXCR-4 axis seems particularly important in stem/muscle progenitor cell homing, chemotaxis, engraftment and retention in ischaemic myocardium. The significance of autologous stem cells mobilization in terms of cardiac salvage and regeneration needs to be proved in humans but it seems to be a reparative mechanism triggered early in the course of acute coronary syndromes."

However, CRT is not always successful, is costly, and is applied without individualization. There is no specific measure of synchrony. The goal of this study was to analyze new quantitative parameters of synchrony and compare them with established measures.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Equilibrium radionuclide angiography, phase angle (Ø), and amplitude quantitate regional contraction timing and magnitude and are the basis for new synchrony (S) and entropy (E) parameters. S is the vector sum of all amplitudes based on the angular distribution of Ø divided by the scalar sum of the length of all vectors. Complete S equals 1, and its absence equals 0. E measures the disorder in the region of interest, is 1 with random contraction and 0 with full synchrony, and differentiates among differing contraction patterns. Left ventricular S and E were measured in 22 normal equilibrium radionuclide angiography studies, where regions of interest were drawn from the left ventricle, left atrium, and background to analyze model ventricles with normal wall motion (N), ventricles with aneurysm (An), ventricles with severe diffuse dysfunction (Diff), and ventricles with severe regional dysfunction (Reg). The new S and E parameters were highly reproducible and well differentiated among N, An, Diff, and Reg, which were not separated by SD Ø (SD of ventricular phase), which has gained popularity as a measure of synchrony.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Unique scintigraphic parameters for the evaluation of ventricular synchrony were derived, and their added value was determine compared with established measures. Indications for pacemaker therapy now include the treatment of severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Atrial triggered biventricular pacemakers reduce CHF symptoms and prolong life in patients with cardiomyopathy, severe CHF, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) lower than 35%, and QRS greater than 120 milliseconds. Such pacing, or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), seeks to reduce the heterogeneity and increase the synchrony of ventricular activation, conduction, and contraction. CRT has improved hemodynamics, increased exercise tolerance, reduced symptoms and the need for hospitalization, reversed ventricular remodeling, and reduced the all-cause mortality rate in CHF. However, CRT is costly, fails to improve symptoms or activity level in more than 30% of patients, and is applied blindly without individualization or consideration of lead placement sight. A variety of echocardiographic methods have sought to measure synchrony and its serial changes with CRT. A recent study presented evidence of the poor reproducibility of several widely applied echocardiographic measurements by which to determine ventricular synchrony. Magnetic resonance imaging has excellent resolution of regional wall motion and has been applied to assess ventricular synchrony and its response to pacing therapy. However, these methods are complex and are not well established or widely available, and magnetic resonance imaging has not been widely applied after pacing. An accurate and reproducible method is needed by which to objectively measure regional ventricular synchrony. Phase image analysis, a functional method based on the first Fourier harmonic fit of the gated blood pool time versus radioactivity curve, generates the parameters of amplitude (A), which parallels the extent of regional ventricular contraction or stroke volume, and phase angle (Ø), which represents the timing of regional contraction. It was applied early with demonstrated reproducibility to show the linkage between electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony and to characterize the contraction pattern in heart failure and its alteration with CRT. The SD of ventricular Ø, applied as a marker of synchrony, has been shown to demonstrate the beneficial effects of biventricular pacing, and its strong prognostic value has been shown in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy and CHF, superior to LVEF. The SD Ø may not be optimal for synchrony evaluation. We sought improved, more sensitive parameters to better differentiate synchrony among the spectrum of possible patterns of dyssynergy. We derived, initially evaluated, and here present new synchrony (S) and entropy (E) parameters, based on the phase method, to quantitate regional and global ventricular synchrony and applied them in simulation and clinical protocols."

Nonlinear dynamics were assessed by sample entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis (alpha(1)), and correlation dimension techniques. The 4-second exercise test was used to calculate the cardiac vagal index (CVI), an indirect measure of cardiac vagal activity. In a randomized crossover design, 18 older (70 +/- 5 years of age) subjects completed IHG exercise (four 2-min isometric contractions at 30% MVC) and a time-matched control condition. Following a single bout of bilateral IHG, there was a small reduction in systolic blood pressure (125 +/- 2 to 122 +/- 1 mmHg, P < 0.01), in addition to, a significant decrease in alpha(1) (1.42 +/- 0.12 to 1.22 +/- 0.10, P < 0.05), an increase in sample entropy (1.28 +/- 0.03 to 1.40 +/- 0.05, P < 0.001), and an increase in the CVI (1.24 +/- 0.03 to 1.29 +/- 0.03, P < 0.01). These results suggest improvements in acute cardiac autonomic modulation following a single bout of IHG. This may be mechanistically linked to the observed reductions in ABP seen in previous IHG training studies.

Finger blood pressure and heart rate were measured with PORTAPRES for 24 h during everyday life and during standardized laboratory tasks, once about 1 to 2 h A.M. and once about 10 to 11 h P.M. once about 1 to 2 h A.M. and once about 10 to 11 h P.M. after drug administration. Physical activity was controlled by integrated thigh-EMG. Using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis it was shown that based on 64 s mean values, this measure of physical activity explains 34-77% of the heart rate variance within 24 h (median 53%), 10-52% (31%) of systolic, and 4-38% (25%) of diastolic blood pressure variance when up to 20 time lags of the EMG signal were introduced as possible predictors. This indicates that varying degrees of physical activity have a great impact on everyday blood pressure and heart rate. After one week cilazapril did not alter 24-h means of systolic and diastolic blood pressure or heart rate significantly, but reduced 30 min averages of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 6-10 and 4-6 mm Hg between 1 1/2 and 4 or 6 h after drug administration respectively during everyday life (p = 0.0067-0.066) without changing heart rate.

During the last decade, clinical evidence suggested that the term acute risk factors can be used for the activities and events that suddenly and transiently increase the risk of acute cardiac diseases. External triggers, such as heavy physical activity, emotional stress, eating, cold or heat exposure, coffee or alcohol consumption, cocaine or marijuana use and sexual intercourse are recognized as most important acute risk factors. It is likely that the morning hours may be considered as an endogenous, external triggering independent acute risk factor related to physiological sympathetic arousal. The features of triggering have been best described for an acute myocardial infarction whose moment of onset appears to be the result of a dynamic interaction between an endogenous response to acute risk factors and patient vulnerability. In this article, pathophysiological changes implicated as internal triggering mechanisms are summarized and the terms sympathetic and parasympathetic triggering patterns are introduced. A highly individual approach tailored both to protect against acute risk factors and to reduce patient vulnerability could provide a more complete protection from myocardial infarction and other coronary incidents. Lifestyle modifications, regular physical activity and adequate drug regimens may at least prove able to defer the occurrence of coronary thrombosis, thereby providing time for the development of collateral vessels, plaque stabilization or invasive/surgical treatment."

Weekly measurements of locomotor ability (BBB scale), baseline mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were made, as were cardiovascular responses to training and colorectal distension (to trigger AD).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Treadmill training improved BBB scores from 2 weeks post-transection onward (P = .010). However, it increased AD, resulting in augmented pressor responses from 2 to 6 weeks post-transection (P = .029). Comparison of the vascular response to phenylephrine under ganglionic blockade showed an enhanced vasoconstrictor response in the renal vasculature of trained SCI animals. Immunohistochemical comparison of the L1-L6 spinal cord segments showed an increased area of CGRP immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn (lamina III/IV) of treadmill-trained SCI compared with intact and sedentary SCI animals.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results suggest that treadmill training exaggerated AD responses perhaps through a combination of enhanced vascular reactivity and central plasticity."

            "abstract": "Despite reported benefits of exercise training in men with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) and in both men and women with coronary artery disease, the effects of training in women with CHF have not been throughly investigated. Therefore, 16 women (62 +/- 10 years [mean +/- SD]) with stable, moderate, chronic CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction 28 +/- 8%) were studied in a randomized crossover trial with 8 weeks of knee extensor endurance training and 8 weeks of nontraining. The effects of the exercise-based rehabilitation were assessed in skeletal muscle metabolic capacity, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. The compliance rate in training was 98% and no adverse events occurred during the study period. Training increased the activity of citrate synthase (44%, p <0.0001) and lactate dehydrogenase (23%, p <0.002) in the trained muscles, and an improved oxidative capacity in relation to the glycolytic capacity (23%, p <0.002) was found. Peak oxygen uptake (14%, p <0.0005) and peak work rate (43%, p <0.0001) during incremental exercise increased, and blood lactate concentration during standardized submaximal exercise and during the recovery phase decreased (17%, p <0.05). The distance ambulated during 6 minutes (p <0.03), and the overall (p <0.01), physical (p <0.05), and psychosocial (p <0.03) health-related quality of life improved. Because the skeletal muscle endurance training improved peripheral oxidative capacity, exercise tolerance, and the health-related quality of life without any adverse events, this mode of training can be recommended for women with chronic heart failure."

            "abstract": "A conventional view of the role of sarcomeric thin filaments in cardiac function is that they react with cross-bridges that translate them toward the center of the sarcomere in a reaction triggered by Ca(2+) and powered by ATP. However, thin filaments also engage in a complex network of protein-protein interactions in the Z-disc. Thus, in the modern context, understanding of what thin filaments do in the heart must take into account not only A-band regions that react with cross-bridges, but also I-Z-I regions that rarely, if ever, react with cross-bridges and dwell near and within the Z-disc. To highlight these multiplex functions of the thin filament, I discuss the hypothesis that physical and chemical reactions at the interface of the thin filaments with Z-disc proteins control the docking and activity of kinases and phosphatases that control the levels of phosphorylation of thin filament regulatory proteins. Testing this hypothesis has taken on new significance with the identification of multisite phosphorylation of thin filament proteins as a critical element in the control of cardiac contraction and relaxation reserve and in maladaptive mechanisms in heart failure. Moreover, multiple mutations in Z-disc proteins that link to prevalent cardiomyopathies are likely to alter this remote control of A-band thin filament function."

            "abstract": "Direct physical injury to bone marrow is associated with a systemic osteogenic response. However, blood loss, a condition that stimulates hemopoietic stem cells, also may activate osteoprogenitor cells in the bone marrow. To determine if bleeding induces a systemic osteogenic response, the mineral appositional rates and osteoblast numbers were determined in the bones of rats that were subjected to controlled cardiac bleeding and compared with those of rats subjected to ablation of their tibial bone marrow. In addition, a study of the kinetics of the osteogenic responses during the first 10 days after operative treatment was performed by quantitating the serum levels of biochemical indices known to be associated with systemic bone formation. The results showed that animals that sustained acute blood loss (1% or 3% body weight) or injury to their tibial bone marrow had statistically significant increases in mineral appositional rate, osteoblast number, and serum levels of osteogenic growth peptide. The kinetics studies showed that osteogenic growth peptide levels peaked on the tenth postoperative day and declined sharply thereafter. An enhancement of serum osteocalcin activity occurred only on the second postoperative day, was increased in all experimental groups when compared with untreated control animals, but immediately declined to baseline levels. Alkaline phosphatase activities increased in the experimental groups, peaking on Day 10 after tibial bone marrow ablation and on Day 12 in the group that underwent bleeding. These findings suggest that bleeding alone, independent of any skeletal trauma, may evoke a systemic osteogenic response. This response is similar in its timing and magnitude to that which has been shown to follow direct physical injury to bone marrow. The observation that systemic bone formation follows bone marrow activation induced by two different stimuli suggests that these responses may be mediated by common regulatory mechanisms. The ability to trigger or control these responses may form the basis for future therapeutic strategies to enhance bone formation."

Captopril was evaluated as an adjuvant to diuretic and digoxin therapy in heart failure in old age, using walking ability, minute ventilation and oxygen consumption and plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentration as measures of outcome. 2. Twenty patients, mean (s.d.) age 81 (6) years, entered a double-blind, randomised, crossover study of three treatments, a twice daily regimen of captopril (AA), at a dosage established by titration against serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, the same dosage in the morning with placebo at night (AP), and twice daily placebo (PP). Each treatment lasted 3 weeks. A 2 week run-in period on triple therapy, with AA captopril, was used to assess stability and compliance. Seventeen completed all treatments: three completed two. 3. Any benefit of captopril was modest and there was deterioration in gait on the titrated dosage 3 months afterwards (P = 0.04). Efficacy in the old may be greatest when the titrated dose (25 or 50 mg) is given once daily: the multiple daily doses recommended may be unnecessarily demanding. 4. Walking performance was measured by gait analysis (GA) at free walking speed and by a simple walking test (SWT), in which patients stopped at the first relevant symptom. There was a consistent tendency for four measures of performance (GA: speed, stride length and double support time; SWT distance) to be best on the AP treatment, next best on AA, and worst on PP but for the fifth, SWT speed, AP and AA were similar. The trend appeared most marked for SWT distance, mean (s.e. mean) values for AP, AA and PP being 123 (15), 94 (16) and 75 (16) m, respectively. However, the treatment effect did not reach statistical significance at the 0.05 level. 5. There was no significant difference between treatments in minute ventilation, minute oxygen consumption, or their ratio, either at rest or on exercise. 6. Resting ANF concentrations were nearly four times higher (P = 0.0001) in the patients than those, mean (s.e. mean) 66 (5) pmol l-1, in eleven healthy volunteers of mean age 80 (6) years, and the increase on exercise, seen in the controls (P less than 0.01), was absent. In the patients the resting plasma ANF concentration was significantly affected by treatment (P = 0.03), being less on both AP, 245 (9), and AA, 214 (9) than on PP, 264 (10) pmol l-1 (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). 7. Baseline serum ACE activity was induced on active treatment. The change in ACE activity at 3 h post an active dose was significantly greater on AP than AA (P = 0.005). The increased sensitivity to inhibition during once daily administration was reflected in mean arterial pressure. The pre-dose standing pressure was less on AP than on PP (P less than 0.05), and the change in postural fall (pre-dose minus 2 h post), was greater (P = 0.004), but AA and PP were similar in these respects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Psychophysiological monitoring can be used to assess emotional reactivity in cardiovascular measures. Since blood pressure (BP) variability in daily life is primarily caused by physical activity, metabolic and nonmetabolic effects are confounded. A newly developed method of multiple accelerometry allows for the control of such unwanted variances by continuously detecting posture, general activity, and distinct movement patterns. Contingent on episodes of additional heart rate (AHR), an indicator of emotional reactivity, BP measurements can be triggered and participants prompted to enter their current mood in a handheld PC. To evaluate both new methods for BP research, we performed 24-h ambulatory monitoring with 40 normotensive student participants, an evaluation designed to include standard settings for a controlled comparison (library vs. cinema). Findings indicated that the group at the cinema showed higher values of AHR, but group differences in BP were not observed. On the whole, such multiple accelerometry and interactive monitoring appear to be useful methods in behavior research."

Ten dogs with a healed anterior myocardial infarction (MI) had ventricular fibrillation (VF) during a 2-min occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery performed toward the end of a submaximal exercise stress test. In successive trials in the same animals, d-sotalol (three injections of 8 mg/kg, one every 12 h), d,l-sotalol (8 mg/kg), and propranolol (1 mg/kg) were tested. All three interventions significantly reduced heart rate (HR) response to exercise, but only d,l-sotalol and propranolol also blunted the reflex HR increase during acute myocardial ischemia. With d-sotalol, HR at 30 s of coronary occlusion was similar (253 +/- 28 beats/min) to that observed in the control tests (259 +/- 35 beats/min). d-Sotalol prevented recurrence of VF in only 1 of 10 dogs tested. One dog was lost to the continuation of the study after occurrence of VF with d-sotalol. Six of 9 dogs (67%) tested with d,l-sotalol and 5 (56%) of the same 9 dogs tested with propranolol were protected from VF. d-Sotalol does not reduce risk of VF during acute myocardial ischemia associated with sympathetic hyperactivity, and lethal events can be prevented by antiadrenergic interventions."

This review summarises the current state-of-the-art of the risk stratification techniques and lists achievements in this field. The review comments in detail on individual factors used in risk stratification. Residual ischemia may be considered as one of the main triggering factors of post-infarction arrhythmia. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction indicates deterioration of ventricular function. Electrical instability of the myocardium reflects the potential substrate of arrhythmia. Frequent ventricular ectopic activity provides triggers of ventricular tachycardia and/or fibrillation when acting on a suitable substrate. Impaired autonomic status of the heart may lead to the loss of vagal antiarrhythmic protection. Further, the tests used for risk stratification are discussed. Ventriculography provides estimates of left ventricular ejection fraction. Holter monitoring is used for the assessment of ventricular ectopic activity and heart rate variability. Exercise testing is used to address residual ischemia. Programmed ventricular stimulation and the analysis of signal averaged electrocardiograms estimate electrical instability of the myocardium. Baroreflex sensitivity is a measure of cardiac parasympathetic reflexes. The design and results of different experimental and clinical studies which utilised these tests are also discussed."

It happens mostly through diminished cardiac vagal modulation and greater procoagulant activity in depressed patients. But the impact of emotional factors in acute cardiac events is not estimated enough. From the clinician's point of view, there are an increasing awareness concerning external circumstances and external triggering in sudden cardiac death, that is caused by malignant ventricular arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. A number of external, i.e. exogenous factors in everyday life can be implicated in triggering such events. Including heavy physical activity, emotional stressors, meteorologic variables, air pollutants, chronobiologic phenomena, food ingestions, coffee, alcohol etc., emotional stress seems to be among the most often triggers of sudden event. There is a wide range of everyday situations and activities that involves activation of sympathetic nervous system, and emotional stressors are described as trigger caused by sympathetic arousal. Acute emotional arousal can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias and the mechanisms of that risk have been recognized. Acute episode of emotional distress (and notably anger-like stress) may trigger ventricular ectopic beats and tachycardia, as well as acute myocardial infarction. These sudden phenomena can be the result of the endogenous response to external risk of acute emotional stress. Sudden death without antecedent angina, suggesting cardiac arrhythmia, as well as deaths preceded by chest pain, suggesting coronary occlusion were observed in many studies that have led to estimates that between 20 and 40 percent of sudden cardiac deaths are precipitated by acute emotional stressors."

At rest, as compared to placebo, neither dilevalol nor propranolol significantly affected arterial pressure and heart rate but, whereas propranolol decreased cardiac output (-27% at 2 h) and tended to increase total peripheral resistance, dilevalol tended to increase cardiac output and decreased total peripheral resistance (-7% at 2 h). Neither dilevalol nor propranolol affected brachial artery diameter. Propranolol tended to decrease brachial artery flow (-20% at 2 h) and to increase brachial vascular resistance (+25% at 2 h), but dilevalol did not and the brachial irrigation ratios did not change. Neither of the drugs affected carotid haemodynamics or plasma atrial natriuretic factor. Both drugs tended to decrease plasma renin activity, and dilevalol (+82% at 2 h) increased norepinephrine more than propranolol (+19% at 2 h). After exercise, dilevalol and propranolol produced similar falls in the induced increases in arterial pressure, heart rate and cardiac output, and had the same effects on regional haemodynamics, plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic factor. Finally, dilevalol greatly increased plasma norepinephrine. We conclude that the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist activity of dilevalol was clearly expressed at rest, thus inducing vasodilation and counteracting the beta-adrenoceptor blockade-induced negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. However, during sub-maximal exercise, only the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity of dilevalol was apparent."

Plasma noradrenaline at rest was similar with both drugs and not significantly different from placebo. During submaximal exercise it increased significantly to 1,228 +/- 58 pg/ml with placebo and to 1,295 +/- 174 pg/ml with milrinone; this response was reduced significantly with captopril, to 820 +/- 100 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). Thus, long-term therapy with both captopril and milrinone improved the clinical score, but only captopril reduced the plasma noradrenaline response to submaximal exercise. These findings suggest that angiotensin-enzyme inhibition with captopril will modulate the adrenergic system response to daily activities in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and therefore could have additional salutary effects beyond vasodilatation."

Muscle of her affected son carried 96% mutated mitochondrial DNA. Both patients were biopsied twice, showing isolated complex I deficiency in the son's first biopsy, additional increased (within normal range) complex II + III activities in his second biopsy, combined complex I, II + III deficiency in mothers first biopsy and additional complex IV deficiency in her second biopsy. After a stay in the mountains, the son died of cardiac arrhythmia. The A3302G mutation has been reported before and is associated with mitochondrial myopathy and cardiorespiratory failure. Pathogenesis is explained by abnormal mtRNA processing, which was also reported for the adjacent C3303T mutation associated with cardiomyopathy and/or skeletal myopathy. Our findings suggest that a high mutation load of the A3302G mutation can lead to fatal cardiorespiratory failure, likely triggered by low environmental oxygen pressure and exercise."

This study examines the initiating sequences of exercise induced idiopathic VT of left bundle branch block-like (LBBB-like) morphology and makes an attempt to relate these to clinical aspects and the mechanisms of arrhythmia. Thirty-two patients (mean age 33.4 +/- 13.2 years; 18 men) with exercise induced VT in the absence of structural cardiac abnormality on history, clinical examination, and noninvasive and invasive investigations were divided into two groups on the basis of the initiating sequence of VT on exercise. Group I consisted of patients with long-short sequence of RR intervals prior to the onset of VT (initiating/preinitiating cycle length ratio < or = 0.78). Group II consisted of patients without changes in cycle length prior to VT. Group I mechanism would suggest delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) or reentry whereas group II mechanism triggered activity due to early afterdepolarizations. Fourteen patients (group I) had long-short sequence and 18 patients (group II) were without cycle length changes prior to VT initiated during exercise. VT axis was inferior in all 18 patients in group II but only in 9 patients in group I (P = 0.02). In these predefined patient groups, sustained monomorphic VT could not be initiated by programmed stimulation in any patient in group I, whereas four patients in group II had inducible VT. Patients in group II also had higher incidence of sustained VT on ambulatory monitoring (P < 0.05). The two groups did not differ in other respects. This study demonstrates the existence of at least two possible mechanisms of initiation of exercise induced idiopathic VT of LBBB-like morphology. VT initiated without cycle length changes is more common, more likely to have an inferior axis suggesting an outflow tract origin, and is probably related to triggered activity secondary to DADs. VT initiated with a long-short sequence is more often nonsustained and may have a superior axis suggesting an origin from the body or septal region of the ventricle. The two groups, therefore, exhibit differences in electrophysiological characteristics that may aid classification and therapy of this arrhythmia."

In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM(2.5) exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."

Fifteen healthy subjects (10 men, 5 women) with a sedentary lifestyle completed a 6-wk training program during which they completed an average of 29 1-h EMS sessions. The form of EMS used by the subjects was capable of eliciting a cardiovascular exercise response without loading the limbs or joints. It achieved this by means of inducing rapid, rhythmical contractions in the large leg muscles. A crossover study design was employed with subjects undergoing their habitual activity levels during the nontraining phase of the study. The training effect was evaluated by means of a treadmill test to determine peak aerobic capacity [peak oxygen consumption (Vo(2))], a 6-min walking distance test, and measurement of body mass index (BMI) and quadriceps muscle strength. At baseline, the mean values for peak Vo(2), 6-min walking distance, quadriceps strength, and BMI were 2.46 +/- 0.57 l/min, 493.3 +/- 36.8 m, 360.8 +/- 108.7 N, and 26.9 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2), respectively. After training, subjects demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all variables except BMI. Peak Vo(2) increased by an average of 0.24 +/- 0.16 l/min (P < 0.05), walking distance increased by 36.6 +/- 19.7 m (P < 0.005), and quadriceps strength increased by 87.5 +/- 55.9 N (P < 0.005); we did not observe a significant effect due to training on BMI (P > 0.05). These results suggest that EMS can be used in sedentary adults to improve physical fitness. It may provide a viable alternative to more conventional forms of exercise in this population."

The study started with 10 days of washout, during which the patients exercised twice on bicycle to verify the reproducibility of the test. Then, they took N or isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISM) for 14 days according to a double blinded cross-over balanced study. Between the 2 periods patients took placebo (PL) for 14 days. In the first day and in the last day of each period, 2 hours after the last drug intake, patients performed a stress test on bicycle. Like ISM, N significantly increased, versus PL, 1 mm of ST depression time (ischemic threshold) in the first and in the last day, without differences between the 2 drugs and between the days. Moreover, ST depression was significantly lower at maximal common work (MCW) versus PL. The rate-pressure product was not different from PL after N and ISM at maximal common work, but is was increased at the ischemic threshold. In conclusion, like ISM, N has shown antiischemic activity in patients suffering from stable angina pectoris on effort with fixed ischemic threshold. After 14 days of treatment there was no evidence of tolerance. The activity of N seems essentially due to an increase of coronary blood flow to ischemic zones."

The second aim was to determine whether there is a relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and physical activity in patients with hypertension when treating with a short-acting (nifedipine) or long-acting (benidipine) calcium channel blocker. In Study 1, ambulatory BP and physical activity were measured simultaneously in 27 patients with hypertension before and after 6 months with benidipine. In Study 2, ambulatory BP and physical activity were measured simultaneously in 16 patients with hypertension before (placebo) and after 6 weeks of crossover treatment with nifedipine and benidipine. In Study 1, there was no difference in the SBP change caused by physical activity between the pre- and posttreatment periods. In Study 2, SBP was significantly related to physical activity in the placebo (16/16) and benidipine (16/16) groups but not in the nifedipine (12/16) group. The lowest BP during day-time and nighttime in the nifedipine group were significantly lower than those in the benidipine group.

            "abstract": "Patients with Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) mostly have mutations on the KCNJ2 gene, producing loss of function or dominant-negative suppression of the inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir2.1. However, clinical manifestations of ATS including dysmorphic features, periodic paralysis (hypo-, hyper-, or normokalemic), long QT, and ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) are considerably variable. Using a modified dynamic Luo-Rudy simulation model of cardiac ventricular myocytes, we attempted to elucidate mechanisms of VA in ATS by analyzing effects of the inward rectifier K(+) channel current (I(K1)) on the action potential (AP). During pacing at 1.0 Hz with extracellular K(+) concentration ([K(+)](o)) at 4.5 mM, a stepwise 10% reduction of Kir2.1 channel conductance progressively prolonged the terminal repolarization phase of the AP along with gradual depolarization of the resting membrane potential (RMP). At 90% reduction, early afterdepolarizations (EADs) became inducible and RMP was depolarized to -52.0 mV (control: -89.8 mV), followed by emergence of spontaneous APs. Both EADs and spontaneous APs were facilitated by a decrease in [K(+)](o) and suppressed by an increase in [K(+)](o). Simulated beta-adrenergic stimulation enhanced delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and could also facilitate EADs as well as spontaneous APs in the setting of low [K(+)](o) and reduced Kir2.1 channel conductance. In conclusion, the spectrum of VAs in ATS may include 1) triggered activity mediated by EADs and/or DADs and 2) abnormal automaticity manifested as spontaneous APs. These VAs can be aggravated by a decrease in [K(+)](o) and beta-adrenergic stimulation and may potentially induce torsade de pointes and cause sudden death. In patients with ATS, the hypokalemic form of periodic paralysis should have the highest propensity to VAs, especially during physical activity."

In this condition, it is important to demonstrate that a stable beta-blocking effect at steady state can be predicted by a mathematical model determined by plasma concentration-effect relationship after an acute intravenous (i.v.) dose. This relation was studied in 10 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled study after a 5-min i.v. infusion of bisoprolol (5 mg) or placebo. Standardized exercise tests were recorded at different times for 48 h after infusion with simultaneous bisoprolol assay (high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) in plasma. After a 1-week interval, subjects received oral bisoprolol (10 mg once daily) for 5 days and exercise tests were repeated on day 5 before and 2, 3, and 4 h after dosing, with bisoprolol plasma level determined simultaneously. In the acute period, bisoprolol significantly decreased exercise heart rate (HR: peak effect -20.5 +/- 4%) as compared with placebo. There was a direct relationship (no hysteresis) between beta-blockade and plasma concentrations with a sigmoid (7 subjects) or a linear (3 subjects) best-fit model. After repeated bisoprolol administration, steady-state plasma levels were achieved and 88% of the observed decreases in exercise HR were within the 95% confidence interval (CI) for individual prediction. These data suggest that bisoprolol-induced beta-blockade after repeated oral dosing can be predicted by single-test i.v. dose administration."

However, the risk-benefit ratio of physical exercise differs among these two age groups. In adults, physical activity can be regarded as a 'double-edged sword': vigorous exertion increases the incidence of acute coronary events in individuals who did not exercise regularly, whereas habitual physical activity reduces the overall risk of myocardial infarction and sudden coronary death by preventing development and progression of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. On the other hand, in adolescents and young adults sports activity is associated with a significant increase of the risk of sudden death. Sport is not per se the cause of the enhanced mortality in this age group; rather, it acts as a trigger of cardiac arrest in those athletes who are affected by silent cardiovascular conditions, mainly cardiomyopathy, premature coronary artery disease and congenital coronary anomalies, which predispose to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during physical exercise."

In the verapamil-irresponsive group, 10 patients (group IA) had VT that could be initiated by programmed ventricular extrastimulation and terminated by overdrive ventricular pacing, and 11 patients (group IB) had VT that could be provoked by isoproterenol infusion (3-8 micrograms/min) but not by programmed electrical stimulation, and that could not be converted to a sustained sinus rhythm by overdrive ventricular pacing. Notably, in the group IA patients, all 10 patients had structural heart disease (coronary arteriosclerosis or idiopathic cardiomyopathy); beta-adrenergic blockade accelerated the VT rate in one patient but exerted no effects on the VT rate in the remaining 9 patients, and VT remained inducible in all 10 patients. By contrast, in the group IB patients, 7 of the 11 patients had no apparent structural heart disease; beta-adrenergic blockade completely suppressed the VT inducibility during isoproterenol infusion in all 11 patients. There were 12 patients with verapamil-responsive VT (group II). 11 of the 12 patients had no apparent structural heart disease. In these patients, the initiation of VT was related to attaining a critical range of cycle lengths during sinus, atrial-paced or ventricular-paced rhythm; beta-adrenergic blockade could only slow the VT rate without suppressing its inducibility. Of note, 14 of the total 33 patients had exercise provocable VT: two in group IA, five in group IB, and seven in group II. Thus, mechanisms of VT vary among patients, and so do their pharmacologic responses. Although reentry, catecholamine-sensitive automaticity, and triggered activity related to delayed afterdepolarizations are merely speculative, results of this study indicate that beta-adrenergic blockade is only specifically effective in a subset group (group IB) of patients with VT suggestive of catecholamine-sensitive automaticity."

We then tested the effects of promoter variation on cardiovascular traits.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The A-296C disrupted a c-FOS motif, exhibiting differential mobility shifting to chromaffin cell nuclear proteins during EMSA, binding of endogenous c-FOS on ChIP, and differential response to exogenous c-FOS. The A-261T disrupted motifs for SRY and YY1, with similar consequences for EMSA, endogenous factor binding, and responses to exogenous factors. The 2-SNP CHGB promoter haplotypes had a profound (p=3.16E-20) effect on blood pressure (BP) in the European ancestry population, with a rank order of CT<AA<<CA<AT on both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), accounting for approximately 2.3% to approximately 3.4% of SBP/DBP variance; the haplotype effects on BP in vivo paralleled those on promoter activity in cella. Site-by-site interactions at A-296C and A-261T yielded highly nonadditive effects on SBP/DBP. The CHGB haplotype effects on BP were also noted in an independent (African ancestry) sample. In normotensive twins, parallel effects were noted for a pre-hypertensive phenotype, BP response to environmental stress.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The common CHGB promoter variants A-296C and A-261T, and their consequent haplotypes, alter binding of specific transcription factors to influence gene expression in cella as well as BP in vivo.

            "abstract": "Circadian patterns of risk for cardiac events and their implications for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular conditions are discussed. Sympathovagal tone, a major biological determinant of circadian variation in cardiovascular function, is modulated through circadian patterns of sleep-wake activity. The influence of neurohumoral activity on cardiovascular function is manifested by 24-hour variability in heart rate, blood pressure, and vasomotor tone. Platelet aggregation and plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 activity peak around the time of awakening. Conversely, endogenous plasminogen activator exhibits a nadir around the time of awakening. Studies of patterns of occurrence of cardiac disorders such as acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, and ventricular arrhythmia show an increased occurrence during the period surrounding awakening. These patterns are consistent with observed circadian patterns in cardiovascular function. Diabetes, left ventricular dysfunction, and congestive heart failure may contribute to alterations in patterns of occurrence of cardiac events. Factors such as race, sex, and age may lead to alterations in circadian variation in cardiovascular function. Unusual physical exertion, stress, and anger may act as triggers of an event at any time of day. The circadian patterns of cardiac events follow the natural fluctuations in endogenous physiological processes, with a vulnerable period consistently observed in the early morning; dynamic assessment of markers of cardiovascular function may assist in determining the extent of disease progression and in selecting cardiovascular therapies."

Furthermore, we assessed thrombin generation [prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) and thrombin-antithrombin complexes in plasma] and thrombin activity (fibrinopeptide A in plasma). Exercise (bicycle ergometry) enhanced thrombin-induced platelet fibrinogen binding (P<0.05) and platelet aggregability (P<0.01), and elevated F1+2, thrombin-antithrombin complexes and fibrinopeptide A (P<0.05 for all three). Adrenaline infusion enhanced thrombin-induced platelet fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregability (P<0.05), and elevated thrombin-antithrombin complexes (P<0.05), whereas F1+2 and fibrinopeptide A levels were not significantly affected. Mental stress increased platelet sensitivity to high concentrations of thrombin only, and produced small increases in levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes. Time control experiments showed no important changes with repeated measurements during rest. Platelet responses to exercise and adrenaline were reversible, with recovery 60 min later. Thus, heavy exercise and high levels of adrenaline reversibly increased platelet aggregability and platelet sensitivity to thrombin, and enhanced thrombin formation; the effects were most pronounced during exercise. Mental stress only weakly affected these parameters."

            "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome is the leading cause of death in infancy, but its pathophysiological mechanism has been elusive. Sudden death in adults is a common phenomenon, but the etiology in many cases remains unknown at autopsy. We hypothesize that maladaptive sympathetic bias is the explanatory mechanism that links many cases of sudden demise among adults and infants as companion syndromes. Normally, sympathetic response occurs as an adaptation to physiologic demands of the body through various autonomic reflex arcs such as chemoreceptors. Sympathetic response can become chronic and maladaptive when the normal sympathetic response fails to correct the precipitating physiologic trigger, leading to chronic activation of autonomic reflex arcs. In conditions such as infant sleep apnea or adult heart failure, a pernicious cycle of sympathetic bias may result. Chronic sympathetic bias increases susceptibility to sudden fatal arrhythmias, QT-related and otherwise, in the setting of an exaggerated adrenergic challenge. Examples of such adrenergic stressors include trauma, hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, sleep arousal, illness, medical procedures, and physical activity, all of which have associations with sudden death. Our hypothesis may not only help explain the survival benefits of drugs such as beta-blockers and devices such as synchronization therapy, but also portend new application of similar therapies for many conditions of sympathetic bias."

However in men with CHF, serum levels of TNF- were similar before and after treatment with testosterone or placebo, irrespective of the length of study or route of administration. The clinically beneficial actions of testosterone in men with CHF are unlikely to be mediated by reducing TNF-alpha."

            "abstract": "Week-long or longer monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, coupled to time-structure analyses, can help detect disease-risk elevations, as a warning of the need for a preventive prehabilitation. Within the normal range of physiologic variation, computer methods quantify time structures, or chronomes, that can serve as reference values. The major applied purpose for mapping chronomes is the detection of disease-risk syndromes such as blood pressure \"overswinging\" and heart rate \"underswinging.\" Too much blood pressure variability (circadian hyperamplitude tension; CHAT), is a risk factor for vascular disease. Other risk syndromes are chronome alterations of heart rate variability (CAHRVs), consisting of a loss of \"jitter\", i.e., a reduced standard deviation of heart rate or of alterations in the spectral element of the heart-rate-variability chronome, such as in the correlation dimension, an endpoint of deterministic chaos. These alterations can again serve for prehabilitation. On the basic side, the spectral element of the heart-rate-variability chronomes extends from focus on the heartbeat's period of about 1 second to periods in heart rate and its standard deviation that are numerical equivalents of about 10.5- and about 21-year cycles of solar activity. A seemingly unnatural physiologic rhythm or pattern (such as one of 81.6 hours) may correspond numerically to a purely physical environmental rhythm. For example, interplanetary magnetic storms, with their cycles as external chronome components, trigger myocardial infarctions, strokes, and traffic accidents. The systematic monitoring of external rhythms along with physiologic ones for the concurrent analysis of rhythms with longer and longer periods could detect alterations anywhere in and between the 1 cycle/sec and the 1 cycle/10.5- or 21-years regions of the spectrum. Chronobiomimetic engineering for discovering both instantaneous and long-term chronorisk alterations can provide warnings of increased risk. If risk-lowering therapy is then instituted automatically, instrumented health care will be extended beyond the pacemaker-cardioverter-defibrillator, which focuses on the frequency of 1 cycle/sec. Instrumentation that automatically detects blood pressure that varies too much and heart rate that varies too little is needed for prompting prophylactic CHAT and CAHRV treatment. A database of reference values that can be used for chronodiagnosis is now accumulating."

Furthermore, the urinary excretion of noradrenaline, adrenaline and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy mandelic acid did not change during beta receptor blockade.

Such triggering may result from unfavorable alterations in the balance between the prothrombotic and antithrombotic properties of the blood. The present study compares the effects of 2 common daily activities, assuming the upright posture and exercise, on platelet aggregation and fibrinolytic activity. In healthy male subjects, assuming the upright posture in the morning significantly increased platelet aggregation and produced only a moderate increase in fibrinolytic activity within 10 minutes. These changes were still present after 90 minutes in the upright posture. Supine posture for 45 minutes resulted in levels of fibrinolytic activity and platelet aggregation comparable to that observed before initially assuming the upright posture in the morning. Return to the supine posture for 45 minutes resulted in levels of fibrinolytic activity and platelet aggregation comparable to that observed before the initial assumption of upright posture. The changes recurred when upright posture was taken later in the day. Exercise did not increase platelet aggregation to levels beyond that produced by the upright posture, but was associated with a marked increase in fibrinolytic activity. Thus, exercise and upright posture produce distinctive alterations in the thrombogenic potential of the blood that may influence the timing of clinical vascular events."

Approximately 12% of all natural deaths occur suddenly, and 88% of them are of cardiac origin. This is the form of death in more than 50% of coronary heart disease patients. Moreover, it is the first symptom in 19-26% of cases. This close relationship with coronary heart disease results in cardiovascular risk factors being also risk factors for sudden death. Several factors, such as physical activity or certain drugs may act as sudden death triggers. The more effective strategy addressed to sudden cardiac death prevention includes identification high-risk subgroups of patients (i.e. patients with previous coronary heart disease, heart failure, out-of-hospital sudden death survivors and patients who developed a ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia after a myocardial infarction) and development of efficacious therapeutic interventions. Given that most sudden death are related to coronary heart disease, those primary preventive measures directed to reduce the coronary heart disease incidence rates will also prevent sudden cardiac deaths in population. Finally, community programs directed to reduce the time to reach cardiac emergencies by trained personnel, and to train general population in cardio-respiratory reanimation have shown to be efficacious owing to the fact that most sudden cardiac deaths occur out of hospitals."

This hormone upregulates the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK)1, which in turn stimulates I(Ks), a slow delayed rectifier potassium current that mediates cardiac action potential repolarization. Mutations in I(Ks) channel alpha (KCNQ1, KvLQT1, Kv7.1) or beta (KCNE1, IsK, minK) subunits cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), an inherited cardiac arrhythmia associated with increased risk of sudden death. Together with the GTPases RAB5 and RAB11, SGK1 facilitates membrane recycling of KCNQ1 channels. Here, we show altered SGK1-dependent regulation of LQTS-associated mutant I(Ks) channels. Whereas some mutant KCNQ1 channels had reduced basal activity but were still activated by SGK1, currents mediated by KCNQ1(Y111C) or KCNQ1(L114P) were paradoxically reduced by SGK1. Heteromeric channels coassembled of wild-type KCNQ1 and the LQTS-associated KCNE1(D76N) mutant were similarly downregulated by SGK1 because of a disrupted RAB11-dependent recycling. Mutagenesis experiments indicate that stimulation of I(Ks) channels by SGK1 depends on residues H73, N75, D76, and P77 in KCNE1. Identification of the I(Ks) recycling pathway and its modulation by stress-stimulated SGK1 provides novel mechanistic insight into potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias triggered by physical or psychological stress."

The single-blind design was instituted because subjects become unblinded due to physiological changes (i.e., fluid shifts, weight gain, and secretory changes) associated with estrogen intake. However, investigators and technicians involved in data collection and analyses remained blind. After each treatment, subjects performed identical autonomic tests, during which electrocardiograms, beat-by-beat BPs, and respiration were recorded. The area under the dicrotic notch of the BP wave was used as an index of arteriolar distensibility. The magnitude of the reflex bradycardia after a precipitous rise in BP was used to determine BRS. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability was used to assess autonomic activity. BPs were recorded from resistance vessels in the finger using a beat-by-beat photoplethysmographic device. RPP, a noninvasive marker of myocardial oxygen consumption, was calculated. Repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed a significantly enhanced arteriolar distensibility and BRS after ERT (P < 0.05). A trend of a lower sympathovagal balance at rest was observed after ERT, however, this trend did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.061) compared with the other treatments. The above autonomic changes produced significantly lower systolic and diastolic BP changes and RPPs (P < 0.05) at rest and during isometric exercise. We conclude that short-term unopposed ERT favorably enhances arteriolar distensibility, BRS, and hemodynamic parameters in postmenopausal women. These findings have clinical implications in the goals for treating cardiovascular risk factors in aging women."

Everyday circumstances which significantly increase the risk of the onset of ACS during the period of several hours have been termed acute risk factors. This term includes morning hours and various possible external triggers such as heavy physical exertion, emotional stress, sexual activity, meteorological stress, and large meals. Possible external triggers precede approximately a half of the onsets of ACS, more frequently in men. Conversely, emotional stress plays a more important role in the triggering of ACS in women. Circadian rhythm represents an independent natural pattern of endogenous functions which is responsible for the morning excess in the incidence of ACS. A beneficial effect of regular physical activity and use of beta-blocker, calcium antagonists, nitrates and aspirin in the prevention of triggering ACS by acute risk factors has been described. Identification of further acute risk factors and better understanding of internal triggering mechanisms may improve the prevention of ACS and other cardiovascular incidents."

Documentation of effectiveness during prolonged monitoring is lacking, however. To assess more accurately the long-term utility of this treatment modality for medically refractory supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs), 10 patients with atrially implanted Intermedics Intertach pacemakers were randomly assigned to either a low or a high bradycardia (back-up) pacing rate. SVT counts were performed during matching follow-up periods both at the initial rate and after rate crossover. The primary antitachycardia modality of this pacemaker (P mod) provides burst pacing to terminate tachycardia episodes, and P mod counters were utilized to quantitate SVT episodes. Tachycardia termination algorithms were programmed to \"no restart\" and were not changed during the study. The P mod use counter, therefore, reflected the number of discrete episodes of SVTs. Pacemaker implantation diagnoses include atrial flutter, concealed bypass tract, AV nodal reentry, intraatrial reentry, and Wolff-Parkinson-White associated tachycardia. Patient age was 59 +/- 18 yrs. The average pacemaker back-up low rate was 45.7 +/- 4 versus a back-up high rate of 85.1 +/- 2 beats/min. Follow-up was for 57.4 days +/- 33 days at the low rate and 57.3 days +/- 34 days at the high rate (r = 0.99).

Ten patients (age, 36-69 years) with mild essential hypertension were enrolled in this study. A randomized, double-blind, crossover treatment of azelnidipine at a dose of 8.0 mg once daily for 4 weeks was performed. After a 4-week placebo period, the patients exercised in a submaximal test by using an ergometer with azelnidipine or placebo treatment. The changes caused by exercise in arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate, cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance were evaluated. In addition, the plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration were determined at rest, at peak exercise, and at the recovery period. Both the SBP and diastolic (D) BP were decreased at rest by azelnidipine treatment (from 158 +/- 10/97 +/- 7 to 145 +/- 14/90 +/- 9 mm Hg). Azelnidipine significantly decreased both SBP and DBP during exercise (SBP, F = 6.09, p < 0.05, Fi = 0.612, NS; DBP, F = 17.78, p < 0.001, Fi = 0.298, NS). No significant changes in the resting heart rate and CO were observed, and the exercise-induced increase of these parameters was also not affected by azelnidipine. Azelnidipine produced no significant change of the resting plasma NE and E levels and an exercise-induced increase of plasma NE. In conclusion, these results indicate that azelnidipine, different from another dihydropyridine-type calcium channel antagonists, does not produce any changes in the hemodynamic and neurohumoral response to exercise, and it may be beneficial for patients with mild essential hypertension."

However, little information is presently available on the underlying hemodynamic changes. We examined 13 essential hypertensive patients and nine normotensive subjects in a randomized, crossover study design during 3 hours after a 30-minute period of upright leg cycling at 50% of peak aerobic capacity and during 3 hours after a 30-minute control period of rest. Blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and regional vascular resistance in the forearm as well as venous plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured repeatedly. After exercise, systolic (-11 +/- 2 mm Hg) and diastolic (-4 +/- 1 mm Hg) blood pressures, total peripheral resistance (-27 +/- 5%), forearm vascular resistance (-25 +/- 6%), and plasma norepinephrine levels (-21 +/- 7%) were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) decreased, and cardiac output was increased (+31 +1- 8%) compared with control in hypertensive subjects. In contrast, in normotensive subjects blood pressure, forearm vascular resistance, and plasma norepinephrine were unchanged, and systemic hemodynamics changed to a lesser extent than in hypertensive subjects after exercise. It is concluded that a decrease in regional vascular resistance in skeletal muscles and possibly in the skin in hypertensive patients may contribute importantly to the antihypertensive effect of prior exercise. A decreased sympathetic nervous activity, as seen from lower plasma norepinephrine levels, may be involved in this effect."

To examine the mechanisms underlying this association, we systematically reviewed the literature to determine the effects of acute psychological stress and physical activity on haemorheology and haemostasis. Studies examining the haemorheological and haemostatic response to an acute bout of physical activity (i.e. <60 min) or laboratory psychological stress task were eligible for inclusion. The experimental evidence, although compromised by various methodological weaknesses, suggests that low and moderate intensity physical activity may be cardio-protective through beneficial effects on fibrinolytic system. High levels of physical activity, and psychological to a lesser extent, have been consistently associated with robust changes in haemorheology and haemostasis. Such findings imply that such activities may have the potential to trigger the onset of ACS, although in reality this may be limited sedentary individual and/or those with pre-existing vascular disease. In addition, the data also suggest that individuals may be at a greatest risk of stress-induced thrombogenesis in the period immediately following physical activity or psychological stress, rather than during the activity per se.

The resting ECG and the ECG under exercise are pivotal for the diagnosis of ion channel diseases. Molecular genetic screening can reveal underlying mutations in a variable degree among the cardiac ion channel diseases in up to 70% (LQTS) and may identify individuals with incomplete penetration of the disease. In patients with primary electrical diseases, specific clinical triggers for arrhythmic events such as syncope or sudden cardiac death have been identified including exercise, strenuous activity, auditory stimuli, or increased vagal tone. Young, otherwise healthy individuals are likely to be involved in sports activity. Therefore, special attention has to be given to advise these patients. Competitive sports and vigorous exercise are contraindications in almost all patients.

            "abstract": "Arrhythmias, a common cause of sudden cardiac death, can occur in structurally normal hearts, although the mechanism is not known. In cardiac muscle, the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases the calcium required for muscle contraction. The FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6) stabilizes RyR2, preventing aberrant activation of the channel during the resting phase of the cardiac cycle. We show that during exercise, RyR2 phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) partially dissociates FKBP12.6 from the channel, increasing intracellular Ca(2+) release and cardiac contractility. FKBP12.6(-/-) mice consistently exhibited exercise-induced cardiac ventricular arrhythmias that cause sudden cardiac death. Mutations in RyR2 linked to exercise-induced arrhythmias (in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]) reduced the affinity of FKBP12.6 for RyR2 and increased single-channel activity under conditions that simulate exercise. These data suggest that \"leaky\" RyR2 channels can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias, providing a possible explanation for CPVT."

Recently, the contribution of presynaptic RyRs and CICR to functions of central and peripheral presynaptic terminals, including neurotransmitter release, has received increased attention. However, there is no general agreement that RyRs are localised to presynaptic terminals, nor is it clear that RyRs regulate a large enough pool of intracellular Ca(2+) to be physiologically significant. Here, we review direct and indirect evidence that on balance favours the notion that ER and RyRs are found in presynaptic terminals and are physiologically significant. In so doing, it became obvious that some of the controversy originates from issues related to (i) the ability to demonstrate conclusively the physical presence of ER and RyRs, (ii) whether the biophysical properties of RyRs are such that they can contribute physiologically to regulation of presynaptic [Ca(2+)](i), (iii) how ER Ca(2+) load and feedback gain of CICR contributes to the ability to detect functionally relevant RyRs, (iv) the distance that Ca(2+) diffuses from plasma membranes to RyRs to trigger CICR and from RyRs to the Active Zone to enhance vesicle release, and (v) the experimental conditions used.

Wind-up was induced either by 10 repetitive (1Hz) contact heat (max. 49°C; 5×5 mm thermode) or ballistic impact stimuli (0.5g at 9 m/s) on the phalanges of the non-dominant hand. Cardiovascular activity, pain experience and corrugator muscle activity were continuously monitored. Although both HNCS forms produced a similar pain experience (45% of scale), a more pronounced cardiovascular activity was observable for the HIT (P<0.01). This indicates a higher baroreceptor activity and stronger contamination of painful water immersion by BRS-related hypoalgesia. Regardless of pain modality, wind-up was significantly reduced by HNCS, although this was stronger for painful water immersion than for noxious pinching (P<0.01). The HNCS types allow a differentiation between BRS-related and DNIC-like hypoalgesia. IWP proved its validity for DNIC induction, being practically non-confounded by BRS."

The calcium antagonist, flunarizine, has been shown to suppress the accumulation of intracellular calcium and has been proposed to protect against triggered activity due to calcium overload. Using 13 mongrel dogs with healed myocardial infarctions, ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced by a 2 min coronary occlusion during exercise. This exercise plus ischemia test consistently induced VF during control (C, vehicle) presentations. Pretreatment with flunarizine (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) completely suppressed VF in all the animals (P less than 0.001 Chi-squared). Flunarizine (F) elicited significant (P less than 0.01 ANOVA) reductions in left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure (C 143.2 +/- 12.0 F 92.3 +/- 10.5 mm Hg), LVdP/dt max (C 4256 +/- 251.9, F 1784 +/- 297.2 mm Hg/s) and heart rate (C 118.8 +/- 7.4, F 104.7 +/- 9.0 beats/min). Since heart rate can contribute significantly to the development of VF, the exercise plus ischemia test was repeated with heart rate held constant with ventricular pacing (n = 3, 230.0 +/- 10 beats/min). Flunarizine pretreatment still prevented VF under these conditions."

            "abstract": "The objective of this work was to test the hypothesis that endurance training may be protective against in vivo doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy through mitochondria-mediated mechanisms. Forty adult (6-8 wk old) male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10/group): nontrained, nontrained + DOX treatment (20 mg/kg), trained (14 wk of endurance treadmill running, 60-90 min/day), and trained + DOX treatment. Mitochondrial respiration, calcium tolerance, oxidative damage, heat shock proteins (HSPs), antioxidant enzyme activity, and apoptosis markers were evaluated. DOX induces mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction, oxidative damage, and histopathological lesions and triggers apoptosis (P < 0.05, n = 10). However, training limited the decrease in state 3 respiration, respiratory control ratio (RCR), uncoupled respiration, aconitase activity, and protein sulfhydryl content caused by DOX treatment and prevented the increased sensitivity to calcium in nontrained + DOX-treated rats (P < 0.05, n = 10). Moreover, training inhibited the DOX-induced increase in mitochondrial protein carbonyl groups, malondialdehyde, Bax, Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio, and tissue caspase-3 activity (P < 0.05, n = 10). Training also increased by approximately 2-fold the expression of mitochondrial HSP-60 and tissue HSP-70 (P < 0.05, n = 10) and by approximately 1.5-fold the activity of mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of SOD (P < 0.05, n = 10). We conclude that endurance training protects heart mitochondrial respiratory function from the toxic effects of DOX, probably by improving mitochondrial and cell defense systems and reducing cell oxidative stress. In addition, endurance training limited the DOX-triggered apoptosis."

Significant improvement in exercise capacity compared with the effects of placebo was maintained at 6 hours after administration. The antianginal activity was accompanied by a marked reduction in blood pressure both at rest and during exercise, which resulted in severe dizziness and fainting in 2 of 6 patients after the 60-mg dose. However, significant reflex tachycardia occurred only at 2 hours after the 60-mg dose. Plasma concentrations of nicorandil correlated with percent reductions in blood pressure at 2 hours after administration (p less than 0.001) and with increasing total exercise work load (p less than 0.01). The incidence of adverse events appeared to be dose related. Headache and dizziness accounted for most of the reported events.

The pathogenesis of cardiac syndrome X has previously ascribed to myocardial ischemia that may be caused by microvascular dysfunction and increased sensitivity to intracardiac pain. Despite the extensive studies, the pathophysiological mechanisms in cardiac syndrome, however, remain unclear. More recently, the data has been suggested that chronic inflammation has been associated with cardiac syndrome X. The evidence for the hypotheses included that inflammatory marker are increased, and associated with the disease activity in patients with cardiac syndrome X. And also, statin, a lipid-lowering as well as anti-inflammatory drug, has significantly modified the disease process in this special syndrome. Despite the good prognosis of cardiac syndrome X, the chronic, frequent nature of the persistent angina and reduced exercise tolerance can significantly impair quality of life. Thus, lowering inflammatory response by, for example, use of statin and/or aspirin, might improve coronary microvascular dysfunction. Whether this is a valid approach, however, is still unknown and deserves further investigation. Indeed, as mediators of inflammation are multiple, the strategy of identifying triggers and mechanisms of inflammation in each special clinical setting and directing treatment at the special triggers or to rate limiting steps in effector pathways appears more reasonable or a promising strategy."

            "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is characterized by the clustering of a number of metabolic abnormalities in the presence of underlying insulin resistance with a strong association with diabetes and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. The disorder is defined in different ways, but the pathophysiology is attributable to insulin resistance. An increased release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from adipocytes block insulin signal transduction pathway, induce endothelial dysfunction due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and oxidative stress. Dyslipidemia, associated with high levels of triglycerides and low concentrations of high density lipoproteins (HDLs), contributes to a proinflammatory state. Inflammation, the key pathogenic component of atherosclerosis, promotes thrombosis, a process that underlies acute coronary event and stroke. Tissue factor, a potent trigger of the coagulation cascade, is increased in diabetes with poor glycemic control. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (weight loss and physical activity) along with pharmacological interventions are recommended to prevent the complications of metabolic syndrome. In addition to statins, metformin, blood pressure lowering medications, interventions to increase HDLs are other important approaches to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and gamma agonists are potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic agents that could both improve insulin sensitivity and the long-term cardiovascular risk. In this review we focus on the molecular and pathophysiological basis of metabolic syndrome, which augments diabetes (insulin resistance) and the contribution of neovascularization in the plaque progression in diabetes, leading to rupture and coronary thrombosis."

Exercise prescription for the activity protocol and cardiovascular fitness were based on a treadmill performance test. Repeated measurements were made of subcutaneous oxygen and temperature using an optode in upper arm subcutaneous tonometers. Perfusion and PscO2 were greater during bed rest (p < .05). Post hoc analysis revealed a trend toward higher heart rates and diastolic blood pressure during the activity protocol. Change in plasma volume did not differ between protocols, and cardiovascular fitness was unrelated to PscO2 or BFsc.

The mechanisms involved in mediating this key effect have long been debated: both regression of coronary artery stenosis and improvement of collateralization have been suggested as potential adaptations. However, the comparatively minute changes in luminal diameter and myocardial contrast staining do not fully explain the significant changes in myocardial perfusion. During the last decade, endothelial dysfunction was identified as a trigger of myocardial ischemia. The impaired production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) in response to acetylcholine and flow leads to paradoxic vasoconstriction and exercise-induced ischemia. Recently, it was confirmed in humans that training attenuates paradoxic vasoconstriction in coronary artery disease and increases coronary blood flow in response to acetylcholine. Data from cell-culture and animal experiments suggest that shear stress acts as a stimulus for the endothelium to increase the transport capacity for L-arginine (the precursor molecule for NO), to enhance NO synthase activity and expression, and to increase the production of extracellular superoxide dismutase, which prevents premature breakdown of NO. Exercise also affects the microcirculation, where it sensitizes resistance arteries for the vasodilatory effects of adenosine. These novel findings provide a pathophysiological framework to explain the improvement of myocardial perfusion in the absence of changes in baseline coronary artery diameter. Because endothelial dysfunction has been identified as a predictor of coronary events, exercise may contribute to the long-term reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."

Although corrections of life-style are essential in childhood, adolescence, and the middle-aged and elderly periods, the methods and purpose are different in each life stage. The risks of emaciation and malnutrition are more important rather than that of obesity in the elderly aged 75 years or over. As for the influence of smoking in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, smoking can be a trigger for arrhythmia, peripheral vascular constriction, and irritation of the respiratory tract in the elderly. Smoking cessation is necessary even among elderly people. It is also necessary to decrease the amount of alcohol intake, because the ability of metabolize alcohol is limited in the elderly. Physical activity in the elderly people is fundamental not only to maintain the ability of daily living, but also to improve metabolic function and to prevent depression.

There is a strong association between external triggers and the onset of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death beyond what is to be expected by chance alone. The magnitude of this association (relative risk two- to threefold) is comparable with the known long-term risk factors of cardiac disease. Trigger factors occur relatively frequently and may play a causative role in up to 20% of cases of acute coronary syndromes.

Physiological parameters (heart rate, physical activity, additional heart rate) and psychological parameters (excitement, enjoyment) were assessed simultaneously throughout the day using a special ambulatory monitoring device capable of storing 23-h records. Emotional events were identified by an increase of heart rate without an accompanying increase in physical activity (additional heart rate) and under special requirements a feedback signal was given which requested subjects to answer predefined questions. Between these 'true' feedbacks, 'random' feedbacks were interspersed with no indication of emotional arousal. Subjects were unaware that the feedback signal was triggered by their own heart rate. Laboratory experiments with films of different emotional quality showed that the method is suitable for the detection of emotional arousal. Comparisons of true feedbacks (emotional events) with random feedbacks (neutral situations) did not show significant differences for excitement and enjoyment ratings for any of the normal samples and for one of the patient samples. Only a sample of coronary heart disease patients showed small differences in the psychological variables which were significant due to the large sample size. From the results it may be concluded that the perception of physiological changes indicating emotional arousal in everyday life is quite different from the results suggested by laboratory experiments. The findings are discussed within the theoretical framework of 'competition of cues' and 'cognitive schemas' proposed by Pennebaker (1982, The psychology of physical symptoms, New York: Springer)."

            "abstract": "Although essential hypertension seems to have a strong hereditary component, the triggering mechanism is unclear. It is likely that the central nervous system via autonomic sympathetic overactivation plays a key role in the development of hypertension. High heart rate has proven to be a strong predictor for cardiovascular disease and a predictor of the development of essential hypertension. Because heart rate is highly influenced by many factors such as anxiety and physical activity, it is sometimes difficult to interpret the value of heart rate measurement in individual persons. Whether heart rate itself is a risk factor for development of hypertension or just a marker for sympathetic overactivation is still a matter of debate, but the presence of elevated heart rate in both hyperkinetic and hypertensive subjects makes it an interesting and easy measurable prognostic marker."

Each subject completed the following on each test day: two maximal graded stress tests on a cycle ergometer and a one-hour exercise stress test coupled to an arithmetic mental concentration test.

The presence of triggering physical and mental stresses is consistent with recent documentation of a morning increase in frequency of acute myocardial infarction.

Recent advances in knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction provide a background to the understanding of the probable triggering mechanism in these three cases.

            "abstract": "Regional sympathetic activity can be studied in humans using electrophysiological methods measuring sympathetic nerve firing rates and neurochemical techniques providing quantification of noradrenaline spillover to plasma from sympathetic nerves in individual organs. Essential hypertension: Such measurements in patients with essential hypertension disclose activation of the sympathetic outflows to skeletal muscle blood vessels, the heart and kidneys, particularly in younger patients. This sympathetic activation, in addition to underpinning the blood pressure elevation, most likely also contributes to left ventricular hypertrophy, and to the commonly associated metabolic abnormalities of insulin resistance and hyperlipidaemia. Antihypertensive drugs, such as moxonidine, which act primarily by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system, should have additional clinical benefits beyond those attributable to blood pressure reduction, in protecting against hypertensive complications. Obesity-related hypertension: Understanding the neural pathophysiology of hypertension in the obese has been difficult. In normotensive obesity, renal sympathetic tone is doubled, but cardiac noradrenaline spillover (a measure of sympathetic activity in the heart) is only 50% of normal. In obesity-related hypertension, there is a comparable elevation of renal noradrenaline spillover, but without suppression of cardiac sympathetics (cardiac sympathetic activity being more than double that of normotensive obese and 25% higher than in healthy volunteers). Increased renal sympathetic activity in obesity may be a 'necessary' cause for the development of hypertension (and predisposes to hypertension development), but apparently is not a 'sufficient' cause. The discriminating feature of the obese who develop hypertension is the absence of the adaptive suppression of cardiac sympathetic tone seen in the normotensive obese. Heart failure: In cardiac failure, the sympathetic nerves of the heart are preferentially stimulated. Noradrenaline release from the failing heart at rest in untreated patients is increased as much as 50-fold, similar to the level seen in the healthy heart during near-maximal exercise. Activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow provides adrenergic support to the failing myocardium, but at a cost of arrhythmia development and progressive myocardial deterioration. Psychosomatic heart disease: No more than 50% of clinical coronary heart disease is explicable in terms of classical cardiac risk factors. There is gathering evidence that psychological abnormalities, particularly depressive illness, anxiety states, including panic disorder and mental stress, are involved here, 'triggering' clinical cardiovascular events, and possibly also contributing to atherosclerosis development. The mechanisms of increased cardiac risk attributable to mental stress and psychiatric illness are not entirely clear, but activation of the sympathetic nervous system seems to be of prime importance."

The relationship of self-reported physical activity and all cause and disease-specific mortality was examined by survival analysis and with the Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for demographic and lifestyle characteristics. Moderate activity was associated with a protective effect on cardiovascular and all cause mortality in both analyses. In the Cox model, age-specific estimates of relative risk (RR) were obtained for several endpoints due to a significant interaction between level of physical activity and attained age (age at death or end of follow-up). This model permits calculation of the age at which the RR = 1.0, or the age at crossover of risk. For moderate activity, this age was 95.6 years (95% confidence intervals, 81.7-109.4 years) for all cause mortality and 91.5 years (95% confidence intervals, 79.0-104.0 years) for cardiovascular mortality.

VT was induced electrophysiologically in 14 patients. Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs were effective in 7 of them, which implied that one of the mechanisms of idiopathic VT was reentry related to the depressed channel dependent slow conduction. In 6 of the 14 patients, the QRS morphology of VT showed a complete RBBB with axis deviation pattern and the tachycardia was responsive to verapamil. In 2 of them, induction of VT was facilitated at low plasma verapamil concentrations. In the other 2 patients, left ventricular mapping showed that a notched potential preceding each QRS complex and the retrograde His bundle deflection with a short interval were recorded during VT. These findings suggested that the mechanism of this type of VT was reentry, mediated by Ca dependent slow conduction and located within the left bundle branch network. Exercise testing provoked VT in eight. Beta-blockers and Ca-antagonists were effective in 6 and in 4, respectively. These findings indicate the possibility that in addition to enhanced automaticity or reentry, triggered activity could play a role in the genesis of exercise related VT."

The haemodynamic effects were similar at rest and during exercise. Overall, systemic vascular resistance decreased by 14%, heart rate fell by 5%, but stroke volume and cardiac output increased. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure and capillary wedge pressure were not significantly affected, but pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 15%. The pressor response to methoxamine was significantly reduced by ketanserin. Both plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations increased, plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentration decreased, and plasma aldosterone concentration was unchanged. The data indicate that ketanserin induces arteriolar dilatation, possibly related to an alpha-1-antagonistic action and to a reduced circulating angiotensin II concentration. The haemodynamic response is complex, and an increase in cardiac output limits the hypotensive effect.

On the one hand, leisure time activities at altitude may well contribute to the well-established beneficial effects of exercise; on the other hand, these activities are also associated with a relatively high risk of death. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the most frequent cause of nontraumatic death in males older than 34 years at altitude during leisure time activities such as downhill skiing and hiking. Whereas prior myocardial infarction is the most important risk factor for SCD, particularly relevant in downhill skiers, the unusual physical activity during the first days at altitude and the prolonged abstinence from food and fluid intake during exercise at altitude are the most important triggers. Unaccustomed physical activity seems more likely to trigger SCD than altitude per se. The detection of subjects at risk, evidence-based therapy, and advice on adequate behavior during the altitude sojourn will help to prevent SCD and to increase the health benefits generated by mountaineering activities."

T(body) was similar at rest in PLAC (35.59 degrees C) and NSAID (35.53 degrees C) and increased similarly during running, but became 0.33 degrees C (SD 0.26) lower in NSAID during cycling (37.39 degrees C vs. 37.07 degrees C; P = 0.03), and remained lower throughout recovery. Sweating was initiated at T(body) of approximately 35.6 degrees C in both conditions but ceased at higher T(body) in PLAC than NSAID during recovery [36.66 degrees C (SD 0.36) vs. 36.39 degrees C (SD 0.27); P = 0.03]. Cardiac frequency averaged 6 x min(-1) higher in PLAC (P < 0.01), whereas exercising metabolic rate was similar (505 vs. 507 W x m(-2); P = 0.56). A modest increase in both cytokines across exercise was similar between conditions. COX-2 specific NSAID lowered exercising heat and cardiovascular strain and the sweating (offset) threshold, independently of heat production, indicating that PGE-mediated inflammatory processes may contribute to exercising heat strain during endurance exercise in humans."

            "abstract": "Thromboembolism is a complication which represents a major limiting factor in animals with long-term postoperative survival periods following total artificial heart replacement. Thrombi are formed on the artificial valves, the biomaterials and in stagnation areas within the artificial ventricles. In design planning the stagnation areas should be avoided as well as major turbulences. The filling volume should be maximally used for the stroke volume and the epicenter of the membrane should be underneath the valve areas. The ellipsoid heart eliminates stagnation areas and the stroke volume is 82% of the filling volume. The maximum cardiac output is 15.8 l/min. The ellipsoid heart was implanted in 20 female calves; the maximum length of survival was 213 hours. There was no compression of the inferior vena cava and the heart fitted well into the chest of the animals. The cardiac output, self-regulated in the sense of Starling's law, was adequate to perfuse the animals and to allow moderate exercise such as standing. The arterial pressure curves show normal physiological activity. The curves in both atria are unphysiological, owing to relative insufficiency of the valves. The limiting factors were pulmonary insufficiency and surgical complications. The ventricles showed no thrombus formation -- except in one case, in which faulty material was the predisposing cause. It was possible to develop an automatic driving system on the basis of these experiments. Regulation occurred by means of gas flow control in the driving tubes, whereby the form of the gas flow curve provides information on position of the membrane. As soon as the membrane has reached the end-diastolic position, systole is triggered off and lasts until the end-systolic position is reached. If the venous return is increased, the ventricles are filled more rapidly and the heart is driven at a higher rate. One part of the ellipsoid heart is used as ventricle for assisted circulation. The left ventricle is cannulated via the left appendage or the apex. The ventricle relieves the left heart to a large extent and the cardiac output is taken over by the pump placed in a paracorporeal position. The blood is directed back into the thoracic aorta."

But there is also evidence of decreased oxygen supply related to a paradoxical catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction which reflects the endothelial dysfunction of atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Elevated blood pressure during daytime and other mechanical factors can facilitate a plaque-rupture which triggers formation of coronary thrombosis. Hypercoagulability in the early morning hours by increased platelet aggregability and by elevated levels of plasminogen-activator inhibitors may contribute to this fatal mechanism."

Recent evidence indicates that several benefits associated with exercise training (e.g., improved insulin action, reduced blood pressure, improved blood lipid profile) may be realized transiently after a single bout of exercise. As many of these effects of recent exercise are linked to cardiovascular control systems, the purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that a single bout of exercise would result in favorable changes in cardiac autonomic function as assessed by frequency-domain measures of HRV.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Subjects were 11 healthy male volunteers ages 18-35 yr.

Here, using the crab stomatogastric nervous system, we show that sensorimotor gating also occurs at the level of the projection neurons that activate motor circuits. We compared the influence of the gastro-pyloric receptor (GPR) muscle stretch-sensitive neuron on two projection neurons, modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) and commissural projection neuron 2 (CPN2), with and without a preceding activation of the mechanosensory ventral cardiac neurons (VCNs). MCN1 and CPN2 project from the paired commissural ganglia (CoGs) to the stomatogastric ganglion (STG), where they activate the gastric mill (chewing) motor circuit. When stimulated separately, the GPR and VCN neurons each elicit the gastric mill rhythm by coactivating MCN1 and CPN2. When GPR is instead stimulated during the VCN-gastric mill rhythm, it slows this rhythm. This effect results from a second GPR synapse onto MCN1 that presynaptically inhibits its STG terminals. Here, we show that, during the VCN-triggered rhythm, the GPR excitation of MCN1 and CPN2 in the CoGs is gated out, leaving only its influence in the STG. This gating effect appears to occur within the CoG and does not result from a ceiling effect on projection neuron firing frequency. Additionally, this gating action enables GPR to either activate rhythmic motor activity or act as a phasic sensorimotor feedback system. These results also indicate that the site of sensorimotor gating can occur at the level of the projection neurons that activate a motor circuit."

Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Each of these cardiac channelopathies is charaterized by unique genetic and clinical features. The resting ECG and the ECG under exercise are pivotal for the diagnosis of ion channel diseases. Molecular genetic screening can reveal underlying mutations in a variable degree among the cardiac ion channel diseases in up to 70% (LQTS) and may identify individuals with incomplete penetration of the disease. In patients with primary electrical diseases specific clinical triggers for arrhythmic events such as syncope or sudden cardiac death have been identified including exercise, strenuous activity, auditory stimuli or increased vagal tone. The significance of programmed ventricular stimulation is at present unclear concerning risk stratification in patients with Brugada syndrome and short QT syndrome and of no significance in long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardias. The success of medical therapy remains modest for prevention of sudden cardiac death and may necessitate the insertion of an implantable cardioverter. However, side effects with inappropriate therapies in this patient group with often young and active individuals have to be encountered.

Given the large number of men receiving medical treatment for ED, concerns regarding the risk for sexual activity triggering acute cardiovascular events and potential risks of adverse or unanticipated drug interactions need to be addressed. A risk stratification algorithm was developed by the First Princeton Consensus Panel to evaluate the degree of cardiovascular risk associated with sexual activity for men with varying degrees of cardiovascular disease. Patients were assigned to 3 categories: low, intermediate (including those requiring further evaluation), and high risk. This consensus study from the Second Princeton Consensus Conference corroborates and clarifies the algorithm and emphasizes the importance of risk factor evaluation and management for all patients with ED. The panel reviewed recent safety and drug interaction data for 3 phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil), with emphasis on the safety of these agents in men with ED and concomitant cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence supports the role of lifestyle intervention in ED, specifically weight loss and increased physical activity, particularly in patients with ED and concomitant cardiovascular disease. Special management recommendations for patients taking PDE-5 inhibitors who present at the emergency department and other emergency medical situations are described.

In addition, it is becoming clear that CCK is involved in regulating certain aspects of cardiovascular function. This article reviews the cardiovascular effects elicited by CCK via its actions at both central and peripheral sites and considers the physiological role of the peptide with respect to the cardiovascular function in different physiological and pathophysiological states. In the periphery CCK released from entoeroendocrine cells in the gut wall in response to a meal triggers a local postprandial hyperaemia in the gut that could promote digestion by facilitating intestinal motility and secretory processes. In addition, activation of CCK receptors on abdominal vagal afferents elicits a reflexly evoked hyperaemia that potentiates these effects and is also gasroprotective. In the brain CCK appears to act as a neuromodulator rather than a direct mediator within cardiovascular control circuits. In particular, it facilitates activity in amygdalar, hypothalamic and midbrain circuits that are involved in mediating acute cardiovascular and behavioural responses to an extreme physical or psychologically stressful challenge. Whilst in the short term activation of the CCK system appears to be beneficial to the organism, chronic stimulation of the system may be maladaptive, laying the foundation for the development of pathophysiological conditions such as panic disorder and chronic pain, both of which are states characterised by significant autonomic activation."

The detection of CAD was based on quantitative defects on initial planar thallium-201 images and resting or inducible wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography. Detection of ischemia was based on redistribution on delayed thallium-201 images and inducible wall motion abnormality on echocardiography. The myocardium in a region with resting wall motion abnormality was considered viable if it showed either redistribution or > 50% activity on delayed thallium-201 images, and if regional function either improved or worsened on echocardiography. The tests were comparable for the detection of CAD (53 and 59%, respectively, p = 0.23). Thallium-201 was superior to echocardiography for the detection of ischemia (35 vs 14%, respectively, p = 0.01). Although the incidence of viable myocardium was equivalent by the 2 tests (100 and 96%, respectively, p = 0.99) for each abnormally moving segment in the 24 patients with resting wall motion abnormality on echocardiography, it was greater on thallium-201 imaging (98 vs 68%, p < 0.01). It is concluded that because of its better ability to detect inducible myocardial ischemia and determine viability in myocardial segments showing reduced function, dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging appears to be superior to dobutamine echocardiography for the evaluation of CAD in patients unable to exercise."

            "abstract": "Six hypertensive patients with daily ventricular arrhythmias underwent a double-blind crossover study to examine whether a once daily regimen of beta receptor blockade was equipotent in antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic activity to a twice daily regimen. Acebutolol, a relatively cardioselective beta blocking compound with intrinsic sympathomimetic properties, was given in two regimens: 200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily. Ventricular ectopic beats were analyzed both during physical exercise and with multiple 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings. Serum concentrations of acebutolol and its acetyl metabolite were determined using high pressure liquid chromatography. The two regimens of acebutolol were equally potent in reducing the blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during physical exertion. The hourly heart rates during 24 hours were reduced to the same extent by both regimens. The single daily 400 mg dose did not significantly reduce the incidence of arrhythmias, whereas 200 mg twice daily evoked a significant reduction during 24 hours. Serum concentrations of acebutolol were twice as great with the twice daily regimen as with the single dose. Both treatments significantly shortened the Q-Tc interval. The data suggest that, despite apparent beta receptor blockade and good blood pressure control, beta blocking agents with a relatively short plasma half-life lose their antiarrhythmic potency when administered on a once daily basis. This property seems to be more related to the plasma concentration of the compound than to the degree of clinically assessed beta receptor blockade."

            "abstract": "To investigate the effects of ramipril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on autonomic function, autonomic function tests were performed in eight healthy male subjects, aged 22-26 years, after single oral administration of 5 mg of ramipril or placebo, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Measurements of heart rate variability and diving reflex test were performed as indices of parasympathetic tone. Forearm isometric exercise (handgrip test) and cold pressor test were carried out to evaluate sympathetic nervous reactivity. Supine systolic blood pressure was decreased significantly after ramipril (F = 11.16, p less than 0.01), but diastolic blood pressure was not. Heart rate at rest did not significantly differ between ramipril and placebo. Heart rate variability was significantly increased 120 min after ramipril [5.5 +/- 0.7% (SEM) on ramipril and 3.7 +/- 0.2% on placebo; F = 7.13, p less than 0.05]. However, reflex bradycardia during the diving test was not enhanced after ramipril. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations before and after handgrip test were not influenced by ramipril. Increments of mean blood pressure and heart rate during handgrip or cold pressor test did not significantly differ between ramipril and placebo, either. These results suggest that ramipril may enhance cardiac vagal tone without affecting sympathetic nervous activity. Enhanced parasympathetic activity could be related to an absence of reflex tachycardia following the administration of ramipril."

The studies were performed at rest and in response to ergometer exercise. The studies showed that: 1. Celiprolol is a cardio-selective beta-receptor blocker with pronounced intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Hence, Celiprolol increases the heart rate and cardiac output at rest. 2. The heart rate was reduced by Celiprolol during pronounced physical exercise. 3. Celiprolol probably has only a very slight blocking effect on those, beta1-receptors which mediate a positive inotropic effect. 4. The increase in blood pressure during exercise was less pronounced during Celiprolol medication than with propranolol."

            "abstract": "An important component in the rehabilitation program of patients with cardiac disease is assisting them in resuming sexual activity. In many cases, cardiac disease creates fear, particularly in the spouse, that sexual activity will trigger a cardiac event. Assessment of the possibility that sexual activity may lead to cardiac disease has been aided by advances in the study of triggers of cardiovascular disease. The acute onset of cardiovascular disease has, in many cases, proved to result from the exposures and activities of patients. Nonfatal myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, transient myocardial ischemia, and most arrhythmias have a marked peak during the period between 6:00 A.M. and noon. Wake-time-adjusted data indicate that peak occurrence follows waking and rising. In addition to this marked dependence of disease onset on time of day and awakening, it has been established that there are numerous other triggers of cardiovascular events. For nonfatal infarction, the triggers of heavy exertion, anger, sexual activity, and awakening account for approximately 17% of all cases. Other triggers are still being identified. A new epidemiologic method, the case-crossover method, has greatly enhanced identification of triggering. Regular exertion can reduce the incidence of triggering. It is possible, though unproved, that an acute event can be triggered by rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. With regard to sexual activity, the low absolute risk generated by a potential trigger is useful information with which to reassure patients."

To determine if optimization of these features improves exercise tolerance, 14 patients with intact sinus node function and AV block treated with dual chamber pacemakers were enrolled in a randomized double-blind crossover trial. Doppler echocardiographic measurements of cardiac index and mitral flow were assessed over a range of programmable AV intervals at rest to determine each patient's optimal AV interval. Eleven patients completed serial graded exercise tests with spiroergometry after randomly programming the AV interval three ways in a crossover manner: fixed AV interval = 150 ms without rate adaptation (150/Fixed), fixed AVinterval = 150 ms with rate adaptation (150/R), or optimized AV interval with rate adaptive AV interval shortening (optimized/R). Exercise capacity was determined by maximum oxygen uptake. Ten men and four women, age 64 +/- 8 years, were enrolled. At rest, optimization of the AVintervalimproved the cardiac index by 21% (P < 0.001) and mitral flow by 13.4% (P < 0.001) when compared to least-favorable AV intervals. During exercise, no differences in maximum heart rates were noted. Maximum oxygen uptake was increased in both groups with rate adaptive AVinterval shortening when compared tofixed AVinterval without rate adaptation: 13.9% (adjusted P < 0.04) and 14.6% (adjusted P < 0.02) in optimized/R and 150/R, respectively. No differences were noted between optimized/R and 150/R. In conclusion, rate adaptive AV interval shortening improved exercise tolerance independent of changes in heart rate.

            "abstract": "This study evaluated daily-life physical and mental triggers of painful and painless myocardial ischemia and of anginal pain in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) by using ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and a structured diary. Eighty-five percent of ambulant ischemic episodes occurred without chest pain; 66% of anginal pain reports were made in the absence of ischemic ST-segment depression. Chest pain reports in the absence of ischemia could not be attributed to \"borderline\" ST-segment changes. Compared with silent ischemia, painful ischemia was triggered at higher levels of physical activity (p < 0.05) and at higher levels of self-rated effort and negative emotion (p < 0.05). Painful episodes were associated with greater-magnitude ST depression (p < 0.02), but a substantial percentage of episodes with > or = 2 mm and > or = 3 mm ST depression were silent. These results reveal an uncoupling of anginal symptoms from ambulatory ischemic episodes in patients with CAD during daily life. In addition, specific activities and emotions correlate with the presence or absence of anginal symptoms as much as does the presence of ischemic ST depression. These results may have implications for antiischemic and antianginal treatment strategies."

A third advance that has stimulated the field has been the recognition that time of onset of cardiac events is not random but instead shows a circadian pattern of onset. In the decade since the 1985 observation by Muller a spol. that the frequency of onset of myocardial infarction peaks at 9 a.m., numerous publications have supported this observation not only for myocardial infarction, but also for sudden cardiac death, transient myocardial ischemia, and stroke. Refinement of these epidemiological observations has led, first, to the conclusion that the morning peak in disease onset is due in part to the physical and mental stressors associated with morning awakening and activity and, second, that stressors such as heavy physical activity and anger can trigger acute cardiovascular events."

            "abstract": "Carotid artery stenosis is generally thought to induce stroke by either compromising cerebral perfusion or inciting embolic phenomena. Carotid baroreceptors and chemoreceptors are vital adaptations for cerebrovascular autoregulation that can behave mal-adaptively in the setting of modern diseases such as atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that acute cerebrovascular events may be partially attributable to autonomic dysfunction and cerebrovascular autoregulatory failure secondary to carotid sensor maladaptations. Specifically, we propose that atherosclerotic disease at the carotid bifurcation can interfere with baroreceptor and chemoreceptor function by buffering against accurate detection of physical and chemical parameters. Misperceptions of hypoxia and hypotension can trigger sympathetic bias and autonomic dysfunction which perturb cerebrovascular autoregulation and vasomotor tone, thereby compromising cerebral perfusion. The preferential association of strokes with morning arousal, stress, acute physical activity, winter months, illness, and older age may relate to this phenomenon. Sympathetic bias promotes inflammation and coagulation, a link likely forged during prehistoric evolution when trauma represented a more significant factor in natural selection. In the setting of carotid sensor dysfunction, the resulting inflammation and coagulation can promote acute cardiovascular events. The ensuing cerebral ischemia can induce further derangement of cerebrovascular autoregulation and upregulate adrenergia, inflammation, and coagulation in a feed-forward manner. Inflammation and coagulation can also exacerbate carotid sensor dysfunction by iteratively worsening atherosclerosis. Angioplasty, stenting, and endarterectomy may inadvertently cause acute and chronic carotid sensor dysfunction through manipulation, material interposition, and balloon-induced baroreceptor injury. Acute strokes during these procedures may result from carotid sensor dysfunction rather than embolization. Carotid body and sinus electro-modulation and non-balloon atherectomy represent new methods to prevent or treat cerebrovascular events. Pharmacologic modulation of autonomic balance, such as adrenergic blockade, long presumed contraindicated due to risk of cerebral hypoperfusion, may counter-intuitively offer benefit during acute strokes. Novel diagnostic paradigms may include functional analysis of carotid sensors as well as measurement of the anatomic thickness of calcified and non-calcified plaque near the carotid body. Carotid sensor dysfunction may be a source of systemic sympathetic bias and autonomic dysfunction observed during aging and, by association, many of the ailments associated with senescence. Modulation of carotid sensors may yield pervasive health benefits beyond those found by treating cerebrovascular disease."

The effects of 3 drugs, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nicorandil and verapamil, were evaluated in 17 patients. ATP suppressed the arrhythmias in 14 patients and nicorandil suppressed them in 8 of those 14. Verapamil suppressed 5 of the 6 ATP-nicorandil-sensitive arrhythmias. Four patients with ATP- or nicorandil-sensitive arrhythmias were not sensitive to verapamil. On the other hand, 3 of the ATP-insensitive arrhythmias were sensitive to neither nicorandil nor verapamil. The QT intervals and QTc were shortened by nicorandil in 5 of the 6 patients who were sensitive to all 3 drugs. One mechanism of suppression by nicorandil could be related to less Ca++ entering the myocardium, which would decrease the duration of the action potential as indicated by the shortened QT intervals. The results suggest that the mechanism of some ventricular arrhythmias is related to triggered activity. Arrhythmias that are sensitive to ATP or nicorandil, but not to verapamil, may be caused by abnormal automaticity. On the other hand, arrhythmias that are insensitive to all 3 drugs might be related to reentry. The features of ventricular arrhythmias with LBBB pattern and inferior axis differ and therefore the causative mechanisms are not the same."

Baroreceptor activity induced by a ramp increase of carotid sinus pressure was reduced significantly during exposure to Gd3+. The inhibition was dose-related and reversible, and was not associated with alteration of carotid sinus wall mechanics as the pressure-strain relationship was unaffected. Veratrine triggered action potentials from single- and multiple-baroreceptor fibers when their response to pressure was inhibited by Gd3+. This suggests that the effect of Gd3+ on baroreceptors in the isolated carotid sinus was specific to their mechanical activation.

However, questions remain about how CaMKII may work in these three processes. Here we tested the role of CaMKII in these processes using transgenic mice (SR-AIP) that express four concatenated repeats of the CaMKII inhibitory peptide AIP selectively in the SR membrane. Wild type mice (WT) and mice expressing AIP exclusively in the nucleus (NLS-AIP) served as controls. Increasing stimulation frequency produced typical FDAR in WT and NLS-AIP, but FDAR was markedly inhibited in SR-AIP. Quantitative analysis of cytosolic Ca(2+) removal during [Ca(2+)](i) decline revealed that FDAR is due to an increased apparent V(max) of SERCA. CaMKII-dependent RyR phosphorylation at Ser2815 and SR Ca(2+) leak was both decreased in SR-AIP vs. WT. This decrease in SR Ca(2+) leak may partly balance the reduced SERCA activity leading to relatively unaltered SR-Ca(2+) load in SR-AIP vs. WT myocytes. Surprisingly, CaMKII regulation of the L-type Ca(2+) channel (I(Ca) facilitation and recovery from inactivation) was abolished by the SR-targeted CaMKII inhibition in SR-AIP mice. Inhibition of CaMKII effects on I(Ca) and RyR function by the SR-localized AIP places physical constraints on the localization of these proteins at the junctional microdomain. Thus SR-targeted CaMKII inhibition can directly inhibit the activation of SR Ca(2+) uptake, SR Ca(2+) release and I(Ca) by CaMKII, effects which have all been implicated in triggered arrhythmias."

Graded exercise tolerance testing was performed twice before randomization, at the end of each treatment period, and after single-blind placebo washout. When compared with baseline tests, the time to onset of 0.1 mV ST-segment depression was similar between dipyridamole and placebo treatments (316 +/- 89 vs 345 +/- 102 seconds, respectively, p = not significant). No significant differences existed between treatments in the peak systolic blood pressure-heart rate product or in the duration of exercise. Angina pectoris occurred during all 3 baseline exercise tests in 7 of the 15 subjects; the time to onset of angina was unchanged by either treatment.

Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 12 patients revealed few episodes of ischemia during daily activities with no alteration in frequency of episodes during treatment periods.

In addition, and much more importantly, all studies show a close correlation between exercise and the reduction of mortality and morbidity with a beneficial effect on the progression of atherosclerosis.

Exercise has a beneficial effect due to its action on all the principal coronary risk factors, an endothelial dysfunction, coagulability and prevention of thrombosis and an autonomic nervous system tone. All forms of physical activity and some sports may therefore be considered by these patients. In some cases, competitive sport may be permitted, in accordance with popular social custom. In order to obtain these cardiocirculatory protection, physical exercise and sporting activities should be the object of a personalised therapeutic prescription which takes into account the intensity, the type of effort, its duration and frequency. Indeed, if the intensity of the exercise is too low, these patients may not obtain the desired benefits. On the other hand, excessively intensive exercise could trigger serious adverse effects such as severe arrhythmias, sudden death or an acute coronary syndrome.

            "abstract": "Numerous pathological, clinical, angiographic and angioscopic studies have demonstrated that acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction and ischemic sudden death) are most frequently the consequence of plaque disruption (plaque rupture or superficial plaque erosion) and consequent coronary thrombosis. Several serial angiographic studies have demonstrated that nearly 60-70% of acute coronary syndromes evolve from mildly to moderately obstructive atherosclerotic plaques. Coronary plaque disruption appears to be a function of both the composition of the plaque (plaque vulnerability ) as well as extrinsic triggers that may precipitate plaque disruption in a vulnerable plaque. Vulnerability for plaque disruption appears to be largely determined by the size of the lipid-rich atheromatous core, the thickness of the fibrous cap covering the core, and the presence of ongoing inflammation within and underneath the cap. Inflammatory cells may play a critical role in plaque disruption through the elaboration of matrix degrading metalloproteinases or MMPs (collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins and matrilysin) and by inhibition of function and survival of matrix-synthesizing smooth muscle cells. Inflammatory cells may also play a critical role in triggering thrombosis following plaque disruption through the tissue factor pathway. In addition, stresses resulting from hemodynamic and mechanical forces may precipitate plaque disruption, particularly at points where the fibrous cap is weakest, such as at its shoulders. The degree of thrombosis following plaque disruption is determined by the thrombogenicity of the disrupted plaque, disturbed local rheology and systemic thrombotic-thrombolytic milieu. Surges in sympathetic activity provoked by sudden vigorous exercise, emotional stress -- including anger, or cold weather, may also trigger plaque disruption. These observations have led to the concept of plaque stabilization as a new clinical strategy for the prevention of acute coronary syndromes. Plaque stabilization can be achieved through pharmacologic and lifestyle-modifying interventions that reduce vulnerability to plaque disruption by altering plaque composition and/or inflammatory activity within the plaque."

Symptoms were least in VVIR and DDDR and all but one patient chose appropriate programming as their overall preferred mode.

            "abstract": "The influence of a 6-week intervention on factors thought to be related to ectopic cardiac rhythms was tested in normal men with frequent ventricular premature contractions (VPCs), using a randomized, controlled and partial crossover design. The VPC intervention trial experimental regimen included total abstinence from caffeine and smoking, reduction of alcohol intake, and a physical conditioning program. Effects were studied in detail among 81 healthy men with persistent VPCs. VPCs were measured during standard states of rest, dynamic and isometric exercise and other stresses, and 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. Adherence to the treatment was excellent. The experimental group achieved more than 80% of activities asked of them, and little \"contamination\" occurred in the control group. VPCs were analyzed according to VPC/min, VPC/man and VPC/total number of heart beats. Moderate changes in VPC rates occurred in both experimental and control groups but no significant group differences were found at rest or during any induction test. This 6-week, multiple-factor \"hygienic\" intervention program had no significant influence on the frequency or occurrence of VPCs in apparently normal men with persistent and frequent VPCs. Because the mechanisms and the significance of VPCs are different in patients with ischemic heart disease, our approach and methods may be useful for similar trials among cardiac patients of adjunct or non-drug therapy for ectopic rhythms."

To address these questions, we collected data from patients with confirmed myocardial infarction on their activities one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction and during control periods.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Interviews with 1228 patients conducted an average of four days after myocardial infarction provided data on their usual annual frequency of physical activity and the time, type, and intensity of physical exertion in the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. We compared the observed frequency of heavy exertion (6 or more metabolic equivalents) with the expected values using two types of self-matched analyses based on a new case-crossover study design. The low frequency of heavy exertion during the control periods was validated by data from a population-based control group of 218 subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the patients, 4.4 percent reported heavy exertion within one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction. The estimated relative risk of myocardial infarction in the hour after heavy physical exertion, as compared with less strenuous physical exertion or none, was 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 7.7), Among people who usually exercised less than one, one to two, three to four, or five or more times per week, the respective relative risks were 107 (95 percent confidence interval, 67 to 171), 19.4 (9.9 to 38.1), 8.6 (3.6 to 20.5), and 2.4 (1.5 to 3.7).

The immediate trigger for AMI is not precisely known. Studies conducted by Lown, Braunwald, Halberg, Otsuka and our group have demonstrated a marked increase in sympathetic activity, oxidative stress, and magnesium and potassium deficiency during AMI. Clinical studies have reported an increased incidence of AMI, sudden death and ischemia during first quarter of the day when there is a rapid withdrawal of vagal activity and increase in sympathetic tone. In one case-control study of 202 patients with AMI, there was a significant (P < 0.02) increase in cardiac events in the second quarter of the day compared to other quarters, respectively (16.8%, 41.0%, 13.8%, 28.2% per quarter). This characteristic remained prevalent in both men and women and among patients with and without known AMI (n = 52), diabetes (n = 53) or hypertension (n = 75). Triggers of AMI were noted among 162 (82.2%) of the patients. Neuropsychological mechanisms were observed as follows: emotional stress (45.5%), sleep deprivation (27.7%), cold climate (29.2%), hot climate (24.7%), large meals (47.5%) and physical exertion (31.2%). These triggering factors are known to enhance sympathetic activity and decrease vagal tone, resulting in an increased secretion of plasma cortisol, noradrenaline, aldosterone, angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE), interleukin (IL)-1, -2, -6, -18, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), all of which are are proinflammatory agents. There is also a deficiency in the serum levels of vitamin A, E, and C and magnesium, potassium, melatonin, and IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory agent). In our study, we found a decrease in magnesium, potassium, vitamin A, E, C and beta carotene combined with an increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), MDA and diene conjugates, TNF-alpha and IL-6, all of which are indicators of oxidative damage and proinflammatory activity, respectively."

However, little is known about the effect of ventricular pacing rate adaptation after mode switching. We conducted a single-blinded, crossover study in 15 patients (58 +/- 21 years) with a DDD pacemaker who had AV block and normal sinus node function to investigate the influence of pacing rate adaptation to intrinsic heart rate during low intensity exercise. Patients performed two tests (A/B) of low intensity treadmill exercise (0.5 W/kg) in randomized order. They initially walked for 6 minutes while paced in DDD mode. The pacing mode was then switched to VVI with a pacing rate of either 70 beats/min (test A) or matched to the intrinsic heart rate (95 +/- 11 beats/min test B). Respiratory gas exchange variables were determined and patients classified the effort before and after mode switching on a Borg scale from 6 to 20. Percentage changes of respiratory gas exchange measurements were significantly larger (O2 consumption: -8.2 +/- 5.0% vs. -0.6 +/- 7.2%; ventilatory equivalent of CO2 exhalation: 5.3 +/- 4.9% vs. 1.5 +/- 4.3%; respiratory exchange ratio: 7.0 +/- 2.2% vs. 3.5 +/- 3.0%; end-tidal CO2: -5.7 +/- 2.9% vs. -1.8 +/- 2.7%; all P < 0.01) and the increase in subjective assessment of the effort tended to be higher (mean increase on Borg scale: 1.6 +/- 1.9 vs. 1.1 +/- 1.8, P = 0.07) after heart rate unadjusted than after adjusted mode switching. Mode switching from DDD to VVI pacing is better tolerated and gas exchange measurements are less influenced if ventricular pacing rate is adjusted to the level of physical activity. Thus, pacing rate adjustment should be considered as part of automatic mode switch algorithms."

After baseline exercise treadmill testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic ST-segment monitoring, patients received either nifedipine (mean dose, 80 mg/day) or placebo administered 4 times per day, with the initial dose taken immediately upon arising in the morning. Patients were maintained on a stable dose of each study drug for 7 days, after which they underwent repeat exercise treadmill testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. During exercise treadmill testing, greater exercise duration was achieved by patients receiving nifedipine than by those receiving placebo (421 +/- 121 vs 353 +/- 155 seconds, respectively; p less than 0.05). Time to greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression was significantly greater with nifedipine (282 +/- 146 seconds) than at baseline (130 +/- 72 seconds, p less than 0.003) and with placebo (150 +/- 98 seconds, p less than 0.0005). During ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, nifedipine reduced both the total number of ischemic episodes (18 vs 54 at baseline and 63 with placebo; p less than 0.02 for both) and the total duration of ischemia (260 vs 874 at baseline and 927 minutes with placebo; p less than 0.02 for both). The surge of ischemia between 06:00 and 12:00 noted at baseline and during placebo therapy was nearly abolished during nifedipine treatment. Nifedipine at this dosage, administered in this manner, is effective in reducing total ischemic activity and may prevent morning surges of ischemic episodes."

The wake-up time, Mondays, winter season, physical exertion, emotional upset, overeating, lack of sleep, cocaine, marijuana, anger, and sexual activity are some of the more common triggers. Certain natural disasters such as earthquakes and blizzards have also been associated with an increase in cardiac events. Certain unnatural triggers may play a role including the Holiday season. Holiday season cardiac events peak on Christmas and New Year. A number of hypotheses have been raised to explain the increase in cardiac events during the holidays, including overeating, excessive use of salt and alcohol, exposure to particulates, from fireplaces, a delay in seeking medical help, anxiety or depression related to the holidays, and poorer staffing of health care facilities at this time. War has been associated with an increase in cardiac events. Data regarding an increase in cardiac events during the 9/11 terrorist attack have been mixed.

All the patients performed a washout period of 7 days at the end of which, before and after acute administration (90 min) of isosorbide 5-mononitrate or placebo some echocardiographic parameters were controlled according to a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Moreover, after 2 months of open treatment with isosorbide 5-mononitrate (20 mg three times daily), echocardiographic parameters were investigated again. Continuous ECG monitoring (24 h) was performed after the washout period and after 2 months of treatment. After acute administration of isosorbide 5-mononitrate, we observed a reduction in pre- and afterload, whereas after 2 months of treatment the reduction in preload seems to play a more important role. Together with other mechanisms these haemodynamic changes are responsible for the substantial diminution of myocardial oxygen consumption, and consequently for the reduction of transient ischaemic episodes, both symptomatic and asymptomatic with heart rate increase. These results suggest that isosorbide 5-mononitrate exhibits a definite nitrate-typical vascular activity that is evident both after single administration and after 2 months of treatment."

Four of the 18 patients achieved intrinsic rates greater than 100 beats/min and were deleted from the primary study. It was noted that all four of these patients performed best with intrinsic rate response and AV synchrony. Thirteen of the remaining 14 patients demonstrated improved exercise tolerance in the VVIR mode. Average exercise time in the VVIR mode (7:25 +/- 3:12 min) was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than the DDD mode (6:01 +/- 2:27 min). Work performed was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in the VVIR mode (4.77 +/- 1.97 METS) than in the DDD mode (3.78 +/- 0.77 METS). Maximum heart rates were 83.86 +/- 5.11 beats/min in DDD mode versus 116.00 +/- 10.56 beats/min in VVIR mode. The results demonstrated that improved exercise tolerance can be achieved with single chamber rate variable pacing compared to DDD pacing in patients with chronotropic incompetence.

Cardiac patients are usually limited by symptoms (angina, ECG abnormalities, anaerobic threshold) therefore the intensity of the training (monitored by heart rate or ECG) must be setted by an ergometer exercise testing. Patients with obliterative peripheral artery disease may surpass the local anaerobic threshold during interval-type loads. Blood pressure limits the training intensity of the hypertensive patients if not an organ lesion. COPD patients use the rest periods of an interval training for expectoration and for restitution of their blood gas values. In insulin dependent diabetes the vascular complications can be avoided by a proper insulin regime, training and diet. Day-to-day training by an even energy need acts like the insulin therefore it must be carefully dosed. In NIDDM also the carbohydrate metabolism can improve significantly. In anxiety and depression the training and the social milieu offers a physiological trigger for the improvement.

However, since association between sexual activity and sudden death determined by forensic autopsies related to cardiac or cerebral causes has been reported, some people with heart disease often abstain from sexual activity that could affect the quality of life. It is therefore important to learn the physical demand of sexual activity and the risk it may trigger. For decades, the cardiologists have conducted observational studies and clinical trials on healthy volunteers or patients. The most common indices responding to cardiovascular risks of sexuality were variances of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), monitored by ambulatory blood pressure and dynamic electrocardiogram recording. BP and HR increase during the coitus just briefly and quickly recover to baseline level. Peak coital BP occurred at onset of plateau phase and quickly decreased, instead of emerged at orgasm as most people supposed. The metabolic equivalent of energy expenditure during the orgasm was relatively modest when compared with other physical exertion such as cycling.

The recessive form of CPVT is associated with mutation in the cardiac calsequestrin gene (CASQ2). We engineered and characterized a homozygous CASQ2(R33Q/R33Q) mouse model that closely mimics the clinical phenotype of CPVT patients. CASQ2(R33Q/R33Q) mice develop bidirectional VT on exposure to environmental stress whereas CASQ2(R33Q/R33Q) myocytes show reduction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium content, adrenergically mediated delayed (DADs) and early (EADs) afterdepolarizations leading to triggered activity. Furthermore triadin, junctin, and CASQ2-R33Q proteins are significantly decreased in knock-in mice despite normal levels of mRNA, whereas the ryanodine receptor (RyR2), calreticulin, phospholamban, and SERCA2a-ATPase are not changed. Trypsin digestion studies show increased susceptibility to proteolysis of mutant CASQ2. Despite normal histology, CASQ2(R33Q/R33Q) hearts display ultrastructural changes such as disarray of junctional electron-dense material, referable to CASQ2 polymers, dilatation of junctional SR, yet normal total SR volume. Based on the foregoings, we propose that the phenotype of the CASQ2(R33Q/R33Q) CPVT mouse model is portrayed by an unexpected set of abnormalities including (1) reduced CASQ2 content, possibly attributable to increased degradation of CASQ2-R33Q, (2) reduction of SR calcium content, (3) dilatation of junctional SR, and (4) impaired clustering of mutant CASQ2."

The IDEFICS consortium comprises 24 research centers and small or medium enterprises across Europe. One part of IDEFICS will investigate the etiology of selected diet- and lifestyle-related diseases in 2- to 10-year-old children. The impact of sensory perception and other internal and external triggers of children's food choices and consumer behavior will be studied in this context. Another part of IDEFICS will develop and evaluate strategies for the primary prevention of diet- and lifestyle-related diseases. The results of the project shall contribute to the development of harmonized European guidelines on diet and lifestyle for health promotion and disease prevention in children."

            "title": "Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.",
            "abstract": "Clinical characteristics:\n        \n      \n      Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is characterized by generalized joint hypermobility, joint instability, pain, soft and hyperextensible skin with atrophic scars and easy bruising, dental crowding, abdominal hernias, pelvic organ prolapse, marfanoid body habitus, mitral valve prolapse, and aortic root dilatation. Subluxations, dislocations, and soft tissue injury are common; they may occur spontaneously or with minimal trauma and can be acutely painful. Degenerative joint and chronic soft tissue disorders may arise due to repeated injury. Chronic pain, distinct from that associated with acute injury, is common and often neuropathic in nature. Chronic fatigue, functional bowel disorders, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, swallow and phonation disorders, sleep disorders including apnea, migraine, entrapment and peripheral neuropathies, inflammation from mast cell activation disorders, anxiety disorders, and urogynecologic disorders are common. Mitral valve prolapse and aortic root dilatation, when present, are typically of a mild degree with no increased risk of cardiac complications.\n    \n\n\n          Diagnosis/testing:\n        \n      \n      The diagnosis of hEDS is established in an adult proband based on 2017 international clinical diagnostic criteria. Currently, no underlying genetic, epigenetic, or metabolomic etiology has been identified for hEDS.\n    \n\n\n          Management:\n        \nTreatment of manifestations: Tailored treatment with exercise to increase core and extremity muscle strength and tone, proprioception, and joint stability; braces and splints to improve alignment and control; occupational therapy for assistive devices (e.g., wide-grip writing utensils, home and work ergonomics); physical therapy for assistive devices (e.g., wheelchair or scooter, suitable mattress, soft neck collar); pain management tailored to cause and symptoms; platelet disorders may respond to tranexamic or mefenamic acid; nutrition advice for micronutrient deficiencies; gastritis, gastroparesis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease may require intensive pharmacotherapy; therapies for other gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, ocular, neurologic, and urogynecologic manifestations; orthodontic, maxillofacial, and ENT management for narrow palate, crowded teeth, temporomandibular joint laxity and dysfunction, and disorders of swallow and phonation; standard treatment of periodontal disease; avoidance of triggers for mast cell activation disorder and pharmacotherapy or monoclonal biologic therapy as needed; counseling and pharmacotherapy for neurobehavioral and psychiatric manifestations.\n    \n\nSurveillance: Assess for joint manifestations, pain, disability, bleeding issues, functional bowel disorders, autonomic dysfunction, oral health needs, phonation and respiratory issues, sleep issues, vision issues, headaches and other neurologic manifestations, inflammatory disease, neurobehavioral and psychiatric manifestations, and urogynecologic manifestations annually or at each visit. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in those with height loss greater than one inch, atypical/low trauma fractures, or radiographs suggestive of osteopenia. Follow-up echocardiography in those with aortic root dilatation.\n    \n\nAgents/circumstances to avoid: High-impact activity may increase the risk of acute subluxation/dislocation and acute and chronic pain. Chiropractic adjustment and yoga are not contraindicated but like all other physical treatments must be performed in ways that avoid iatrogenic subluxations or dislocations. Autonomic concerns, gastrointestinal disorders, and intolerances may preclude use of medications or their excipients (e.g., common analgesics in someone with slow gastrointestinal transit, vasodilator in a person with orthostatic intolerance).\n    \n\nPregnancy management: Preconceptual (e.g., musculoskeletal health and medication use), antenatal (e.g., joint instability, pelvic strength, hernias, and pain management), intrapartum (e.g., birth choices, mobility in labor, anesthesia), and postpartum (e.g., wound healing, pelvic health, newborn/infant care) issues should all be addressed.\n    \n\n\n          Genetic counseling:\n        \n      \n      Hypermobile EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with variable expression of signs and variable severity of symptoms among affected family members. Most individuals diagnosed with hEDS have an affected parent, although a detailed history and examination of the parents is often necessary to recognize that a parent has a current or prior history of joint laxity, easy bruising, and skin manifestations despite the absence of serious complications. Each child of an individual with hEDS has a 50% chance of inheriting hEDS. Because the gene(s) and pathogenic variant(s) responsible for hEDS have not been identified, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are not possible."

All pacemakers were implanted for sick sinus syndrome (8 patients) or complete heart block (13 patients). The pacemakers were randomly programmed to VVIR or DDD pacing modes for 2-week periods and then the pacing mode was switched for another 2-week period. At the end of each period, the quality-of-life was evaluated by a questionnaire with regard to cardiovascular symptoms, physical activity, psychosocial and emotional functioning, and self-perceived health. Nineteen questions were scored 0-5 points each. Significant improvement in the mean total quality-of-life score (20.5 +/- 14.9 vs 34.8 +/- 17.4) as well as in dyspnea on effort, dizzy spells, palpitation, sweating, fatigue, lethargy, emotional functioning, and self-perceived health was observed during DDD compared to VVIR pacing. No question was scored in favor of VVIR pacing mode. Significant improvements during DDD pacing was demonstrated in all subgroups of patients (sick sinus syndrome, chronotropically competent and incompetent patients, and patients with high degree AV block). Eighteen patients preferred DDD pacing mode, while only one preferred VVIR pacing mode. Two remaining patients expressed no preference. The results suggest that DDD pacing offers better quality-of-life than dual sensor VVIR pacing in all subgroups of patients commonly indicated for pacemaker implantation."

            "abstract": "m-Chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) is a metabolite of the antidepressant trazodone which has been widely used in psychopharmacology research as a probe of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) function. However, in addition to binding at 5-HT receptors it also binds strongly to alpha 2-adrenoceptors, and it is conceivable that some of the physical and psychological symptoms previously reported following mCPP infusion are due to effects upon central noradrenergic neurotransmitter function. In this double-blind placebo-controlled balanced-crossover study in 12 healthy male volunteers we have examined the effects of infusion of mCPP (0.08 mg/kg over 2 min) on symptoms of anxiety, cognitive performance, pulse and blood pressure, and plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone, and the noradrenaline metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycerol (MHPG). The results confirm previous findings that in humans mCPP causes significant increases in the symptoms of anxiety, and in the plasma concentrations of cortisol, prolactin and growth hormone. In addition, our results demonstrate that mCPP causes no significant changes in cognitive performance, in pulse or systolic blood pressure, or in the plasma concentration of MHPG. Since pulse, systolic blood pressure and MHPG plasma concentrations all to some degree reflect central noradrenergic activity, we believe it unlikely that the psychological and hormonal effects of mCPP are due primarily to effects on noradrenergic neurotransmission. Further studies to address this specific issue are needed, however, before firm conclusions can be reached."

Testing was done according to a randomized double-blind crossover placebo-controlled trial consisting of 3 consecutive 7-day treatment periods with verapamil or propranolol or placebo. Patients underwent continuous 48-hour electrocardiographic monitoring before therapy (run-in phase) and during the last 2 days of each treatment period. A total of 391 episodes of diagnostic (greater than or equal to 0.15 mV) ST depression was recorded during the trial. Of these, 23 were symptomatic. None of the episodes occurred while the patients were asleep, 25% during exercise, 35% during minimal physical activity and 40% at rest. Rest included activities demanding mental arousal (conversation, reading or watching television). Heart rate at the onset of ST depression was higher (greater than or equal to 10 beats/min) than that observed in the 5 minutes preceding ischemia in 95% of the episodes. In the group as a whole, the average number of ischemic episodes per 24 hours was significantly reduced during propranolol therapy compared with placebo (0.7 +/- 0.6 vs 3.9 +/- 1.8; p less than 0.0005). No significant differences were seen during verapamil treatment (3.4 +/- 1.7 vs 3.9 +/- 1.8). It is concluded that transient myocardial ischemia in syndrome X is mostly precipitated by an increase in oxygen consumption, presumably due to a heightened sympathetic activity. Accordingly, beta blockers may represent the first line of treatment."

            "abstract": "Endurance training after myocardial infarction results in increased fitness and favours regression of coronary arteriosclerosis if the intensity of the training programme results in an expenditure of at least 2200 Kcalories per week. During physical exercise the risk of sudden death is increased, however the net effect of endurance training results in a decreased risk of sudden cardiac death and also of reinfarction. Very intense physical activity may trigger a myocardial infarction and should be avoided by patients with coronary artery disease. Patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction benefit from a structured exercise programme lasting 6 months or longer. After a large anterior myocardial infarction moderate physical activity does not have an apparent effect on left ventricular size or remodelling. In patients with a low ejection fraction and borderline compensation, physical activity should be delayed until a better degree of cardiac compensation is achieved. The intensity of exercise most be closely supervised to avoid cardiac decompensation. Regular physical activity is an important component of secondary preventive measures in virtually all patients with established coronary artery disease."

            "abstract": "The neuroendocrine response to sexual activity in humans is characterized by a pronounced orgasm-dependent increase of plasma levels of prolactin. In contrast to the well-known inhibitory effects of chronic hyperprolactinemia on sexual drive and function, the impact of acute prolactin alterations on human sexual physiology is unknown. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effects of acute manipulation of plasma prolactin on sexual behavior. Ten healthy males participated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over design. Prolactin levels were pharmacologically increased to high levels (protirelin, 50 micro g i.v.) or reduced to low physiological concentrations (cabergoline, 0.5 mg p.o.). Sexual arousal and orgasm were then induced by an erotic film and masturbation. In addition to continuous neuroendocrine and cardiovascular recordings, the quality and intensity of the acute sexual drive, arousal, orgasm and refractory period were assessed by extensive psychometric measures. Administration of cabergoline decreased prolactin levels and significantly enhanced all parameters of sexual drive (P<0.05), function (P<0.01) and positive perception of the refractory period (P<0.01). Administration of protirelin increased prolactin concentrations and produced small, but not significant reductions of sexual parameters. The sexual effects observed from cabergoline were completely abrogated by coadministration of protirelin. Although different pharmacological sites of action of prolactin-altering drugs have to be considered, these data demonstrate that acute changes in prolactin plasma levels may be one factor modulating sexual drive and function. Therefore, besides a neuroendocrine reproductive reflex, a post-orgasmic prolactin increase may represent one factor modulating central nervous system centers controlling sexual drive and behavior. These findings may offer a new pharmacological approach for the treatment of sexual disorders."

The ergoreceptor test involved two 5-minute handgrip exercises. On one occasion, the subjects recovered normally (control recovery), whereas on the other a posthandgrip regional circulatory occlusion was induced in the exercising arm, isolating the stimulation of the ergoreceptor after exercise. The ergoreflex was quantified as the difference in ventilation between the posthandgrip regional circulatory occlusion and the control recovery periods. During the protocol, the local muscular blood effluent concentrations of metabolic mediators were assessed. Patients had an ergoreflex effect on ventilation greater than controls (4.8+/-1.4 versus 0.4+/-0.1 L/min, P<0.01).

            "abstract": "Cardiac dysfunction occurs during type 1 and type 2 diabetes and results from multiple parameters including glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, fibrosis and mitochondrial uncoupling. Oxidative stress arises from an imbalance between the production of ROS and the biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates. It is involved in the etiology of diabetes-induced downregulation of heart function. Several studies have reported beneficial effects of a therapy with antioxidant agents, including trace elements and other antioxidants, against the cardiovascular system consequences of diabetes. Antioxidants act through one of three mechanisms to prevent oxidant-induced cell damages. They can reduce the generation of ROS, scavenge ROS, or interfere with ROS-induced alterations. Modulating mitochondrial activity is an important possibility to control ROS production. Hence, the use of PPARalpha agonist to reduce fatty acid oxidation and of trace elements such as zinc and selenium as antioxidants, and physical exercise to induce mitochondrial adaptation, contribute to the prevention of diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction. The paradigm that inhibiting the overproduction of superoxides and peroxides would prevent cardiac dysfunction in diabetes has been difficult to verify using conventional antioxidants like vitamin E. That led to use of catalytic antioxidants such as SOD/CAT mimetics. Moreover, increases in ROS trigger a cascade of pathological events, including activation of MMPs, PPARs and protein O-GlcNAcation. Multiple tools have been developed to counteract these alterations. Hence, well-tuned, balanced and responsive antioxidant defense systems are vital for proper prevention against diabetic damage. This review aims to summarize our present knowledge on various strategies to control oxidative stress and antagonize cardiac dysfunction during diabetes."

The contribution of the recruitment of different muscle groups, the activity of the cardiac mechanoreceptors, the level of arterial baroreceptor stimulation, and the hemodynamic effects of gravity on the exercising muscles was analyzed during upright (U) and S exercise. Delayed rise in VE and pulmonary gas exchange following an impulselike change in work rate (supramaximal leg cycling at 240 W for 12 s) was measured in seven healthy subjects and six heart transplant patients both in U and S positions. This approach allows study of the relationship between the rise in VE and O2 uptake (VO2) without the confounding effects of contractions of different muscle groups. These responses were compared with those triggered by an impulselike change in work rate produced by the arms, which were positioned at the same level as the heart in S and U positions to separate effects of gravity on postexercising muscles from those on the rest of the body. Despite superimposable VO2 and CO2 output responses, the delayed VE response after leg exercise was significantly lower in the S posture than in the U position for each control subject and cardiac-transplant patient (-2.58 +/- 0.44 l and -3.52 +/- 1.11 l/min, respectively). In contrast, when impulse exercise was performed with the arms, reduction of ventilatory response in the S posture reached, at best, one-third of the deficit after leg exercise and was always associated with a reduction in VO2 of a similar magnitude. We concluded that reduction in VE response to exercise in the S position is independent of the types (groups) of muscles recruited and is not critically dependent on afferent signals originating from the heart but seems to rely on some of the effects of gravity on postexercising muscles."

In this study we used a mathematical model to simulate two mutations linked toCPVT, in cardiac calsequestrin (CSQN2) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR2). The aim of the present study is to characterize the mutations responsible for CPVT and establish the mechanistic basis for spontaneous Ca2+ release events that lead to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered arrhythmias. Simulated calcium transients in the mutant CSQN2 model recapitulated the smaller amplitude and time to peak, as well as accelerated recovery from inactivation seen in experiments. When simulated CSQN2-mutant myocytes were paced in current-clamp mode, DADs were observed, suggesting that accelerated recovery of RyR2 induced by impaired luminal Ca2(+) sensing can lead to the triggered activity observed in the mutant CSQN2. Simulations of mutant RyR2 suggest that the hyperactive, \"leaky\" receptors characteristic of reduced FKBP12.6 function may be centrally involved in triggering DADs. These results provide plausible mechanisms by which defects in RyR2 gating may lead to the cellular triggers of CPVT, with implications for the development of targeted therapies."

Physical activity did not significantly change the baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) or the sensitivity of the baroreflex bradycardia in normotensive Sham rats. However, in 2K1C hypertensive rats, physical activity induced a significant fall in baseline MAP and HR and produced an improvement of the baroreflex function (bradycardic component). The microinjections of Ang II into the CVLM produced similar decreases in MAP in all groups, Sham and 2K1C, sedentary and trained rats. The hypotensive effect of Ang II at the CVLM was blocked by previous microinjection of the AT(2) receptors antagonist, PD123319, in all groups of rats. Unexpectedly, microinjection of PD123319 at the CVLM produced a depressor effect in 2K1C sedentary that was attenuated in 2K1C trained rats. No significant changes in MAP were observed after PD123319 in Sham rats, sedentary or trained. These data showed that low-intensity physical activity is effective in lowering blood pressure and restoring the sensitivity of the baroreflex bradycardia, however these cardiovascular effects are not accompanied by changes in the responsiveness to Ang II at CVLM in normotensive or hypertensive, 2K1C rats. In addition, the blood pressure changes observed after AT(2) blockade in 2K1C rats suggest that hypertension may trigger an imbalance of AT(1)/AT(2) receptors at the CVLM that may be restored, at least in part, by low-intensity physical activity."

            "abstract": "Since April 1974 until January 1978 permanent pacemakers were implanted in 21 children. The patient age at the time of operation averaged 4.5 years; the youngest patient was 3 months old. Indications for pacemaker implantation were: congenital total a-v block (TAVB) (n = 4), sick syndrom (S-S-S) (n = 4), postoperative TAVB (n = 13). Cardiac failure was present in all patients despite optimal medical treatment. Pacemakers were implanted under general anesthesia and intubation. The stimulation electrodes were positioned by the transvenous route in 16 subjects and by direct fixation upon the ventricle and the atrium in 5 patients. 5 children obtained an atrial triggered, 14 patients R-inhibited demand pacemaker and 2 subjects an asynchronous pacemaker. After a mean observation time of 16.4 months mean pacemaker function is normal in 14 patients. 6 children died 1 to 33 months after implantation despite functioning pacemakers because of congestive heart failure. Pacemaker malfunction was observed in 4 patients. The type of malfunction induced: failure of the impulse generator (n = 2), dislodgement of the electrode (n = 2), threshold increase (n = 1). In 5 children generators were changed 9 to 36 months (m = 23 plus or minus 10) after implantation because of battery depletion. The use of the pacemakers in small children is connected with several specific problems: 1. Application of large generators is hazardous because of impending perforation and secondary infection. 2. Until now miniaturization of pacemakers decreases function time and therefore implies frequent surgical intervention. 3. Stretching and dislodgement of transvenous electrodes may occur due to growth of the child. 4. Threshold increase may limit the life-span of myocardial electrodes. 5. Physiological changes in natural frequency requires changes in stimulation rate. 6. To guarantee normal physical activity demand related adaptation of heart rate is necessary. Because of these reasons a pacemaker system for children should have the following criteria: low weight, small wolume, high energy capacity, atrial or programmable stimulation, a thin elastic perhaps coiled electrode."

The study included 30 patients. Their physical and laboratory examinations did not show a pathology that may be the cause of their syncope. HUT test was positive in 13 patients and negative in 17 patients. Plasma NA concentrations were higher in the HUT positive than the HUT negative group at the beginning and at the 10th minute of the test. Specific I-123 MIBG uptake assessed as the cardiac to mediastinal activity ratio in the delayed image was significantly higher in HUT positive group. The higher levels of MIBG uptake and plasma NA observed in HUT positive patients may reflect the greater capacity of NA storage in cardiac adrenergic neuronal tissue in patients with NCS. The results of this study support the critical role of autonomic nervous system in the pathophysiology of NCS and the excessive sympathetic nervous stimulation as the trigger of paradox reflex."

            "abstract": "A dual sensor DDDR pacemaker (DX2 Model 7970, Medtronic Inc.) has integrated the rate response of minute ventilation (MV) and activity (ACT) sensors. False rate acceleration by the ACT (constrained upper rate) and MV (cross-checked by ACT) is reduced. We examined the rate response profile and rate kinetics of the automatically optimized integrated sensor by comparing with the projected rate response of ACT and MV sensors alone in nine patients. After 1 month of sensor optimization using rate profile optimization (RPO), patients underwent maximal and submaximal treadmill exercises and performed activities of daily living (ADL). The integrated sensor mode gave a faster speed of rate response with a shorter delay time, time to 50% rate response and time to 90% of rate response compared to the MV sensor during hall walk (0.37 +/- 0.08, 0.7 +/- 0.09, 1.43 +/- 0.19 vs 1.11 +/- 0.1, 1.75 +/- 0.14, 2.91 +/- 0.17 min; P < 0.05). The average maximal sensor rates were significantly more proportional for the integrated sensor mode compared with either the ACT or MV mode. There was no significant difference in both the maximal pacing rate among the three sensor modes during maximal exercise and the rate decay during recovery. During interference studies by arm swinging (30-40 swings/min) and external tapping of the pacemakers (2 taps/s), there was only a moderate increase in pacing rate by 13 +/- 9, 16 +/- 5 beats/min. Hence, the new integrated sensor with the automatic rate profile optimization algorithm resulted in improved rate response profiles during submaximal exercise and ADL compared to the individual sensor response, and the sensor blending and cross-checking algorithm made the pacemaker relatively immune to false triggering of both the ACT and MV sensors."

It has been hypothesized that mental stress-induced cardiovascular reactions may play a role in the triggering of myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular activity was measured during rest, stress, and recovery in rheumatoid arthritis patients with high systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein >8 mg/l), rheumatoid arthritis patients with low systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein <or= 8 mg/l), and osteoarthritis patients. Systemic vascular resistance increased only in rheumatoid arthritis patients with high systemic inflammation. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure increased during the stress task in all groups. Thus, acute cardiovascular events in rheumatoid arthritis patients may be related to stress-induced increases in systemic vascular resistance, particularly in patients with high levels of systemic inflammation."

In these patients, nitrate therapy is a contraindication to the use of sildenafil. To assess whether the metabolic anti-ischemic agent, trimetazidine, is effective in controlling episodes of myocardial ischemia during sexual activity in patients who have CAD and use long-term nitrate therapy, we studied 38 men (57 +/- 6 years of age) who had proved CAD. Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring at baseline, after 1 week of oral nitrate therapy (20 mg 3 times a day), and after 1 week of trimetazidine (20 mg 3 times a day). Patients were asked to engage in >/=1 session of sexual intercourse during each session of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. They were instructed to take sildenafil (100 mg) 1 hour before sexual intercourse performed at baseline and during therapy with trimetazidine and sildenafil or placebo (blinded) during therapy with nitrates. A decrease in total ischemic burden was observed with nitrates and trimetazidine compared with baseline (-3 +/- 1.2 episodes/patient/24 hours vs -5 +/- 1.3 episodes/patient/24 hours and -6 +/- 5 min/patient/24 hours vs -8 +/- 3 min/patient/24 hours, p <0.01 for nitrates and trimetazidine vs baseline). Trimetazidine plus sildenafil was more effective in controlling episodes of myocardial ischemia during sexual activity than nitrates alone (-45 +/- 11% vs -18 +/- 7%, p <0.04). In conclusion, in patients who have CAD, combination therapy with sildenafil and trimetazidine is more effective than nitrate therapy in the control of ischemic episodes during sexual activity, suggesting that long-term nitrate therapy may be safely switched to trimetazidine therapy when therapy for erectile dysfunction is required."

            "title": "Antiarrhythmic mechanisms during exercise.",
            "abstract": "Exercise disturbs cardiac sympathovagal and ionic balance. In arterial blood, vigorous exercise can double plasma K(+), decrease pH by 0.4 unit, and raise catecholamines 15-fold. If any of these changes are experienced at rest, there is an increased risk of arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, yet in exercise they are usually tolerated. How the heart is protected from the chemical stress caused by exercise is not fully understood but may be related to a collective antiarrhythmic effect of these chemical changes, so when they combine there is a mutual antagonism. Catecholamines can offset the harmful cardiac effects of hyperkalemia and acidosis in isolated hearts and whole hearts in vivo and improve action-potential characteristics in K(+)-depolarized ventricular myocytes. This results from an increase in the inward Ca2(+) current that is modulated by both adrenergic and nonadrenergic hormones. Conversely, hyperkalemia can reduce or abolish the incidence of norepinephrine-induced arrhythmias. The efficacy of the mutual antagonism is reduced when the combination of acidosis, hyperkalemia, and high levels of norepinephrine are superimposed on a heart with regional ischemia or a small infarct. However, the heart may be at greatest risk in the postexercise period when plasma K(+) is low and the adrenergic tone is high. Little is known about this period, but abnormal regulation of electrolyte and cardiac sympathovagal balance may increase the incidence of arrhythmia, especially if there is underlying ischemia. Although regular physical activity can reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death, recent epidemiological studies show that vigorous exercise can trigger myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, especially in habitually sedentary subjects with coronary artery disease. This may be partly related to disruption of the normal protective mechanism that allows the heart to cope with the chemical stress caused by exercise."

            "abstract": "Sexual activity corresponds to light to moderate physical exercise and entails no significant risk to the majority of patients with cardiovascular disease. In patients suffering from severe angina or chronic heart failure, however, sexual activity might trigger coital angina or cardiac decompensation necessitating hospitalization. Nevertheless, even for patients with coronary artery disease the absolute risk of having a heart attack or fatal event during sexual activity is extremely low. Due to systemic atherosclerosis and concomitant endothelial dysfunction the prevalence of sexual dysfunction is higher in patients with cardiovascular disease as compared to the general population. PDE-5 inhibitors can be safely used by many patients suffering from both, cardiovascular disease and sexual dysfunction as long as no concomitant medication with nitrates exists. The concomitant use of PDE-5 inhibitors and nitrates is strictly contraindicated because of the risk of life-threatening hypotension. It is therefore of utmost importance to ask patients presenting with coital angina about PDE-5 inhibitor intake before the administration of nitrate-based anti-ischemic therapies. The recommendations of the Princeton Consensus Conference provide a useful framework for risk stratification and counseling of patients with cardiovascular disease regarding sexual activity."

A total of 581 cases were studied. Monthly fluctuation of incidence was not found to be statistically significant. A cold period in the Kamikawa Basin was defined in this study as the period when ordinary mean atmospheric temperatures were below 0 degree C (from 7 Nov. to 16 Apr.). Canonical discriminant analysis was applied to 10 meterological factors between the days with occurrences and those without occurrences (245 days vs 245 days) in the cold periods of the investigated 10 years, and between the days with outdoor occurrences and those without occurrences (37 days vs 37 days). In order to compare the regional difference, this analysis was done on the same 10 factors for the cold periods over 3 years in Yamagata (46 days vs 46 days). The F values of 0.0003, 0.0155 and 0.0098 respectively in the above 3 analyses were small (much less than F 1(9) (0.25) = 1.51). A circadian rhythm of 2 cycles/day was recognized concerning the time of occurrence by power spectral analysis of the data of 562 patients for whom the time of the onset of myocardial infarction was known. Subdividing the patients into 2 groups according to physical activity just before the occurrence, the group who experienced an occurrence at rest showed a rhythm of 1 cycle/day, and the group who experienced an occurrence on effort showed a rhythm of 2 cycles/day. Therefore, the 10 meterological factors could not discriminate the probabilities between the days with occurrences and the days without occurrences of myocardial infarction in the cold periods. On the other hand, it was suggested that biological intrinsic rhythm participates in triggering the occurrence of myocardial infarction."

These studies lead to the hypothesis that the hyperreactivity common to the laboratory and to the field has a beta-adrenergic basis. We examined the heart rate variability of 16 hyperreactive and 16 hyporeactive subjects over an 8-hour period while they were receiving either a placebo or a cardio-selective beta-blocking drug (Bisoprolol) in a double-blind crossover design. Subjects were classified on the basis of their heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses to a complex self-paced, reaction-time task. Response in the field was assessed from the standard deviation of the raw heart rate series, after allowance for the serial dependency in the data using autoregressive methods and, when allowance was made for physical activity, assessed from the muscle activity of the thigh. As predicted, on placebo hyperreactive subjects had markedly more variable heart rates, particularly when allowance was made for physical activity. Although not confirmed by a significant interaction effect, this difference largely disappeared under beta-blockade."

Young people (<35 years) are not spared from sudden death (SD) with a rate of 1/100,000 per year. Effort is a trigger with a threefold risk in athletes vs. nonathletes, and sports disqualification is by itself life-saving in people with underlying concealed cardiovascular diseases. Several culprits of cardiac SD may be identified at postmortem and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the leading cause (25% of SD cases in the young), mostly consisting of a single obstructive plaque with fibrocellular intimal proliferation. However, the spectrum of cardiovascular substrates is wide and include also congenital diseases of the coronary arteries (mainly anomalous origin), myocardium (arrhythmogenic and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, myocarditis), valves (aortic stenosis and mitral valve prolapse), and conduction system (ventricular preexcitation, accelerated atrioventricular conduction and block). In up to 20% of cases, the heart is grossly and histologically normal at autopsy (unexplained SD or \"mors sine materia\"), and inherited ion channel diseases have been implicated (long and short QT syndromes, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). Targets to treat and prevent SD in the young consist of the following: (a) avoid triggers like effort or emotion, (b) inhibit the onset of arrhythmias with drugs or ablation, (c) switch off arrhythmias with defibrillator, and (d) hinder the recurrence of the disease with genetic counseling and/or therapy. In vivo detection of cardiomyopathies is nowadays feasible by electrocardiogram and/or echocardiography, which resulted in a sharp decline of SD in the athletes in Italy, thanks to obligatory preparticipation screening for sport activity. Genetic screening could play a pivotal role in early detection of asymptomatic mutation carriers of cardiovascular diseases at risk of SD."

A previous study has shown that postmeal exercise of moderate intensity blunts the blood glucose increase after carbohydrate intake (Høstmark et al. Prev. Med. 42(5): 369-371). The objective of the present study was to examine whether even postmeal slow walking would have a similar effect. Fourteen healthy women aged >50 years participated in 3 experiments in a random crossover design: after a carbohydrate-rich meal, either they were seated (control experiment) or they performed slow postmeal walking for 15 min (W15) or 40 min (W40). Blood glucose concentration was determined prior to the meal (fasting), and at 11 time points throughout each experiment. The W15 trial lowered the blood glucose values during walking and delayed the peak blood glucose value (p = 0.003). In W40, the postmeal blood glucose increase during walking was blunted, the peak glucose value was delayed (p = 0.001), and the incremental area under the 2-h blood glucose curve (IAUC) was reduced (p = 0.014). There was a negative relationship between IAUC and walking time (p = 0.016). The individual reducing effect of walking on IAUC correlated strongly with IAUC on the control day (p < 0.001). We conclude that even slow postmeal walking can reduce the blood glucose response to a carbohydrate-rich meal. The magnitude of this effect seems to be related to the duration of walking and to the magnitude of the postprandial blood glucose response when resting after a carbohydrate-rich meal."

However, a 28% increase in plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (P < .01) was noted during the initial 12-week training period, which regressed during the washout period, and was not replicated during the second 12-week exercise period.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Twelve weeks of walking and stair climbing at a moderate pace and intensity at an energy cost of about 2,000 kcal per week failed to improve physical fitness or risk factors for CHD. A reduction in physical activities other than the prescribed exercise program, as reported by a physical activity recall questionnaire, probably contributed to an absence of an exercise response. A longer and/or a more intense activity program is apparently required to improve these modalities."

Dual-chamber pacing with ventricular preactivation generates discoordinate contraction, which can limit cavity obliteration and thereby increase potential ejection reserve. Accordingly, we hypothesized that pacing may improve exercise tolerance long-term in this syndrome.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Dual-chamber pacemakers were implanted in 9 patients with exertional dyspnea caused by HHCO. Intrinsic atrial rate was sensed, and ventricular preactivation was achieved by shortening the atrial-ventricular delay. Pacing was on or off for successive 3-month periods (randomized, double-blind, crossover design), followed by 6 additional pacing-on months. Metabolic exercise testing, quality-of-life assessment, and rest and dobutamine-stress echocardiographic/Doppler data were obtained. After 3 months of pacing-on, exercise duration rose from 324+/-133 to 588+/-238 s (mean+/-SD; P=0.001, with 7 of 9 patients improving >/=30%), and maximal oxygen consumption increased from 13.6+/-2.9 to 16.7+/-3.3 mL of O(2). min(-1). kg(-1) (P<0.02).

            "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in industrialized countries, accounting for 10 to 20% of total mortality. Several studies have demonstrated a circadian variation of sudden death with a primary peak in the morning hours after awakening and a secondary peak in the late afternoon. Weekly and seasonal variations have been observed, with more frequent occurrence of sudden death on Mondays and in the winter compared with other days of the week and seasons, respectively. These patterns of disease occurrence indicate the presence of identifiable triggering factors. Interestingly, the circadian pattern of sudden death appears to be more pronounced in older patients and to be attenuated by beta-blocker therapy. Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with subsequent coronary thrombosis is the most common underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of sudden death. The variation in disease occurrence may reflect endogenous physiologic rhythms and the importance of external events (e.g., exertional physical activity) that trigger changes (e.g., surges in blood pressure) that lead to coronary plaque rupture. To reduce the long-term risk of sudden death, strategies of primary and secondary prevention must be further developed. To reduce short-term risk of sudden death, patients at risk for sudden death may require additional behavior modification and pharmacological intervention."

A second purpose was to determine the effects of switching exercise programs and continuing training for an additional 12 weeks. Twenty women and 17 men, (age 48.8 +/- 9.0 years) were divided randomly into 2 groups: INT (n = 20) and CON (n = 17). Aerobic exercise was performed 4 d.wk(-1) for 12 weeks.

Subjects exercised incrementally for weeks 1-4 and training was conducted at 70-80% heart rate reserve for weeks 5-24. Both groups showed comparable exercise adherence, completing 96.6 +/- 12.2% (CON) and 96.3% +/- 17.7% (INT) of the prescribed exercise time. The INT walked at a lower percentage of Vo(2)max, maximum heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.05). Maximal oxygen consumption increased by 4.5% in CON and by 8.7% in INT. Following the second 12 weeks, Vo(2)max increased by 3.6 and 7.7% in CON and INT, respectively. Treadmill test time increased by 41 seconds in CON (p < 0.05) and 71 seconds in INT (p < 0.05) after 12 weeks of training. High-density lipoproteins significantly increased in the INT group following the first 12 weeks of training.

            "abstract": "The physiological benefit of rate responsive, single-chamber cardiac pacing is well documented. We studied the activity response of nine atrially placed Activitrax II pacemakers. Seven patients were noted to have an inadequate activity-rate response with maximal pacing rates of 85 to 101 beats/min. Marker Channel analysis revealed that the upper rate timeout was reset by far-field R wave sensing, even when sensing occurred in the atrial refractory period. These 9 pacemakers were tested by atrial sensitivity adjustment for ability to exclude far-field R wave sensing, while preserving P wave sensing. Unipolar implantation data were then examined for predictors of this differential far-R and P-wave sensing. Differential atrial sensing occurred in 4/9 pacemakers (2/2 bipolar in the right atrial appendage; 0/1 bipolar in the coronary sinus; and 4/9 unipolar). An empirically developed index utilizing unipolar implant parameters discriminated outcomes for 8/9 unipolar pacemakers. We conclude that: (1) the rate responsiveness of the atrial Activitrax II pacemaker is limited by far-field R wave sensing even when this occurs during atrial channel refractoriness; (2) reprogramming atrial sensitivity to differentially sensed P and far-field R waves may restore appropriate rate responsiveness; and (3) although a unipolar implant discriminant index may correctly identify adequacy of future rate responsiveness, the atrial application of the Activitrax II pacemaker is cautioned until further validation is forthcoming, particularly when used in unipolar and coronary sinus applications."

            "title": "Two forms of spiral-wave reentry in an ionic model of ischemic ventricular myocardium.",
            "abstract": "It is well known that there is considerable spatial inhomogeneity in the electrical properties of heart muscle, and that the many interventions that increase this initial degree of inhomogeneity all make it easier to induce certain cardiac arrhythmias. We consider here the specific example of myocardial ischemia, which greatly increases the electrical heterogeneity of ventricular tissue, and often triggers life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. There is growing evidence that spiral-wave activity underlies these reentrant arrhythmias. We thus investigate whether spiral waves might be induced in a realistic model of inhomogeneous ventricular myocardium. We first modify the Luo and Rudy [Circ. Res. 68, 1501-1526 (1991)] ionic model of cardiac ventricular muscle so as to obtain maintained spiral-wave activity in a two-dimensional homogeneous sheet of ventricular muscle. Regional ischemia is simulated by raising the external potassium concentration ([K(+)](o)) from its nominal value of 5.4 mM in a subsection of the sheet, thus creating a localized inhomogeneity. Spiral-wave activity is induced using a pacing protocol in which the pacing frequency is gradually increased. When [K(+)](o) is sufficiently high in the abnormal area (e.g., 20 mM), there is complete block of propagation of the action potential into that area, resulting in a free end or wave break as the activation wave front encounters the abnormal area. As pacing continues, the free end of the activation wave front traveling in the normal area increasingly separates or detaches from the border between normal and abnormal tissue, eventually resulting in the formation of a maintained spiral wave, whose core lies entirely within an area of normal tissue lying outside of the abnormal area (\"type I\" spiral wave). At lower [K(+)](o) (e.g., 10.5 mM) in the abnormal area, there is no longer complete block of propagation into the abnormal area; instead, there is partial entrance block into the abnormal area, as well as exit block out of that area. In this case, a different kind of spiral wave (transient \"type II\" spiral wave) can be evoked, whose induction involves retrograde propagation of the action potential through the abnormal area. The number of turns made by the type II spiral wave depends on several factors, including the level of [K(+)](o) within the abnormal area and its physical size. If the pacing protocol is changed by adding two additional stimuli, a type I spiral wave is instead produced at [K(+)](o)=10.5 mM. When pacing is continued beyond this point, apparently aperiodic multiple spiral-wave activity is seen during pacing. We discuss the relevance of our results for arrythmogenesis in both the ischemic and nonischemic heart. (c) 1998 American Institute of Physics."

            "abstract": "Some of the physiological changes associated with the taper and their relationship with athletic performance are now known. Since the 1980s a number of studies have examined various physiological responses associated with the cardiorespiratory, metabolic, hormonal, neuromuscular and immunological systems during the pre-event taper across a number of sports. Changes in the cardiorespiratory system may include an increase in maximal oxygen uptake, but this is not a necessary prerequisite for taper-induced gains in performance. Oxygen uptake at a given submaximal exercise intensity can decrease during the taper, but this response is more likely to occur in less-skilled athletes. Resting, maximal and submaximal heart rates do not change, unless athletes show clear signs of overreaching before the taper. Blood pressure, cardiac dimensions and ventilatory function are generally stable, but submaximal ventilation may decrease. Possible haematological changes include increased blood and red cell volume, haemoglobin, haematocrit, reticulocytes and haptoglobin, and decreased red cell distribution width. These changes in the taper suggest a positive balance between haemolysis and erythropoiesis, likely to contribute to performance gains. Metabolic changes during the taper include: a reduced daily energy expenditure; slightly reduced or stable respiratory exchange ratio; increased peak blood lactate concentration; and decreased or unchanged blood lactate at submaximal intensities. Blood ammonia concentrations show inconsistent trends, muscle glycogen concentration increases progressively and calcium retention mechanisms seem to be triggered during the taper. Reduced blood creatine kinase concentrations suggest recovery from training stress and muscle damage, but other biochemical markers of training stress and performance capacity are largely unaffected by the taper. Hormonal markers such as testosterone, cortisol, testosterone : cortisol ratio, 24-hour urinary cortisol : cortisone ratio, plasma and urinary catecholamines, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 are sometimes affected and changes can correlate with changes in an athlete's performance capacity. From a neuromuscular perspective, the taper usually results in markedly increased muscular strength and power, often associated with performance gains at the muscular and whole body level. Oxidative enzyme activities can increase, along with positive changes in single muscle fibre size, metabolic properties and contractile properties. Limited research on the influence of the taper on athletes' immune status indicates that small changes in immune cells, immunoglobulins and cytokines are unlikely to compromise overall immunological protection. The pre-event taper may also be characterised by psychological changes in the athlete, including a reduction in total mood disturbance and somatic complaints, improved somatic relaxation and self-assessed physical conditioning scores, reduced perception of effort and improved quality of sleep. These changes are often associated with improved post-taper performances. Mathematical models indicate that the physiological changes associated with the taper are the result of a restoration of previously impaired physiological capacities (fatigue and adaptation model), and the capacity to tolerate training and respond effectively to training undertaken during the taper (variable dose-response model). Finally, it is important to note that some or all of the described physiological and psychological changes associated with the taper occur simultaneously, which underpins the integrative nature of relationships between these changes and performance enhancement."

If particular exercises can achieve multiple training functions, the number of exercises and the time needed to achieve a training goal may be decreased. It was the objective of this study to compare the extent of trunk muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity during running and callisthenic activities. EMG activity of the external obliques, lower abdominals (LA), upper lumbar erector spinae (ULES), and lumbosacral erector spinae (LSES) was monitored while triathletes and active nonrunners ran on a treadmill for 30 min at 60% and 80% of their maximum heart rate (HR) reserve, as well as during 30 repetitions of a partial curl-up and 3 min of a modified Biering-Sørensen back extension exercise. The mean root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the EMG signal was monitored over 10-s periods with measures normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction rotating curl-up (external obliques), hollowing exercise (LA), or back extension (ULES and LSES). A main effect for group was that triathletes had greater overall activation of the external obliques (p < 0.05), LA (p = 0.01), and LSES (p < 0.05) than did nonrunners. Main effects for exercise type showed that the external obliques had less EMG activity during 60% and 80% runs, respectively, than with the curl-ups (p = 0.001). The back extension exercise provided less ULES (p = 0.009) and LSES (p = 0.0001) EMG activity than the 60% and 80% runs, respectively. In conclusion, triathletes had greater trunk activation than nonrunners did while running, which could have contributed to their better performance. Back-stabilizing muscles can be activated more effectively with running than with a prolonged back extension activity. Running can be considered as an efficient, multifunctional exercise combining cardiovascular and trunk endurance benefits."

The findings evidence for a principal difference of this tachycardia form from paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia by trigger mechanism. All the tests performed showed rhythm-dependence of RNVT, tachycardia cannot be initiated by electrocardiostimulation, but can be stopped after intravenous introduction of finoptin. It is evident that this form of cardiac arrhythmia is due to the mechanism of pathological ectopic automatism represented, most likely, by trigger activity, but not re-entry, as it is in the majority of patients with paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia."

            "abstract": "Fish and amphibians utilise a suction/force pump to ventilate gills or lungs, with the respiratory muscles innervated by cranial nerves, while reptiles have a thoracic, aspiratory pump innervated by spinal nerves. However, fish can recruit a hypobranchial pump for active jaw occlusion during hypoxia, using feeding muscles innervated by anterior spinal nerves. This same pump is used to ventilate the air-breathing organ in air-breathing fishes. Some reptiles retain a buccal force pump for use during hypoxia or exercise. All vertebrates have respiratory rhythm generators (RRG) located in the brainstem. In cyclostomes and possibly jawed fishes, this may comprise elements of the trigeminal nucleus, though in the latter group RRG neurons have been located in the reticular formation. In air-breathing fishes and amphibians, there may be separate RRG for gill and lung ventilation. There is some evidence for multiple RRG in reptiles. Both amphibians and reptiles show episodic breathing patterns that may be centrally generated, though they do respond to changes in oxygen supply. Fish and larval amphibians have chemoreceptors sensitive to oxygen partial pressure located on the gills. Hypoxia induces increased ventilation and a reflex bradycardia and may trigger aquatic surface respiration or air-breathing, though these latter activities also respond to behavioural cues. Adult amphibians and reptiles have peripheral chemoreceptors located on the carotid arteries and central chemoreceptors sensitive to blood carbon dioxide levels. Lung perfusion may be regulated by cardiac shunting and lung ventilation stimulates lung stretch receptors."

A cross over design switched the patients to the other treatment. On the last day of each treatment period blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were determined at rest and during handgrip test.

            "abstract": "Resting heart rate is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and the mortality benefit of some cardiovascular drugs seems to be related in part to their heart rate-lowering effects. Since it is difficult to separate the benefit of heart rate lowering from other actions with currently available drugs, a 'pure' heart rate-lowering drug would be of great interest in establishing the benefit of heart rate reduction per se. Heart rate is determined by spontaneous electrical pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial node. Cardiac pacemaker cells generate the spontaneous slow diastolic depolarisation that drives the membrane voltage away from a hyperpolarised level towards the threshold level for initiating a subsequent action potential, generating rhythmic action potentials that propagate through the heart and trigger myocardial contraction. The I(f) current is an ionic current that determines the slope of the diastolic depolarisation, which in turn controls the heart beating rate. Ivabradine is the first specific heart rate-lowering agent to have completed clinical development for stable angina pectoris. Ivabradine specifically blocks cardiac pacemaker cell f-channels by entering and binding to a site in the channel pore from the intracellular side. Ivabradine is selective for the I(f) current and exerts significant inhibition of this current and heart rate reduction at concentrations that do not affect other cardiac ionic currents. This activity translates into specific heart rate reduction, which reduces myocardial oxygen demand and simultaneously improves oxygen supply, by prolonging diastole and thus allowing increased coronary flow and myocardial perfusion. Ivabradine lowers heart rate without any negative inotropic or lusitropic effect, thus preserving ventricular contractility. Ivabradine was shown to reduce resting heart rate without modifying any major electrophysiological parameters not related to heart rate. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction, ivabradine reduced resting heart rate without altering myocardial contractility. Thus, pure heart rate lowering can be achieved in the clinic as a result of specific and selective I(f) current inhibition. Two randomised clinical studies have shown that ivabradine is an effective anti-ischaemic agent that reduces heart rate and improves exercise capacity in patients with stable angina. Ivabradine was shown to be superior to placebo in improving exercise tolerance test (ETT) criteria (n = 360) and, in a 4-month, double-blind, controlled study (n = 939), ivabradine 5 and 7.5mg twice daily were shown to be at least as effective as atenolol 50 and 100mg once daily, respectively, in improving total exercise duration and other ETT criteria, and reducing the number of angina attacks. Experimental data indicate a potential role of pure heart rate lowering in other cardiovascular conditions, such as heart failure."

Epanolol, a selective beta 1-receptor blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, induced a fall in intraarterial pressure of 8% at rest sitting and 11% during 100 W bicycle exercise after the first dose of 200 mg in 12 patients with essential hypertension. Heart rate, stroke index, and cardiac index initially fell by 14%, 11%, and 23%, respectively. The total peripheral resistance index increased by 21% after 2 hours, and then reverted towards the pretreatment level. After 10 months of epanolol treatment (mean 300 mg/day), the reduction in arterial pressure was 5% at rest and 10% during exercise. Cardiac index and heart rate were still reduced 14-21%, while total peripheral resistance was unchanged or slightly increased (2-10%). Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was higher on epanolol (300 mg/day) than on atenolol (150 mg/day) treatment (137/97 vs. 128/91 mmHg). Thus, the achieved blood pressure reduction induced by epanolol was moderate, while other characteristics of beta-receptor blockade, in particular, the reduction of heart rate and cardiac output, were maintained. This suggests that the compound may be useful for other cardiovascular disorders, e.g., angina pectoris in patients without hypertension or cardiac arrhythmia."

Fourteen sudden death patients, eight males and six females, were studied at autopsy based on apparent sudden cardiac death, without significant anatomical abnormalities. The coding regions of arrhythmia genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and directly sequenced. Three novel RyR2 mutations, R414C, F2331S, and R2401L, were identified in three unrelated patients (two males and one female; mean age at death, 12 +/- 2 years), all performing strenuous activity at the time of death or collapse. These mutations were located in highly conserved regions where arrhythmia-linked RyR2 mutations clustered. Although G269S in the KVLQT1 gene was detected in a female with known family history of syncope and sudden cardiac death, no other mutations were found in any of the 14 cases, and no other mutations was found in 200 controls. The absence of structural cardiac disease in physical activity-induced sudden death and the finding of three novel RyR2 mutations suggest that mutation screening in such cases should include RyR2."

Thus subjects who practise aerobic sports differ principally in terms of variations in inhibitors (low PC in rowers and marathon runners, increased presence of inhibitors in controls).

            "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have identified associations between time of day and risk of sudden cardiac death. The marked peak in the occurrence of sudden cardiac death after awakening suggests that the disease is triggered by changes that occur during this time period. Increased sympathetic stimulation is a likely cause of such triggering. In the light of the circadian variation of sudden cardiac death and the evidence linking physical activity or mental stress (both associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system) to the disease, the role of potential triggering events should be investigated. Controlled studies are needed to determine the relative risk of activities that may trigger sudden cardiac death. Since such studies must rely on witnesses (or resuscitated patients), data quality must be closely scrutinized, and studies using case-control and case-crossover designs are needed. The epidemiological and pathophysiological data reviewed in the present article suggest a number of pathways through which activities may trigger sudden cardiac death. Different extrinsic stimuli may cause similar physiological changes that subsequently lead to acute pathological events, a decrease in the ventricular fibrillation threshold through a direct myocardial effect, or a harmful effect on the conduction system. Myocardial ischemia induced by plaque rupture and thrombosis may lead directly to myocardial electric instability. The presence of chronic structural abnormalities of the myocardial tissue or the conduction system may further lower the threshold for electric instability and ventricular fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by defects in insulin secretion as well as reduced insulin action. During aging, glucose intolerance will gradually develop, and this is manifested primarily by an increase in the postprandial blood glucose response while fasting blood glucose levels are often less elevated. Abnormal beta-cell secretion of insulin is a main feature of this. Treatment of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus focuses on reduction of (hyperglycaemic) complaints and prevention of the development or progression of secondary complications. Although regular physical activity and dietary measures, aiming at bodyweight normalisation, are the cornerstones of therapy, pharmacological treatment with oral blood glucose lowering-agents often proves necessary to control the hyperglycaemia. In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) it was clearly shown that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were intensively treated with oral blood glucose-lowering agents or insulin developed less microvascular complications. The question whether achievement of strict metabolic control is also of benefit in elderly patients, is still unanswered. Sulphonylureas are drugs which stimulate insulin secretion by enhancing the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta-cells without an effect on insulin synthesis. They are frequently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and several preparations are available. In general, there are no major differences in effectiveness between the various sulphonylureas. Long term treatment with sulphonylureas will decrease fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels by 3 to 5 mmol/L, and glycosylated haemoglobin by 20%. However, after its initial decline, plasma glucose level will often go up slightly during the following months to years. Sulphonylureas are usually well tolerated. Hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring adverse effect, which may be very serious and damaging in the elderly. It has been associated primarily with long-acting sulphonylureas, like chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide). Hypoglycaemic episodes may trigger serious events like myocardial infarction or stroke. Therefore, shorter-acting compounds like tolbutamide and gliclazide have been relatively well tolerated and appear to be the best choice to treat elderly patients. It is advisable to start with a low dose and increase the dose, when needed, in small steps. The efficacy of sulphonylureas is much greater when they are taken before a meal. Because of the fact that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease, and residual beta-cell function decreases with time, insulin therapy may ultimately be warranted in a significant number of patients."

Among other \"physiologic\" pacing modes, respiration traced ventricular stimulation showed high physiologic sensitivity (90%) and haemodynamic benefit comparable to that obtained during dual chamber pacing and without the related disadvantages."

            "title": "Tachycardias of right ventricular origin.",
            "abstract": "Ventricular tachycardia arising from the right ventricle usually has a left bundle branch morphology and occurs in a variety of disorders. Uhl's anomaly and right ventricular dysplasia may represent a spectrum of one disorder and are a cause of right heart dilatation, failure, and premature sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmias. Familial forms of the disorder may account for focal clustering in some geographic areas. Management should involve aggressive stratification of arrhythmia risk and may include medical, surgical, or device therapy. In contrast, the syndrome of right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia, including nonischemic exercise-induced and repetitive monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, is a more benign entity. Management often involves beta- and calcium channel blocking drugs or type IC antiarrhythmic drugs. Catheter ablation of the arrhythmia focus in the right ventricular outflow tract has been used in selected patients. In this syndrome the right ventricle is normal, and noninvasive testing as well as electrophysiologic studies can be helpful in distinguishing it from the more malignant right ventricular dysplasia. Ventricular arrhythmias may also be seen after right ventricular incision, as in surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot and ventricular septal defects. Significant ventricular ectopy associated with an abnormal right ventricle (enlarged or depressed systolic function) is associated with an increased risk for sustained arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in this group. The optimal indicator(s) of highest risk in these patients remains under investigation but will likely include electrophysiologic testing. Bifascicular block occurs commonly after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, but is usually benign. Isolated right ventricular infarction is rare. Most right ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischemia occur in the setting of iatrogenic catheter manipulation for pacing or hemodynamic monitoring. In conclusion, right ventricular arrhythmias involve an unusual and interesting group of clinical entities and appear to span the spectrum of arrhythmias mechanisms. A macroreentrant activation ring around the ventriculotomy scar may account for the arrhythmias following repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Microreentry at sites of morphologic abnormalities results in the arrhythmias associated with right ventricular dysplasia and ischemia. Triggered activity related to DADs or, less likely, abnormal automaticity, produce repetitive monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and nonischemic exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia, both of which usually originate from the right ventricular outflow tract. Iatrogenic ventricular tachycardia associated with catheter manipulation is especially likely to occur in the presence of right ventricular ischemia and infarction. It is important to recognize these clinical entities because treatment is specific.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "In this study prophylactic antiarrhythmic effects of verapamil on exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias are evaluated. Investigations were carried out on a total of 22 patients. All patients showed frequent and/or complex ventricular arrhythmias during repeated exercise tests under control conditions. After two control exercise tests all patients were treated with verapamil 120 mg given every 8 hours orally over 4 days. On the 3rd and 4th day of treatment the exercise tests were repeated. Verapamil caused a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias in 13 out of 22 patients. In patients with exercise-induced ST-segment depression a prophylactic action could be demonstrated in 9 out of 10 cases. The antiarrhythmic effect was independent of changes in heart rate. A reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption and direct electrophysiological effects (suppression of the 'slow response' and/or an increase in the resting potential of the 'depressed fast response') can be considered, as well as a suppression of 'triggered activity' or a direct inhibition of adrenergic effects. Calcium antagonists (type verapamil) prove to be suitable drugs for the treatment of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias in patients with myocardial ischaemia."

            "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of obesity in the industrialized world is causing an alarming epidemic. Almost 70% of American adults are overweight or obese. The link between increasing body weight and hypertension is well established. Obesity hypertension through metabolic, endocrinic, and systemic hemodynamic alteration causes structural vascular and cardiac adaptations that trigger concentric, eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy and electrophysiological changes, which may increase the risk for congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death as a result of arrhythmias. The increased renal blood flow in conjunction with a decreased renal vascular resistance causes renal hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration. Such changes lead to glomerulomegaly, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and fibrosis that characterize the renal damage in obese hypertensive subjects. We propose that weight reduction, with the addition of other nonpharmacological approaches that included exercise and reduction in alcohol intake, should be the first choice to treat obesity hypertension. Salt restriction may be helpful only in salt-sensitive patients. The benefits of diet in obese patients include improvement of insulin sensitivity, reduction in sympathetic nervous and renin angiotensin system activities, and restoration of leptin sensitivity. As a consequence of these and other metabolic changes, the previously described systemic and renal hemodynamic alterations improved and the cardiovascular and renal morphological changes induced by obesity were lessened. After reviewing the medications available, we believe that owing to the cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality that characterized obesity hypertension, the ACEI or ARBs offer the best cardio-renal protection and should be the pharmacologic treatment of choice. If these alone do not control BP adequately, then a low-dose diuretic should be added as a second approach. Although we strongly believe in our proposal, more multicenter long-term clinical pharmacological trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the antihypertensive approaches in the treatment of obesity hypertension."

            "abstract": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a heritable arrhythmia unmasked by exertion or stress and is characterized by triggered activity and sudden cardiac death. In this study, we simulated mutations in 2 genes linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, the first located in calsequestrin (CSQN2) and the second in the ryanodine receptor (RyR2). The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanistic basis for spontaneous Ca2+ release events that lead to delayed afterdepolarizations in affected patients. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) luminal Ca2+ sensing was incorporated into a model of the human ventricular myocyte, and CSQN2 mutations were modeled by simulating disrupted RyR2 luminal Ca2+ sensing. In voltage-clamp mode, the mutant CSQN2 model recapitulated the smaller calcium transients, smaller time to peak calcium transient, and accelerated recovery from inactivation seen in experiments. In current clamp mode, in the presence of beta stimulation, we observed delayed afterdepolarizations, suggesting that accelerated recovery of RyR2 induced by impaired luminal Ca2+ sensing underlies the triggered activity observed in mutant CSQN2-expressing myocytes. In current-clamp mode, in a model of mutant RyR2 that is characterized by reduced FKBP12.6 binding to the RyR2 on beta stimulation, the impaired coupled gating characteristic of these mutations was modeled by reducing cooperativity of RyR2 activation. In current-clamp mode, the mutant RyR2 model exhibited increased diastolic RyR2 open probability that resulted in formation of delayed afterdepolarizations. In conclusion, these minimal order models of mutant CSQN2 and RyR2 provide plausible mechanisms by which defects in RyR2 gating may lead to the cellular triggers for arrhythmia, with implications for the development of targeted therapy."

Thus, we measured muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in response to +30 Torr neck pressure (NP) and -30 Torr neck suction (NS) delivered for 20 s either as a sustained or pulsatile stimulus. CBR-mediated changes in MSNA, HR and MAP were similar with sustained and pulsatile stimuli. The time course of MSNA and HR responses identified that significant changes occurred during the initial 5 s and were better maintained over 20 s with NP than with NS. Changes in MAP exhibited a slower onset with the peak increase during NP occurring at 10 s (sustained, 7 +/- 1 mmHg; pulsatile, 7 +/- 1 mmHg; P > 0.05) and the nadir during NS occurring at 20 s (sustained, -7 +/- 1 mmHg; pulsatile, -9 +/- 2 mmHg; P > 0.05). These data demonstrate that sustained and pulsatile NP and NS produce comparable CBR-mediated responses. Furthermore, despite MSNA and HR returning towards baseline during NS, CBR-mediated changes in MAP are well maintained over 20 s of NS and NP."

In the present study the role of the central endorphin system in the cardiovascular responses to spontaneous exercise in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR was investigated. The experimental design allowed us to record mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) continuously for more than 1 week without interfering with the daily activities of the animals. They were active in running wheels during the dark period (19.00-07.00 h) and the activity was accompanied by a marked rise in HR. In SHR, a clear depression of blood pressure lasting for about for about 50 min was noted following each running period. The MAP during the post-running depression was 131.4 +/- 1.6 mmHg which was significantly lower than the pre-running control value (145.2 +/- 2.3 mmHg, P less than 0.01). In contrast, MAP in the post-running period in WKY was not significantly different from the pre-running values. In addition, the depression period of SHR had a mean post-running length of 49.7 +/- 3.4 min, which is significantly longer than in the WKYs (37.8 +/- 3.5 min, P less than 0.05). In control rats, naloxone infusion had no effect on blood pressure but a marked bradycardia was observed. In nine running SHR receiving a naloxone infusion, their MAP during the depression period was not different from the control pressure. Our study indicates that endorphin systems are involved in the regulating of blood pressure and HR during muscle exercise in SHR. These systems trigger the transient depression of blood pressure observed immediately after a running period in the SHR."

The purpose of the study was to compare cardiac structure and function among athletes of various sports and sedentary controls. Standard transthoracic two-dimensional M-mode and Doppler echocardiography was performed at rest in Caucasian male canoe/kayak paddlers (n = 9), long distance runners (LDR, n = 18), middle distance runners (MDR, n = 17), basketball players (BP, n = 31), road cyclists (n = 8), swimmers (n = 10), strength/power athletes (n = 9) of similar age (range, 15 to 31 yrs), training experience (4 to 9 years), and age-matched healthy male sedentary controls (n = 15). Absolute interventricular septum (IVS) thickness and LV wall thickness, but not LV diameter, were greater in athletes than sedentary controls. Left ventricular mass of all athletes but relative wall thickness of only BP, swimmers, cyclists, and strength/power athletes were higher as compared with controls (p < 0.05). Among athletes, smaller IVS thickness was observed in MDR than BP, cyclists, swimmers or strength/power athletes, while LDR had higher body size-adjusted LV diameter as compared to BP, cyclists and strength/power athletes. In conclusion, relative LV diameter was increased in long distance runners as compared with basketball players, cyclists, and strength/power athletes. Basketball, road cycling, strength/power, and swimming training were associated with increased LV concentricity as compared with paddling or distance running. Key pointsThe type of cardiac hypertrophy seems to be only moderately exercise-specific.Long-distance runners develop larger left ventricular dilation as compared with basketball players, cyclists, and strength/power athletes.Myocardial wall thickening is triggered by different sporting activities that involve large muscle groups."

A multivariate analysis yielded a twofold risk of myocardial infarction during physical exertion, statistically independently of time of day. 7.1% of patients had engaged in exertional physical activity at onset of the event, as opposed to 3.9% of control subjects. The case-crossover analysis demonstrated a relative risk of 2.1 (1.6-3.1) of exertional physical activity within 1 hour prior to myocardial infarction. Patients whose average frequency of physical exertion was < 4 versus > or = to 4 times per week had relative risks of 6.9 versus 1.3 (p < 0.01).

Basal levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone were greater in the IF rats. However, in contrast to large stress-induced increases in ACTH, corticosterone and epinephrine levels in AL rats, increases in these hormones in response to repeated immobilization stress sessions were reduced or absent in IF rats.

Usually they are assumed to have a benign prognosis, although they do very occasionally present with ventricular fibrillation (VF) as the first manifestation of the syndrome. Discovering a WPW pattern in a previously asymptomatic athlete on a routine electrocardiogram (ECG) identifies the necessity for more accurate screening tests. However, non-invasive methods (Holter monitoring, exercise treadmill testing) seem to be relatively incomplete for risk stratification, especially for athletes. Current guidelines do not always recommend a routine electrophysiological study (EPS) in patients with an asymptomatic WPW ECG pattern, especially in children younger than 12 years. Individuals who engage in high-risk occupations or those patients who have a pre-excitation pattern which precludes them from following their chosen career or activities may be exceptions. The presence of inducible reciprocating tachycardia during EPS, especially when it triggers atrial fibrillation with short RR interval, can represent a specific risk marker of dangerous arrhythmias."

This study sought to evaluate the possible association between the occurrence of out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and daily PM levels in the Seattle metropolitan area. The underlying hypothesis was that PM exposure may act as a cardiovascular trigger for SCA. A case-crossover study was conducted among 362 SCA cases identified by paramedics from October 1988 through June 1994. Cases were King County WA residents who were married, aged 25 to 74 years at the time of their SCA, with no prior history of clinically recognized heart disease or other life-threatening comorbid conditions. Daily averages of regional PM monitoring data for nephelometry measures of PM (reported in units of bsp, referred to as coefficient of light scattering) and PM10 (particulate matter 10 microm or smaller in aerodynamic diameter) from three monitoring sites were used as indicators of exposure. In the case-crossover analysis, PM levels during index times of cases within the five days preceding an SCA were compared with PM levels at referent days, defined as the same days of the week during the month of SCA occurrence. Lag periods for index days of 0 to 5 days were investigated. The estimated relative risk (RR) at a lag of 1 day for an interquartile range (IQR) change in nephelometry (0.51 bsp) was 0.893 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.779-1.024). Varying the lag period had only minimal change on the observed association. The estimated relative risk at a lag of 1 day for an IQR change of PM10 (19.3 microg/m3) was 0.868 (95% CI 0.744-1.012). There was no evidence of confounding by ambient daily exposures to carbon monoxide or sulfur dioxide. Analysis of effect modification by individual-level variables, including age, cigarette smoke exposure, physical activity, and other risk or protective factors for cardiovascular disease did not reveal any susceptible subgroups. The null results of this study may be due to several factors; these include: the highly selected nature of this SCA case series; the fact that cases were free of prior clinically recognized heart disease or major life-threatening comorbidity; and the possibility that PM exposures at the relatively low levels seen in the Seattle metropolitan area do not trigger cardiovascular toxic mechanisms that culminate in SCA."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Depression and poor social support are significant risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), and stress and anxiety can trigger coronary events. People experiencing such psychosocial difficulties are more likely to be physically inactive, which is also an independent risk factor for CHD. Resilience training can target these risk factors, but there is little research evaluating the effectiveness of such programs. This paper describes the design and measures of a study to evaluate a resilience training program (READY) to promote psychosocial well-being for heart health, and the added value of integrating physical activity promotion.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      In a cluster randomized trial, 95 participants will be allocated to either a waitlist or one of two intervention conditions. Both intervention conditions will receive a 10 x 2.5 hour group resilience training program (READY) over 13 weeks. The program targets five protective factors identified from empirical evidence and analyzed as mediating variables: positive emotions, cognitive flexibility, social support, life meaning, and active coping. Resilience enhancement strategies reflect the six core Acceptance and Commitment Therapy processes (values, mindfulness, defusion, acceptance, self-as-context, committed action) and Cognitive Behavior Therapy strategies such as relaxation training and social support building skills. Sessions include psychoeducation, discussions, experiential exercises, and home assignments. One intervention condition will include an additional session and ongoing content promoting physical activity. Measurement will occur at baseline, two weeks post intervention, and at eight weeks follow-up, and will include questionnaires, pedometer step logs, and physical and hematological measures. Primary outcome measures will include self-reported indicators of psychosocial well-being and depression. Secondary outcome measures will include self-reported indicators of stress, anxiety and physical activity, and objective indicators of CHD risk (blood glucose, cholesterol [mmol.L-1], triglycerides, blood pressure). Process measures of attendance, engagement and fidelity will also be conducted. Linear analyses will be used to examine group differences in the outcome measures, and the product of coefficients method will be used to examine mediated effects.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      If successful, this program will provide an innovative means by which to promote psychosocial well-being for heart health in the general population.

            "abstract": "The environment of children has drastically changed in Europe during the last decades as reflected in unhealthy dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle. Nutrition obviously plays a part in the development of overweight in childhood. However, dietary factors and physical activity are also involved in the development of metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, and postural deformities like scoliosis, effects related in part to excessive weight gain. To stop the resulting epidemic of diet- and lifestyle-induced morbidity, efficient evidence-based approaches are needed. These issues are the focus of IDEFICS (Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants), a five-year project proposed under the sixth EU framework. The IDEFICS consortium comprises 25 research centres and SMEs across Europe. The planned prospective study will identify risk profile inventories for children susceptible to any of these disorders with emphasis on obesity and its co-morbid conditions. Genetic and non-genetic factors, psychosocial factors and social settings will be considered. The project will devise tailored prevention strategies that are effective, easy to implement and that account for the needs of different social groups. Population-based studies will investigate the impact of sensory perception and provide results concerning internal and external triggers of food choices and children's consumer behaviour. The ethical implications of a \"right not to know\" of genetic factors will be addressed. We will propose knowledge-based guidelines on dietary and lifestyle activities for health promotion and disease prevention in children for health professionals, stakeholders and consumers."

Eight men with experience in the recreational use of MDMA participated in four 10-h experimental sessions with a 1-week washout period. Single oral doses of 125 mg and 75 mg of MDMA, 40 mg of amphetamine, and placebo were given. Both MDMA doses significantly increased blood pressure (increases of 40 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure), heart rate (increases of 30 beats/min), and pupillary diameter (mydriasis) as compared with placebo. Oral temperature did not show significant changes in any drug-active condition. Plasma cortisol levels showed a statistically significant increase after MDMA administration. Prolactin levels only increased after high dose of MDMA. Cmax values for 125-mg and 75-mg MDMA doses were 236.4 and 130.9 ng/ml, and Tmax was observed at 2.4 and 1.8 h, respectively. Elimination half-life was 8.6 h and 7.7 h for high and low MDMA doses, respectively. Amphetamine half-life was 15 h. Between 8 and 9% of the doses of MDMA appeared in plasma in the form of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine. The important cardiovascular effects observed after MDMA administration in laboratory conditions at rest (increases of 40 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 30 beats/min in pulse rate) could be relevant in terms of toxicity in real-life conditions (e.g., crowded places and physical activity)."

            "abstract": "Drug-induced delayed cardiac protection (DCP) against the effects of acute myocardial ischemia was first described 22 years ago by the author and his coworkers. It can be initiated by noninjurious pharmacological doses of prostacyclin (PGI2), its stable analogues, and by catecholamines. DCP protects against many consequences of ischemia, attenuating early morphological changes, limiting infarct size and suppressing arrhythmias, and can also protect against ouabain intoxication. DCP operates under a variety of pathological conditions (atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolaemia, and diabetes). DCP can also be evoked by transient myocardial ischemia and by exercise and is known in this context as \"ischemic preconditioning\", specifically the \"second window of protection\"; transient ischemia also evokes an immediate but short-lived protection known as \"classical preconditioning\". DCP is fundamentally different in concept to conventional drug therapy because the process appears to depend on the duration of the trigger and be related in a bell-shaped manner to the strength of the trigger. The exact mechanism is uncertain. Prolongation of the effective refractory period (ERP) and of the action potential duration (APD) may contribute to DCP suppression of arrhythmias. The protection is time and dose dependent, with optimal effects 24 to 48 hr after treatment. It can be sustained by intermittent administration of low maintenance doses. Stimulation of the adenylate-cyclase/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system appears to be a common feature of DCP. Responses to beta-adrenergic stimuli are also diminished. Cardiac cAMP triggers the induction of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 1 and 4 isoforms and of Na/K-ATPase. Increased amount and activity of PDE isoforms subsequently reduces excess myocardial cAMP production. Changes in Na/K-ATPase moderate ischemic myocardial potassium loss, sodium, and calcium accumulation, as well as the toxicity of ouabain. The future therapeutic challenge is to identify new drugs that can mimic DCP."

Central hemodynamic values (Swan-Ganz catheter) as well as free plasma catecholamines noradrenaline and adrenaline were simultaneously determined at rest and during incremental exercise. At rest, no significant differences were observed between all groups. The cardiac patients with normal central hemodynamics also did not show any significant differences in their plasma catecholamine responses during exercise as compared with healthy control subjects. Patients with impaired left-ventricular contractility, indicated by a significantly increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as reference value of increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, both with negative and positive indicators of coronary insufficiency during exercise, showed significantly higher noradrenaline levels at identical work loads than control subjects. However, adrenaline responses were only significantly higher in patients with positive indicators of coronary insufficiency during exercise. The noradrenergic responses may be triggered by a borderline reduction of cardiac output as well as by increased pressures in the low-pressure system. The over-proportional adrenergic responses may be an indicator of precordial anginal pain and anxiety. This reaction is seen to be significant for a further increase in myocardial oxygen demands and anginal pain."

            "abstract": "The cardiovascular response to coitus and the risk of an acute cardiac event related to sexual activity is of clinical importance, especially now that effective pharmacologic treatment of male erectile dysfunction permits older men to resume active sex lives. Early studies by Masters and Johnson of young subjects engaging in coitus in laboratory settings reported that heart rates and systolic blood pressures were at near maximum exercise levels. Subsequent data from studies by Hellerstein and Friedman and by Stein in men with coronary artery disease, using ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings during coitus at home, demonstrated significantly lower heart rate and blood pressure responses to coitus. The associated myocardial oxygen demand of coitus in these men was found to in the range of moderate activities, often achieved or exceeded during their workday. The cardiovascular risk of coitus was addressed in the recent ONSET study in which myocardial infarction (MI) patients were interviewed shortly after their MI about potential triggering activities or events. Coitus was noted to represent a very low absolute risk of being a trigger for MI, but had an increased relative risk of 2.5 for the subjects in their study. Sexual intercourse will, in most men, represent only a moderate \"stress\" on the heart in terms of the responses that impact on myocardial oxygen requirement (heart rates, and systolic blood pressure). In patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis, coitus, compared with vigorous physical activity and intense emotional responses, represents a small risk of triggering an acute MI."

A within patient randomized, double-blind crossover study involving ten patients, mean age 67.4 years (70% male), had Medtronic Legend Plus dual sensor VVIR pacemakers implanted for high grade AV block and chronic or persistent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Performance values were compared to 20 healthy control subjects of a similar age and gender. Patients were both subjectively and objectively assessed after 2 weeks of out-of-hospital activity in VVIR mode (minute ventilation sensing), VVIR mode (activity sensing), VVIR mode (dual sensor), and VVI mode (no rate response). All patients were assessed for subjective preference for, and objective improvement in, any pacing modality as assessed by standardized daily activity protocols and graded exercise treadmill testing. Subjective perception of exercise capacity and functional status was significantly lower in VVI mode (P < 0.05) compared to any of the VVIR modes, which did not differ. After completion of the study 70% of patients chose VVIR as their preferred mode, with 30% expressing no preference. Forty percent preferred activity sensor VVIR mode pacing, 30% preferred dual sensor VVIR mode pacing, and 70% found either dual sensor VVIR mode, minute ventilation sensor VVIR mode, or both modalities least acceptable. No patient found activity sensing VVIR mode least acceptable. Graded treadmill testing revealed significantly lower exercise tolerance during VVI mode pacing (P < 0.01) compared to the VVIR modalities, which did not differ. Overall, chronotropic response was best with dual sensor pacing during standardized daily activity protocols and during the standard car journey. The data from this study suggest that there is no marked clinical advantage obtained from the use of dual sensor devices over current activity sensing ventricular demand rate responsive pacemakers, but with the probable added disadvantages of increased size, complexity, cost, and decreased longevity."

However, optimizing settings for these devices often entails treadmill exercise testing. To assess simpler procedures for predicting appropriate settings, pacing rates of \"strapped-on\" and implanted Activitrax pacemakers were evaluated during arm exercise, walk-in-place exercise and treadmill exercise (0% slope at 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mph). For exercise of similar duration, steady-state pacing rates of implanted devices during arm and walk-in-place exercise were lower than those achieved during treadmill exercise. Linear regression analysis resulted in the slope of these relations most closely approaching 1.0 for arm exercise at \"low\" activity threshold, while walk-in-place tended to result in slopes approaching 1.0 at all activity thresholds. Similarly, although strapped-on devices underestimated rates obtained with implanted devices, differences fell within a narrow range (-6 to -14%). Thus, in patients with implanted or strapped-on Activitrax pacemakers, relatively simple exercise procedures suitable for office or clinic environment may be useful to provide an estimate of pacing rates during physical activity, and may thereby facilitate selection of appropriate programmable settings."

            "abstract": "We encountered a 40-year-old man with recurrent symptomatic palpitations manifested as monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) of a right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern with an inferior frontal axis. Physical examination, chest roentgenogram, and echocardiogram were unremarkable. The VT could be provoked by treadmill exercise testing. Electrophysiologic study revealed that the VT could be reproducibly initiated with either atrial or ventricular pacing at cycle lengths between 500 and 400 ms. With overdrive ventricular pacing, the VT could be terminated. Of note was the observation that intravenous adenosine was not effective, but intravenous verapamil could interrupt the VT. The VT was pace mapped to be arising from a site at the left ventricular outlet tract (LVOT). Notably, during pace mapping, the pacing spike was immediately followed by the beginning of the paced QRS complex, and during VT, there was no time delay between the earliest local activation and the onset of QRS complex. Furthermore, there was no mid-diastolic activity or Purkinje potential that could be recorded during sinus rhythm and VT. Subsequently, the VT was successfully ablated with radiofrequency energy as guided by pace mapping. In summary, an idiopathic VT arising from the LVOT was found to be cycle lengths- and catecholamine-dependent, adenosine-insensitive but verapamil responsive. These unusual features suggest that either microreentry or triggered activity could be the underlying mechanism."

An adequate increase in heart rate, irrespective of atrioventricular synchronization, seems to be the most important denominator for cardiac output and exercise tolerance. Atrioventricular synchronization will add some hemodynamic benefit, which is most pronounced at rest. The importance of a rate-adaptive atrioventricular delay and a normalized ventricular activation sequence remains, however, to be fully established. Myocardial oxygen consumption does not differ during fixed rate ventricular pacing, atrial synchronous or non-synchronous rate-adaptive ventricular pacing, neither at rest nor during exercise, despite a higher cardiac output during the rate-adaptive modes. This indicates a more \"economic\" cardiac work with rate-adaptive pacing. Fixed rate ventricular pacing, on the other hand, may have negative long-term effects on myocardial function due to an increased cardiac sympathetic activity compared with rate-adaptive ventricular pacing, in particular during exercise. It is concluded that the majority of pacemaker-dependent patients will benefit from restored rate variability, with the atrial electrogram still being the most appropriate trigger for rate-adaptive ventricular pacing. When the atrial signal cannot be used or when it is unreliable, however, other rate-triggering signals can be used with comparable results regarding hemodynamics and exercise tolerance."

            "abstract": "The recognition that the onset of cardiovascular events follows a circadian periodicity and is frequently triggered by physical or mental stresses has created new possibilities for disease prevention. Morning peaks in occurrence are now well-documented for acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, transient myocardial ischemia, and ischemic stroke. The morning increase in events begins after subjects assume an upright posture and start the day's activities, during a time of sympathetic nervous system activation. Additional triggers of onset include heavy physical exertion, sexual activity, and anger, the risks of which have been quantified in the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study. A general hypothesis of the triggering of coronary thrombosis has been proposed. The process begins with the development of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which may become disrupted by internal forces or by external hemodynamic or vasoconstrictive changes. Once disrupted, the plaque becomes a thrombogenic focus. An occlusive thrombus is more likely to form if other factors come into play to increase coagulability and vasoconstriction. From a clinical standpoint these findings provide theoretical support for the use of long-acting agents to provide adequate anti-ischemic protection during the higher risk morning hours in patients already taking anti-ischemic medications. From a research standpoint this new information on triggering provides clues to a mechanism of onset that might lead to more effective preventive therapy. Because most deaths from coronary artery disease occur before any type of acute therapy can be given, further efforts to explore this new field are warranted."

            "abstract": "More than 90% of all sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) during downhill skiing, the most popular winter sport world-wide, are attributed to men over the age of 34. However, no data exist on additional risk factors and triggers for SCD related to downhill skiing. Therefore risk factor profiles of 68 males who died from SCD during downhill skiing were compared to those of 204 matched controls. Skiers who suffered SCD had much more frequently prior myocardial infarction (MI) (41% vs. 1.5%; p<0.001), hypertension (50% vs. 17%; p<0.001), known coronary heart disease (CHD) without prior MI (9% vs. 3%; p=0.05) and were less engaged in strenuous exercise (4% vs. 15%; p<0.05) when compared to controls. Multivariate analyses even enhanced the importance of these risk factors. Downhill skiing is considered to be a serious trigger for SCD especially in skiers with prior MI but also for those with hypertension, known CHD without prior MI, or insufficient adaptation to strenuous exercise. Skiing-related increased sympathetic activity might well disturb the autonomic balance with subsequent arrhythmias and/or may increase cardiac work and platelet aggregability with possible plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis. Therefore adaptation to high intensity exercise and therapeutic interventions or abstinence from skiing in certain cases should be considered for downhill skiers at high risk."

Endocavitary investigation showed a concealed atrioventricular accessory pathway during sinus rhythm with anterograde 1/1 conduction up to 270/min; retrograde conduction was not so good with block occurring at 175/min. The spontaneous tachycardia was reproduced by catecholamine infusion: it was an antidromic reciprocating rhythm triggered by a ventricular extrasystole of identical form to that of a pure preexcitation complex and to that of the tachycardia complexes. Spontaneous termination of attacks always occurred when conduction from the ventricle to the atria stopped. The attacks could be induced by ventricular extrastimuli when they caused an increment in retrograde conduction time resulting from retrograde conduction up the nodohisian pathway and not the Kent bundle. The tachycardia could also be initiated by atrial extrastimuli providing pure pre-excitation could be obtained. In both cases, retrograde conduction of the nodohisian pathway had to be improved by catecholamines. When the patient was given betablocker therapy the attacks of tachycardia completely disappeared. The association of ventricular extrasystoles and antidromic reciprocating rhythm and their morphological identity suggest that these extrasystoles were in fact automatic activity of the Kent bundle. Escape phenomena as signs of passive automatism have been described in this conditions but, to our knowledge, extrasystoles suggesting an active automatic process have not been previously reported."

            "abstract": "Clinical and pathologic studies have confirmed that disruption or superficial erosion of atherosclerotic plaque is the major cause of coronary thrombosis, which is the primary mechanism responsible for acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. Serial angiographic studies have shown that nearly 60-70% of acute coronary syndromes evolve from mildly to moderately obstructive atherosclerotic plaques. The risk of plaque disruption appears to be a function of both plaque vulnerability (intrinsic factors) and extrinsic triggers, and is determined largely by the size of the lipid-rich atheromatous core, the thickness of the fibrous cap covering the core, and the presence of ongoing inflammation within and underneath the cap. Hemodynamic or mechanical stresses may precipitate plaque disruption, particularly in places where the fibrous cap is weakest, such as the shoulders. The degree of thrombosis following plaque disruption depends on the thrombogenicity of the disrupted plaque, the disturbed local rheology, and the systemic thrombotic-thrombolytic milieu. Surges in sympathetic activity (such as those provoked by sudden vigorous exercise, emotional stress, or cold weather) may also trigger plaque disruption. These observations have led to the concept of plaque stabilization as a new strategy for the prevention of acute coronary syndromes. Plaque stabilization can be achieved through pharmacologic and lifestyle-modifying interventions that alter plaque composition and/or inflammatory activity within the plaque and thus reduce its vulnerability to disruption."

ADR is an anti-neoplastic agent with notorious cardiotoxicity, most likely because it increases oxidative stress. ET and/or ADR treatment can induce metabolic and signaling alterations affording cross-tolerance against several insults such as ischemia and reperfusion. The objective of the present work was to investigate whether heart mitochondria isolated from rats submitted to ET with or without ADR treatment were more or less susceptible to in vitro anoxia-reoxygenation (AR) when compared with control rats. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were assigned into four groups (n = 6 each): control (C), ADR 20 mg-kg-1), 14 wk ET (T), and T+ADR. Respiratory parameters and oxidative damage were determined before and after 1 min anoxia followed by 4 min reoxygenation. Basal heat shock proteins (HSPs)60 and -70 and antioxidant enzymes' activity were measured. ADR by itself decreased state 3 and respiratory control ratio (RCR), as opposed to ET by itself, which improved state 3 and RCR. As expected, AR impaired state 3 and 4, RCR, and ADP/O in the C group (p > 0.05). In the ADR group, AR did not induce any alteration in RCR and in ADP/O values. ET in the absence of ADR treatment prevented the impairment in RCR and ADP/O and in state 4 induced by AR. Also, despite the fact that state 3 respiration after AR was lower in all groups, it was significantly higher in the T than in the C group. Increased mitochondrial carbonyls and malondialdehyde (MDA) after AR were only found in the C group. Also, following AR, both carbonyls and MDA levels were lower in the T and in the T+ADR than in C and ADR groups, respectively. HSP60 levels were higher in the ADR, T, and T+ADR than in the C group (2.5- fold, 2-fold, and 1.9-fold increase, respectively). HSP70 increased twofold in the T and T+ADR groups. ET augmented 1.5-fold the activity of superoxide dismutase. The present work demonstrates that both ET and ADR treatment induced myocardial alterations that interfere with in vitro mitochondrial responses to AR."

There is a graded relationship with the amount of physical activity (or physical fitness), with some evidence that an asymptote is reached in the mid-range. Epidemiological studies have also shown that physically inactive individuals are at greater risk of developing hypertension or non-insulin-dependent diabetes or of experiencing a stroke, but less is known about the nature of these relationships. The effects of exercise on blood pressure, glucose/insulin dynamics and lipoprotein metabolism may contribute to the lower risk of these diseases in people who exercise regularly. Long-term adaptations to regular exercise may result in improved insulin sensitivity and in higher serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated in part by improved weight regulation. However, the residual effects of individual exercise bouts may, cumulatively, also be important; these \"acute' effects may be enhanced when functional capacity is increased through training. More intensive exercise may carry greater benefits in some respects, but it also carries higher risks, for example of orthopaedic injury or triggering of heart attack. Consequently, public health policies should aim to foster a long-lasting commitment to increased levels of frequent, moderate-intensity activity in as many people as possible."

Iloprost administration resulted in reduced platelet aggregation at peak exercise in all patients, whether they had consistent or little response to the drug.

Application of LBPP during the first 15 or last 15 min of exercise increased mean arterial blood pressure, plasma lactate concentration, and minute ventilation, indicating an activation of the muscle metaboreflex. These changes were rapidly reversed when LBPP was removed. During exercise at this intensity, LBPP augmented the release of arginine vasopressin and catecholamines but not of plasma renin activity.

            "abstract": "Various types of Cl- currents have been recorded in cardiac myocytes from different regions of the heart and in different species. With few exceptions, most of these currents are not active under basal conditions, but are activated under the influence of various agonists and by physical stress. These channels are distributed nonuniformly, depending on the cell type, tissue and region of the heart. Therefore, Cl- current activation may influence membrane potential and impulse formation differently in different cells, and may play a role in arrhythmogenesis. Among these Cl- currents, the protein kinase A-activated Cl- current (I Cl.PKA), the stretch- or swelling-activated Cl- current (I Cl.SWELL) and the Ca(2+)-activated Cl current (I Cl.Ca) comprise the major anion currents that modify cardiac electrical activity. These currents exhibit outward-going rectification, or are predominantly activated at depolarized voltages and, thus, contribute significantly to shortening of the action potential duration but little to diastolic depolarization. The action potential shortening by Cl- current activation may not only perpetuate reentry by shortening the refractory period in a reentry pathway, but may also prevent the development of early afterdepolarization and triggered activity caused by the prolongation of action potentials. I Cl.Ca contributes to delayed afterdepolarization at diastolic potentials in Ca(2+)-overloaded cells. Another factor limiting the influence of Cl- currents on diastolic potentials is the presence of a predominantly opposing background K+ current, except at the nodal regions that lack these K+ channels, or under conditions of decreased K+ conductance. Therefore, the contribution of Cl- currents to the genesis of arrhythmias may depend on their association with the conductance of other ions, especially that of K+."

Published data and the results obtained in 8 healthy subjects (mean age 23 years) studied before and after acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade with pindolol (nonselective, 10 mg) and metoprolol (beta 1-receptor selective, 100 mg) suggest that the differences in the cardiovascular and respiratory effects between the 2 types of antagonists are marginal and cannot explain the discrepancies concerning exercise perception and performance. Conversely, basic differences between the 2 types of antagonists were shown in different groups of hypertensive men (mean age 32 years) studied before and after 4 weeks of treatment with pindolol (15 mg), and with metoprolol (200 mg) and acebutolol (cardioselective, 500 mg), by single crossover technique. Whereas lipolysis was similarly inhibited by both selective and non-selective antagonists, hypoglycaemia occurred only under non-selective blockade. It apparently reflects the inhibition of glycogen breakdown; concomitant rises in plasma adrenaline and ACTH probably reflect counter-regulatory mechanisms."

            "title": "Pathophysiology of heart failure.",
            "abstract": "Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in Western countries. Common etiology is mostly represented by ischemic and hypertensive heart disease. Clinically, heart failure can be defined as an impaired cardiac performance, unable to meet the energy requirements of the periphery. Pathophysiologically, the clinical onset of heart failure symptoms already represents an advanced stage of disease when compensatory mechanisms triggered by the underlying decrease in contractility are no longer capable of maintaining adequate cardiac performance during exercise and, subsequently, under resting conditions. Independent of its underlying etiology, cardiac failure is always characterized by an impairment in the intrinsic contractility of myocytes. As a consequence of reduced contractility, a number of central and peripheral compensatory mechanisms take place that are capable of effectively counteracting reduced intravascular intrinsic performance for a long period of time. Among them, recruitment of preload reserve, enhanced neurohormonal stimulation and cardiac hypertrophy are the most important. All of them, however, also carry unfavorable effects that contribute to further deterioration of cardiac function. In fact, increased end-diastolic volume determines increased wall stress that further reduces systolic performance; sympathetic and angiotensin stimulation increases peripheral resistance and contributes to increase volume expansion; hypertrophic myocytes demonstrate impaired intrinsic contractility and relaxation, and hypertrophy causes a clinically relevant deterioration of ventricular relaxation and compliance that substantially participates in increased end-diastolic pressure, and, therefore, to limited exercise performance. Diastolic dysfunction usually accompanies systolic dysfunction, although in some cases it may represent the prevalent mechanism of congestive heart failure in patients in whom systolic performance is preserved. Biological causes of reduced contractility in heart failure are not completely elucidated. Changes in myosin composition and in sarcoplasmic ATPase activity, causing reduced Ca2+ availability during contraction, have been reported, although their exact contribution is not clear. Recently, impaired endothelial function has also been described in heart failure, and new appealing hypotheses have been made regarding the causative role of circulating cytokines like tumor necrosis factor in the pathogenesis of heart failure."

As a result, patients with CHF gauge quality of life in terms of symptom-free activities they can undertake. Physicians attempt to alleviate these limiting symptoms and increase the exercise capacity of patients with CHF by therapeutic interventions. In recent years a variety of systemic vasodilators and inotropic agents have been introduced to aid digitalis and diuretics in improving cardiac performance in patients with CHF. Although the pumping function of the heart is enhanced at rest, it remains to be determined whether exercise tolerance is also improved. In this paper we review our clinical experience with a number of systemic vasodilators and positive inotropic agents, focusing particular attention on their influence on exercise performance in patients with CHF. This experience includes (1) 28-week double-blind study of hydralazine vs placebo in 19 patients with CHF, (2) 52-week double-blind crossover study of trimazosin (alpha 1 blockade) vs placebo in 27 patients with CHF of varying severity, and (3) open study of amrinone (positive inotropic agent) in 12 patients with CHF."

Eighteen patients (14 men and 4 women, aged 70 +/- 6.5 years) implanted with a dual chamber, dual sensor pacemaker for CAVB with normal sinus node chronotropic function were studied. A quality-of-life and cardiovascular symptom questionnaire, and a treadmill exercise test were completed after a period of VVIR and a period of DDD pacing, each lasting 1 month. Overall quality-of-life and cardiovascular symptoms did not significantly differ, though three patients felt discomfort during VVIR mode. There was no significant statistical difference in cardiopulmonary parameters. DDD and VVIR modes yielded the following respective data: maximum heart rate = 105.7 +/- 21.8 beats/minute versus 107.6 +/- 21.6 beats/minute (NS); maximum workload = 60 +/- 33.4 W versus 59.3 +/- 37.8 W (NS); treadmill duration = 10.1 +/- 3.8 minute versus 10.1 +/- 3.6 minute (NS); oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold = 14.6 +/- 4.1 mL/kg per minute versus 14.9 +/- 4.6 mL/kg per minute (NS); maximum minute ventilation = 49.6 +/- 9L/min versus 46 +/- 12 L/min (NS); and respiratory quotient = 1.08 +/- 0.15 versus 1.08 +/- 0.13 (NS). We conclude that, during a 1-month follow-up period, no difference was found between DDD and dual sensor VVIR (QT and activity) pacing modes in CAVB patients with regard to quality-of-life and cardiopulmonary performance, though a trend toward an increased sense of well being was noted with the DDD mode."

Aspirin's cardioprotective abilities involve a multitude of physiologic processes. However, the effects of aspirin on cardiac autonomic activity are unknown. In a double-blind crossover study, 22 subjects randomly received either aspirin or placebo in the amounts of 325 mg with each meal (three times per day) over a 2.5-day period. The total amount of aspirin ingested was 2,275 mg, which resulted in plasma levels of 3.3 mg/dl. At the conclusion of each treatment, subjects were evaluated for autonomic physiology activity using standard autonomic tests. Power spectral analyses of the electrocardiograms were used to delineate autonomic function. A 2 x 4 repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant and favorable changes in autonomic activity after the use of aspirin. Specifically, at rest high-frequency (HF) power was significantly higher (mean, 1,090 + 1,463.5 msec2) compared with the placebo (mean, 692 742 msec2) (p <0.05). Low-frequency (LF) power was significantly reduced (mean, 963 745 msec2) after aspirin compared with placebo (mean, 1,100 906 msec2). After the aspirin treatment, a significantly lower LF-to-HF power ratio (mean, 1.7 2 msec2) was noted at rest when compared with the placebo (mean, 2.5 2.7 msec2) (p <0.05). Similar significant trends were seen during the sustained isometric contraction after aspirin therapy for HF power (mean 210 2.15 msec2) compared with placebo (mean, 213 184 msec2) (p <0.05). Accordingly, the LF-to-HF power ratio was lower as well when compared to placebo treatment (mean, 2.3 3.5 msec2) (mean, 5.3 8.4 msec2) (p <0.05). No differences were found in breathing rates for hemodynamic variables between any of the protocols. The significant reduction of LF-to-HF ratio, a marker of sympathovagal balance, for both protocols appeared to be largely due to a withdrawal of LF modulation and concomitant but lesser increase in HF modulation. Favorable alterations in autonomic outflow through prostaglandin inhibition may be one of the mechanisms by which low therapeutic amounts of aspirin provide prophylactic cardioprotection."

            "abstract": "The increased morning frequency of cardiovascular disease onset has created concern that morning exertion promotes greater risk than evening exertion. The physiologic responses to isometric exercise (handgrip) in the morning (9 A.M.) versus the evening (6:30 P.M.) were compared in 15 subjects with mild hypertension. Isometric exercise produced similar increases at both times of the day (morning vs evening) in systolic arterial pressure (31 +/- 4 vs 35 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = NS) and heart rate (7 +/- 1 vs 8 +/- 1 beats/min, p = NS). It also produced similar increases in fibrinolytic activity (reduction in euglobulin clot lysis time) at both times of the day (-53 +/- 27 vs -53 +/- 21 minutes). However, because basal fibrinolytic activity was lower in the morning than in the evening (euglobulin clot lysis time 364 +/- 45 vs 220 +/- 33 minutes, p < 0.01), peak fibrinolytic activity after stress was also lower in the morning (312 +/- 44 vs 176 +/- 27 minutes, p < 0.01). The present study demonstrates that in subjects with hypertension, the hemostatic and hemodynamic responses to handgrip are not greater during morning versus evening exertion. This finding, plus the overall benefits of regular exercise and the low absolute risk of an event during exercise, suggests that timing of exertion is not of critical importance. However, to obtain a definitive answer to this question, further studies are needed using different potential triggers and subject populations."

Rilmenidine is an I(1)-imidazoline receptor agonist that reduces blood pressure by modulation of central sympathetic activity, but the effects of low-dose rilmenidine on the hemodynamic responses to physiological maneuvers that increase adrenergic drive is not known. To assess the effects of low-dose rilmenidine on the hemodynamic responses to stress, 32 healthy subjects (20-56 years old) underwent acute physical exercise (n = 15, individualized ramp protocol on treadmill) and mental stress (n = 17, word color Stroop and mental arithmetics tests) two hours after the oral administration of 0.5 mg of rilmenidine (RIL) or placebo (PLA) following a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study. No subject complained of any side effect. Rilmenidine reduced peak exercise heart rate (PLA: 187 +/- 7; RIL: 181 +/- 9 bpm; P = 0.003), but did not modify peak aerobic power (VO(2max) - PLA: 41.7 +/- 6.2; RIL: 42.3 +/- 6.7 ml/kg/min; P = 0.26).

In conclusion, rilmenidine reduced the hemodynamic response to physical and mental stress stimuli without limiting exercise capacity. These results support the concept that rilmenidine, at a dose lower than the ones recommended to treat hypertension, reduced the myocardial oxygen demand to stress and may carry potential clinical impact."

            "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the major cause of fatalities in males over 34 years of age during hiking or downhill skiing in the mountains. The main goal of the present study was the identification of risk factors and triggers associated with SCDs during these mountain activities. Besides recording individual circumstances associated with SCD, a case-control study was performed comparing the risk factor profiles of 247 males over the age of 34 who suffered SCD during mountain hiking or downhill skiing with those of 741 matched controls. The SCD risk was greatest on the first day at altitude but altitude per se and the duration of activity did not appear to markedly modify this risk. In contrast, the longer the time from the last food and fluid intake during hiking, the higher was the SCD risk. Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was started in 33% of skiers and in 14 % of hikers after occurrence of unconsciousness. Hikers who died suddenly during mountain hiking were much more likely to have had a prior myocardial infarction (MI) (17% vs. 0.9%), known coronary artery disease (CAD) without prior MI (17% vs. 4%), diabetes (6% vs. 1%), hypercholesterolemia (54 % vs. 20%), and were also less engaged in regular mountaineering activities (31% vs. 58%) compared with hikers from the control group (all P < 0.001). Skiers who suffered SCD had much more frequently a prior MI (41% vs. 1.5%), hypertension (50% vs. 17%), known CAD without prior MI (9% vs. 3%), and were less engaged in regular strenuous exercise (4% vs. 15%) when compared to controls (all P < 0.05). These findings enable identification of skiers and hikers at increased SCD-risk and recommendation of preventive measures, e.g. pharmacological interventions and adaptation to specific mountain activities. They also underline the need for intensified cardio-pulmonary resuscitation training for all mountaineers."

The effects of sildenafil and placebo on neural and circulatory responses to stressful stimuli (sustained handgrip, maximal forearm ischemia, mental stress, and the cold pressor test) were also evaluated. Blood pressure, heart rate, and forearm vascular resistance after sildenafil and placebo were similar. However, muscle sympathetic nerve activity increased strikingly after sildenafil (by 141+/-26%, mean+/-SEM) compared with placebo (3+/-8%) (P=0.006); plasma norepinephrine levels also increased by 31+/-5% after sildenafil administration (P=0.004).

            "abstract": "Menopause and the loss of estrogen trigger a deleterious cascade of metabolic and cardiovascular events. Recent data suggest that the menopause transition is associated with changes in body composition that promote a loss of fat-free mass and potentially a decline in skeletal muscle mass that may be related to a decline in energy expenditure, a loss of muscular strength and a decline in physical activity. The mechanisms underlying changes in ovarian function and its influence on skeletal muscle mass, however, are unknown. This brief review examines the impact of the menopause transition on body composition with a particular emphasis on menopause-associated sarcopenia. We also consider the possibility that hormone-replacement may be an effective intervention to offset these changes."

In view of the inhibitory effect of clonidine (CL) upon the adrenergic nervous system, the effectiveness of small doses of CL in chronic angina was evaluated in a double-blind crossover study on 60 patients suffering at least 5 coronary pains per week in spite of routine medication. CL was given orally in a dose of 2 x 75 microgram/day for a 2 wk. Reduction in frequency of coronary pains by at least 50% was observed in 53.7% of patients, total nitroglycerin consumption decreased from 322 to 174 tablets/week, and ergometric performance increased from 168 to 283 W x min/patient. Urinary excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline diminished. Blood pressure and heart rate were not considerably changed. Mild and transient side effects occurred in 10 patients, 9 of them completed the trial. It is concluded that CL in low doses is effective and safe in patients with chronic angina, presumably by alleviating adrenergic strain."

Beause of the probable importance of neural stress responses in the heart as triggers for clinical end points of coronary artery disease, it is pertinent to investigate whether sympathetic nervous responses to stresses are increased by aging.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      We applied kinetic methods for measuring the fluxes to plasma of neurochemicals relevant to sympathetic neurotransmission in younger (aged 20 to 30 years) and older (aged 60 to 75 years) healthy men during mental stress (difficult mental arithmetic), isometric exercise (sustained handgrip), and dynamic exercise (supine cycling). The increase in total norepinephrine spillover to plasma with mental stress was unaffected by age. In contrast, the increase in cardiac norepinephrine spillover was two to three times higher in the older subjects (P < .05). The probable mechanism of this higher cardiac norepinephrine spillover was reduced neuronal reuptake of the transmitter, because age had no influence on the overflow of the norepinephrine precursor, dihydroxyphenylalanine, or intraneuronal metabolite, dihydroxyphenylglycol (levels of these two substances reflect rates of cardiac norepinephrine synthesis and intraneuronal metabolism), and the transcardiac extraction of plasma radiolabeled norepinephrine was lower in the older subjects (P < .05). An almost identical pattern of neurochemical response was seen with isometric exercise. During cycling, total norepinephrine spillover was 16% lower in the older men, but cardiac norepinephrine spillover was 53% higher.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Reduced norepinephrine reuptake increases the overflow of the neurotransmitter to plasma from the aging heart during stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow. Failure of transmitter inactivation at postjunctional receptors with aging would amplify the neural signal, and in the presence of myocardial disease could trigger adverse stress-induced cardiovascular events, particularly when accompanied by an age-dependent reduction in vagal tone. Reduction of postsynaptic adrenergic responsiveness with aging, however, might protect against this, as indicated by our finding that in no case was the heart rate increase during stress greater in older men, despite their having larger increases in cardiac norepinephrine spillover."

            "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome of unknown etiology characterized by chronic wide spread pain, increased tenderness to palpation and additional symptoms such as disturbed sleep, stiffness, fatigue and psychological distress. While medication mainly focus on pain reduction, physical therapy is aimed at disease consequences such as pain, fatigue, deconditioning, muscle weakness and sleep disturbances and other disease consequences. We systematically reviewed current treatment options in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Based on evidence from randomized controlled trials cardiovascular fitness training importantly improves cardiovascular fitness, both subjective and objective measures of pain as well as subjective energy and work capacity and physical and social activities. Based on anecdotal evidence or small observational studies physiotherapy may reduce overloading of the muscle system, improve postural fatigue and positioning, and condition weak muscles. Modalities and whole body cryotherapy may reduce localized as well as generalized pain in short term. Trigger point injection may reduce pain originating from concomitant trigger points in selected FM patient. Massage may reduce muscle tension and may be prescribed as a adjunct with other therapeutic interventions. Acupuncture may reduce pain and increase pain threshold. Biofeedback may positively influence subjective and objective disease measures. TENS may reduce localized musculoskeletal pain in fibromyalgia. While there seems to be no single best treatment option, physical therapy seem to reduce disease consequences. Accordingly a multidisciplinary approach combining these therapies in a well balanced program may be the most promising strategy and is currently recommended in the treatment of fibromyalgia."

Heart rate (HR), PR interval, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured supine, standing, and after treadmill exercise, before and 2 h after drug administration. The adverse effects experienced with felodipine were as expected for a vasodilator. Seven subjects mentioned complaints voluntarily on the combinations while three experienced side effects receiving felodipine or beta-blocker alone. Felodipine increased resting HR significantly. Timolol produced a greater depression of exercise heart rate than the other beta-blockers, indicating that the dose given was not equivalent to that of the other beta-blockers. Pindolol was ineffective in preventing the increase in supine HR produced by felodipine. Felodipine did not alter PR interval at any level of activity, but rate-corrected supine PR interval was prolonged slightly by felodipine. Metoprolol and timolol significantly prolonged standing PR interval. All beta-blockers prolonged exercise PR interval. Felodipine/beta-blocker combinations did not prolong PR interval more than beta-blockers alone. Prolonged PR interval was the result of reduced HR and direct inhibition of atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Only timolol and the timolol/felodipine combination lowered supine systolic blood pressure significantly. Timolol and all beta-blocker/felodipine combinations reduced exercise SBP significantly."

This review attempts to answer the following questions: (1) Is there evidence of significantly increased risk of metabolic syndrome in SMDs? (2) How is this evidence explained by stress theory and functional polymorphism? (3) What role can psychopharmacology and psychosocial therapies play in minimizing the problem? We have done a historical review using related literature from Medline. Compared with the general population, metabolic syndrome is two to three times more common in SMDs. The evidence for this predates the era of antipsychotic drugs. Altered glucose metabolism and dyslipidemia seem to be integral to SMDs. However, major psychotropic drugs are associated with metabolic syndrome, because of their activity at the appetite-stimulating receptors. SMDs seem to trigger a pathogenic cycle that fuels metabolic syndrome. To explain these findings, a neural diathesis-stress model has been proposed. Furthermore, candidate genes associated with receptors for weight gain are implicated. Using metformin (≥750 mg/day) may significantly reduce metabolic risks, and the data support consideration of this intervention for psychiatric patients taking antipsychotics. The obstacles to the implementation of the available guidelines for monitoring metabolic effects and changing unhelpful lifestyles need to be overcome by making monitoring mandatory and integration of physical exercise into routine care. Drug development and genotyping for the risk factors are future solutions."

Since then, we have developed a simple cross-over control strategy in which the heart rate of one subject is related to the finger-tapping rate of another. Of the 20 normal subjects previously studied while tapping a telegraph key at a comfortable rate for 10 min., reevaluation of their data showed that 9 (45%) and 4 (20%) of them, under test and control conditions, respectively, appeared to couple at a single-digit integer ratio. Neither the incidence nor the intensity of apparent CLC under the two conditions was significantly different. Raster plots of the most tightly related rates gave no evidence of phase locking. These results have two implications. First, previously published reports on CLC (and other entrainment phenomena) should be interpreted with caution, and cross-over controls should be considered in future research. Second, the absence of CLC during finger tapping suggests that CLC may only be functionally significant during exercise of large muscle groups (e.g., by minimization of cardiac afterload) or when impact-loading occurs (e.g., by enhancing cardiac ventricular emptying."

Exercise training reduces resting sympathetic activity, but the effects on sympathetic activation or withdrawal during baroreflex responses to blood pressure perturbations are controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of training on both the vagal and sympathetic reflex heart rate responses to blood pressure changes. 2. Using 10 healthy males in a randomized cross-over design, we examined the effects of three 30 min cycling sessions at 70% of maximal capacity for 4 weeks on the steady-state reflex heart rate responses to perturbations in mean arterial pressure induced with injections of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. The method provides a sigmoidal relationship between changes in heart rate and blood pressure. The upper plateau (maximum tachycardia in response to blood pressure reduction) and lower plateau (maximum bradycardia in response to blood pressure elevation) are mainly mediated by the cardiac sympathetics and vagus, respectively. The slope of the relationship is a measure of reflex gain. 3. Training, which increased maximal oxygen consumption by 13 +/- 2% (mean +/- standard error of the difference), reduced supine and standing blood pressures by 3 +/- 1/3 +/- 1 mmHg (P less than 0.05) and 4 +/- 1/2 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.05 for systolic), respectively, whereas resting heart rate was lowered by 6 +/- 1 beats/min (P less than 0.05).

The prevalence of coronary spasm differs among populations, is higher in Japan and Korea than in the Western countries probably due to genetic as well as environmental factors. Coronary spasm occurs most often from midnight to early morning and is usually not induced by exercise in the daytime. The attacks of coronary spasm are associated with either ST segment elevation or depression, or negative U wave on ECG. Patients with multi-vessel coronary spasm may suffer from lethal arrhythmia, including advanced AV block, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or even sudden death, and they are often resistant to conventional medical therapy including Ca-channel blockers (CCBs). Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) activity is reduced and markers of oxidative stress are elevated in patients with coronary spasm. Thrombogenesis is enhanced and plasma levels of hsCRP and P-selection are elevated in patients with coronary spasm. Thus, patients with coronary spasm have endothelial dysfunction and are suffering from a low-grade chronic inflammation. Polymorphisms of endothelial NO synthase, smoking, and low-grade inflammation are the most important risk factors for coronary spasm. Coronary spasm is a hyper-contraction of coronary smooth muscle triggered by an increase of intracellular Ca2+ in the presence of an increased Ca2+ sensitivity. It has been shown that RhoA/ROCK pathway is involved in Ca2+ sensitivity and that the reduced endothelial NO activity results in increased Ca2+ sensitivity through enhanced RhoA/ROCK pathway. Accordingly, it is possible that in addition to CCBs, RhoA/ROCK pathway blockers may prove to be useful for the treatment of coronary spasm."

            "abstract": "It has long been recognized that increased sympathetic nerve activity during physiologic stress (exercise, swimming, emotion, arousal, loud noise, etc.) has profound influences on the electrical and contractile functions of the heart. In the severely predisposed heart, these stressors may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. Still little is known about the temporal relationship between instantaneous autonomic nerve activity and arrhythmias. There is a large variety of autonomically-driven arrhythmias, from serious ventricular tachycardia in pathological conditions to single supraventricular and ventricular extrasystolic beats in the healthy heart. The latter are considered harmless if occurring at low frequency. In the atria, mounting data indicate the presence of a sophisticated network of ganglionated plexi with major influences on cardiac function. The ablation of multiple such ganglia can suppress pulmonary vein potentials and atrial fibrillation. At the cellular level, recent studies have focused on the spatiotemporal details of cyclic nucleotide signaling influencing ion channel function during neurohumoral stimulation. We have come to understand that sarcolemmal ion channels and other electrogenic transporters are macromolecular complexes that interact with structural elements (other than the phospholipid bilayer) to promote regionalization and targeting by regulatory proteins. Compartmentation of these regulatory proteins in subdomains of the myocyte is increasingly recognized and thought to segregate the functional (including electrogenic) responses induced by different neuromediators and hormones. In this article, contemporary issues are discussed regarding arrhythmias that are triggered by influences from the neurocardiac interface, covering the field from the molecular genetic to the intact integrated level. Actual questions are listed per topic, and viewpoints are expressed."

Our concern should be addressed particularly to the competitive athlete, insofar as training seems to increase the blood pressure reactivity to dynamic exercise. However, studies performed in young borderline hypertensive subjects have demonstrated that blood pressure level during steady-state long lasting exercise can not be predicted by the maximum blood pressure attained during a short-lasting incremental effort. Several prospective studies have demonstrated that excessive increases in blood pressure during exercise may be a marker of future sustained hypertension and of increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. The steeper rise in exercise blood pressure in normotensive subjects prone to develop hypertension and its complications seems to be due to a failure to reduce total peripheral resistance adequately during exercise, as a result of initial structural vascular changes which would pre-date the tonic elevation in the blood pressure."

Exercise resulted in coronary blood flow increases (to 1.88+/-0.26 from 1.10+/- 0.12 ml x min(-1) x g(-1)) and in a fall (P<0.01) in coronary sinus O(2) saturation (17.4+/-1.5 to 9.6+/-0.7 vol%), whereas myocardial O(2) consumption (MVO(2)) increased (109+/-13% from 145+/-16 microl O(2) min(-1) x g(-1)). Tezosentan, a dual ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor blocker, slightly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and increased heart rate throughout exercise. The relationship between coronary sinus O(2) saturation and MVO(2) was shifted upward (P<0.05) after tezosentan administration; i.e., as MVO(2) increased during exercise, coronary sinus O(2) saturation was disproportionately higher after ET-receptor blockade. After propranolol, tezosentan resulted in significant decreases (P<0.05) in left ventricular pressure, the first derivative of left ventricular pressure over time, and MAP during exercise. As MVO(2) increased during exercise, coronary sinus O(2) saturation levels after tezosentan became superimposable over those observed before ET-receptor blockade. Thus dual blockade of ET(A)/ET(B) receptors alters coronary hemodynamics and O(2) metabolism during exercise, but ET activity failed to increase beyond baseline levels."

Symptoms were assessed on a visual analogue scale and exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold) was measured during rate responsive (peak rate 125/min) and conventional fixed rate (VVI) pacing (70/min). One month after randomisation treadmill exercise was performed. The mode was then changed to the other pacing mode and exercise was repeated three hours later. After another month the process was repeated but in the reverse order. During long term assessment there was subjective improvement in the sensation of breathlessness with rate responsive pacing. During short term assessment maximal oxygen consumption increased and the benefit was maintained during long term rate responsive compared with long term VVI pacing; oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold was similarly improved.

            "abstract": "The strong relationship between over-nutrition, central obesity, insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) suggest pathogenic interactions, but key questions remain. NAFLD starts with over-nutrition, imbalance between energy input and output for which the roles of genetic predisposition and environmental factors (diet, physical activity) are being redefined. Regulation of energy balance operates at both central nervous system and peripheral sites, including adipose and liver. For example, the endocannabinoid system could potentially be modulated to provide effective pharmacotherapy of NAFLD. The more profound the metabolic abnormalities complicating over-nutrition (glucose intolerance, hypoadiponectinemia, metabolic syndrome), the more likely is NAFLD to take on its progressive guise of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Interactions between steatosis and insulin resistance, visceral adipose expansion and subcutaneous adipose failure (with insulin resistance, inflammation and hypoadiponectinemia) trigger amplifying mechanisms for liver disease. Thus, transition from simple steatosis to NASH could be explained by unmitigated hepatic lipid partitioning with failure of local adaptive mechanisms leading to lipotoxicity. In part one of this review, we discuss newer concepts of appetite and metabolic regulation, bodily lipid distribution, hepatic lipid turnover, insulin resistance and adipose failure affecting adiponectin secretion. We review evidence that NASH only occurs when over-nutrition is complicated by insulin resistance and a highly disordered metabolic milieu, the same 'metabolic movers' that promote type 2 diabetes and atheromatous cardiovascular disease. The net effect is accumulation of lipid molecules in the liver. Which lipids and how they cause injury, inflammation and fibrosis will be discussed in part two."

Rest following strenuous physical activity, carbohydrate ingestion, emotional stress and exposure to cold are the precipitating triggers. Most of the mutations act in a dominant-negative fashion, either through a trafficking dysfunction or through Kir2.1-phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate binding defect. We have identified two families that were diagnosed with periodic paralysis and cardiac abnormalities, but only discrete development features. The proband in one of the two families reported having his symptoms occurring twice within the day following corticosteroids ingestion, and alleviated after stopping the corticosteroid treatment. Electromyographic evaluations pointed out to a typical hypokalemic periodic paralysis pattern. Molecular screening of the KCNJ2 gene identified two mutations leading to C54F and T305P substitutions in the Kir2.1 protein. Functional expression in mammalian cells revealed a loss-of-function of the mutated channels and a dominant-negative effect when both mutants and wild-type channels are present in the same cell. However, channel trafficking and assembly are not affected. Substitutions at these residues may interfere with phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate binding to Kir2.1 channels. Sensitivity of our patients to multiple corticosteroid administrations shows that care must be taken in the use of such treatments in AS patients. Taken together, our data suggest the inclusion of the KCNJ2 gene in the molecular screening of patients with periodic paralysis, even when the classical AS dysmorphic features are not present."

Body vibrations were induced by a treadmill exercise test with increasing speed. Maximum pacing rates were measured at the stage of symptom-limited tolerance.

Until the latter half of the twentieth century, beyond a nodding acknowledgment of its massive prevalence, this syndrome received but scant attention from the medical profession. In the early 1960s a number of insights changed perceptions as well as practice. These related to 4 postulates: (1) sudden cardiac death, in the majority of victims, was due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias either initiated by or culminating rapidly in ventricular fibrillation; (2) the lethal arrhythmia was not the consequence of irreversible pathomorphologic impairment of the contractile apparatus, but rather the expression of an electrophysiologic derangement; (3) the triggering of ventricular fibrillation was the result of an electrical accident both reversible as well as preventable; (4) the potential victim was identifiable either by the presence of certain grades of ventricular ectopic activity or by exposure of repetitive ectopic activity or by exposure of repetitive ventricular arrhythmias by electrophysiologic techniques. The innovations that have led to these insights and their consequences have been numerous and continuous. Among these are direct current defibrillation, cardioversion, coronary care units, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise stress testing for exposing ventricular arrhythmias, electrophysiologic provocative testing and mapping techniques, overdrive programmable pacemakers as well as implantable defibrillators and cardioverters, and surgical, electrical and laser techniques for ablating the nidus or interrupting the pathways of the arrhythmias."

Sexual activity was found to double the relative risk of acute MI in healthy individuals and patients with a prior history of angina or MI. However, the absolute risk of sexually triggered MI remains extremely low, because the baseline risk of MI is low for most individuals and the increased risk due to sexual activity is transient. Regular exercise also was found to reduce the risk of MI by sexual activity. Given that >12 million people in the United States have coronary artery disease, these findings should be more widely disseminated to reassure patients that, in most cases, sexual activity carries little risk of causing a cardiac event.

In this regard, individual behavioral strategies have been documented to be effective in motivating sedentary Type 2 diabetic subjects to the adoption and the maintenance of regular physical activity. In Type 1 diabetic subjects, the lack of the physiological inhibition of insulin secretion during exercise results in a potential risk of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, exercise-induced activation of counter-regulatory hormones might trigger an acute metabolic derangement in severe insulin-deficient subjects.

            "abstract": "Evidence obtained over the past decade indicates that myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden death are not random events but rather, in many cases, may be triggered by the daily activities of the subject. The importance of physical or mental stresses as triggers is suggested by the parallel morning increased onsets of MI, sudden cardiac death, and stroke. Unstable angina and MI are usually precipitated by thrombus formation over a disrupted plaque that causes partial or complete obstruction of coronary artery blood flow. This process may be caused by physiologic factors that lead to rupture of a vulnerable plaque and subsequent thrombosis. Beta-blockers and aspirin, which can diminish these physiologic processes, have been shown to blunt or abolish the morning peak of onset of acute MI. It is hypothesized that occlusive coronary thrombosis occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque becomes vulnerable to rupture, and mental or physical stress causes the plaque to rupture. Increases in coagulability or vasoconstriction triggered by daily activities may also contribute to complete occlusion of the coronary artery lumen. Recognition of the circadian variation of the onset of acute cardiovascular disease suggests the need for pharmacologic protection of patients during the vulnerable periods and provides clues to the mechanism of disease onset, the investigation of which may lead to improved methods of prevention."

Moreover, enalapril increased significantly the angina threshold and exercise duration. Three of the eight patients ended the exercise without pain. The rate-pressure product was not significantly modified at any time. Thus, the anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal activity may be due to an increase of coronary blood flow, rather than a reduction of MVO2 consumption."

            "title": "The roles of exercise-induced immune system disturbances in the pathology of heat stroke : the dual pathway model of heat stroke.",
            "abstract": "Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition that can be fatal if not appropriately managed. Although heat stroke has been recognised as a medical condition for centuries, a universally accepted definition of heat stroke is lacking and the pathology of heat stroke is not fully understood. Information derived from autopsy reports and the clinical presentation of patients with heat stroke indicates that hyperthermia, septicaemia, central nervous system impairment and cardiovascular failure play important roles in the pathology of heat stroke. The current models of heat stroke advocate that heat stroke is triggered by hyperthermia but is driven by endotoxaemia. Endotoxaemia triggers the systemic inflammatory response, which can lead to systemic coagulation and haemorrhage, necrosis, cell death and multi-organ failure. However, the current heat stroke models cannot fully explain the discrepancies in high core temperature (Tc) as a trigger of heat stroke within and between individuals. Research on the concept of critical Tc as a limitation to endurance exercise implies that a high Tc may function as a signal to trigger the protective mechanisms against heat stroke. Athletes undergoing a period of intense training are subjected to a variety of immune and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. The immune disturbances include the suppression of immune cells and their functions, suppression of cell-mediated immunity, translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suppression of anti-LPS antibodies, increased macrophage activity due to muscle tissue damage, and increased concentration of circulating inflammatory and pyrogenic cytokines. Common symptoms of exercise-induced GI disturbances include diarrhoea, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cramps, which may increase gut-related LPS translocation. This article discusses the current evidence that supports the argument that these exercise-induced immune and GI disturbances may contribute to the development of endotoxaemia and heat stroke. When endotoxaemia can be tolerated or prevented, continuing exercise and heat exposure will elevate Tc to a higher level (>42 degrees C), where heat stroke may occur through the direct thermal effects of heat on organ tissues and cells. We also discuss the evidence suggesting that heat stroke may occur through endotoxaemia (heat sepsis), the primary pathway of heat stroke, or hyperthermia, the secondary pathway of heat stroke. The existence of these two pathways of heat stroke and the contribution of exercise-induced immune and GI disturbances in the primary pathway of heat stroke are illustrated in the dual pathway model of heat stroke. This model of heat stroke suggests that prolonged intense exercise suppresses anti-LPS mechanisms, and promotes inflammatory and pyrogenic activities in the pathway of heat stroke."

            "title": "Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility.",
            "abstract": "Clinical characteristics:\n        \n      \n      Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle calcium regulation associated with uncontrolled skeletal muscle hypermetabolism. Manifestations of malignant hyperthermia (MH) are precipitated by certain volatile anesthetics (i.e., halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane), either alone or in conjunction with a depolarizing muscle relaxant (specifically, succinylcholine). The triggering substances cause uncontrolled release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and may promote entry of extracellular calcium into the myoplasm, causing contracture of skeletal muscles, glycogenolysis, and increased cellular metabolism, resulting in production of heat and excess lactate. Affected individuals experience acidosis, hypercapnia, tachycardia, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis with subsequent increase in serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration, hyperkalemia with a risk for cardiac arrhythmia or even cardiac arrest, and myoglobinuria with a risk for renal failure. In nearly all cases, the first manifestations of MH (tachycardia and tachypnea) occur in the operating room; however, MH may also occur in the early postoperative period. There is mounting evidence that some individuals with MHS will also develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments. Without proper and prompt treatment with dantrolene sodium, mortality is extremely high.\n    \n\n\n          Diagnosis/testing:\n        \n      \n      The diagnosis of MHS is established with in vitro muscle contracture testing by measuring the contracture responses of biopsied muscle samples to halothane and graded concentrations of caffeine. The diagnosis of MHS can also be established by identification of a pathogenic variant in CACNA1S, RYR1, or STAC3 on molecular genetic testing.\n    \n\n\n          Management:\n        \nTreatment of manifestations: Early diagnosis of an MH episode is essential. Successful treatment of an acute episode of MH includes: discontinuation of potent inhalation agents and succinylcholine; increase in minute ventilation to lower end-tidal CO2; use of MHAUS helpline; administration of dantrolene sodium intravenously; cooling measures if body temperature is >38.5° C; treatment of cardiac arrhythmias if needed (do not use calcium channel blockers); monitoring blood gases, serum concentrations of electrolytes and CK, blood and urine for myoglobin, and coagulation profile; treatment of metabolic abnormalities.\n    \n\nPrevention of primary manifestations: Individuals with MHS should not be exposed to potent volatile agents and succinylcholine. Individuals undergoing general anesthetics that exceed 30 minutes in duration should have their temperature monitored using an electronic temperature probe. Individuals with MHS should carry proper identification as to their susceptibility.\n    \n\nAgents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid potent inhalation anesthetics and succinylcholine. Calcium channel blockers should not be given together with dantrolene because of a potential cardiac depressant effect. Serotonin antagonist (5HT3-antagonist) antiemetics should be used cautiously. Individuals with MHS should avoid extremes of heat, but not restrict athletic activity unless there is a history of overt rhabdomyolysis and/or heat stroke. Strenuous activities at high ambient temperatures should be avoided or performed with caution. In individuals with MH undergoing cardiac bypass surgery, aggressive rewarming should be avoided, as it may be associated with development of clinical signs of MH.\n    \n\nEvaluation of relatives at risk: If the MHS-causative pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to established increased risk of MH in a heterozygous individual; molecular genetic testing alone cannot be used to identify family members who are not at increased risk for MH because of other possible genetic risk factors. If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known or if an at-risk relative is found to be negative for a familial pathogenic variant, muscle contracture testing can be used to assess susceptibility to MH.\n    \n\nPregnancy management: If a pregnant woman with MHS requires a non-emergent surgery, a non-triggering anesthetic (local, nerve block, epidural, spinal anesthesia, or a total intravenous general anesthetic) should be administered. Continuous epidural analgesia is highly recommended for labor and delivery. If a cesarean delivery is indicated in a woman who does not have an epidural catheter in place, neuraxial (spinal, epidural, or combined spinal-epidural) anesthesia is recommended (if not otherwise contraindicated). If a general anesthetic is indicated, a total intravenous anesthetic technique should be administered, with an anesthesia machine that has been prepared for an MH-susceptible individual.\n    \n\n\n          Genetic counseling:\n        \n      \n      Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is an autosomal dominant disorder. Most individuals diagnosed with MHS have a parent with MHS, although the parent may not have experienced an episode of MH. The proportion of individuals with MHS caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with MHS has a 50% chance of inheriting a causative pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if there is a known MH pathogenic variant in the family."

            "title": "An animal model of spontaneous arrhythmic death.",
            "abstract": "Ventricular arrhythmias and the proclivity for sudden death have been identified in German shepherd dogs. This disorder is inherited, and affected animals can be consistently produced from an established colony. The arrhythmias are most prevalent in young dogs between 22 and 26 weeks of age, with death most frequent at this same age. Death occurs most frequently during presumed sleep or at rest after exercise or excitement. The QT interval is not prolonged; however, more frequent notching of the T wave exists in affected dogs compared to control dogs. Polymorphic rapid nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurs most frequently following long RR intervals. Accordingly, perturbations that decrease the heart rate or enhance sinus arrhythmia increase the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Because the arrhythmias are age, behavior, and heart rate dependent, the autonomic nervous system may play a role in their generation. As determined by metaiodobenzyl-guanidine scintigraphy and immunocytochemical staining of tyrosine hydroxylase, cardiac sympathetic innervation is regionally deficient in affected dogs. Evidence suggests that initiation of the ventricular arrhythmias is caused by early afterdepolarization (EAD)-induced triggered activity originating from left ventricular Purkinje fibers. Alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation provokes EADs in the Purkinje fibers and ventricular arrhythmias in the dogs. The development of EADs may be related to heterogeneity of repolarizing currents (Ito in particular) in affected dogs. From this canine model of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias, the opportunity exists to investigate the interplay between abnormal development of cardiac innervation and the genesis of lethal ventricular arrhythmias."

In this study we investigated, through the use of selective antagonists, the relative role of amygdaloid mineralocorticoid (MR) versus glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in CORT-mediated spinal and cardiovascular pseudoaffective reflex responses to colorectal distension (CRD). Micropellets containing, CORT and a selective MR antagonist (spironolactone) or GR antagonist (mifepristone) were implanted stereotaxically onto the dorsal margin of the amygdala in rats. On day 7 post-implantation in response to graded CRD we measured: (i) changes in the electrical activity of dorsal horn neurons in the L6-S1 spinal cord and (ii) the cardiovascular depressor responses. Exposure of the amygdala to CORT-releasing micropellets increased the proportion of spinal neurons showing high-threshold and/or long-lasting responses and potentiated the magnitude of excitation. Elevated levels of amygdala CORT also increased the magnitude of the cardiovascular depressor response to CRD. MR but not GR antagonism prevented the increase in spinal cord neuronal excitation, whereas either the MR or GR antagonist decreased the magnitude of the depressor cardiovascular response to CRD. We conclude that MR in the amygdala trigger descending pathways facilitating viscero-nociceptive processing in the spinal cord, whereas MR and GR have a non-redundant role in CORT-induced potentiation of the autonomic pseudoaffective responses to colorectal stimuli."

These regulators of the RyR channels have potential therapeutic implications in that the small molecule and the protein have novel anti-arrhythmic and anti-heart failure activities involving the cardiac (RyR2) and skeletal (RyR1) ryanodine receptors. Protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts or mutations in RyR2 linked to sudden cardiac death (SCD) can result in diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak that can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias, and deplete SR Ca2+ stores contributing to decreased contractility. We and others have identified a class of small molecules derived from 1,4-benzothiazepines, that enhance the binding affinity of calstabin 2 for RyR2 and reduce the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, even when the channel is PKA hyperphosphorylated. Therefore, this class of compounds has tremendous potential as novel therapeutics for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias."

Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen consumption (VO2), cardiac output and stroke volume were determined at 25, 45, 60 and 75% of each subject's VO2 max. Heart rate was significantly lower with pindolol compared with placebo at all stages of exercise, but significantly higher compared with propranolol at all stages of exercise except at 75% of VO2 max and at VO2 max (no significant differences between the 2 beta blockers were recorded at these stages). Mean arterial pressure was statistically equivalent with pindolol and propranolol at all stages of exercise and significantly lower while beta-blocked compared with placebo conditions at 45, 60 and 75% of VO2 max. Cardiac output and VO2 were statistically equivalent across all 3 treatments at all submaximal levels of exercise. It was concluded that, although heart rate was significantly higher with pindolol compared with propranolol at the 3 lower rates of work, cardiac output and VO2 were not different between the drugs, thus making little impact on exercise performance."

The notion that an abrupt increase in physical activity in the spring, after a period of relative inactivity, can trigger sudden cardiac events has not been confirmed. There are seasonal variations in the physiological responses to exercise and the occurrence of injuries during participation in sports, but it is not known whether these changes are explained by fluctuations in activity levels and environmental conditions, or by any endogenous circannual rhythms in the human. There are indications of endogenous control for some physiological processes (eg, the metabolic responses to a given intensity of exercise) that seem to mediate more favorable effects of exercise on body composition in the winter. Well-trained athletes show obvious seasonality in their competitive performances, generally in line with adopted annual periodization strategies, although these strategies can be disrupted by external seasonal factors, such as heat stress or the susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections. Maximal oxygen consumption and other physiological indicators of exercise performance might not mirror seasonal variation in real performances, which suggests that top-class athletes maintain a good level of general physical conditioning throughout the year."

In this study, a prominent circadian variation was also identified in which frequency of sudden cardiac death increased sharply between 6 A.M. and 9 P.M.; distribution was fairly even throughout the rest of the day.

Treadmill exercise tests and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring were performed at the end of each treatment phase. The results showed that both time to 1-mm ST depression and total exercise duration were significantly prolonged with nicorandil treatment compared with placebo (p = 0.026 and 0.036, respectively). Maximum exercise ST depression also tended to be less with nicorandil treatment than with placebo (p = 0.083). Compared with 10 healthy control subjects, study patients had significantly reduced heart rate variability in both low- and high-frequency bands while receiving placebo. Nicorandil treatment did not change the altered heart rate variability in either time domain or spectral analysis. Systemic hemodynamics were also unchanged with nicorandil treatment.

Recent studies have revealed a remarkable parallel between the regulation of uptake of glucose and fatty acids by muscle, in that each is mediated by sarcolemmal transporters that are recruited from an intracellular storage site. The focus of this review is to describe newly obtained insights on the recruitment of fatty acid transporters and their malfunctioning in diabetes.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      The major fatty acid transporter involved is fatty acid translocase (CD36). Translocation of this protein to the membrane is triggered by muscle contraction and by insulin, and presumably occurs from distinct intracellular pools. This resembles the well documented exercise and insulin-induced recruitment of glucose transporter-4. Whether another transporter, plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein, is also subject to such recycling is not yet clear. In a rodent model of insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes, the increased rate of muscle fatty acid uptake could be associated with an increased total amount of fatty acid translocase (CD36). In a model of non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, this increased rate could be associated with a permanent relocalization of fatty acid translocase to the sarcolemma.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      These findings indicate a pivotal role for the membrane transporter fatty acid translocase in the exercise and insulin-induced increases of muscle fatty acid uptake and utilization, and suggest that malfunctioning of the cellular recycling of fatty acid translocase is involved in the etiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes."

In isolated rat aortic nodose baroreceptor neurons, mechanical stimulation depolarized 12 neurons by 13.1+/-3.4 mV and triggered action potentials in 5 of them, averaging 18.2+/-9.5 spikes. Current injections depolarized 21 neurons by 29.9+/-8.0 mV and triggered action potentials averaging 17.0+/-2.4 spikes. After a period of prolonged neuronal activation with pulses of 1 nA at 20 Hz for 1 minute, the action potential responses to mechanical stimulation and to current injections were first markedly suppressed (0.2+/-0.2 and 2.1+/-0.7 spikes, respectively) and then enhanced, reaching levels above control (29.0+/-8.0 and 21.7+/-2.6 spikes, respectively) over the subsequent 15 minutes. In contrast, there was no inhibition of the depolarizations caused by mechanical stimulation or current injections. The recovery and enhancement of action potentials, which reached 150+/-5.4% of control values at 15 minutes (n=13), were abrogated by 10 micromol/L of indomethacin and replaced by sustained inhibition for over 15 minutes. Carbacyclin (10 micromol/L) reversed the inhibition and restored action potential responses. Prostacyclin production by cultured nodose neurons was enhanced by arachidonic acid and electrical field stimulation and inhibited by indomethacin. We conclude that prostacyclin provides an autocrine feedback that restores and enhances the responsiveness of arterial baroreceptor neurons after their inhibition from excessive neuronal activation. We speculate that reduced synthesis of neuronal prostacyclin contributes to the resetting phenomenon and the suppressed activity of arterial baroreceptors in hypertension."

During 2519 hours of observation, a morning increase in ischemia coincided with increases in physical and mental activities, and an evening decrease in ischemia coincided with a decline in activities. During the morning, ischemic versus ischemia-free periods were more likely to occur with high levels of physical activity (P < .001). High physical activity triggered ischemia to a lesser but still significant extent (P < .05) in the afternoon but not in the evening (P = NS). High levels of mental activity triggered ischemia significantly during the morning (P < .04) and evening (P < .04) but not in the afternoon. When a residualized score procedure was used to correct ischemic time for each patient's simultaneously measured activities, for hourly heart rates, or for activity-related heart rate fluctuations, the circadian variation in ischemia was still observed (P < .001), with a peak at 6 AM. A significant increase in ischemia occurred immediately after awakening (P < .05), but activity-adjusted increases in morning ischemia persisted (P < .05) for 2 hours after awakening.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Exogenous factors (physical and mental activities) are most potent as triggers of ischemia during the morning hours, and the postural change after awakening contributes to the morning increase in ischemia.

In adolescents and young adults, competitive physical exercise is associated with a significant increase of the risk of sudden death.

In adults, on the other hand, physical activity can be regarded as a \"two-edged sword\": vigorous exertion increases the incidence of acute coronary events in individuals who did not exercise regularly, whereas habitual physical activity reduces the overall risk of myocardial infarction and sudden coronary death by preventing development of coronary artery disease and progression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions."

Idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia, for which there is significant evidence for re-entry within the Purkinje network, is largely curable with catheter ablation. The long QT syndrome comprises a heterogeneous group of ion channel defects leading to prolongation of myocyte repolarization and Torsade de Pointes ventricular tachycardia.

            "abstract": "Although sleep and exercise may seem to be mediated by completely different physiological mechanisms, there is growing evidence for clinically important relationships between these two behaviors. It is known that passive body heating facilitates the nocturnal sleep of healthy elderly people with insomnia. This finding supports the hypothesis that changes in body temperature trigger somnogenic brain areas to initiate sleep. Nevertheless, little is known about how the core and distal thermoregulatory responses to exercise fit into this hypothesis. Such knowledge could also help in reducing sleep problems associated with nocturnal shiftwork. It is difficult to incorporate physical activity into a shiftworker's lifestyle, since it is already disrupted in terms of family commitments and eating habits. A multi-research strategy is needed to identify what the optimal amounts and timing of physical activity are for reducing shiftwork-related sleep problems. The relationships between sleep, exercise and diet are also important, given the recently reported associations between short sleep length and obesity. The cardiovascular safety of exercise timing should also be considered, since recent data suggest that the reactivity of blood pressure to a change in general physical activity is highest during the morning. This time is associated with an increased risk in general of a sudden cardiac event, but more research work is needed to separate the influences of light, posture and exercise per se on the haemodynamic responses to sleep and physical activity following sleep taken at night and during the day as a nap."

Extracellular unit recordings were made from a region previously shown to drive the sympathetic supplies to tail vessels and brown adipose tissue. Neurons that were antidromically activated by stimulation across the intermediate region of the upper lumbar cord (the origin of the tail sympathetic outflow) were selected for study. 2. Non-noxious cooling stimuli were delivered to the animal's shaved trunk by circulating cold instead of warm water through a water jacket. Cooling increased the activity of 21 out of 76 raphé-spinal neurons by 1.0 +/- 0.2 spikes x s(-1) degrees C(-1) for falls in skin temperature of 3-5 degrees C below a threshold of 35.0 +/- 0.6 degrees C. Their responses followed skin temperature in a graded manner, and did so whether or not there was any change in core (rectal) temperature. 3. Indirect observations suggested that seven of the neurons that were activated by skin cooling were also activated by falls in core temperature (by 2.1 +/- 0.7 spikes x s(-1) x degrees C(-1) below a threshold of 36.1 +/- 0.7 degrees C), while the remainder were unaffected by core cooling. 4. An additional 7/76 raphé-spinal neurons showed evidence of inhibition (activity reduced by 2.1 +/- 0.5 spikes x s(-1) x degrees C(-1)) when the trunk skin was cooled. 5. Cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons were found in the nuclei raphé magnus and pallidus, centred at the level of the caudal part of the facial nucleus. Their spinal axons conducted at velocities between 3.4 and 29 m x s(-1) (median 6.8). 6. Drug-induced rises in arterial pressure partially inhibited the discharge of 6/14 cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons. Weak-to-moderate cardiac modulation (10-70 %) was present in arterial pulse-triggered histograms of the activity of 11/21 cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons, and 6/6 showed evidence of ventilatory modulation (two strongly, four weakly) in pump-triggered histograms. 7. Raphé-spinal neurons responded to cooling in the absence of any change in the electroencephalogram pattern (6/6 neurons). 8. Most cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons responded to noxious tail pinch (13/21 inhibited, 6/21 excited), as did most thermally unresponsive raphé-spinal cells in the same region (19/41 excited, 9/41 inhibited). 9. It is suggested that these cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons may constitute a premotor pathway that drives sympathetically mediated cold defences, such as cutaneous vasoconstriction or thermogenesis. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that a brainstem reflex, with additional descending input signalling body core temperature, may mediate autonomic responses to environmental cooling."

Immediate post-deprivation measurement of VO2max showed a small but statistically significant decrease (-3.8 ml min-1 kg-1, STPD), with no difference between exercise and control trials. The final decrement in aerobic power was not due to a loss of motivation, as 88% (21 of 24) of post-deprivation tests still showed a plateau of VO2max; in addition, terminal heart rates (198 vs 195 beats min-1), respiratory exchange ratios (1.14 vs 1.15) and blood lactate levels (12.1 vs 11.8 mmol l-1) were not significantly different after sleep deprivation. The decrease in VO2max was associated with a lower VEmax (127 vs 142 l min-1, BTPS) and a substantial haemodilution (13%). Physiological responses to sub-maximal exercise showed persistence of the normal diurnal rhythm in heart rate and oxygen consumption, with no added effects due to sleep deprivation. However, ratings of perceived exertion (Borg scale) increased significantly throughout sleep deprivation. The findings are consistent with a mild respiratory acidosis, secondary to reduced cortical arousal and/or a progressive depletion of tissue glycogen stores which are not altered appreciably by moderate physical activity."

            "abstract": "Issue:\n        \n      \n      In 2002, (before the establishment of the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee), the Medical Advisory Secretariat conducted a health technology policy assessment on biventricular (BiV) pacing, also called cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). The goal of treatment with BiV pacing is to improve cardiac output for people in heart failure (HF) with conduction defect on ECG (wide QRS interval) by synchronizing ventricular contraction. The Medical Advisory Secretariat concluded that there was evidence of short (6 months) and longer-term (12 months) effectiveness in terms of cardiac function and quality of life (QoL). More recently, a hospital submitted an application to the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee to review CRT, and the Medical Advisory Secretariat subsequently updated its health technology assessment.\n    \n\n\n          Background:\n        \n      \n      Chronic HF results from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the heart to act as a pump. It is estimated that 1% to 5% of the general population (all ages) in Europe have chronic HF. (1;2) About one-half of the patients with HF are women, and about 40% of men and 60% of women with this condition are aged older than 75 years. The incidence (i.e., the number of new cases in a specified period) of chronic HF is age dependent: from 1 to 5 per 1,000 people each year in the total population, to as high as 30 to 40 per 1,000 people each year in those aged 75 years and older. Hence, in an aging society, the prevalence (i.e., the number of people with a given disease or condition at any time) of HF is increasing, despite a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. A recent study revealed 28,702 patients were hospitalized for first-time HF in Ontario between April 1994 and March 1997. (3) Women comprised 51% of the cohort. Eighty-five percent were aged 65 years or older, and 58% were aged 75 years or older. Patients with chronic HF experience shortness of breath, a limited capacity for exercise, high rates of hospitalization and rehospitalization, and die prematurely. (2;4) The New York Heart Association (NYHA) has provided a commonly used functional classification for the severity of HF (2;5): CLASS I: No limitation of physical activity. No symptoms with ordinary exertion.CLASS II: Slight limitations of physical activity. Ordinary activity causes symptoms.CLASS III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Less than ordinary activity causes symptoms. Asymptomatic at rest.CLASS IV: Inability to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms at rest.The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute estimates that 35% of patients with HF are in functional NYHA class I; 35% are in class II; 25%, class III; and 5%, class IV. (5) Surveys (2) suggest that from 5% to 15% of patients with HF have persistent severe symptoms, and that the remainder of patients with HF is evenly divided between those with mild and moderately severe symptoms. Overall, patients with chronic, stable HF have an annual mortality rate of about 10%. (2) One-third of patients with new-onset HF will die within 6 months of diagnosis. These patients do not survive to enter the pool of those with \"chronic\" HF. About 60% of patients with incident HF will die within 3 years, and there is limited evidence that the overall prognosis has improved in the last 15 years. To date, the diagnosis and management of chronic HF has concentrated on patients with the clinical syndrome of HF accompanied by severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Major changes in treatment have resulted from a better understanding of the pathophysiology of HF and the results of large clinical trials. Treatment for chronic HF includes lifestyle management, drugs, cardiac surgery, or implantable pacemakers and defibrillators. Despite pharmacologic advances, which include diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, spironolactone, and digoxin, many patients remain symptomatic on maximally tolerated doses.\n    \n\n\n          The technology:\n        \n      \n      Owing to the limitations of drug therapy, cardiac transplantation and device therapies have been used to try to improve QoL and survival of patients with chronic HF. Ventricular pacing is an emerging treatment option for patients with severe HF that does not respond well to medical therapy. Traditionally, indications for pacing include bradyarrhythmia, sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block, and other indications, including combined sick sinus syndrome with atrioventricular block and neurocardiogenic syncope. Recently, BiV pacing as a new, adjuvant therapy for patients with chronic HF and mechanical dyssynchrony has been investigated. Ventricular dysfunction is a sign of HF; and, if associated with severe intraventricular conduction delay, it can cause dyssynchronous ventricular contractions resulting in decreased ventricular filling. The therapeutic intent is to activate both ventricles simultaneously, thereby improving the mechanical efficiency of the ventricles. About 30% of patients with chronic HF have intraventricular conduction defects. (6) These conduction abnormalities progress over time and lead to discoordinated contraction of an already hemodynamically compromised ventricle. Intraventricular conduction delay has been associated with clinical instability and an increased risk of death in patients with HF. (7) Hence, BiV pacing, which involves pacing left and right ventricles simultaneously, may provide a more coordinated pattern of ventricular contraction and thereby potentially reduce QRS duration, and intraventricular and interventricular asynchrony. People with advanced chronic HF, a wide QRS complex (i.e., the portion of the electrocardiogram comprising the Q, R, and S waves, together representing ventricular depolarization), low left ventricular ejection fraction and contraction dyssynchrony in a viable myocardium and normal sinus rhythm, are the target patients group for BiV pacing. One-half of all deaths in HF patients are sudden, and the mode of death is arrhythmic in most cases. Internal cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) combined with BiV pacemakers are therefore being increasingly considered for patients with HF who are at high risk of sudden death. CURRENT IMPLANTATION TECHNIQUE FOR CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION: Conventional dual-chamber pacemakers have only 2 leads: 1 placed in the right atrium and the other in the right ventricle. The technique used for BiV pacemaker implantation also uses right atrial and ventricular pacing leads, in addition to a left ventricle lead advanced through the coronary sinus into a vein that runs along the ventricular free wall. This permits simultaneous pacing of both ventricles to allow resynchronization of the left ventricle septum and free wall. MODE OF OPERATION: Permanent pacing systems consist of an implantable pulse generator that contains a battery and electronic circuitry, together with 1 (single-chamber pacemaker) or 2 (dual-chamber pacemaker) leads. Leads conduct intrinsic atrial or ventricular signals to the sensing circuitry and deliver the pulse generator charge to the myocardium (muscle of the heart). COMPLICATIONS OF BIVENTRICULAR PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION: The complications that may arise when a BiV pacemaker is implanted are similar to those that occur with standard pacemaker implantation, including pneumothorax, perforation of the great vessels or the myocardium, air embolus, infection, bleeding, and arrhythmias. Moreover, left ventricular pacing through the coronary sinus can be associated with rupture of the sinus as another complication. CONCLUSION OF 2003 REVIEW OF BIVENTRICULAR PACEMAKERS BY THE MEDICAL ADVISORY SECRETARIAT: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) the Medical Advisory Secretariat retrieved analyzed chronic HF patients that were assessed for up to 6 months. Other studies have been prospective, but nonrandomized, not double-blinded, uncontrolled and/or have had a limited or uncalculated sample size. Short-term studies have focused on acute hemodynamic analyses. The authors of the RCTs reported improved cardiac function and QoL up to 6 months after BiV pacemaker implantation; therefore, there is level 1 evidence that patients in ventricular dyssynchrony who remain symptomatic after medication might benefit from this technology. Based on evidence made available to the Medical Advisory Secretariat by a manufacturer, (8) it appears that these 6-month improvements are maintained at 12-month follow-up. To date, however, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of combined ICD/BiV devices in patients with chronic HF with prolonged QRS intervals. SUMMARY OF UPDATED FINDINGS SINCE THE 2003 REVIEW: Since the Medical Advisory Secretariat's review in 2003 of biventricular pacemakers, 2 large RCTs have been published: COMPANION (9) and CARE-HF. (10) The characteristics of each trial are shown in Table 1. The COMPANION trial had a number of major methodological limitations compared with the CARE-HF trial.

            "abstract": "Idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (IVT) represents 10% of all cases of VT and is usually observed in young subjects. The origin of the VT may be right ventricular, especially in the infundibulum, giving rise to runs of VT with inter-critical ventricular extrasystoles of the same morphology, or to paroxysmal sustained exercise-induced VT; they usually show left bundle branch block with right axis deviation: the triggering mechanism is probably a parasystole incompletely protected from the sinus rhythm (for the runs of VT) whereas the mechanism of maintenance is probably that of triggered repetitive activity (for the runs and paroxysmal forms of VT). When the origin is in the left ventricle, the VT shows right bundle branch block and left axis deviation and is typically paroxysmal and sustained, triggered by coupled atrial stimulation and followed by a post-tachycardial syndrome; these forms are probably due to reentry into or near to the left posterior hemibranch. These forms of IVT are unique by: 1) their triggering by acceleration of the heart rate, especially during the day, on effort or during an emotion; 2) the usual absence of late ventricular potentials on surface recordings; 3) their capricious outcome, usually good with 92% survival at 10 years; 4) their response to drugs (verapamil, betablockers and/or adenosine) which are relatively ineffective against other forms of VT; 5) their tendency to recur often leading to radiofrequency ablation procedures (80% success rate).

The ISA effect of pindolol was evident at rest in that the heart rate of 82 +/- 4 beats/min was higher than with propranolol (70 +/- 3). At low levels of exercise heart rate, cardiac output and O2 consumption (VO2) were still higher. However, there was no difference in cardiac output or VO2 at higher levels of exercise and no difference in the VO2 at the anaerobic threshold and peak exercise. Peak VO2 was 1,344 +/- 108 ml/min with propranolol and 1,350 +/- 116 with pindolol therapy. There were also no differences in ejection fraction or cardiac volumes at rest or during exercise. The incidence of side effects was similar with both drugs and there was no significant preference for either medication. In conclusion, patients with angina treated with pindolol had the same peak exercise performance as with an 8:1 equivalent dose of propranolol (clinically equivalent), although at lower levels of exercise, VO2, cardiac output and heart rate were higher from the ISA of pindolol."

            "abstract": "ICI 141,292 is a new beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug. The beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonistic effect of ICI 141,292 was examined in a double-blind, randomised crossover study in eight healthy young volunteers and compared with atenolol. Three doses of ICI 141,292 (1, 2 and 4 mg) and atenolol 5 mg were administered intravenously. The attenuation in exercise induced tachycardia varied between 16.0 and 21.2% (P less than 0.01). A significant reduction in blood pressure could be demonstrated following all three doses of ICI 141,292 and atenolol during exercise. At rest in the sitting position HR decreased approximately 8% following all three doses of ICI 141,292 and 14.9% after atenolol 5 mg. No changes in blood pressure were observed under resting conditions after any of the drugs. In six patients with ischaemic heart disease the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity following intravenous administration of four sequential doses (0.5, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg) of ICI 141,292 was examined. HR decreased 7% (P less than 0.05) following ICI 141,292 1 mg with no further decrease following the succeeding doses. Cardiac output decreased 5.2% (P less than 0.05) following a cumulative dose of 4 mg. No significant changes were observed in mean arterial blood pressure, stroke volume or total peripheral resistance whereas an increase in supine resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 3.4 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) could be demonstrated. ICI 141,292 seems to be a potent (at least five times as potent as atenolol) beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent possessing moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activity."

Sixteen patients with RR pacemakers and a mean age of 56 (range 22-77) years were involved in a double-blind crossover study to assess their exercise capacity (treadmill testing), symptomatology, and quality of life (structured questionnaires). Pacemakers were implanted because of symptomatic heart block or sick sinus syndrome. Ventricular demand pacemakers were randomly programmed into the constant rate (VVI) or RR pacing modes for four-week study periods. All patients exercised longer in the RR mode than in the VVI mode (570 +/- 29 vs. 437 +/- 17 s, p less than 0.001). Statistically significant improvements in \"shortness of breath\" and \"energy during daily activities\" as measured by a 10-point scale were reported in the RR pacing mode by the patients and were also observed by their close relatives. Symptoms such as \"chest pain\" and \"palpitations\" were not worsened during RR pacing. Nondisease-specific \"quality of life\" was studied in 11 patients using the Nottingham Health Profile which showed a trend for an improved quality of life in five of the six dimensions of perceived health, although none of the changes were statistically significant.

Skeletal muscle effects were assessed by resting tremor and fenoterol induced tremor. 4 Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor antagonism was assessed by measuring the effect on resting heart rate and on maximum heart rate in a standard exercise test. 5 Pindolol tended to cause least change from placebo in resting spirometry, caused significant tremor response, inhibited the fenoterol airway response, and tended to protect against inhaled histamine. 6 Atenolol 60 mg was the only drug to allow a fenoterol airway response similar to placebo. Atenolol increased the inhaled histamine responsiveness. 7 Propranolol 160 mg caused the most reduction in spirometry but also tended to cause the maximum reduction in exercise heart rate.

            "abstract": "Ocular vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and age-related macular degeneration, whose population increases along with aging, have become leading causes of severe visual disturbance. Macular edema and serous retinal detachment are associated with abnormal vascular leakage and tractional retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma is caused by retinal neovascularization. Such ocular vascular diseases are caused by vascular cell aging and vascular damage associated with lifestyle-related diseases including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. In the present study, we investigated molecular mechanisms in such vascular deficiencies using vascular cell biology methodology, and we propose novel strategies for the treatment of such vascular diseases. Along with aging, oxidative stress and physical stress, such as mechanical stretch, continuously and directly insult vascular cells. Such stress induces apoptosis by intracellular signaling through stress kinases in cultured retinal vascular cells. Inhibition of such stress kinases could be an effective treatment to protect the vascular cells against age-related damage. In a retinal vascular developmental model, pericyte loss causes pathology mimicking macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang 1) secreted by pericytes suppresses oxidative stress-induced intracellular signaling through stress kinases linked to cell apoptosis and normalizes such retinal pathology. This suggests that the paracrine action of Ang 1 in the pericytes is necessary to sustain normal retinal vasculature, and that Ang 1-triggered intracellular signaling is useful for the treatment of vascular cell pathology associated with pericyte loss. In diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion, retinal vessels regress along with retinal vascular cell apoptosis, and the retina becomes ischemic followed by pathological retinal neovascularization. VEGF has been recognized as a predominant factor to induce the ischemic retinal neovascularization. We found that retinal vascular cells have a characteristic pattern in VEGF receptor expression, which causes vascular pathology more frequently in the retina than in other organs. Neuropilin 1 (NRP 1), which enhances VEGF receptor function, is abundantly expressed in the retinal endothelial cells and is upregulated by VEGF itself and by hypoxia to regulate a positive feedback mechanism in retinal neovascularization. This receptor could be a unique target for retina-specific therapy. Lifestyle-related diseases increase along with aging and have further increased due to changes in Japanese lifestyle imitating that of Western countries. We found that the renin-angiotensin system which regulates hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, and adipocytokines which are abnormally secreted in obesity, act as proangiogenic factors. Regulation of such lifestyle-related disease factors is important for the treatment of retinal vascular diseases. Finally, we found that erythropoietin is an ischemia-induced angiogenic factor that acts independently and as potently as VEGF in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Our study utilizing human vitreous samples demonstrates that the VEGF level is particularly high and strongly associated with angiogenic activity in PDR patients. The potential of VEGF inhibitors has recently been recognized in clinical applications. The manipulation of each angiogenic factor and adipocytokine that we report here could become potential therapy in the near future."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The most common form of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is repetitive monomorphic VT (RMVT), which is characterized by frequent ventricular ectopy and salvos of nonsustained VT with intervening sinus rhythm. Unlike most other forms of idiopathic VT, this tachycardia typically occurs at rest and is nonsustained. The mechanism of RMVT is undefined. Because of a common site of origin, the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), we hypothesized that RMVT is mechanistically related to paroxysmal sustained, exercise-induced VT, which has been shown to be consistent with cAMP-mediated triggered activity. Therefore, in this study, we sought to identify (1) the mechanism of RMVT at the cellular level by using electropharmacological probes known to activate either stimulatory or inhibitory G proteins and thereby modify intracellular cAMP levels, (2) potential autonomic triggers of RMVT through analysis of heart rate variability, and (3) whether well-characterized somatic activating mutations in the stimulatory G protein, G alpha s, underlie RMVT.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Twelve patients with RMVT underwent electrophysiological study. Sustained monomorphic VT was reproducibly initiated and terminated with programmed stimulation and/or isoproterenol infusion in 11 of the 12 patients (the other patient had incessant RMVT). Induction of VT demonstrated cycle length dependence and was facilitated by rapid atrial or ventricular pacing. Termination of VT occurred in response to interventions that either lowered stimulated levels of intracellular cAMP (and thus decreased intracellular Ca2+)--ie, adenosine (12 of 12), vagal maneuvers or edrophonium (8 of 9), and beta-blockade (3 of 5)--or directly decreased the slow-inward calcium current--ie, verapamil (10 of 12). Analysis of heart rate variability during 24-hour ambulatory monitoring in 7 patients showed that the sinus heart rate is increased and accelerates before nonsustained VT (P < .05), whereas high-frequency heart rate variability is unchanged. These findings are consistent with transient increases in sympathetic tone preceding nonsustained VT. Finally, myocardial biopsy samples were obtained from the site of origin of the VT (typically the RVOT) and from the right ventricular apex from 9 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from each biopsy sample, and three exons of G alpha s in which activating mutations have previously been described were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. All sequences from these regions were found to be identical to that of control.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although the arrhythmia occurs at rest, the constellation of findings in idiopathic VT that is characterized by RMVT is consistent with the mechanism of cAMP-mediated triggered activity. Therefore, the spectrum of VT resulting from this mechanism includes not only paroxysmal exercise-induced VT but also RMVT."

            "abstract": "To study the interrelationship between myocardial norepinephrine content, left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function, morphological changes, and plasma catecholamine concentrations, 20 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy underwent endomyocardial biopsy and ventricular angiography. The strongest correlation was found between LV ejection fraction (EF) and myocardial norepinephrine content (r = 0.87; p less than 0.001). Myocardial norepinephrine content was much weaker correlated to RV EF (r = .55; p less than 0.005), and no correlation was found to morphological changes or plasma norepinephrine concentration. The hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of hydralazine versus captopril after the first dose were compared in a crossover trial including 15 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Hydralazine induced increases in heart rate and cardiac index (p less than 0.01) and decreases in mean arterial pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.005, respectively). These hemodynamic effects were associated with increased plasma norepinephrine concentrations during upright exercise (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma renin activity (p less than 0.01). After captopril, norepinephrine plasma concentrations showed a tendency to lower levels during upright exercise, although mean arterial pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that, in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial norepinephrine depletion strongly reflects left ventricular dysfunction. The different patterns of neurohumoral response to hydralazine versus captopril may be important for their long-term effect and for the prognosis of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. It remains to be established whether the myocardial catecholamine content is differently influenced by either drug, and whether this effect is related to the drug response after long-term treatment."

            "abstract": "Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is an uncommon form of arrhythmia which is characterized by an exaggerated increase in heart rate that is out of proportion to normal physiologic demands. Usually, IST is triggered by orthostasis, minimal exertion, and psychological stress. The etiology of IST remains ill-defined. However, proposed mechanisms include: enhanced sinus node automaticity, alterations in autonomic function associated with increased sympathetic activity or reduced parasympathetic activity, and impaired baroreflex control. Recently, increased levels of autoantibodies to beta-adrenergic receptors have been observed in patients with IST. The clinical presentation of IST is highly varied and ranges from short episodes of palpitations associated with dyspnea, atypical precordial pain, cephalalgia, fatigue, and occasional syncope and presyncope to incapacitating incessant tachycardia. In general, IST is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is important that other causes of sinus tachycardia are excluded before making a diagnosis. Evaluation of autonomic function is essential for a diagnosis of IST. Treatment of IST is based on autonomic function findings and involves multidisciplinary management, including cardiac rehabilitation. Control and restitution of normal autonomic function is essential. The prognosis is benign though regular follow-up is required to optimize therapy."

            "abstract": "A triple risk model for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as described by Filiano and Kinney involves the intersection of three risks: (1) a vulnerable infant, (2) a critical developmental period in homeostatic control, and (3) an exogenous stressor(s). The triple risk model aptly describes the dynamics of an animal model for SIDS: (1) a vulnerable animal that is young and magnesium deficient: (2) a critical developmental period revealed by hyperirritability, labile cardiovascular and respiratory control; and (3) an exogenous stressor such as soft, high-pitched noise; motion or handling; or a chill. Together these three risks may trigger a shock-like episode of apnea, unconsciousness and bradycardia. The lung is the shock organ. An animal that dies quietly or after physical activity following the episode, models SIDS. However, if the shock-like episode resolves spontaneously or after resuscitation, the survivor is a model for an apparent life-threatening episode (ALTE). If, while still in the critical developmental period the ALTE survivor is stressed again, there is a risk for a recurrent episode, with the final outcome still unpredictable but with increasing risk for SIDS with multiple recurrences. The purpose of this communication is to present an illustrated review of the magnesium deficient weanling rat as an animal model for SIDS/ALTE, showing pertinent physical, electrocardiographic and pathological features. In the weanling rat, magnesium deficiency appears to be the single common pathway upon which multiple stressors may impinge to produce sudden death during the relatively brief critical developmental period, while magnesium supplements may protect the animal. If significant magnesium deficiency is subsequently diagnosed in a properly controlled study of human SIDS tissue, it is likely that a high proportion of SIDS deaths could be prevented by simple oral magnesium supplementation to infants during the first critical weeks and months of life."

The medications (PRO: 80 mg x 2/day, PIN: 10 mg x 2/day, for seven days) were given in a placebo (PLA) controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over fashion. Both the drugs reduced heart rate and blood pressure during exercise equally compared with the placebo. The oxygen uptake at submaximal work loads, as well as at the maximum, was constantly and equally reduced by PRO and PIN compared with PLA. The anaerobic threshold was reached at a slightly lower oxygen uptake for both the drugs compared with the placebo (P < 0.05). No significant difference was, however, observed in the work levels at which the ventilatory anaerobic threshold was reached. Moreover, the gross efficiency, i.e. the amount of work performed at a certain energy consumption level (aerobic + anaerobic), was increased by both PRO (26.7 +/- 0.5%, P < 0.02 vs PLA: 24.7 +/- 0.5%) and PIN (26.5 +/- 0.5%, P < 0.05 vs PLA) at a submaximal work load of 240 W. The results indicate that beta-blocking agents propranolol and pindolol slightly and equally reduce maximal work performance, but increase the efficiency of submaximal work in a way that a certain amount of external work can be done with smaller consumption of oxygen.

            "abstract": "During the past 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity in the United States and other developed nations. Recent studies indicate that adipose tissue is an endocrine organ producing numerous proteins, collectively referred to as adipokines, with broad biological activity, that play an important autocrine role in obesity-associated complications. Adipose tissue in general and visceral fat in particular are thought to be key regulators of inflammation. Inflammation is heavily involved in the onset and development of atherothrombotic disease. Moreover, chronic inflammation may also represent a triggering factor in the origin of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. According to a hypothesis, stimuli such as overnutrition, physical inactivity, and aging would result in cytokine hypersecretion and eventually lead to insulin resistance and diabetes in genetically or metabolically predisposed individuals. This article discusses the current understanding of important adipokines thought to be involved in the metabolic and cardiovascular risk associated with obesity. Available evidence linking fat removal by liposuction to modification of cardiovascular risk and vascular inflammatory markers in the obese patient is also presented. Most studies have shown that liposuction produces beneficial effects on insulin resistance and vascular inflammation in the obese patient, reducing its cardiovascular risk. Besides having a significant role in body contouring of the obese patient at the end of the lengthy process of bariatric surgery and massive weight loss, plastic surgery should be incorporated into a multifaceted program of lifestyle changes that allows the obese patient to obtain weight loss and, more importantly, to maintain the reduced weight in the long term."

            "abstract": "Although the prevailing view of mechanoelectric feedback (MEF) in the heart is in terms of longitudinal cell stretch, other mechanical forces are considerable during the cardiac cycle, including intramyocardial pressure and shear stress. Their contribution to MEF is largely unknown. In this study, mechanical stimuli in the form of localized fluid jet pulses were applied to neonatal rat ventricular cells cultured as confluent monolayers. Such pulses result in pressure and shear stresses (but not longitudinal stretch) in the monolayer at the point of impingement. The goal was to determine whether these mechanical stimuli can trigger excitation, initiate a propagated wave, and induce reentry. Cells were stained with the voltage-sensitive dye RH237, and multi-site optical mapping was used to record the spread of electrical activity in isotropic and anisotropic monolayers. Pulses (10 ms) with velocities ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 m/s were applied from a 0.4-mm diameter nozzle located 1 mm above the cell monolayer. Fluid jet pulses resulted in circular wavefronts that propagated radially from the stimulus site. The likelihood for mechanical stimulation was quantified as an average stimulus success rate (ASSR). ASSR increased with jet amplitude and time waited between stimuli and decreased with the application of gadolinium and streptomycin, blockers of stretch-activated channels, but not with nifedipine, a blocker of the L-type Ca channel. Absence of cellular injury was confirmed by smooth propagation maps and propidium iodide stains. In rare instances, the mechanical pulse resulted in the induction of reentrant activity. We conclude that mechanical stimuli other than stretch can evoke action potentials, propagated activity, and reentrant arrhythmia in two-dimensional sheets of cardiac cells."

Furthermore, it may be the predisposing factor for myocardial infarction triggered by physical exertion. The authors have shown that systolic BP achieved after 6 minutes of exercise is the strongest predictor of left ventricular hypertrophy. Furthermore, a 37 mm Hg increase in systolic BP above resting BP at 6 minutes of exercise was the threshold for left ventricular hypertrophy. The purpose of this study was to determine predictors of exercise BP response in normotensive and hypertensive women.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An exercise tolerance test (Bruce) was performed by 1411 normotensive (resting BP < 140/90 mm Hg) and hypertensive (resting BP > or = 140/90 mm Hg) women. These women were faculty, students, and staff at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, and the George Washington University Medical Center, as well as patients undergoing a routine exercise tolerance test at West Coast Cardiology, Pinellas Park, Florida.

In a stepwise multiple-regression analysis, the determinants of BP after 6 minutes of exercise were resting systolic BP and treadmill time to exhaustion (R2 = 0.36) for normotensive women and treadmill time to exhaustion and resting systolic BP (R2 = 0.30) for hypertensive women. When fitness categories were contrasted, low-fit women in both the normotensive and hypertensive categories had higher BP and rate-pressure product after 6 minutes of exercise than the high-fit women (P <.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Resting systolic BP and cardiorespiratory fitness are determinants of a submaximal exercise BP response for both hypertensive and normotensive women. Low cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with a higher BP response during submaximal exercise, suggesting that increased fitness may attenuate this abnormal rise in BP. Thus, low- to moderate-intensity physical activities for most days of the week should be encouraged for all women to increase cardiorespiratory fitness. This is likely to attenuate an abnormal rise in systolic BP that may occur during routine daily activities and protect against the associated health consequences."

            "abstract": "This article provides an overview of the role of metabolite toxicity, low-grade inflammation and disturbed cellular signaling in obesity, glucose intolerance and diabetes. It also highlights links between this continuum of deteriorating glucose tolerance and atherosclerosis. Obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease are all related to diet and to the level of physical activity. They have reached epidemic proportions worldwide. Glucose intolerance and diabetes increase the risk of atherosclerotic events. Moreover, obesity, and glucose intolerance or diabetes, are components of the metabolic syndrome, which also imparts an increased cardiovascular risk. There is increasing recognition that common mechanisms contribute to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Following increased calorie intake and/or decreased physical activity, fuel metabolism generates excess of 'toxic' metabolites, particularly glucose and fatty acids. Homeostasis is affected by the endocrine output from the adipose tissue. Reactive oxygen species are generated, creating oxidative stress, which exerts major effects on signaling pathways, further affecting cellular metabolism and triggering low-grade inflammatory reaction. This perspective on the diabetic syndrome has been reflected in the approach to its treatment, which integrates maintenance of glycemic control with primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention. Laboratory medicine should support diabetes care with an integrated package of tests which, in addition to glycemic control, enable assessment and monitoring of the risk of microvascular complications as well as cardiovascular disease."

Subjective assessment showed improved 'general wellbeing' and preference for 175 ms rate responsive AVD (P less than 0.01) or 125 ms fixed AVD (P less than 0.05). The longest fixed AVD setting (250 ms) was least acceptable and had increased symptom prevalence (P less than 0.02).

Telemetry transmitters were implanted in Wistar rats in the peritoneal cavity with a pressure catheter in the aorta and electrodes for electrocardiogram (ECG) recording subcutaneously. After a single oral administration of saline, each rat was administered single oral doses of 5, 15 and 45 mg/kg b.w. of caffeine. Caffeine was found to induce, to various degrees, a dose-dependent early increase in spontaneous physical activity, heart rate, dp/dt and systolic-diastolic blood pressure. No arrhythmias or visual changes were observed in the ECG complex. High doses induced more strong responses and of longer duration. The increase in systolic blood pressure at the median dose remained in the rats until 20 h after administration. However, the highest dose of caffeine (45 mg/kg b.w.) induced a biphasic response, with an early and pronounced increase in body temperature, spontaneous physical activity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure that later decreased, except for the systolic blood pressure. The results show that the dose level for long-lasting signs of intoxication to develop in the rat, in terms of effects on spontaneous physical activity, body temperature and cardiovascular function, was reached after a single oral dose of caffeine at 45 mg/kg b.w."

Both therapeutic regimens significantly reduced blood pressure (13/13 mmHg for atenolol and 17/10 mmHg for methyldopa) in an erect position. The higher dose of methyldopa gave a further significant reduction only for the systolic standing blood pressure. No statistical difference was found between the antihypertensive activity of the two drugs, but atenolol reduced heart rate more than did methyldopa. Side effects occurred more frequently during methyldopa administration and most often during the first days of treatment. During exercise (treadmill test) the two drugs induced the same antihypertensive response, but atenolol provoked a greater reduction of exercise tachycardia. Whereas total oxygen consumption was not affected by the two drugs, atenolol induced a much greater reduction of the myocardial oxygen consumption evaluated by the product of the systolic blood pressure X heart rate. These findings show that atenolol at the 100-mg daily dose is as effective as the full dosage of methyldopa and in addition shows better tolerance, a simpler therapeutic scheme, and less incidence of side effects."

In the absence of any side-effects, bunitrolol shows a higher degree of beta-adrenergic receptor bocking activity than practolol, with a distinct specificity towards myocardial receptors and very low cardiodepressive properties at rest. Bunitrolol caused a marked reduction (33%) in exercise-induced myocardial work effort, whilst practolol achieved a reduction of only 17% under equal conditions. Thus, the same physical work load is performed after bunitrolol more economically by decreasing both heart rate and blood pressure. The circulatory effects of an intravenous dose of 5 mg bunitrolol seems to be twice as effective as 10 mg practolol. This implies that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by bunitrolol during work performance is four times as effective as practolol.

            "abstract": "Sudden cardiac and cerebral events are most common in the morning. A fundamental question is whether these events are triggered by the increase in physical activity after waking, and/or a result of circadian variation in the responses of circulatory function to exercise. Although signaling pathways from the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei to sites of circulatory control are not yet understood, it is known that cerebral blood flow, autoregulation and cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in CO(2) are impaired in the morning and, therefore, could explain the increased risk of cerebrovascular events. Blood pressure (BP) and the rate pressure product (RPP) show marked 'morning surges' when people are studied in free-living conditions, making the rupture of a fragile atherosclerotic plaque and sudden cardiac event more likely. Since cerebral autoregulation is reduced in the morning, this surge in BP may also exacerbate the risk of hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes in the presence of other acute and chronic risk factors. Increased sympathetic activity, decreased endothelial function, and increased platelet aggregability could also be important in explaining the morning peak in cardiac and cerebral events but how these factors respond to exercise at different times of day is unclear. Evidence is emerging that the exercise-related responses of BP and RPP are increased in the morning when prior sleep is controlled. We recommend that such 'semi-constant routine' protocols are employed to examine the relative influence of the body clock and exogenous factors on the 24-h variation in other circulatory factors."

In case-crossover analyses, the risk of sudden cardiac death was transiently elevated during moderate to vigorous exertion (relative risk [RR], 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-4.60; P = .01) compared with the risk during lesser or no exertion. Habitual moderate to vigorous exertion modified this transient risk (P = .005 for interaction) and the risk was no longer significantly elevated among those who exercised 2 or more hours per week. In the cohort analyses, an increasing amount of moderate to vigorous exercise was associated with a lower long-term risk of sudden cardiac death in age-adjusted and multivariable models that excluded biological intermediates (P = .006 for trend). This relationship was attenuated when biological intermediates were included (P = .06 for trend); however, the reduction in risk remained significant among women who exercised 4 or more hours per week (adjusted RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.83; P = .01) compared with women who did not exercise.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese prospective data suggest that sudden cardiac death during exertion is an extremely rare event in women. Regular exercise may significantly minimize this small transient risk and may lower the overall long-term risk of sudden cardiac death.\n"

Regional myocardial perfusion and ischaemia were assessed by measurement of the uptake of rubidium-82 with positron tomography after mental arithmetic and physical exercise. With mental arithmetic, 12 (75%) patients had abnormalities of regional perfusion, accompanied in only 6 by ST-segment depression and in 4 of these 6 by angina, leaving 6 patients with perfusion abnormalities but neither pain nor electrocardiographic changes. After exercise, all the patients showed abnormal regional myocardial perfusion in the segments that became ischaemic with mental arithmetic.

Repeated daily administration of m-CPP to rats induces rapid tolerance to these effects of m-CPP. As m-CPP has been used in challenge tests and in preliminary treatment trials in humans, we evaluated the possible development of tolerance to m-CPP in ten healthy human volunteers using a double-blind, random assignment crossover study of placebo versus daily m-CPP infusions. Psychological and physical symptoms of anxiety, temperature, pupil size, diastolic blood pressure, and plasma ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin concentrations were increased by the first administration of m-CPP (0.08 mg/kg) compared to placebo. All of these responses were attenuated on m-CPP days 2 and 3. Plasma m-CPP levels did not differ across the 3 m-CPP days. Repeated m-CPP administration thus appears to induce rapid tolerance to its behavioral and physiological effects in humans. Further investigations of the mechanisms involved in the development of subsensitivity to m-CPP may contribute to increased understanding of the regulation of serotonin-mediated functions and of anxiety disorders."

We propose that this view is oversimplified. For example, high levels of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with lower mortality, even in those who are overweight or obese. To address this issue, we combine epidemiological and physiological evidence in a new paradigm that integrates excess calorie intake, sedentary behavior, and a maladaptive response to stress. Human physiology is optimized to allow large distances to be covered on foot every day in order to find enough food to sustain brain metabolism. Furthermore, when the body is immobilized by an injury, it triggers efficient life-saving metabolic and inflammatory responses. Both these critical adaptations are, however, confounded by a sedentary lifestyle. The implications of these issues for clinical trial design and epidemiologic data analysis are discussed in this article."

After the initial administration of both dosages, compared to placebo there were significant reductions in exercise-induced ST-segment depression and significant increases in ischemia-free exercise time at all times of testing. At 12 hours, the 100-mg dosage still amounted to greater than 50% of its maximum and was significantly more marked than the 50 mg dose. Accordingly, the 100-mg dosage can be assumed to confer a longer duration of action. At the end of 3 weeks of long-term treatment, the significant antiischemic effects were not diminished versus those observed after initial administration. There was no evidence of tolerance development with either dosage. The IS-5-MN plasma concentration during long-term administration displayed, within the 24-hour treatment cycle, a clear decrease to low baseline values and a marked 5- to 7-fold increase after the daily dose in accordance with the response known to be prerequisite to successful interval treatment. Thus, the once-daily administration of IS-5-MN SR with dosages of 50 mg and, more markedly, 100 mg, provides effective antiischemic protection throughout the daily period of most physical activities in patients with stable angina pectoris."

Twenty-eight patients with documented coronary artery disease underwent ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram. Physical activity and perceived mental status were recorded by patients in a diary which was then graded according to intensity of the activity. Analyses of the continuous electrocardiographic recordings were done separately from the analysis of the diaries. The time of each episode of ischemia, the duration of each episode in minutes and the number of episodes in each 24-hour period were calculated. A total of 372 episodes of ST-segment depression occurred in 912 hours of monitoring. Ischemic events occurring during usual physical and usual mental activities were most frequent (36%). Twenty-six percent of ischemic episodes occurred during increased physical activity, but usual mental activities. Interestingly, 22% of the ischemic events occurred at high levels of mental stress, but low physical activity. Ten percent of episodes occurred during sleep. Although the majority of events occurred during usual daily activities, when duration of ischemia was normalized for time spent in each category, increasing physical or mental activity was associated with an increasing duration of ischemia per unit (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

THE AIMS OF OUR STUDY: 1. the analysis of possibility of utility of recipient atrial sinus node as natural biosensor for triggered donor atrium permanent pacing in transplanted patients with SND. 2. the evaluation of pacing and sensing conditions of the recipient's atrium in the some pts.. 3. long-term observation of effectiveness A2A2T(/D) pacing mode.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      10 out of 37 pts. received A2A2T (8 pts.) and A2A2T/D (2 pts) pacing systems. In pts. with NSR of recipients atrium, we evaluated acceleration of its frequency during slight exercise and atropine.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In recipient's atrium among 37 pts we recognized NSR only in 15/37 pts.; in the remaining 22 pts. we found: sinus bradycardia--in 3, atrial flutter--in 3, low voltage AF--in 12 and no electrical activity--in 4 pts. Positive response to isometric exercise and atropine was observed in 12/15 pts. and 8 of them received A2A2T or A2A2T/D pacing system. We found much better sensing and pacing conditions in donor (A wave 2.1 mV, p. threshold 0.8 V) than in recipient atrium (1.1 mV and 1.4 V respectively). We observed some problems with sensing of recipient atrium in 4 of 10 pts. and changes SST to AAI-R mode solved the problem without loss of atrial resynchronization. 9 out of 10 pts. preferred AAT to AAI-R pacing program. One dislodged lead required revision during postoperative period (1/44, 2%). There was no dislodgement related to endomyocardial biopsy. In one patient, atrial flutter in recipient atria was transmitted to atrium of transplanted heart by pacing system with 2:1 conduction; arrhythmia was interrupted with drugs and did not return.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      1. Atrial resynchronization is possible only in about 1/4 patients with SND after OHT due to frequently noted electrophysiological changes in recipient atrium. 2. In transplanted heart patients sensing and pacing conditions are much more favorable in donor's than recipient's atrium. 3. Atrial resynchronization can be subjectively (positively) recognised by most of patient after OHT and it still remains a promising pacing mode for selected patients after OHT with SND."

The morning predominance of these events has been well documented in a number of large population studies. This fact provides the stimulus for better understanding our own chronobiology and the periodicity of circadian rhythms which contribute to this predominance of adverse events in the morning hours. We now understand that a number of important physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, vascular reactivity, cardiac contractility, and various hemostatic factors all demonstrate a circadian pattern similar to that described for cardiovascular disorders. Several recent studies have also emphasize the importance of changes in posture, time of awakening, physical activity, mental stress as potential triggers. Circadian patterns have been observed for several supraventricular arrhythmias, premature ventricular beats, ventricular tachycardias including sudden cardiac death. The chronobiological therapeutic systems can help to prevent life threatening events."

The effects of exercise on coronary hemodynamics were determined in eight patients with mild essential uncomplicated hypertension, before and after treatment with furosemide (50 mg, to ensure activation of the renin-angiotensin system). Coronary sinus blood flow was measured by thermodilution technique, intra-arterial blood pressure was measured from the ascending aorta, and plasma renin activity was determined by radioimmunoassay. Oxygen supply and demand were derived (using coronary sinus blood flow multiplied by the arteriovenous oxygen difference to equal oxygen supply and heart rate multiplied by the mean systolic blood pressure to equal oxygen demand) both at rest and during isometric exercise (handgrip to 50 percent of maximal effort for three minutes). The study was a single-blind crossover (furosemide versus placebo) design. Furosemide produced a significant reduction in coronary sinus blood flow, associated with an increase in coronary vascular resistance. Changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate were insignificant. Slight reductions in plasma volume and mean right atrial pressure were observed. During isometric exercise, the increase in oxygen supply for a given increment in oxygen demand was attenuated by furosemide. The contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to this effect was determined by the short-term administration of 25 mg of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Forty-five minutes after oral captopril, coronary reserve was restored to pretreatment values. In conclusion, furosemide modulates coronary reserve, and it is likely that this is because furosemide mediates activation of renin-angiotensin system, thus reducing the vasodilatory capacity of the coronary arteries."

            "abstract": "Information obtained during the past decade suggests that the onset of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death is frequently triggered by daily activities. The importance of physical or mental stress in triggering coronary thrombosis is supported by finding that (1) the frequencies of the onset of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke show marked circadian variations, with similar increases in the period from 6 AM to noon; (2) the frequency of transient myocardial ischemia shows a similar increase in the morning, and episodes are often preceded by mental or physical triggers; (3) a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, often nonobstructive by itself, lies at the base of most coronary thrombi; (4) a number of physiologic processes that could lead to plaque rupture, a hypercoagulable state, or coronary vasoconstriction, are accentuated in the morning; and (5) aspirin and beta-adrenergic blocking agents that affect certain of these processes have been shown to prevent disease onset. The hypothesis presented is that occlusive coronary thrombosis occurs when (1) an atherosclerotic plaque becomes vulnerable to rupture; (2) mental or physical stress causes the plaque to rupture; and (3) increases in coagulability or vasoconstriction, triggered by daily activities, contribute to complete occlusion of the coronary artery lumen. Recognition of the circadian variation--and the possibility of frequent triggering--of the onset of acute disease suggests the need for pharmacologic protection of patients during the vulnerable periods and provides clues to the mechanism of disease onset, the investigation of which may lead to improved methods of prevention."

Long-term effects of regular exercise are particularly advantageous for type 2 diabetic patients. Regular aerobic exercise reduces of visceral fat mass and body weight without decreasing lean body mass, ameliorates insulin sensitivity, glucose and blood pressure control, lipid profile and reduces the cardiovascular risk.

Circadian rhythms are under the influence of, and physiological variables are mediated by the activation of the adrenals, sympathetic/parasympathetic, hypothalamic and pituitary activity. Emotional stress, physical exertion, sleep deprivation and large fatty meals are major triggers of myocardial ischemia, angina, infarction, sudden cardiac death (SCD) and stroke. These events have been reported to exhibit a circadian variation with increased frequency in the second quarter of the day, which has also been observed in our studies on Indians. Recent studies indicate that altered HRV and BPV are also important in the pathogenesis and progression of heart failure, atheroma and thrombosis. Mediation via beta-blockers, oestrogens, n-3 fatty acids, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 and fasting appears to have a beneficial influence whereas progestins, nifedipine, stress and exercise may have an adverse effect on HRV and BPV. We have reported that plasma levels of vitamin E and C are lower in the second quarter of the day than at other times, indicating their role in the pathogenesis of variability and cardiac events. Prospective studies also indicate that HRV and BPV are important and independent risk factors for cardiovascular events. However, no study has yet been conducted in patients with abnormal HRV and BPV in a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial to find out whether improvement in variability can cause a significant reduction in cardiovascular events. There is a need to study the role of n-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, the effect of regular physical training, medication and ACE inhibitors in patients with abnormal HRV and BPV to demonstrate that improving variability can modulate cardiovascular events."

Our goal was to identify the genes in skeletal muscle whose expression is most sensitive to periods of unloading/reduced physical activity and that may be involved in triggering initial responses before phenotypic changes are evident. The ability of short periods of physical activity/loading as an effective countermeasure against changes in gene expression mediated by inactivity was also tested. Affymetrix microarrays were used to compare mRNA levels in the soleus muscle under three experimental treatments (n = 20-29 rats each): 12-h hindlimb unloading (HU), 12-h HU followed by 4 h of intermittent low-intensity ambulatory and postural activity (4-h reloading), and control (with ambulatory and postural activity). Using a combination of criteria, we identified a small set of genes (approximately 1% of 8,738 genes on the array or 4% of significant expressed genes) with the most reproducible and largest responses to altered activity. Analysis revealed a coordinated regulation of transcription for a large number of key signaling proteins and transcription factors involved in protein synthesis/degradation and energy metabolism. Most (21 of 25) of the gene expression changes that were downregulated during HU returned at least to control levels during the reloading. In surprising contrast, 27 of 38 of the genes upregulated during HU remained significantly above control, but most showed trends toward reversal. This introduces a new concept that, in general, genes that are upregulated during unloading/inactivity will be more resistant to periodic reloading than those genes that are downregulated. This study reveals genes that are the most sensitive to loading/activity in rat skeletal muscle and indicates new targets that may initiate muscle alterations during inactivity."

            "abstract": "The anti-ischaemic properties of benazepril, a non-sulfhydryl inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, were assessed in 20 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, by repeated exercise tests and repeated 72-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over; 11 patients received benazepril 10 mg b.i.d. and nine received 20 mg b.i.d. All patients had a positive treadmill stress test and at least three ischaemic episodes during 24 h of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Benazepril at a dose of 10 mg b.i.d. did not improve the exercise duration, the time taken to reach 1 mm ST depression. Similar findings were observed during treatment with 20 mg b.i.d. Benazepril at a dose of 10 mg b.i.d. was ineffective in improving ischaemic parameters during daily activities. However, among the nine patients who received 20 mg b.i.d. the number of ischaemic episodes was reduced from 142 to 103, and the total duration of ischaemic was reduced from 1099 to 531 min. The number of weekly anginal attacks was reduced from 58 to 33, and the weekly sublingual nitroglycerin tablets consumption was reduced from 31 to 14. When the two doses (10 mg and 20 mg) were combined (N = 20), the number of ischaemic episodes was reduced from 314 to 260 (P = 0.074), and the duration of ischaemic was reduced from 3453 to 2514 min (P = 0.072)."

            "abstract": "The clinical applicability of rate-responsive pacing (RRP) by means of activity sensing has been tested in 15 patients. The patients (ages 24-85) had sinus node dysfunction (2), atrial fibrillation (7), or sinus rhythm (6) combined with complete atrioventricular block. Exercise capacity was investigated on a bicycle ergometer and on a treadmill in a double-blind cross-over study design following one week each of fixed rate ventricular pacing (70 bpm) and rate-responsive pacing (60/125-150 bpm). The patients answered a questionnaire concerning subjective symptoms. A Holter ECG was recorded during 24 hours of all day activity on rate-responsive pacing. During exercise in the rate-responsive mode, heart rate increased more on the treadmill than on the bicycle. A majority of the patients (13 of 15) preferred rate-responsive pacing mainly due to less dyspnea and tiredness. Exercise capacity improved significantly both on bicycle (+7%; p less than 0.01) and on treadmill (+19%; p less than 0.01) during rate-responsive pacing. There were no complications during the follow-up period. In conclusion, the activity-sensing pacemaker is a valuable supplement to existing types of pacemakers. It should be used in patients in whom an atrial electrogram cannot be used for rate triggering."

Heart rate (HR) variability was used to study autonomic effects during mental and physical stress and to study circadian variations. Mean 24-hour HR decreased from 77 +/- 7 to 60 +/- 6 beats per minute after atenolol and to 62 +/- 6 beats per minute after metoprolol (P = .046). At baseline, mental performance tasks did not affect HR, but decreased HR variability (SDNN index from 51 +/- 26 to 30 +/- 13 milliseconds [ms], P < .001; high-frequency power from 130 +/- 143 to 110 +/- 125 ms2, P = .046; and low-frequency power from 538 +/- 447 to 290 +/- 275 ms2, P < .001). Both beta-blockers decreased HR during mental performance tasks (P < .001) and increased SDNN index and high-frequency power. Before treatment, bicycle exercise decreased HR variability; root-mean-square of successive difference decreased from 21 +/- 8 to 15 +/- 10 ms (P = .004). beta-Blockade could not prevent this decrease. No differences between atenolol and metoprolol were observed for absolute high- and low-frequency power or after adjustment for HR. Vagal blockade with methylatropine during chronic beta-blocker treatment nearly abolished all components of spectral power.

The point of action in these patients is mainly a reduction in HR, probably due to a reduction in stress-induced sympathetic activation. Clinically significant differences between atenolol and metoprolol were absent, indicating that the degree of lipophilicity does not distinguish among the beta-blockers what their salutary effects are on HR variability during the specific challenges used."

            "title": "Peripheral Arterial Disease – Diagnosis and Treatment: A Systematic Review [Internet].",
            "abstract": "This report summarises the results of SBU’s systematic review of the literature concerning methods of diagnosing and treating symptomatic peripheral arterial disease caused by atherosclerosis or arterial thrombosis in the lower extremities. The project did not include studies of methods to prevent or affect the development or progress of peripheral arterial disease. Many of those methods have been assessed by previous SBU reports: Smoking Cessation Methods (1998), Obesity – Problems and Interventions (2002), Moderately Elevated Blood Pressure (2004), Interventions to Prevent Obesity (2005) and Methods of Promoting Physical Activity (2007).\n    \n\n      \n       Peripheral arterial disease is the result of ischaemia (insufficient blood flow) in the lower extremities. In the great majority of cases, the cause is atherosclerosis – which is among the most common diseases and one that rarely affects the blood vessels of the lower extremities alone, but rather the entire cardiovascular system. Thus, all patients who have symptoms of peripheral arterial disease should be assessed for risk of atherosclerosis.\n    \n\n      \n      Peripheral arterial disease in its mild form may be limited to intermittent claudication, pain in the lower extremities that is triggered by exertion but that ceases during rest. When ischaemia is chronic, critical or acute – characterised by stenosed or occluded blood vessels – peripheral arterial disease increases the risk of tissue death (gangrene), amputation and premature death. \n    \n\n      \n      Because atherosclerosis – the primary cause of peripheral arterial disease – can progress for a long time without producing any direct symptoms, the number of people who have the disease is unknown. The risk increases with age, and peripheral arterial disease occurs among an estimated 10% of people over 60 years. Half (more than 5,000) of the invasive procedures that are performed every year at Swedish hospitals for vascular diseases seek to restore blood flow in patients with various forms of peripheral arterial disease.\n    \n\n      \n      The correlation between smoking and peripheral arterial disease is very strong and has been documented by a large number of studies. The risk that a smoker will develop intermittent claudication is almost double that of developing angina pectoris. Smoking cessation reduces the risk of serious ongoing symptoms, amputation and death due to vascular complications.\n    \n\n      \n      All treatment of peripheral arterial disease includes aggressively affecting the general risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as smoking, physical inactivity, overweight, hypertension, high lipids and high blood sugar.\n    \n\n      \n      Although a review of the literature identified several thousand articles, close examination revealed that only a small percentage of the studies met the criteria for quality and internal validity that have been established by health technology assessment and SBU in particular. As a result, the scientific evidence for the report’s conclusions is limited – or moderately strong at best. The benefits and risks of a number of the treatment methods reviewed by the project could not be assessed due to a lack of studies characterised by sufficient quality and internal validity. Such methods include anticoagulant therapy for intermittent claudication, oestrogen and testosterone therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, spinal cord stimulation, electromagnetic therapy, ultraviolet light therapy and intermittent pneumatic compression. Scientific evidence is also lacking to assess the efficacy of vitamin E, vitamin B / folic acid, Omega-3, garlic and the Padma 28 herbal preparation.\n    \n\n      \n      Peripheral arterial disease has a decisive – often disabling – impact on quality of life, the experience of which varies from person to person. Quality of life, which is among the key goals of all medical treatment, may be defined as an aggregate measure of physical and mental functioning, along with a sense of wellbeing and satisfaction. But clinical practice still takes only limited advantage of opportunities to assess quality of life, i.e., how the patient deals with daily activities and responds to treatment.\n    \n\n      \n      The basic method for diagnosis and assessment of patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease includes assessing medical history with walking distance palpation, and a simple physical examination with a stethoscope, sphygmomanometer cuff and Doppler probe to compare blood pressure in the arms and legs. Such examinations, which may be performed at any health centre or hospital, can identify most patients with peripheral arterial disease.\n    \n\n      \n      To more precisely locate stenoses and any thrombi requires additional assessment. While conventional angiography is still the most common approach, technical progress in recent years has generated a number of new methods for reliably diagnosing peripheral arterial disease. These methods are just as dependable as conventional angiography for designing a treatment strategy, but are gentler, easier, faster and less risky.Duplex ultrasonography has the same high reliability as conventional angiography when it comes to confirming or ruling out vascular disease in the lower abdominal aorta, as well as the arteries of the pelvis, thigh and knee. The scientific evidence is, however, weaker with respect to the certainty of the method for diagnosing changes in the lower leg and foot.Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) using an injected contrast agent has the same high reliability as conventional angiography when it comes to confirming or ruling out vascular disease in the abdominal aorta below the kidneys, as well as the arteries of the pelvis and thigh. The scientific evidence is not as strong in terms of identifying stenoses in the arteries of the lower leg.MRA that does not use an injected contrast agent has the same high reliability as conventional angiography when it comes to confirming or ruling out vascular disease in the arteries of the thigh and lower leg. MRA is not as reliable for identifying changes in the abdominal aorta below the kidneys and in the pelvic arteries.Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) has the same high reliability as conventional angiography when it comes to confirming or ruling out vascular disease in all blood vessels, from the abdominal aorta to the arteries of the foot.\n\n\n      \n      No drug has been approved in Sweden for specifically treating peripheral arterial disease, and there is no therapy that can be said to cure the condition.\n    \n\n      \n      Nevertheless, the following has been established:Physical training, walking or Nordic walking – particularly when organised or supervised – improves walking distance.Revascularisation, which is an intervention intended to restore or improve blood flow, should generally be avoided. But there is limited scientific evidence that open revascularisation in claudication patients with disabling symptoms may be somewhat more effective than walking training.Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with selective placement of a stent is cost-effective in comparison with other revascularisation methods that were reviewed.There is limited scientific evidence that Ginkgo biloba, a natural remedy, and levocarnitine can improve walking distance.There is limited scientific evidence that intravenous prostaglandin E1 increases walking distance.\n\n\n      \n      Patients who have symptoms of critical limb ischaemia must receive prompt treatment to relieve the pain and minimise or eliminate the risk of deterioration leading to ulcers and tissue death (gangrene).Open or endovascular revascularisation using thrombolysis therapy or PTA should be offered when critical limb ischaemia may lead to amputation.Adjunctive therapy using a platelet inhibitor or vitamin K antagonist whose (warfarin) improves results after revascularisation therapy.Adjunctive therapy using a vitamin K antagonist causes more bleeding complications than platelet inhibitor.\n\n\n      \n      Acute limb ischaemia is caused by abrupt occlusion of a major artery. The patient often experiences severe pain. Treatment must start immediately. The leg may have to be amputated.Immediate invasive treatment normally permits amputation-free survival for many years.There is no decisive difference between open surgical intervention and endovascular revascularisation through the blood vessels (thrombolysis therapy) in terms of amputation-free survival.Acute limb ischaemia often occurs at the end of life. In such cases, lower limb ischaemia results from a gradual slowdown in the functioning of the organs. Surgery is not indicated, and pain relief may be the proper treatment from a medical and compassionate point of view.\n\n\n      \n      Following are some of the ethical issues that must be taken into consideration when diagnosing and treating peripheral arterial disease:Reconstructive procedures for critical and acute limb ischaemia are often associated with the risk of serious complications, as well as death in some cases. Such risks must be weighed against the opportunity to improve health and quality of life.One problem in particular is that caregivers may have difficulty refraining from the use of new methods even when the documentation is substandard or incomplete.A patient’s lifestyle, such as continued smoking, must not lead to discriminatory treatment.While attempts to avoid amputation are a worthy goal, they must be weighed against risks and suffering in patients for whom it may turn out to be necessary after all. Resource utilisation is also an ethical issue in such cases.\n\n\n      \n      Diagnosis, medical treatment and referral procedures for peripheral arterial disease patients in primary care can be improved. The disease is an uncommon diagnosis in Swedish primary care. Many patients are referred for diagnosis and assessment prior to possible intervention, but only a few undergo invasive treatment. SBU’s survey of clinical practice also reveals major regional differences in the number of patients who are referred for such diagnosis and assessment.\n    \n\n      \n      Educational efforts, as well as guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial disease in primary care, would raise awareness about patients with vascular disease who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease and death.\n    \n\n      \n      Major inadequacies remain when it comes to assessing new technologies. Systematic efforts in that area should be given high priority.\n    \n\n      \n      The results of treatment should be reported to, and compiled in, a central registry. For the past 20 years, most vascular surgery – including radiological interventions such as throm- bolysis therapy and PTA – has been reported to the Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc). Amputation due to peripheral arterial disease is however not systematically reported to the registry.\n    \n\n      \n      Multicentre randomised trials could be arranged in Sweden to address two key questions:Which therapy is better for intermittent claudication – intervention or walking training and best medical treatment?Which therapy is better for critical limb ischaemia – surgical/endovascular intervention or best medical treatment?"

            "abstract": "To study physiological and psychological effects of baroreceptor activity, the cervical neck cuff technique has been frequently used to stimulate the carotid baroreceptors mechanically. Using this technique, no satisfying control conditions to date have been available. Because the carotid stretch receptors are sensitive not only to the pressure level, but also to the rate of change, it is possible to manipulate the receptor firing through changes in carotid pulse amplitude. The device described here relies on the application of short changes in cuff pressure tied to different phases within the cardiac cycle (phase related external suction (PRES)). A brief external suction during systole has potent stimulatory effects on baroreceptors whereas the application of the very same pressure pulse during diastole inhibits the firing burst associated with the pulse wave. To allow an ongoing period of stimulation, a sequence of alternating negative/positive pressure pulses is applied. In the stimulation condition, the R-wave of the electrocardiogram triggers a negative pulse which is followed by a positive one during diastole. In the control condition this relationship is reversed. Two experiments are reported confirming different baroreceptor effects of the two conditions. PRES allows for blind or double-blind experiments to investigate effects of baroreceptor activity on physiology and behavior."

            "abstract": "This study evaluated the synergistic effects of acute exercise with capsaicin (200mg) upon the restoration of cardiac autonomic functions and depolarization- repolarization interval as well as substrate oxidation. Nine healthy males [21.9(0.8) yrs] volunteered for this study. Cardiac autonomic activity, metabolic responses, and the ECG QT intervals were continuously measured during 5 min at rest and postexercise recovery after 30 min exercise at 50% VO2max on a stationary ergometer with placebo (ECON) or capsaicin intake (ECAP), and no exercise control (NCON) were randomized. Results indicated that the HF power reflecting parasympathetic activity significantly returned to the baseline much faster during ECAP than ECON trial during postexercise [122.1 (23.2) vs. 60.2 (11.7) %, p < 0.05]. The ECAP trial significantly decreased RQ [0.79(0.02) vs. 0.85 (0.03), p < 0.05] with significantly greater fat oxidation [69.3 (6.0) vs. 49.4 (10.8) %, p < 0.05] in comparison to NCON trial during 120 min postexercise recovery without any adverse effects on cardiac electrical stability as determined by trigger-averaged ECG QT interval analyses. We suggest that capsaicin before the exercise may contribute to the improvement of cardio-protective functions and metabolic responses as one of the beneficial supplements accelerating faster restoration of autonomic activity and enhanced lipolysis during postexercise recovery without any adverse effects on cardiac electrical stability.

            "abstract": "Excitation-contraction coupling in both skeletal and cardiac muscle depends on structural and functional interactions between the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptor L-type Ca(2+) channels in the surface/transverse tubular membrane and ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The channels are targeted to either side of a narrow junctional gap that separates the external and internal membrane systems and are arranged so that bi-directional structural and functional coupling can occur between the proteins. There is strong evidence for a physical interaction between the two types of channel protein in skeletal muscle. This evidence is derived from studies of excitation-contraction coupling in intact myocytes and from experiments in isolated systems where fragments of the dihydropyridine receptor can bind to the ryanodine receptors in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles or in lipid bilayers and alter channel activity. Although micro-regions that participate in the functional interactions have been identified in each protein, the role of these regions and the molecular nature of the protein-protein interaction remain unknown. The trigger for Ca(2+) release through ryanodine receptors in cardiac muscle is a Ca(2+) influx through the L-type Ca(2+) channel. The Ca(2+) entering through the surface membrane Ca(2+) channels flows directly onto underlying ryanodine receptors and activates the channels. This was thought to be a relatively simple system compared with that in skeletal muscle. However, complexities are emerging and evidence has now been obtained for a bi-directional physical coupling between the proteins in cardiac as well as skeletal muscle. The molecular nature of this coupling remains to be elucidated."

            "abstract": "Circuit training effectively reduces the time devoted to strength training while allowing an adequate training volume to be achieved. Nonetheless, circuit training has traditionally been performed using relatively low loads for a relatively high number of repetitions, which is not conducive to maximal muscle size and strength gain. This investigation compared physical performance parameters and cardiovascular load during heavy-resistance circuit (HRC) training to the responses during a traditional, passive rest strength training set (TS). Ten healthy subjects (age, 26 +/- 1.6 years; weight, 80.2 +/- 8.78 kg) with strength training experience volunteered for the study. Testing was performed once weekly for 3 weeks. On day 1, subjects were familiarized with the test and training exercises. On the subsequent 2 test days, subjects performed 1 of 2 strength training programs: HRC (5 sets x (bench press + leg extensions + ankle extensions); 35-second interset rest; 6 repetition maximum [6RM] loads) or TS (5 sets x bench press; 3-minute interset rest, 6RM loads). The data confirm that the maximum and average bar velocity and power and the number of repetitions performed of the bench press in the 2 conditions was the same; however, the average heart rate was significantly greater in the HRC compared to the TS condition (HRC = 129 +/- 15.6 beats x min(-1), approximately 71% maximum heart rate (HRmax), TS = 113 +/- 13.1 beats x min(-1), approximately 62% HRmax; P < 0.05). Thus, HRC sets are quantitatively similar to traditional strength training sets, but the cardiovascular load is substantially greater.

Clinical analysis of autonomic nervous function has revealed a transient increase of sympathetic nervous activity and decrease of vagal nervous activity. Immobilization (IMO) stress of rats can reproduce the electrocardiographic and left ventriculographic changes that occur in takotsubo cardiomyopathy, both of which are prevented by combined blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Estrogen supplementation partially attenuated these cardiac changes. It also attenuated the IMO-induced increase of c-Fos immunoreactivity, or c-fos mRNA expression in the lateral septum, medial amygdaloid nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and locus ceruleus; these regions contain central sympathetic neurons and neurons with immunoreactive estrogen receptors. It also downregulated c-fos mRNA expression in the adrenal gland and the heart, suggesting an increase of estrogen attenuated the stress-induced hypothalamo-sympathoadrenal outflow from the central nervous system to the target organs. Estrogen treatment also upregulated the levels of cardioprotective substances, such as atrial natriuretic peptide and heat shock protein 70, in the heart.

Patients were interviewed with validated questionnaires to identify one of the following triggers: i) timing of onset of ST, ii) performance of vigorous ( ≥ 6 MET) physical activity in the two hours preceding ST, iii) presence of emotional stress (experiencing a serious life event in the 14 days preceding the ST or feelings of anger in the 12 hours of ST) and iv) presence of a documented active infection at the time of ST. A total of 363 patients (83.1%) were able to supply adequate information. A significant trigger was identified in 83 patients (22.9%). Analysis of the different categories according to timing of ST revealed a higher prevalence of triggers with an increasing time-interval between index PCI and ST.

            "title": "Modulation of cardiac ryanodine receptor activity by ROS and RNS.",
            "abstract": "Calcium release through cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2) triggers heart muscle contraction. Reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), normally produced in the heart, promote endogenous RyR2 S-nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation. These reversible redox modifications increase RyR2 activity in vitro, and presumably also in vivo. RyR2 S-glutathionylation increases under physiologically relevant conditions (tachycardia and exercise), suggesting that cardiac cells utilize this redox modification to increase RyR2 activity under increased demand. In contrast, in vivo changes in RyR2 S-nitrosylation in response to physiological stimuli remain uncharacterized. The number and identity of the highly reactive RyR2 cysteine residues and the nature of the redox modification they undergo are presently unknown. Likewise, the physiological sources of ROS/RNS responsible for functionally relevant RyR2 redox modifications have not been completely identified. The redox state of RyR2 is altered in heart failure leading to enhanced RyR2 activity, which presumably contributes to decrease SR calcium content and induce other calcium release abnormalities observed in heart failure. Greater understanding of RyR2 redox modulation is necessary to counteract the deleterious consequences of RyR2 activity deregulation caused by oxidative stress."

Selection of therapy for episodes of asymptomatic ischemia is limited by a lack of direct comparative studies. To determine the most effective monotherapy for patients with stable angina and a high frequency of asymptomatic ischemic episodes, propranolol-LA (mean daily dose, 293 mg), diltiazem-SR (mean daily dose, 350 mg), nifedipine (mean daily dose, 79 mg) were each compared with placebo, each for 2 weeks, in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover trial. Entry criteria were a positive exercise treadmill test during placebo therapy characterized by 1.0 mm or more ST segment depression and angina pectoris, and six or more episodes of transient ST segment depression of 1.0 mm or more on a 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram. One hundred ninety-four patients were screened, 63 were eligible and received randomized therapy, of which 56 patients completed at least two of the four treatment periods and were included in an intent-to-treat analysis. Fifty patients completed all four treatment phases and were included in the protocol-completed analysis. Anti-ischemia efficacy was assessed by 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, exercise treadmill tests, and anginal diaries. Ninety-four percent of all episodes of ambulatory ischemia were asymptomatic. Compared with placebo, only propranolol was associated with a marked reduction in all manifestations of asymptomatic ischemia during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (2.3 versus 1.0 episodes/24 hr; mean duration of ischemia per 24 hours, 43.6 versus 5.7 minutes; both p less than 0.0001). Diltiazem's reduction of the frequency of episodes compared with placebo (2.3 versus 1.9 episodes/24 hr) was associated with a trend (p = 0.08) in the protocol-completed analysis and with a significant reduction in the intent-to-treat analysis (p = 0.03). Nifedipine had no significant effect on any measured variable of ambulatory ischemia. The dosages of medication used may have been excessive for some patients, and a more beneficial effect may have been evident at a lower dose. In contrast to the marked effects of the active agents on ambulatory asymptomatic ischemia, the effects on exercise performance and angina pectoris were slight. The active agents modestly improved treadmill exercise duration time until 1 mm ST segment depression (3%), and only propranolol and diltiazem had significant effects. Only diltiazem significantly prolonged the total exercise time. Anginal frequency was significantly decreased by both propranolol and diltiazem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Physical exercise is one of the life-style modifications used for lowering blood pressure. Except for diminished norepinephrine spill over, the mechanism by which physical exercise exerts its effects was not known. Based on our preliminary finding that the reduction of blood pressure was inversely correlated to the baseline plasma renin activity, we have consequently revealed that mild exercise reduces plasma volume and hence the cardiac index. In order to elucidate the mechanism, we have investigated all possible parameters relevant to plasma volume regulation. Among them, urinary free dopamine and urinary active kallikrein increased in the early stages (weeks 2-4) while atrio-natriuretic factor (week 4) and endogeneous ouabain-like substance (EOLS) consequently (weeks 7-10) decreased. Serum taurine increased and plasma norepinephrine decreased in the late stages. The conclusion reached is that mild exercise seems to first activate the renal dopamine and kallikrein systems and second trigger other mechanism, such as an increase in taurine and decreases in EOLS and norepinephrine."

            "abstract": "Autonomic functions, such as increased sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus, higher nervous centres, depression, hostility and aggression appear to be important determinants of heart rate variability (HRV), which is, itself, an important risk factor of myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, sudden death, heart failure and atherosclerosis. The circadian rhythm of these complications with an increased occurrence in the second quarter of the day may be due to autonomic dysfunction as well as to the presence of excitatory brain and heart tissues. While increased sympathetic activity is associated with increased levels of cortisol, catecholamines, serotonin, renin, aldosterone, angiotensin and free radicals; increased parasympathetic activity may be associated with greater levels of acetylecholine, dopamine, nitric oxide, endorphins, coenzyme Q10, antioxidants and other protective factors. Recent studies indicate that hyperglycemia, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, ambient pollution, insulin resistance and mental stress can increase the risk of low HRV. These risk factors, which are known to favour cardiovascular disease, seem to act by decreasing HRV. There is evidence that regular fasting may modulate HRV and other risk factors of heart attack. While exercise is known to decrease HRV, exercise training may not have any adverse effect on HRV. In a recent study among 202 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the incidence of onset of chest pain was highest in the second quarter of the day (41.0%), mainly between 4.0-8.0 AM, followed by the fourth quarter, usually after large meals (28.2%). Emotion was the second most common trigger (43.5%). Cold weather was a predisposing factor in 29.2% and hot temperature (> 40 degrees celsius) was common in 24.7% of the patients. Dietary n-3 fatty acids and coenzyme Q10 have been found to prevent the increased circadian occurrence of cardiac events in our randomized controlled trials, possibly by increasing HRV. We have also found that n-3 fatty acids plus CoQ can decrease TNF-alpha and IL-6 in AMI which are pro-inflammatory agents. There is evidence that dietary n-3 fatty acids canenhance hippocampal acetylecholine levels, which may be protective. Similarly, the stimulation of the vagus nerve may inhibit TNF synthesis in the liver and acetylecholine, the principal vagal neurotransmitter, significantly attenuates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, interleukin 1,6 and 18, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in experiments. Therefore, any agent which can enhance brain acetylecholine levels, may be used as a therapeutic agent in protecting the suprachiasmatic nucleus, higher nervous centres, vagal activity and sympathetic nerve activity which are known to regulate the body clock and HRV and the risk of SCD and heart attack."

            "abstract": "Beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP or protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent modulation of cardiac potassium currents controls ventricular action potential duration (APD) at faster heart rates. HERG (KCNH2) gene mutations are associated with congenital long-QT syndrome (LQT2) and affect IKr activity, a key determinant in ventricular repolarization. Physical activity or emotional stress often triggers lethal arrhythmias in LQT2 patients. Beta-adrenergic stimulation of HERG channel activity is amplified and prolonged in vitro by the adaptor protein 14-3-3epsilon. In LQT2 families, we identified three novel heterozygous HERG mutations (G965X, R1014PfsX39, V1038AfsX21) in the C-terminus that led to protein truncation and loss of a PKA phosphorylation site required for binding of 14-3-3epsilon. When expressed in CHO cells, the mutants produced functional HERG channels with normal kinetic properties. We now provide evidence that HERG channel regulation by 14-3-3epsilon is of physiological significance in humans. Upon co-expression with 14-3-3epsilon, mutant channels still bound 14-3-3epsilon but did not respond with a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependence as seen in wild-type channels. Co-expression experiments of wild-type and mutant channels revealed dominant-negative behavior of all three HERG mutations. Simulations of the effects of sympathetic stimulation of HERG channel activity on the whole-cell action potential suggested a role in rate-dependent control of APD and an impaired ability of mutant cardiac myocytes to respond to a triggered event or an ectopic beat. In summary, the attenuated functional effects of 14-3-3epsilon on C-terminally truncated HERG channels demonstrate the physiological importance of coupling beta-adrenergic stimulation and HERG channel activity."

            "abstract": "Research examining the occurrence of sexual problems in nonclinical populations tends to be restricted to highly select populations. Recently, several population-based surveys surfaced in the international literature, triggered by the advent of effective pharmacological treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). ED is a common disorder, especially among elderly men. The annual incidence in men 40-69 y of age is 26 per 1000 men. Although most of the difficulties are mild and do not totally prevent intercourse, about 26% of men experience moderate to complete ED. The impact of this category of ED on sexual activity among men is marked. The incidence of ED increases with age and the presence of concomitant conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, depression, pelvic surgery, negative mood, lack of self-esteem, problems with relationships, or just inadequate sexual experience. Vascular disease is thought to be the most common cause of organic ED, and it may be an early symptom of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Although one may expect that any man with ED who is motivated to continue sexual activity may seek current highly effective symptomatic medical treatment, only a few men are actually seeking help, and not every man seeking help appears to be a candidate for (symptomatic) medical treatment. The frequent association of sexual and medical problems, especially in the aged, and the high dropout rates for symptomatic ED treatment make counseling, adjustment of lifestyle, and modification of risk factors, such as medication, overweight, smoking, alcohol consumption, and lack of exercise, the primary steps in a holistic approach toward the treatment of ED. It is especially important to educate these men to remain physically and sexually as active as possible for as long as possible. The phrase 'use it or lose it' is particularly appropriate for the genitalia."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND Many patients with the obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSA) travel to the mountains for recreational and professional activities while temporarily discontinuing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. A study was undertaken to evaluate the hypothesis that altitude would aggravate their hypoxaemia, sleep-related breathing disturbances and impair daytime performance. METHODS Thirty-four patients with OSA of median age 62 years (IQR 57-65), median apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) 47.5 events/h (IQR 32.4-72.8), residing at <600 m were enrolled. A crossover trial randomised for the sequence of altitude exposure was carried out: patients spent 1 day in Zurich (490 m) and 4 days in the Swiss Alps at 1860 m and 2590 m (2 days each) during which continuous positive airway pressure was discontinued. Daily evaluations included polysomnography, symptom questionnaires, physical examination and driving simulator tests. RESULTS Polysomnography revealed median oxygen saturations at 490 m and in the first and second nights at 1860 and 2590 m, respectively, of 94%, 90%, 90%, 86% and 87% (p<0.01 between altitudes). Corresponding median AHI were 47.5, 85.1, 74.6, 90.0 and 90.9 events/h (p<0.01 between altitudes) with ratios of central to obstructive events of 0.1, 0.8, 1.0, 1.9 and 1.9 (p<0.01 between altitudes). Tracking performance during simulated driving was significantly impaired at 2590 m compared with 490 m. Systolic blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmias were increased at altitude. CONCLUSIONS Altitude exposure in untreated patients with OSA aggravates hypoxaemia, increases sleep-related breathing disturbances due to frequent central apnoeas/hypopnoeas, impairs driving simulator performance and induces cardiovascular stress. These findings have implications for counselling and treating patients with OSA planning to travel to high altitude. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00514826."
