            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nDespite anecdotal evidence suggesting that heavy physical exertion can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction, there have been no controlled studies of the risk of myocardial infarction during and after heavy exertion, the length of time between heavy exertion and the onset of symptoms (induction time), and whether the risk can be modified by regular physical exertion. To address these questions, we collected data from patients with confirmed myocardial infarction on their activities one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction and during control periods.\n## METHODS\nInterviews with 1228 patients conducted an average of four days after myocardial infarction provided data on their usual annual frequency of physical activity and the time, type, and intensity of physical exertion in the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. We compared the observed frequency of heavy exertion (6 or more metabolic equivalents) with the expected values using two types of self-matched analyses based on a new case-crossover study design. The low frequency of heavy exertion during the control periods was validated by data from a population-based control group of 218 subjects.\n## RESULTS\nOf the patients, 4.4 percent reported heavy exertion within one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction. The estimated relative risk of myocardial infarction in the hour after heavy physical exertion, as compared with less strenuous physical exertion or none, was 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 7.7), Among people who usually exercised less than one, one to two, three to four, or five or more times per week, the respective relative risks were 107 (95 percent confidence interval, 67 to 171), 19.4 (9.9 to 38.1), 8.6 (3.6 to 20.5), and 2.4 (1.5 to 3.7). Thus, increasing levels of habitual physical activity were associated with progressively lower relative risks. The induction time from heavy exertion to the onset of myocardial infarction was less than one hour, and symptoms usually began during the activity.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nHeavy physical exertion can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction, particularly in people who are habitually sedentary. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which heavy physical exertion triggers the onset of myocardial infarction and the manner in which regular exertion protects against it would facilitate the design of new preventive approaches.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nIt is controversial whether the onset of myocardial infarction occurs randomly or is precipitated by identifiable stimuli. Previous studies have suggested a higher risk of cardiac events in association with exertion.\n## METHODS\nConsecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were identified by recording all admissions to our hospital in Berlin and by monitoring a general population of 330,000 residents in Augsburg, Germany. Information on the circumstances of each infarction was obtained by means of standardized interviews. The data analysis included a comparison of patients with matched controls and a case-crossover comparison (one in which each patient serves as his or her own control) of the patient's usual frequency of exertion with the last episode of exertion before the onset of myocardial infarction.\n## RESULTS\nFrom January 1989 through December 1991, 1194 patients (74 percent of whom were men; mean age [+/- SD], 61 +/- 9 years) completed the interview 13 +/- 6 days after infarction. We found that 7.1 percent of the case patients had engaged in physical exertion (> or = 6 metabolic equivalents) at the onset of infarction, as compared with 3.9 percent of the controls at the onset of the control event. For the patients as compared with the matched controls, the adjusted relative risk of having engaged in strenuous physical activity at the onset of infarction or the control event was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.6). The case-crossover comparison yielded a similar relative risk of 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.1) for having engaged in strenuous physical activity within one hour before myocardial infarction. Patients whose frequency of regular exercise was less than four and four or more times per week had relative risks of 6.9 and 1.3, respectively (P < 0.01).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA period of strenuous physical activity is associated with a temporary increase in the risk of having a myocardial infarction, particularly among patients who exercise infrequently. These findings should aid in the identification of the triggering mechanisms for myocardial infarction and improve prevention of this common and serious disorder.\n",

Interviews were carried out with 699 myocardial infarction patients after onset of the disease. These cases represented 47 percent of all cases in the study base, and 70 percent of all nonfatal cases. The relative risk from vigorous exertion was 6.1 (95% confidence interval: 4.2, 9.0). The rate difference was 1.5 per million person-hours, and the attributable proportion was 5.7 percent. The risk was modified by physical fitness, with an increased risk being seen among sedentary subjects as in earlier studies, but the data also suggested a U-shaped association. In addition, the trigger effect was modified by socioeconomic status. Premonitory symptoms were common, and this implies risks of reverse causation bias and misclassification of case exposure information that require methodological consideration. Different techniques (the use of the usual-frequency type of control information, a pair-matched analysis, and a standard case-referent analysis) were applied to overcome the threat of misclassification of control exposure information. A case-crossover analysis in a random sample of healthy subjects resulted in a relative risk close to unity, as expected.\n",

We evaluated whether the risk of having an AMI triggered by physical exertion exhibits an exposure-response relationship, and whether it varies by ambient temperature or by taking place indoors or outdoors.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nWe conducted a case-crossover study within the Myocardial Infarction Registry in Augsburg, Germany in 1999-2003. One thousand three hundred and one patients reported levels of activity and time spent outdoors on the day of AMI and three preceding days in an interview. The case-crossover analyses showed an association of physical exertion with AMI symptom onset within 2 h, which was strong for strenuous exertion (METs >or= 6) [relative risk (RR) 5.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-9.0), and still significant for moderate exertion (METs = 5) (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1) compared to very light or no exertion. Strenuous exertion outside was associated with a four-fold larger RR of AMI symptom onset than exertion performed indoors, which was not explained by temperature.\n## CONCLUSION\nThis study confirms previous results and shows a graded exposure-response relationship between physical exertion intensity and triggering of AMI onset. These findings may have implications for behavioural guidance of people at risk of AMI.\n",

In case-crossover analyses, the risk of sudden cardiac death was transiently elevated during moderate to vigorous exertion (relative risk [RR], 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-4.60; P = .01) compared with the risk during lesser or no exertion. Habitual moderate to vigorous exertion modified this transient risk (P = .005 for interaction) and the risk was no longer significantly elevated among those who exercised 2 or more hours per week. In the cohort analyses, an increasing amount of moderate to vigorous exercise was associated with a lower long-term risk of sudden cardiac death in age-adjusted and multivariable models that excluded biological intermediates (P = .006 for trend). This relationship was attenuated when biological intermediates were included (P = .06 for trend); however, the reduction in risk remained significant among women who exercised 4 or more hours per week (adjusted RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.83; P = .01) compared with women who did not exercise.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese prospective data suggest that sudden cardiac death during exertion is an extremely rare event in women. Regular exercise may significantly minimize this small transient risk and may lower the overall long-term risk of sudden cardiac death.\n",

However, the role of physical activity in precipitating or preventing sudden death has not been assessed prospectively in a large number of subjects.\n## METHODS\nWe used a prospective, nested case-crossover design within the Physicians' Health Study to compare the risk of sudden death during and up to 30 minutes after an episode of vigorous exertion with that during periods of lighter exertion or none. We then evaluated whether habitual vigorous exercise modified the risk of sudden death that was associated with vigorous exertion. In addition, the relation of vigorous exercise to the overall risk of sudden death and nonsudden death from coronary heart disease was assessed.\n## RESULTS\nDuring 12 years of follow-up, 122 sudden deaths were confirmed among the 21,481 male physicians who were initially free of self-reported cardiovascular disease and who provided information on their habitual level of exercise at base line.

Data were gathered on potential triggers of MI occurring immediately prior to the event and during the previous year. Results are presented for the 858 patients who were sexually active in the year prior to the MI, with attention to the 273 patients who had coronary artery disease prior to their index MI, and the effect of regular exertion on risk.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nThe relative risk of nonfatal MI following sexual activity.\n## RESULTS\nOf the 858 patients, 79(9%) reported sexual activity in the 24 hours preceding MI, and 27(3%) reported sexual activity in the 2 hours preceding onset of symptoms of MI. The relative risk of MI occurring in the 2 hours after sexual activity was 2.5(95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.7). The relative risk of triggering onset of MI among patients with a history of prior angina (2.1 [95% CI, 0.8-5.8]) or prior MI (2.9 [95% CI, 1.3-6.5]) was not greater than that observed in those without prior cardiac disease. Sexual activity was a likely contributor to the onset of MI in only 0.9% of cases and regular exertion was associated with decreasing risk.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSexual activity can trigger the onset of MI. However, the relative risk is low, and since the absolute hourly risk of MI is extremely low, the absolute risk increase caused by sexual activity also is extremely low (1 chance in a million for a healthy individual). Moreover, the relative risk is not increased in patients with a prior history of cardiac disease and regular exercise appears to prevent triggering. These findings should be useful for counseling patients and decreasing the fear of sexual activity that often prevents complete rehabilitation from cardiovascular disease.\n",

Patients were interviewed about the baseline characteristics as well as potential triggers of chest pain experienced over the day before the diagnosed onset of disease. The start of diagnostic chest pain was used as a marker of disease onset. The hazard period was defined as 12-h period of onset of chest pain.\n## MAIN RESULTS\nAmong probable triggers, only unsuspected sudden bad news and sexual activity had significant relationships with chest pain appearance during the hazard period. Among patients with the experience of bad news, the risk of chest pain occurrence during the hazard period was 6.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-31.8]. Also, among those who were exposed to sexual activity, this risk was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-10.4).
