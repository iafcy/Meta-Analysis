            "criteria": "One reviewer screened all abstracts (I.J.D.) to identify potentially eligible studies, and 2 reviewers (I.J.D. and J.K.P.) screened all potentially eligible studies in full text to determine eligibility for the review. Eligible studies had to have a case-crossover design, as described by Maclure,10 and had to examine the effect of episodic physical or sexual activity (exposures) on the risk of acute coronary syndrome (including MI) and SCD (outcomes). Given that we expected studies conducted over a period of several years to be eligible for this analysis, we considered the definitions and diagnostic criteria used in the primary studies for the outcomes of interest. We excluded studies with an experimental design, ie, studies where exposure status was assigned by the investigators, including studies of induced exertion. Finally, we excluded observational studies not using a case-crossover design, including those with ecological, case-control, and cohort designs. We did not use any language restrictions, and we did not consider abstracts presented at scientific meetings, since they are frequently not peer reviewed.",
