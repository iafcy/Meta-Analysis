            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of tolterodine and gabapentin vs placebo in catheter related bladder discomfort (CRBD) following percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      This study was a double-blind parallel group randomized clinical trial. Patients who were candidates of PCNL were enrolled. Patients were randomized to treatment groups of tolterodine 2 mg orally (PO) (group T, n = 50), gabapentin 600 mg PO (group G, n = 50), and placebo (group P, n = 70) 1 hour before operation using balanced block randomization. The primary endpoint of interest was visual analog pain scale in 1, 3, 12, and 24 hours after the operation. Secondary endpoints included rescue analgesic use (opioid and nonopioid).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The frequency of severe CRBD in 1,12, and 24 hours after the operation was 4%, 4%, and 6% in group T vs 4%, 0%, and 2% in group G vs 47%, 14%, and 6% in the P group (p < 0.001). The number of paracetamol injections for CRBD in the T and G groups was significantly lower than the placebo group (1.8 ± 0.8 vs 1.8 ± 0.7 vs 3.6 ± 0.7, p < 0.001). Likewise the number of pethidine injections in the T and G groups was significantly lower than the placebo group (0.42 ± 0.54 vs 0.68 ± 0.62 vs 2.4 ± 0.64, p < 0.001). In patients with history of Double-J insertion, the severity of CRBD was lower in all treatment groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Preoperative administration of oral tolterodine or gabapentin reduces postoperative CRBD and the need for rescue analgesics as much as 24 hours after surgery. Patients with history of Double-J insertion experience less CRBD."

            "abstract": "Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-beta-Ala-NH2 (TAPA), a novel dermorphin analog with high selectivity and affinity for mu-opioid receptors, was administered intracerebroventricularly to mice before or immediately after training in a one-trial step-down type passive avoidance task. The pre- and post-training administration of TAPA (0.3 and/or 3 ng) impaired retention performance 24 h after training. In particular, the post-training administration of TAPA was much more effective because a lower dose (0.3 ng) of TAPA exclusively inhibited retention performance. The amnesic effects of TAPA were reversed by the mu-selective opioid antagonist beta-funaltrexamine (5 micrograms, i.c.v.). In addition, TAPA (0.3 and 3 ng) had no effects on nociceptive responses in a tail-flick test or on behavioral responses to electric shock during training. These results suggest that activation of mu-opioid receptors impairs passive avoidance learning, resulting in a dysfunction of memory consolidation, without affecting other behavioral responses."

They are produced by cells in the brain and other tissues and combine with two subtypes of G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. Their ability to modulate a variety of pathophysiological processes, including appetite, pain and mood, provides unique opportunities for drug discovery. Three such opportunities are discussed here: reduction of body weight through blockade of CB1 receptors, alleviation of pain through activation of extracerebral cannabinoid receptors, and modulation of pain and anxiety through inhibition of endocannabinoid degradation."

These included dentist-administered or placebo ultrasound (the latter given in two different ways to control for massage effects), untreated controls and a group instructed to apply facial massage to themselves. Pre- and post-operative measurements included trait and state-anxiety, coping style, emotional state, pain, plasma cortisol and facial swelling. Cortisol levels correlated with anxiety and avoidant coping. Post-operative anxiety was negatively correlated with pre-operative arousal. Neither coping nor emotional state was affected by the treatments, but swelling was reduced by a placebo effect of ultrasound. Cortisol levels also responded, apparently to an effect of massage. The coping and emotional factors which we measured here cannot, therefore, explain the effects of this psychological procedure on post-operative recovery."

Not only physical causes but also behavioral disorders such as a fear-avoidance belief (FAB) can associate with the chronicity of neck pain. However, functional brain mechanisms underlying CNP and its related behavioral disorders remain unknown. The aim of the current resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to explore how the functional brain networks differed between CNP patients and age- and sex-matched healthy, pain-free controls (HCs). We also investigated whether these possible brain network changes in CNP patients were associated with fear avoidance belief (FAB) and the intensity of pain. We analyzed the resting-state fMRI data of 20 CNP patients and 20 HCs. FAB and the intensity of pain were assessed by Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of pain. The whole brain analysis showed that CNP patients had significant different functional connectivity (FC) compared with HCs, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was a core hub of these altered functional networks. Furthermore, general linear model analyses showed that, in CNP patients, the increased FC between the right DLPFC and the right anterior insular cortex (aIC) significantly associated with increased TSK (p = 0.01, statistical significance after Bonferroni correction: p<0.025), and the FC between the right DLPFC and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex had a trend of inverse association with VAS (p = 0.04). Our findings suggest that aberrant FCs between the right DLPFC and aIC associated with CNP and its related FAB."

            "abstract": "Although pain is frequently accompanied with depression, little is known about the risk factors contributing to individual differences to the comorbidity of pain and depression. In this study, we examined whether cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) might contribute to the individual differences in the development of neuropathic pain-induced depression. Rats were randomly subjected to spared nerved ligation (SNI) or sham surgery. The SNI rats were divided into two groups by the data from depression-related behavioral tests. Rats with depression-like phenotype displayed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6) as well as imbalance of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with rats without depression-like phenotype and sham-operated rats. Levels of BDNF in the prefrontal cortex of rats with depression-like phenotype were lower than those of rats without depression-like phenotype and sham-operated rats. A single dose of ketamine ameliorated depression-like behaviors in the rats with depression-like phenotype. Interestingly, higher serum levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in the rat with depression-like phenotype were normalized after a single dose of ketamine. These findings suggest that alterations in the inflammatory cytokines and BDNF might contribute to neuropathic pain-induced depression, and that serum cytokines may be predictable biomarkers for ketamine's antidepressant actions."

Blood samples were withdrawn at 0, 2 and 6 h after oral administration in patients treated with slow-release oral morphine and once or twice a day in patients treated with continuous infusion of morphine. In four cancer patients treated with continuous infusion of morphine, in order to analyze chronopharmacokinetic variability, the M-3-G/M ratio was observed at 12:00 h and 24:00 h. No significant changes were observed in M-3-G/M ratios and M-6-G ratios at 0, 2, and 6 h after oral administration of morphine. The M-3-G/M ratio (38.6 +/- 25.7) in the oral morphine group was significantly higher than that (15.3 +/- 12.9) in the continuous infusion group (p < 0.01). There was an approximately 10-fold interindividual variation in the M-3-G/M ratio both in the continuous infusion group and in the oral morphine group. These results suggest that the activity of UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 in the intestinal metabolism of morphine may play an active part in a large interindividual variation in the ratio of metabolites to morphine.

            "abstract": "Background: Pharmacological management of chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) still represents a major clinical challenge. Collective harnessing of both the scientific evidence base and clinical experience (of clinicians and patients) can play a key role in informing treatment pathways and contribute to the debate on specific treatments (e.g., cannabinoids). A group of expert clinicians (pain specialists and psychiatrists), scientists, and patient representatives convened to assess the relative benefit-safety balance of 12 pharmacological treatments, including orally administered cannabinoids/cannabis-based medicinal products, for the treatment of CNP in adults. Methods: A decision conference provided the process of creating a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model, in which the group collectively scored the drugs on 17 effect criteria relevant to benefits and safety and then weighted the criteria for their clinical relevance. Findings: Cannabis-based medicinal products consisting of tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD), in a 1:1 ratio, achieved the highest overall score, 79 (out of 100), followed by CBD dominant at 75, then THC dominant at 72. Duloxetine and the gabapentinoids scored in the 60s, amitriptyline, tramadol, and ibuprofen in the 50s, methadone and oxycodone in the 40s, and morphine and fentanyl in the 30s. Sensitivity analyses showed that even if the pain reduction and quality-of-life scores for THC/CBD and THC are halved, their benefit-safety balances remain better than those of the noncannabinoid drugs. Interpretation: The benefit-safety profiles for cannabinoids were higher than for other commonly used medications for CNP largely because they contribute more to quality of life and have a more favorable side effect profile. The results also reflect the shortcomings of alternative pharmacological treatments with respect to safety and mitigation of neuropathic pain symptoms. Further high-quality clinical trials and systematic comprehensive capture of clinical experience with cannabinoids is warranted. These results demonstrate once again the complexity and multimodal mechanisms underlying the clinical experience and impact of chronic pain."

Convergent work has supported the significant potential to exploit this system to decrease pain and inflammation. Although the clinical research remains in its infancy, recent systematic reviews have found that 25 of 30 randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a significant analgesic effect. The authors concluded that cannabinoids currently available for clinical use demonstrate a modest analgesic effect and are safe for the management of chronic pain. There is a critical need for more translational research so that the excellent work of Dr. Itai Bab and our basic science colleagues around the world can move forward in providing novel cannabinoid-based medicines. This should include more potent analgesics that are limited in side effects with several routes of delivery.

            "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder, manifested by recurrent edema leading to disfigurement, organ dysfunction and life-threatening respiratory impairment that may become fatal. The hallmark of HAE is C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, but recent evidence points at bradykinin as the main mediator that causes hyperpermeability of small vasculature, leading to accumulation of edema fluid. Current therapeutic options for HAE are limited, and consist of drugs, replacement therapy, and supportive treatment. In view of many disadvantages of the current therapeutic modalities, new approaches to the treatment of HAE are now being offered. This review summarizes our experience with a new line of medications developed for the treatment of acute exacerbations and prophylaxis of HAE--icatibant: bradykinin receptor antagonist, ecallantide: kallikrein inhibitor, and two C1 INH preparations: Berinert-P, human plasma-derived concentrate, and Rhucin: novel recombinant C1-INH produced in transgenic rabbits. Preliminary results of these studies are encouraging and may bring new hope to the patients with this distressing condition. The exact number of HAE patients in Israel is unknown and because patients are treated individually and comprehensive laboratory assessment is partial, many cases might be missed or not treated according to accepted guidelines. We offer a new specialty center for HAE patients, addressing the medical and psychosocial needs of patients and their families."

Amongst directly acting CB receptor ligands, clinical experience with ∆9 -tetrahydracannabinol and medical cannabis in chronic non-cancer pain indicates that there are differences between the benefits perceived by patients and the at best modest effect seen in meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. The reason for this difference is not known but may involve differences in the type of patients that are recruited, the study conditions that are chosen and the degree to which biases such as reporting bias are operative. Other directly acting CB receptor ligands such as biased agonists and allosteric receptor modulators have not yet reached the clinic. Amongst indirectly acting compounds targeting the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and catabolism of the eCBs anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors have been investigated clinically but were per se not useful for the treatment of pain, although they may be useful for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and cannabis use disorder. Dual-acting compounds targeting this enzyme and other targets such as cyclooxygenase-2 or transient potential vanilloid receptor 1 may be a way forward for the treatment of pain."

After an initial open-label period, the CBMEs were used in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover trial. Extracts which contained THC proved most effective in symptom control. Regimens for the use of the sublingual spray emerged and a wide range of dosing requirements was observed. Side-effects were common, reflecting a learning curve for both patient and study team.

This retrospective study of 104 male inmates with serious mental illness prescribed nabilone analyzes the indications, efficacy, and safety of its use. Medications discontinued with the initiation of nabilone were also reviewed. The results showed nabilone targeting a mean of 3.5 indications per patient, thus likely reducing polypharmacy risk. The mean final dosage was 4.0 mg. Results indicated significant improvement in PTSD-associated insomnia, nightmares, PTSD symptoms, and Global Assessment of Functioning and subjective improvement in chronic pain. Medications associated with greater risk for adverse effects or abuse than nabilone were often able to be discontinued with the initiation of nabilone, most often antipsychotics and sedative/hypnotics.

            "abstract": "The serum time-concentration curves and pharmacokinetic parameters of meperidine after the intravenous, intramuscular, and oral administration of 26 mg/m2 doses were determined and compared. After 30 minutes, there was no statistically significant difference between the serum time-concentration curve following intravenous administration and intramuscular administration; and after 2 hours, all three serum time-concentration curves were the same. Comparison of the mean cumulative excretion of meperidine and normeperidine following all three routes of administration demonstrated that the maxmimun rates of both meperidine and normeperidine reflect the route of administration, with a marked delay following oral administration reflecting a delay in absorption. Further, the excretion of normeperidene following oral administration, is greater despite adequate absorption than the other two routes of administration, indicating that delayed absorption increases the metabolic phase. Subjective symptomatology and the serum time-concentration curves were compared and their relationship wxamined. Comparison of the serum time-concentration curves to pervious analgesic and toxicity trials was made, and minimum serum levels for induction of analgesia and production of side effects are discussed. From the data it appears that in the case of acute pain, the intramuscular route of administration is as beneficial as the intravenous route, that oral dosing is less efficacious due to lower peak serum concentrations, and that all doses, regardless of the route administration, should be administered clinically on a mg/m2 basis rather than as a predetermined dose as currently used. Oral administration may have some benefit in the treatment of chronic pain, but the possibility of cumulative toxicity due to normeperidine should be considered."

Pain can be present at any point in the course of the disease and patients may experience pain from various causes simultaneously. Pain in MS can also be secondary to other symptoms, such as spasticity, fatigue, and mood disorder. Of all drug use to treat MS symptoms, treatment for pain accounts for nearly 30 % of total use. At the same time, patients report low satisfaction with pain management. Pain affects quality of life and can influence a person's participation in family life and work and affect mood. Most of the pain literature in the field of MS is based on open-label studies involving small numbers of subjects. Placebo-controlled trials in severe pain syndromes such as trigeminal neuralgia are unethical but for other types of MS-related pain conditions, placebo-controlled trials are ethical and necessary to establish efficacy, particularly given the well-documented placebo effect for various painful conditions This review discusses available data and emphasizes areas of pain research that require further attention."

Four to 6 h after surgery the patients (25 per group) received either no therapy, US (0.1 W/cm2), 'mock' US with massage, 'mock' US without massage, or 'self-massage' with a dummy applicator. Facial swelling, trismus, serum C-reactive protein, serum cortisol, pain and anxiety were measured 24 h postoperatively. The results showed that the beneficial analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of US therapy were placebo-mediated, with maximum effect in the placebo ('mock' US) group without circular massaging with the applicator). Self-massage by the patient produced no significant effect. This placebo action was independent of changes in serum cortisol or patient anxiety state. US therapy can significantly reduce postoperative morbidity, but by placebo-mediated mechanisms which are unrelated to the US itself."

In HT, there occurs formation of antibodies against the self (thyroid), which causes enlargement of the thyroid gland as a whole and decreased thyroid hormone levels. Most of the patients with HT are given medical line of management (hypo/hyperthyroidism). The indications for surgical line of management for HT are due to pressure symptoms over the trachea and oesophagus, pain in the thyroid gland and for chance of malignancy. Surgical treatment gives complete relief from pain and pressure symptoms and also prevents the risk of malignancy. To evaluate the outcome and complications of total thyroidectomy in painful (symptomatic) Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It was a Hospital based Descriptive study conducted in tertiary care teaching hospital by ENT Department, Sri Manakula Vinayagar Medical College and Hospital, Pondicherry from Nov 2017 to May 2019. Sample size was 30. All patients with symptomatic (painful) HT was given trail of medical therapy (steroids and NSAIDS), following repeated attempts of failed medical therapy, surgical management (total thyroidectomy) was preferred. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain grading pre and post operatively. MS Excel and SPSS trial version 20 software was used to analyze the data. The Wilcoxan Signed Ranked test was used as test of significance to identify the difference between ordinal variables. In this study, all the 30 patients had pain as the predominant symptom. Visual Analog Scale was used to grade the pain in all the patients preoperatively and 2 weeks postoperatively. All the patients had significant reduction in the pain following total thyroidectomy, when compared to pre-operative VAS grading. Total thyroidectomy is the technique of choice in surgical treatment of symptomatic Hashimoto's thyroiditis (pain, tenderness and pressure symptoms) which warrants a radical and definitive control of the disease, without any risk of relapse and without the side effects of medical management. Moreover in longstanding cases of HT, the risk of malignant transformation is prevented due to total thyroidectomy. In experienced hands it assures total relief of compressive and painful symptoms and low incidence of/nil major complications."

However, they are still a controversial topic in oncological praxis. Cannabinoids play a role in different organs of human body and they are an integral part of the newly described endocannabinoid system, which regulates several body functions. The important function of endocannabinoids which is related to cancer, is the regulation of cell cycle and cell survival pathways. Presented review gives three different views on the association between cannabinoids and cancer. First, the treatment of adverse symptoms of oncological therapy - nausea and vomiting inhibition, appetite stimulation, pain relieving, mood modulation and muscle stiffness relieving. Second, in the late 1990s, three possible mechanisms of antitumour action were identified - apoptosis induction, direct cell cycle arrest and angiogenesis and metastasis inhibition. The phase I/II of clinical trials are carrying out in Spain. They study effects of local administration of tetrahydrokanabinol on the growth of glioblastoma multiforme. Third, the results of the newest study focused on the association between cannabinoids use and cancer risk showed no significant association between increased cancer incidence and cannabinoids use and it does not depend on the amount of used cannabis. It is important to establish the association between marihuana use and cancer risk regarding the consideration of advantages and risks of medicinal cannabinoids use and the impact on public health."

Pain and somatosensory disturbances are prominent manifestations of this disease. Until recently disease manifestations in female carriers of Fabry disease have been questioned. To explore the frequency of symptoms and the functional and structural involvement of the nervous system in female patients we examined the presence of pain, manifestations of peripheral neuropathy and nerve density in skin biopsies in 19 female patients with Fabry disease and 19 sex- and age-matched controls. Diaries, quantitative sensory testing, neurophysiologic tests and skin biopsies were performed. Daily pain was present in 63% of patients, with a median VAS score of 4.0. Tactile detection threshold and pressure pain threshold were lower and cold detection thresholds increased in patients. Sensory nerve action potential amplitude and maximal sensory conduction velocity were not different, whereas there was a highly significant reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density. We found no correlation between pain VAS score, quantitative sensory testing and intraepidermal nerve fiber density. Our study demonstrates that careful evaluation of symptoms in female Fabry patients is important as small fiber disease manifestations are present, which in some cases is only detected by skin biopsy."

The trial involved 2 periods (separated by a 2-week washout) consisting of a 1-week wash-in phase followed by 2weeks double-blind treatment. Patients received single-blind placebo throughout the wash-in and washout periods. Patients were randomised to receive either 4mg q.d. PF-04457845 followed by placebo (or vice versa), or 500mg b.i.d. naproxen followed by placebo (or vice versa). The primary end point was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score. The trial had predefined decision rules based on likelihood that PF-04457845 was better or worse than the standard of care (considered to be a 1.8 reduction in WOMAC pain score compared to placebo). A total of 74 patients were randomised to 1 of 4 treatment sequences. The mean differences (80% confidence intervals) from placebo in WOMAC pain score were 0.04 (-0.63 to 0.71) for PF-04457845 and -1.13 (-1.79 to -0.47) for naproxen, indicating that whilst naproxen seemed efficacious, PF-04457845 was not differentiated from placebo. The study was stopped at the interim analysis for futility. PF-04457845 decreased FAAH activity by >96% and substantially increased 4 endogenous substrates (fatty acid amides). PF-04457845 was well tolerated in osteoarthritis patients, and there was no evidence of cannabinoid-type adverse events.

Neuromodulators included in this review were anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, phenytoin, sodium valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine and topiramate), ketamine, bupropion, methylphenidate, nefopam, capsaicin and the cannabinoids.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a computer-assisted search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, 4th quarter), MEDLINE (1950 to week 1 November 2010), EMBASE (Week 44, 2010) and PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 November 2010).

Two trials evaluated oral nefopam (52 participants) and one trial each evaluated topical capsaicin (31 participants) and oromucosal cannabis (58 participants).The pooled analyses identified a significant reduction in pain levels favouring nefopam over placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) -21.16, 95% CI -35.61 to -6.71; number needed to treat (NNT) 2, 95% CI 1.4 to 9.5) after two weeks. There were insufficient data to assess withdrawals due to adverse events. Nefopam was associated with significantly more adverse events (RR 4.11, 95% CI 1.58 to 10.69; NNTH 9, 95% CI 2 to 367), which were predominantly nausea and sweating.In a mixed population trial, qualitative analysis of patients with RA showed a significantly greater reduction in pain favouring topical capsaicin over placebo at one and two weeks (MD -23.80, 95% CI -44.81 to -2.79; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 47; MD -34.40, 95% CI -54.66 to -14.14; NNT 2, 95% CI 1.4 to 6 respectively). No separate safety data were available for patients with RA, however 44% of patients developed burning at the site of application and 2% withdrew because of this.One small, low quality trial assessed oromucosal cannabis against placebo and found a small, significant difference favouring cannabis in the verbal rating score 'pain at present' (MD -0.72, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.13) after five weeks. Patients receiving cannabis were significantly more likely to suffer an adverse event (risk ratio (RR) 1.82, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.00; NNTH 3, 95% CI 3 to 13). These were most commonly dizziness (26%), dry mouth (13%) and light headedness (10%).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is currently weak evidence that oral nefopam, topical capsaicin and oromucosal cannabis are all superior to placebo in reducing pain in patients with RA. However, each agent is associated with a significant side effect profile. The confidence in our estimates is not strong given the difficulties with blinding, the small numbers of participants evaluated and the lack of adverse event data. In some patients, however, even a small degree of pain relief may be considered worthwhile. Until further research is available, given the relatively mild nature of the adverse events, capsaicin could be considered as an add-on therapy for patients with persistent local pain and inadequate response or intolerance to other treatments. Oral nefopam and oromucosal cannabis have more significant side effect profiles however and the potential harms seem to outweigh any modest benefit achieved."

The study combined data from the individual-based Danish Health Survey in 2010 and the official Danish health and socio-economic, individual-based registers. From a simple random sample of 25,000 adults (16 years or older) living in Denmark, 13,281 individuals were analyzed through multiple logistic regression analyses to assess the association between chronic pain (lasting ≥6 months), opioid use, health behavior, and body mass index. Six potential addictive behaviors were identified: daily smoking; high alcohol intake; illicit drug use in the past year; obesity; long-term use of benzodiazepines; and long-term use of benzodiazepine-related drugs. At least 2 of the 6 addictive behaviors were observed in 22.6% of the long-term opioid users with chronic pain compared with 11.5% of the non-opioid users with chronic pain and 8.9% of the individuals without chronic pain. Thus, a strong association was demonstrated between long-term opioid use and the clustering of addictive behaviors.

            "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is the second most abundant component of the Cannabis plant and is known to have effects distinct from Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Many studies that examined the behavioral effects of CBD concluded that it lacks the psychotomimetic effects attributed to THC. However, CBD was shown to have a broad spectrum of effects on several conditions such as anxiety, inflammation, neuropathic pain, and epilepsy. It is currently thought that CBD engages different targets and hence CBD's effects are thought to be due to multiple molecular mechanisms of action. A well-accepted set of targets include GPCRs and ion channels, with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and the transient receptor potential cation channel TRPV1 channel being the two main targets. CBD has also been thought to target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as cannabinoid and opioid receptors. Other studies have suggested a role for additional GPCRs and ion channels as targets of CBD. Currently, the clinical efficacy of CBD is not completely understood. Evidence derived from randomized clinical trials, in vitro and in vivo models and real-world observations support the use of CBD as a drug treatment option for anxiety, neuropathy, and many other conditions. Hence an understanding of the current status of the field as it relates to the targets for CBD is of great interest so, in this review, we include findings from recent studies that highlight these main targets."

            "abstract": "Several lines of evidence suggest that cannabinoids can attenuate various types of pain and hyperalgesia through peripheral mechanisms. The development of rodent cancer pain models has provided the opportunity to investigate novel approaches to treat this common form of pain. In the present study, we examined the ability of peripherally administered cannabinoids to attenuate tumor-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia in a murine model of cancer pain. Unilateral injection of osteolytic fibrosarcoma cells into and around the calcaneus bone resulted in tumor formation and mechanical hyperalgesia in the injected hindpaw. Mechanical hyperalgesia was defined as an increase in the frequency of paw withdrawals to a suprathreshold von Frey filament (3.4 mN) applied to the plantar surface of the hindpaw. WIN 55, 212-2 (1.5 to 10 microg) injected subcutaneously into the tumor-bearing hindpaw produced a dose-dependent decrease in paw withdrawal frequencies to suprathreshold von Frey filament stimulation. Injection of WIN 55,212-2 (10 microg) into the contralateral hindpaw did not decrease paw withdrawal frequencies in the tumor-bearing hindpaw. Injection of the highest antihyperalgesic dose of WIN 55,212-2 (10 microg) did not produce catalepsy as determined by the bar test. Co-administration of WIN 55,212-2 with either cannabinoid 1 (AM251) or cannabinoid 2 (AM630) receptor antagonists attenuated the antihyperalgesic effects of WIN 55, 212-2. In conclusion, peripherally administered WIN 55,212-2 attenuated tumor-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia by activation of both peripheral cannabinoid 1 and cannabinoid 2 receptors. These results suggest that peripherally-administered cannabinoids may be effective in attenuating cancer pain."

Placebo or Theracurmin containing 180 mg/day of curcumin was administered orally every day for 8 weeks. To monitor adverse events, blood biochemistry analyses were performed before and after 8 weeks of each intervention. The patients' knee symptoms were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks by the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure, the knee pain visual analog scale (VAS), the knee scoring system of the Japanese Orthopedic Association, and the need for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At 8 weeks after treatment initiation, knee pain VAS scores were significantly lower in the Theracurmin group than in the placebo group, except in the patients with initial VAS scores of 0.15 or less. Theracurmin lowered the celecoxib dependence significantly more than placebo. No major side effects were observed with Theracurmin treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Theracurmin shows modest potential for the treatment of human knee osteoarthritis."

            "title": "Effects of Cannabidiol Chewing Gum on Perceived Pain and Well-Being of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: A Placebo-Controlled Crossover Exploratory Intervention Study with Symptom-Driven Dosing.",
            "abstract": "Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders. Its pathophysiology is diverse and variable, involving disturbed gut-brain interactions, altered motility and secretion, visceral hypersensitivity, increased intestinal permeability, immune activation, and changes in gut microbiota. Complaints experienced by patients suffering from IBS and its co-morbidities strongly impair quality of life (QoL), and available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Anecdotal reports and preclinical data suggest that the endocannabinoid system and functionally related mechanisms could offer treatment targets. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a candidate agent of interest with a broad molecular target profile and the absence of psychoactive properties. Materials and Methods: In 32 female IBS patients, we explored the effect of a chewing gum formulation containing 50 mg CBD on abdominal pain and perceived well-being in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Chewing gums were used on-demand guided by pain symptoms with a maximum of six per day. Pain intensity was assessed by a visual analogue scale (scale 0.0-10.0), and QoL was evaluated with the IBS-36 questionnaire. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores between CBD and placebo at a group level. Subgroup and individual analyses showed a highly variable picture. No indications were found for symptom-driven intake, which also remained lower than expected overall. Conclusions: With the current design, based on the assumption that IBS patients would adjust their intake to their perceived symptom relief, no differences at the group level were found between CBD and placebo gum in pain scores and the number of gums used. The low use of the gums also indicates that the benefits experienced by these patients generally did not outweigh practical disadvantages such as prolonged chewing throughout the day. The very high intra- and inter-individual variation in IBS symptoms warrant future trials that are more personalized, for example by applying an N-of-1 (rotating) design with individualized dose titration."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Neuropathic pain is often associated with depression. Enhancing endocannabinoids by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors relieves neuropathic pain and stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in animal models. However, it is unclear whether FAAH inhibitor can relieve neuropathic pain-induced depression by or not by its antinociceptive effects.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Adult male Wistar rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the sciatic nerve were treated with the systemic FAAH inhibitor URB597 (5.8 mg·kg·day, intraperitoneally) or peripherally acting FAAH inhibitor URB937 (1.6 mg·kg·d, intraperitoneally; n = 11-12). The treatment was applied from the 15th day after surgery and continued for 15 days. Mechanical withdrawal threshold was examined by Von Frey test before surgery and on the 28th day after CCI. Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by forced swimming test (FST) and novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) after 15-day treatment. The levels of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in hippocampus were examined by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Hippocampal neurogenesis including proliferation, differentiation, and survival of newborn cells was assessed by immunohistochemistry.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After CCI injury, the rats developed significantly nociceptive and depressive-like behaviors, indicated by persistent mechanical hypersensitivity in Von Frey test, significantly prolonged immobility time in FST (sham: 84.2 ± 13.4 seconds versus CCI: 137.9 ± 18.8 seconds; P < .001), and protracted latency to feed in NSF (sham: 133.4 ± 19.4 seconds versus CCI: 234.9 ± 33.5 seconds; P < .001). For the CCI rats receiving treatment, compared to vehicle placebo group, pain threshold was increased by both URB597 (3.1 ± 1.0 vs 11.2 ± 1.2 g; P < .001) and URB937 (3.1 ± 1.0 vs 12.1 ± 1.3 g; P < .001). Immobility time of FST was reduced by URB597 (135.8 ± 16.6 vs 85.3 ± 17.2 seconds; P < .001) but not by URB937 (135.8 ± 16.6 vs 129.6 ± 17.8 seconds; P = .78). Latency to feed in NSF was also reduced by URB597 (235.9 ± 30.5 vs 131.8 ± 19.8 seconds; P < .001) but not by URB937 (235.9 ± 30.5 vs 232.2 ± 33.2 seconds; P = .72). Meanwhile, CCI decreased the number of proliferating cells and reduced survival of new mature neurons in hippocampus. URB597 but not URB937 treatment improved these cellular deficits.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Inhibition of FAAH can improve depressive-like behaviors induced by neuropathic pain independent of its peripheral antinociceptive action. Enhanced neurogenesis in hippocampus might contribute to the antidepressive effects of URB597."

Methods: This study was an open-label two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial. Women (18-75 years) undergoing breast cancer surgery were allocated to either electronic or traditional data collection and completed pain-related questionnaires at baseline, postoperative period, and 3-month follow-up (NCT02240199). Results: We acquired outcome data at all time points from 78 randomized patients, 38 in the electronic group and 40 in the traditional group. The number of data queries (e.g., erroneously entered data) per patient was higher in the electronic data group (4.92 [SD = 4.67] vs. 1.88 [SD = 1.51]; P < 0.001).

            "abstract": "Neurons possessing C-fibers transmit nociceptive information into the central nervous system and participate in various reflex responses. These neurons carry receptors that bind capsaicin, recently identified as the vanilloid VR1 receptor. Excitation of these cells by capsaicin is followed by a lasting refractory state, termed desensitisation, in which the neurons fail to respond to a variety of noxious stimuli. Desensitisation to capsaicin has a clear therapeutic potential in relieving neuropathic pain and ameliorating urinary bladder overactivity, just to cite 2 important examples. Vanilloids may also be beneficial in the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Since the majority of elderly patients have neuropathic pain co-existent with urinary incontinence and/or BPH, a drug that ameliorates pain and improves urinary symptoms at the same time promises to be of great clinical value in geriatric medicine. In fact, capsaicin has already been shown to have a role in the treatment of conditions that can arise in the elderly, including herpes zoster-related neuropathic pain, diabetic neuropathy, postmastectomy pain, uraemic itching associated with renal failure, and urinary incontinence. The potent VR1 agonist resiniferatoxin, now in phase II clinical trials, appears to be superior to capsaicin in terms of its tolerability profile. Recent discoveries enhance the therapeutic potential of vanilloids. The recognition that VR1 also functions as a principal receptor for protons and eicosanoids implies that VR1 antagonists may be of value in the treatment of inflammatory hyperalgesia and pain. Animal experimentation has already lent support to this assumption. The discovery of VR1-expressing cells in the brain as well as in non-neural tissues such as the kidney and urothelium places VR1 in a much broader perspective than peripheral pain perception, and is hoped to identify further, yet unsuspected, indications for vanilloid therapy. The realisation that VR1 and cannabinoid CB1 receptors have overlapping ligand recognition properties may also have far-reaching implications for vanilloid therapy. In fact, arvanil, a combined agonist of VR1 and CB1 receptors, has already proved to be a powerful analgesic drug in the mouse. From academic molecular biology laboratories to industrial drug discovery centres to the clinics, there is a steady flow of new data, forcing us to constantly revise the ways we are thinking about vanilloid receptor ligands and their hopes and realities for the future. This review covers the most promising current trends in vanilloid research with special emphasis on geriatric medicine."

Medical use of cannabis derivatives is a current hot topic and it is unknown whether phytocannabinoids may modify endometriosis symptoms and development. Here we evaluate the effects of repeated exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a mouse model of surgically-induced endometriosis. In this model, female mice develop mechanical hypersensitivity in the caudal abdomen, mild anxiety-like behavior and substantial memory deficits associated with the presence of extrauterine endometrial cysts. Interestingly, daily treatments with THC (2 mg/kg) alleviate mechanical hypersensitivity and pain unpleasantness, modify uterine innervation and restore cognitive function without altering the anxiogenic phenotype. Strikingly, THC also inhibits the development of endometrial cysts. These data highlight the interest of scheduled clinical trials designed to investigate possible benefits of THC for women with endometriosis."

Although there are published meta-analyses of analgesic therapy in PHN, and neuropathic pain in general, the evidence base has been substantially enhanced by the recent publication of several major trials. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for both efficacy and adverse events of analgesic therapy for PHN.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      We systematically searched databases (MEDLINE 1966-2004, EMBASE 1988-2004, CINAHL 1982-2002, and PubMed [29 October 2004]) for trials of PHN. We also searched references of retrieved studies and review articles for further trials. We included trials that examined adult patients with PHN of greater duration than 3 mo, that were blinded, randomised, and had at least one measure of pain outcome. Dichotomous pain outcome data were extracted for 50% decrease in baseline pain using a hierarchy of pain/pain-relief measurement tools. Where available, dichotomous data were also collected for adverse events. Calculated estimates of efficacy included relative benefit and number needed to treat. Of 62 studies identified, 35 were randomised controlled trials. Of these, 31 were placebo controlled and suitable for meta-analysis, from which it was possible to extract dichotomous efficacy outcome data from 25. This meta-analysis revealed that there is evidence to support the use of the following orally administered therapies: tricyclic antidepressants, \"strong\" opioids, gabapentin, tramadol, and pregabalin. Topical therapies associated with efficacy were lidocaine 5% patch and capsaicin. Finally, a single study of spinal intrathecal administration of lidocaine and methyl prednisolone demonstrated efficacy, although this has yet to be replicated. Data suggest that the following therapies are not associated with efficacy in PHN: certain NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., oral memantine, oral dextromethorphan, intravenous ketamine), codeine, ibuprofen, lorazepam, certain 5HT1 receptor agonists, and acyclovir. Topical administration of benzydamine, diclofenac/diethyl ether, and vincristine (iontophoresis) are similarly not associated with efficacy, nor are intrathecal administration of lidocaine alone or epidural administration of lidocaine and methylprednisolone, intravenous therapy with lidocaine, subcutaneous injection of Cronassial, or acupuncture. However, many of the trials that demonstrated a lack of efficacy represented comparatively low numbers of patient episodes or were single-dose studies, so it may be appropriate to regard such interventions as \"not yet adequately tested\" rather than demonstrating \"no evidence of efficacy.\" Topical aspirin/diethyl ether has not been adequately tested.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The evidence base supports the oral use of tricyclic antidepressants, certain opioids, and gabapentinoids in PHN. Topical therapy with lidocaine patches and capsaicin is similarly supported. Intrathecal administration of methylprednisolone appears to be associated with high efficacy, but its safety requires further evaluation."

Absolute strains were lower than those considered globally injurious. Strains redistributed to higher aeration areas as lung injury progressed in supine lungs. At 24 hours, tissue-normalized 18F-FDG uptake increased more in atelectatic and moderately high-aeration regions (>70%) than in normally aerated regions (P < 0.01), with differential mechanistically relevant regional gene expression. 18F-FDG phosphorylation rate was associated with strain and blood volume.

            "abstract": "Many people with MS (pwMS) use unregulated cannabis or cannabis products to treat the symptoms associated with the disease. In line with this, Sativex, a synthetic combination of cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) has been approved to treat symptoms of spasticity. In animals, CBD is effective in reducing the amounts of T-cell infiltrates in the spinal cord, suggesting CBD has anti-inflammatory properties. By doing this, CBD has shown to delay symptom onset in animal models of multiple sclerosis and slow disease progression. Importantly, combinations of CBD and Δ9-THC appear more effective in treating animal models of multiple sclerosis. While CBD reduces the amounts of cell infiltrates in the spinal cord, Δ9-THC reduces scores of spasticity. In human studies, the results are less encouraging and conflict with the findings in animals. Drugs which deliver a combination of Δ9-THC and CBD in a 1:1 ratio appear to be only moderately effective in reducing spasticity scores, but appear to be almost as effective as current front-line treatments and cause less severe side effects than other treatments, such as baclofen (a GABA-B receptor agonist) and tizanidine (an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist). The findings of the studies reviewed suggest that cannabinoids may help treat neuropathic pain in pwMS as an add-on therapy to already established pain treatments. It is important to note that treatment with cannabinoid compounds may cause significant cognitive dysfunction. Long term double-blind placebo studies are greatly needed to further our understanding of the role of cannabinoids in multiple sclerosis treatment."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors are located at key sites involved in the relaying and processing of noxious inputs. Both CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists have analgesic effects in a range of models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Importantly, clinical trials of cannabis-based medicines indicate that the pre-clinical effects of cannabinoid agonists may translate into therapeutic potential in humans. One of the areas of concern with this pharmacological approach is that CB1 receptors have a widespread distribution in the brain and that global activation of CB1 receptors is associated with adverse side effects. Studies of the endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) have demonstrated that they are present in most tissues and that in some pain states, such as neuropathic pain, levels of endocannabinoids are elevated at key sites involved in pain processing. An alternative approach that can be used to harness the potential therapeutic effects of cannabinoids is to maximise the effects of the endocannabinoids, the actions of which are terminated by re-uptake and metabolism by various enzymes, including fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX2). Preventing the metabolism, or uptake, of endocannabinoids elevates levels of these lipid compounds in tissue and produces behavioural analgesia in models of acute pain. Herein we review recent studies of the effects of inhibition of metabolism of endocannabinoids versus uptake of endocannabinoids on nociceptive processing in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain."

There is an obvious need for more reliable scientific data, pharmacology information, a better understanding of its mode of action, and available clinical evidence supporting its robust use. Physicians must complete a thorough medical assessment, screening for potential drugs, or treatment contraindications before allowing its consumption. In light of the growing popularity of cannabis usage, it is highly essential that, in the near future, the medical community will be able to provide practical recommendations and explicit guidelines, including doses, and that cannabinoid concentrations in the used products are defined regarding its prescription before any medical procedure involving its usage is authorized. Here, we review and describe the favorable outcomes demonstrating the benefits of cannabis as an adjunctive treatment to conventional medicines for chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and cancer-related pain (primarily refractory chronic or neuropathic pain). Although not yet substantial enough, the treatment of anorexia, insomnia, depression, and anxiety is also seemingly favorable. To date, reports regarding its anti-neoplastic effects or its potent immunosuppressive properties influencing response to immunotherapy are still very conflicting and controversial. Thus, with the current state of evidence, cannabis use is not advisable as initial treatment, as an adjunct or an advanced line of care. In the coming years, we expect that preclinical data and animal models will shift to the clinical arena, and more patients will be recruited for clinical trials, and their reports will advance the field. Thus, physicians should prescribe cannabis only if careful clarification and consideration is provided together with a follow-up response evaluation."

            "abstract": "Pain is a complex multidimensional concept that facilitates the initiation of the signaling cascade in response to any noxious stimuli. Action potential generation in the peripheral nociceptor terminal and its transmission through various types of nociceptors corresponding to mechanical, chemical or thermal stimuli lead to the activation of receptors and further neuronal processing produces the sensation of pain. Numerous types of receptors are activated in pain sensation which vary in their signaling pathway. These signaling pathways can be regarded as a site for modulation of pain by targeting the pain transduction molecules to produce analgesia. On the basis of their anatomic location, transient receptor potential ion channels (TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPM8), Piezo 2, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), purinergic (P2X and P2Y), bradykinin (B1 and B2), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), metabotropic glutamate (mGlu), neurokinin 1 (NK1) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors are activated during pain sensitization. Various inhibitors of TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPM8, Piezo 2, ASICs, P2X, P2Y, B1, B2, AMPA, NMDA, mGlu, NK1 and CGRP receptors have shown high therapeutic value in experimental models of pain. Similarly, local inhibitory regulation by the activation of opioid, adrenergic, serotonergic and cannabinoid receptors has shown analgesic properties by modulating the central and peripheral perception of painful stimuli. This review mainly focused on various classes of nociceptors involved in pain transduction, transmission and modulation, site of action of the nociceptors in modulating pain transmission pathways and the drugs (both clinical and preclinical data, relevant to targets) alleviating the painful stimuli by exploiting nociceptor-specific channels and receptors."

            "abstract": "Pain is both a sensory and an emotional experience, and is subject to modulation by a number of factors including genetic background modulating stress/affect. The Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat exhibits a stress-hyper-responsive and depressive-like phenotype and increased sensitivity to noxious stimuli, compared with other rat strains. Here, we show that this genotype-dependent hyperalgesia is associated with impaired pain-related mobilisation of endocannabinoids and transcription of their synthesising enzymes in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Pharmacological blockade of the Cannabinoid1 (CB1) receptor potentiates the hyperalgesia in WKY rats, whereas inhibition of the endocannabinoid catabolising enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase, attenuates the hyperalgesia. The latter effect is mediated by CB1 receptors in the RVM. Together, these behavioural, neurochemical, and molecular data indicate that impaired endocannabinoid signalling in the RVM underpins hyper-responsivity to noxious stimuli in a genetic background prone to heightened stress/affect."

A large body of preclinical evidence suggests that there are functional interactions between these two systems that may be leveraged to address various health conditions. Numerous animal studies have shown that cannabinoid agonists (e.g., delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [Δ9-THC]) enhance the analgesic effects of µ-opioid analgesics as evidenced by decreasing the opioid dose required for analgesia (i.e., opioid sparing) and extending the duration of the opioid analgesia. In contrast, controlled human laboratory studies and clinical trials have not demonstrated robust analgesic or opioid-sparing effects from opioid-cannabinoid combinations. Meta-analyses of the literature (clinical trials, controlled laboratory studies; some non-controlled studies/case reports) have examined the effects of cannabis/cannabinoids for pain relief in those taking a wide variety of analgesics, including prescription opioid medications. These data do not strongly support the use of cannabinoids for chronic pain nor do prospective studies demonstrate significant cannabinoid-mediated opioid-sparing effects. Preclinical studies have also suggested a role for cannabinoids for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. Controlled laboratory and clinical studies suggest that there may be a modest signal for Δ9-THC to suppress some opioid signs and symptoms but they are not completely ameliorated and there may also be concerns around safety of Δ9-THC administration in a state of heightened autonomic arousal as occurs with opioid withdrawal. Despite anecdotal and correlational reports suggesting a benefit of cannabis on reducing opioid overdose, there is no strong data supporting this contention and emerging reports have conflicting results. In summary, there is a groundswell of public advocacy supporting the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to replace opioid analgesics or to reduce opioid use; however, the extant controlled clinical data do not support the role of cannabinoids for opioid replacement or opioid-sparing effects when treating opioid use disorder or chronic pain."

CONCLUSIONS About half of Japanese patients with GERD may be refractory to conventional PPIs. Their reflux-related symptoms are often severe and may impair QOL. Switching to esomeprazole could be used to improve their symptoms and QOL."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Some cannabinoids have been identified as anti-inflammatory agents; however, their potential therapeutic or prophylactic applications remain controversial. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a timely and comprehensive insight into cannabinoid-mediated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in preclinical in vivo studies. Methods and Materials: A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus. Eligible studies where cannabinoids had been evaluated for their effect on inflammation in animal models were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from 26 of 4247 eligible full text articles, and risk of bias was assessed using the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool. Studies examined cannabidiol (CBD; n=20); cannabigerol (CBG; n=1); delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; n=2); THC and CBD separately (n=1); and THC and CBD in combination (n=2). Results: Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and interferon gamma were the most commonly studied pro-inflammatory cytokines and their levels were consistently reduced after treatment with CBD, CBG, or CBD+THC, but not with THC alone. The association between cannabinoid-induced anti-inflammatory response and disease severity was examined. In 22 studies where CBD, CBG, or CBD in combination with THC were administered, a reduction in the levels of at least one inflammatory cytokine was observed, and in 24 studies, some improvements in disease or disability were apparent. THC alone did not reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (n=3), but resulted in improvements in neuropathic pain in one study. Conclusions: This review shows that CBD, CBG, and CBD+THC combination exert a predominantly anti-inflammatory effect in vivo, whereas THC alone does not reduce pro-inflammatory or increase anti-inflammatory cytokines. It is anticipated that this information could be used to inform human clinical trials of cannabinoids, focusing on CBD and CBG to reduce inflammation across a range of pathophysiological processes."

            "abstract": "The design of analgesic clinical trials invariably involves a comparison between placebo and active study medication. An assumption is made that treatment effects can be approximated by subtracting the response to placebo from that attained with the use of active study medication. However, the psychoactivity of cannabinoids may unmask their presence and lead to an expectation and/or conditioning of pain relief. For example, study participants biased toward the belief that cannabis is beneficial for their condition might be more inclined to report positive effects if they were to accurately identify the active treatment because of its psychoactivity. This may lead to incorrect assumptions regarding the efficacy of a cannabinoid. Methodologies designed to counteract unmasking need to be implemented in the design phase of a study. During the clinical trial, it is also important to query participants as to which treatment they believe they have received. Blinding can be considered to be preserved when the accuracy of treatment guesses is not considerably different than random guessing, which is estimated to be correct 50% of the time. After a study has been completed, the use of statistical methodologies such as regression and mediation analysis are worthy of consideration to see whether psychoactive effects biased the results."

Longitudinal cohort studies may be one feasible alternative that could yield clinically relevant information. Willingness to participate in such studies is not known. Materials and Methods: In October 2016, we surveyed a convenience sample of patients with chronic pain from two New York registered organizations (responsible for growing, processing, distributing, and retailing medical cannabis products). After a vignette describing a longitudinal cohort study involving weekly patient-reported outcomes and quarterly assessments of physical functioning and urine and blood tests, we asked about respondents' willingness to participate. We examined willingness to participate, duration of participation, and frequency of data collections overall and by subgroups, using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Of 405 respondents (estimated response rate: 30%), 54% were women and 81% were white non-Hispanic. Neuropathy was the most common pain condition (67%) followed by inflammatory bowel disease (19%). Of respondents, 94% (95% CI 92-97%) thought that the study should be done, 85% (95% CI 81-88%) would definitely or probably enroll if asked, 76% (95% CI 72-81%) would participate for ≥1 year, and 59% (95% CI 54-64%) would respond to questions at least daily. Older age was the only factor associated with lower willingness to participate, lower willingness to participate for ≥1 year, and lower willingness to respond to questions at least daily. Conclusions: Nearly all respondents were supportive of the proposed study and most reported that they would enroll if asked. Enhanced engagement with older individuals may be needed to promote equal enrollment. Recruitment for longitudinal cohort studies with frequent data collection appears feasible in this patient population."

Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects; while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohen's kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that body's immune system is building protection.

Patients took extracts containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD; 2.5 mg of each per spray) for eight weeks followed by THC-only (2.5 mg THC per spray) for a further eight weeks, and then into a long-term extension. Assessments included urinary frequency and volume charts, incontinence pad weights, cystometry and visual analogue scales for secondary troublesome symptoms. Twenty-one patients were recruited and data from 15 were evaluated. Urinary urgency, the number and volume of incontinence episodes, frequency and nocturia all decreased significantly following treatment (P <0.05, Wilcoxon's signed rank test). However, daily total voided, catheterized and urinary incontinence pad weights also decreased significantly on both extracts. Patient self-assessment of pain, spasticity and quality of sleep improved significantly (P <0.05, Wilcoxon's signed rank test) with pain improvement continuing up to median of 35 weeks.

            "abstract": "Convincing evidence from preclinical studies demonstrates that cannabinoids can reduce pain responses in a range of inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. The anatomical and functional data reveal cannabinoid receptor-mediated analgesic actions operating at sites concerned with the transmission and processing of nociceptive signals in brain, spinal cord and the periphery. The precise signalling mechanisms by which cannabinoids produce analgesic effects at these sites remain unclear; however, significant clues point to cannabinoid modulation of the functions of neurone and immune cells that mediate nociceptive and inflammatory responses. Intracellular signalling mechanisms engaged by cannabinoid receptors-like the inhibition of calcium transients and adenylate cyclase, and pre-synaptic modulation of transmitter release-have been demonstrated in some of these cell types and are predicted to play a role in the analgesic effects of cannabinoids. In contrast, the clinical effectiveness of cannabinoids as analgesics is less clear. Progress in this area requires the development of cannabinoids with a more favourable therapeutic index than those currently available for human use, and the testing of their efficacy and side-effects in high-quality clinical trials."

Vascular inflammation, platelet activation, and carboxyhemoglobin generation have also been proposed as potential side effects of cannabis smoking. As such, an association between cannabis use and acute coronary syndrome has been postulated. Objective: The objective of our study was to analyze systematically the medical literature pertaining to this putative association. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey were queried using a unique search string. All human trials, case series, or case reports of cannabis use and acute coronary syndrome in any language were considered in the literature search. The definition of acute coronary syndrome represented a penumbra that included chest pain, angina pectoris, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrest. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Our final search strategy included free-text words (TW): (\"cannabis\"[TW] OR \"marijuana\"[TW]) AND (\"acute coronary syndrome\"[TW] OR \"myocardial\" OR \"ischemia\"[TW] OR \"infarction\"[TW] OR \"chest pain\"[TW] OR \"cardiac arrest\"[TW] OR \"angina\"[TW]). To remain consistent over a span of five decades, we specifically did not include any publications with non-phytogenic, non-smoked cannabis as the sole etiology, as these are relatively recent and may possess additional pharmacologic characteristics compared to phytogenic cannabinoids. Therefore, for the purpose of this review, the term \"cannabis\" refers to the smoked phytogenic form. The search resulted in 325 articles. References in each selected publication were carefully hand-searched for any additional reports having relevance, and a total of 12 publications were identified in this manner. Following comparison and discussion amongst the co-authors, duplicate and non-relevant publications were removed, and a total of 85 publications involving 541,518 human subjects were selected for inclusion. Results were synthesized and reviewed by the authors for relevance. Clinical trials, observational studies, retrospective studies, case series, and case reports were graded using Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine guidelines. Results: There were no Level I randomized blinded controlled studies specifically addressing the cannabis/acute coronary syndrome association. However, there were five Level I systematic reviews, 14 Level II studies with 83,961 subjects, and 14 Level III studies with 457,495 subjects. Conclusions from 28 of these 33 studies highlighted an increased risk of both acute coronary syndrome and chronic cardiovascular disease from cannabis use. The systematic reviews were wide-ranging in topic and scale, and none specifically focused on the association between cannabis use and acute coronary syndrome. The dissenting studies included two systematic reviews, one concluding there was limited and weak evidence for association of cardiovascular disease and acute coronary syndromes with cannabis use, and another citing the evidence was inconclusive. The other dissenting articles were two longitudinal prospective studies and a retrospective review concluding cannabis users had lower post-myocardial infarction mortality. There were 51 case series (Level IV) and case reports (Level V) with 62 subjects. Six cases were female (10%). Average age was 31 ± 12 years, reported maximum heart rate was 88 ± 21 bpm, systolic blood pressure was 125 ± 32 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure was 80 ± 17 mmHg. ST-segment elevation was documented on 37 (60%) electrocardiograms, and the most common angiographic finding was left anterior descending coronary arterial occlusion and/or stenosis in 22 (35%) patients. Concomitant cardiomyopathy was described in 21 (34%) cases. There were 14 (23%) deaths attributed to acute coronary syndrome associated with cannabis use.

Treatment of postoperative pain with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is controversial as many surgeons believe that it reduces the efficacy of pleurodesis and increases the pneumothorax recurrence rate.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this retrospective study, we reviewed the hospital records for patients following VATS pleurodesis for recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. The patients were divided into two groups: (1) NSAID group: patients were treated with NSAIDs for more than a week following surgery and (2) control group: patients did not receive NSAIDs. Data regarding short- and long-term outcomes were compared.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study cohort included 105 patients: 48 in the NSAID group and 57 in the control group. During the early postoperative period the average daily requirement of narcotic analgesia and the incidence of narcotic-related side effects were lower in the NSAIDs group. No difference was found in the long-term recurrence rate: two of 48 (4%) in the NSAID group and three of 57 (5%) in the control group. There was one case of early recurrence in the NSAID group. Both groups had similar length of stay with no cases of mortality or major morbidity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      NSAIDs for postsurgical pleurodesis pain obviates the need for narcotics without increasing the pneumothorax recurrence rate. Prospective randomized controlled studies are needed to further investigate this issue."

A parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in three centres, recruiting 160 outpatients with MS experiencing significant problems from at least one of the following: spasticity, spasms, bladder problems, tremor or pain. The interventions were oromucosal sprays of matched placebo, or whole plant CBME containing equal amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) at a dose of 2.5-120 mg of each daily, in divided doses. The primary outcome measure was a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for each patient's most troublesome symptom. Additional measures included VAS scores of other symptoms, and measures of disability, cognition, mood, sleep and fatigue. Following CBME the primary symptom score reduced from mean (SE) 74.36 (11.1) to 48.89 (22.0) following CBME and from 74.31 (12.5) to 54.79 (26.3) following placebo [ns].

To investigate whether this was due to some change in cannabinoid receptor levels and/or expression induced by chronic morphine, we designed this autoradiographic binding study coupled with in situ hybridization on sagittal sections of the treated rat brains. Binding showed a significant increase in CB1 receptor density (15%) specifically in the caudate-putamen, in parallel with a significant enhancement of CB1 mRNA in the same area (20%).

            "abstract": "Despite the long-standing belief in the analgesic properties of alcohol, experimental studies have produced mixed results. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify whether alcohol produces a decrease in experimentally-induced pain and to determine the magnitude of any such effect. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases were searched from inception until April 21, 2016 for controlled studies examining the effect of quantified dosages of alcohol on pain response to noxious stimulation. Eighteen studies involving 404 participants were identified providing alcohol versus no-alcohol comparisons for 13 tests of pain threshold (n = 212) and 9 tests of pain intensity ratings (n = 192). Random effects meta-analysis of standardized mean difference (SMD) provided robust support for analgesic effects of alcohol. A mean blood alcohol content (BAC) of approximately .08% (3-4 standard drinks) produced a small elevation of pain threshold (SMD [95% CI] = .35 [.17-.54], P = .002), and a moderate to large reduction in pain intensity ratings (SMD [95% CI] = .64 [.37-.91], P < .0001), or equivalently, a mean reduction of 1.25 points on a 0- to 10-point pain rating scale. Furthermore, increasing BAC resulted in increasing analgesia, with each .02% BAC increment producing an increase of SMD = .11 for pain threshold and SMD = .20 for reduced pain intensity. Some evidence of publication bias emerged, but statistical correction methods suggested minimal impact on effect size. Taken together, findings suggest that alcohol is an effective analgesic that delivers clinically-relevant reductions in ratings of pain intensity, which could explain alcohol misuse in those with persistent pain despite its potential consequences for long-term health. Further research is needed to corroborate these findings for clinical pain states.\n    \n\n\n          Perspective:\n        \n      \n      This meta-analysis provides robust evidence for the analgesic properties of alcohol, which could potentially contribute to alcohol misuse in pain patients. Strongest analgesia occurs for alcohol levels exceeding World Health Organization guidelines for low-risk drinking and suggests raising awareness of alternative, less harmful pain interventions to vulnerable patients may be beneficial."

Though there are nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions recommended for the treatment of agitation, the efficacy of these are modest and not always consistent. Furthermore, the safety profiles of currently prescribed medications are questionable. Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, has a distinct pharmacological profile that may provide a safer and more effective treatment for agitation, while potentially having benefits for weight and pain. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests nabilone may have neuroprotective effects. We describe a clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of nabilone for the treatment of agitation in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. This will be a double-blind, randomized cross-over study comparing 6 weeks of nabilone (0.5-2 mg) and placebo, with a 1-week washout preceding each phase.

Exploratory outcomes include pain (Pain Assessment in Advanced AD), nutritional status (Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form), caregiver distress (NPI caregiver distress), and blood-based biomarkers. A safe and efficacious pharmacological intervention for agitation, with effects on pain and weight loss in patients with moderate-to-severe AD could increase quality-of-life, reduce caregiver stress and avoid unnecessary institutionalization and related increases in health care costs.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical trials number:\n        \nNCT02351882."

Regarding side effects in cancer patients, there were no differences between cannabinoids and placebo in symptoms of dizziness (RD: 0.03 [-0.02; 0.08]; P = 0.23) or poor mental health (RD: -0.01 [-0.04; 0.03]; P = 0.69), whereas in HIV patients, there was a significant increase in mental health symptoms (RD: 0.05 [0.00; 0.11]; P = 0.05). Tolerability (measured by the number of withdrawals because of adverse events) did not differ significantly in cancer (RD: 1.15 [0.80; 1.66]; P = 0.46) and HIV patients (RD: 1.87 [0.60; 5.84]; P = 0.28). Safety did not differ in cancer (RD: 1.12 [0.86; 1.46]; P = 0.39) or HIV patients (4.51 [0.54; 37.45]; P = 0.32) although there was large uncertainty about the latter reflected in the width of the CI. In one moderate quality study of 469 cancer patients with cancer-associated anorexia, megestrol was superior to cannabinoids in improving appetite, producing >10% weight gain and tolerability. In another study comparing megestrol to dronabinol in HIV patients, megestrol treatment led to higher weight gain without any differences in tolerability and safety. We found no convincing, unbiased, high quality evidence suggesting that cannabinoids are of value for anorexia or cachexia in cancer or HIV patients."

In a crossover design, each participant was exposed to 4 single dosing sessions of placebo or to low (1% tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]), medium (4% THC), or high (7% THC) doses of cannabis. Baseline spontaneous pain, evoked pain, and cognitive testing were performed. Subjects were then administered aerosolized cannabis or placebo and the pain intensity and subjective \"highness\" score was measured at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes and then every 30 minutes for an additional 3 hours. Cognitive testing was performed at 5 and 30 minutes and then every 30 minutes for an additional 3 hours. The primary analysis compared differences in spontaneous pain over time between doses using linear mixed effects models. There was a significant difference in spontaneous pain scores between doses (P < .001). Specific significant comparisons were placebo versus low, medium, and high doses (P = .031, .04, and <.001, respectively) and high versus low and medium doses (both P < .001).

Plasma vasopressin (ADH) levels rose significantly in both groups after the beginning or surgical procedure which was markedly less pronounced in patients with high fentanyl (group B). In group A (low dose) a second dose of fentanyl was given after sternotomy, which was followed by a significant decrease in ADH (80% from previous value). No significant variations could be demonstrated in plasma levels of cortisol, ACTH, and human growth hormone (HGH). The data stress the importance of plasma-vasopressin-levels in determining the endocrine stress response following trauma and operation.

            "abstract": "The interest on cannabinoids became evident between the 1940 and 1950 decades. Although the active substance of the plant was not known, a series of compounds with cannabinomimetic activity were synthesized, which were investigated in animals and clinically. The most widely tested was Δ6a, 10a-THC hexyl. Δ6a, 10a-THC dimethylheptyl (DMHP) antiepileptic effects were studied in several children, with positive results being obtained in some cases. DMHP differs from sinhexyl in that its side chain is DMHP instead of n-hexyl. The first cannabinoid isolated from Cannabis sativa was cannabinol, although its structure was correctly characterized several years later. Cannabidiol was isolated some years later and was subsequently characterized by Mechoulam and Shvo. In 2013, the National Academy of Medicine and the Faculty of Medicine of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, through the Seminar of Studies on Entirety, decided to carry out a systematic review on a subject that is both complex and controversial: the relationship between marijuana and health. In recent years, studies have been conducted with cannabis in several diseases: controlled clinical trials on spasticity in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, chronic, essentially neuropathic, pain, movement disorders (Gilles de Latourette, dystonia, levodopa dyskinesia), asthma and glaucoma, as well as non-controlled clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease, neuroprotection, intractable hiccups, epilepsy, alcohol and opioid dependence and inflammatory processes."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Spasticity is the main complication of many upper motor neuron disorders. Many studies describe neuro-orthopedic surgeries for the correction of joint and limb deformities due to spasticity, though less in the upper extremity. The bulk of care provided to patients with spasticity is provided by rehabilitation clinicians, however, few of the surgical outcomes have been summarized or appraised in the rehabilitation literature. Objective: To review the literature for neuro-orthopedic surgical techniques in the upper limb and evaluate the level of evidence for their efficacy in adult patients with spasticity. Method: Electronic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for English, French as well as Farsi languages human studies from 1980 to July 2, 2020. After removing duplicated articles, 2,855 studies were screened and 80 were found to be included based on the criteria. The studies were then divided into two groups, with 40 in each trial and non-trial. The results of the 40 trial articles were summarized in three groups: shoulder, elbow and forearm, and wrist and finger, and each group was subdivided based on the types of intervention. Results: The level of evidence was evaluated by Sackett's approach. There were no randomized control trial studies found. About, 4 studies for shoulder, 8 studies for elbow and forearm, 26 studies for wrist and finger (including 4 for the thumb in palm deformity), and 2 systematic reviews were found. Around, two out of 40 trial articles were published in the rehabilitation journals, one systematic review in Cochrane, and the remaining 38 were published in the surgical journals. Conclusion: Most surgical procedures are complex, consisting of several techniques based on the problems and goals of the patient. This complexity interferes with the evaluation of every single procedure. Heterogenicity of the participants and the absence of clinical trial studies are other factors of not having a single conclusion. This review reveals that almost all the studies suggested good results after the surgery in carefully selected cases with goals of reducing spasticity and improvement in function, pain, hygiene, and appearance. A more unified approach and criteria are needed to facilitate a collaborative, evidence-based, patient referral, and surgical selection pathway."

Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to explore the association of six prespecified variables with more complete reporting of PRISMA harms items.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We included 120 systematic reviews, including 60 Cochrane and 60 non-Cochrane reviews. Scores on the PRISMA harms checklist (23 items) were low (median 4, [first, third quartile: 2, 6]), with no difference between Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews (4.5 [2, 7] vs. 4 [2.5, 5]; P = 0.29). Among all eligible reviews, only one item (i.e., state conclusions in coherence with the review findings) was reported adequately (proportion of adherence 81.6%); proportion of reporting for other items ranged from 1.7% to 68.3%. The four essential reporting items from PRISMA harms checklist were also poorly complied (proportion of adherence ranged from 1.7% to 9.2%). Multivariable linear regression analyses found no significant associations between any study characteristic and reporting on the PRISMA harms, likely because of limited variability in scores across studies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The reporting of safety information was poor both for Cochrane and non-Cochrane drug systematic reviews predating PRISMA harms checklist. The findings suggested a strong need to use the PRISMA harms checklist for reporting safety among drug systematic reviews."

            "abstract": "Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is an integral membrane serine hydrolase that degrades the fatty acid amide family of signaling lipids, including the endocannabinoid anandamide. Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of FAAH leads to analgesic and anti-inflammatory phenotypes in rodents without showing the undesirable side effects observed with direct cannabinoid receptor agonists, indicating that FAAH may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory pain and other nervous system disorders. Herein, we report the discovery and characterization of a highly efficacious and selective FAAH inhibitor PF-04457845 (23). Compound 23 inhibits FAAH by a covalent, irreversible mechanism involving carbamylation of the active-site serine nucleophile of FAAH with high in vitro potency (k(inact)/K(i) and IC(50) values of 40300 M(-1) s(-1) and 7.2 nM, respectively, for human FAAH). Compound 23 has exquisite selectivity for FAAH relative to other members of the serine hydrolase superfamily as demonstrated by competitive activity-based protein profiling. Oral administration of 23 at 0.1 mg/kg results in efficacy comparable to that of naproxen at 10 mg/kg in a rat model of inflammatory pain. Compound 23 is being evaluated in human clinical trials."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoids are pharmacologically active agents extracted from the cannabis plant. Cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the most studied cannabinoids and both interact with endocannabinoid receptors in various human tissues. The endocannabinoid system moderates physiological functions, such as neurodevelopment, cognition, and motor control. The products naturally derived from cannabis include marijuana (dried leaves and flowers, mostly for smoking) and oral cannabinoid extracts with varying concentrations of cannabinoids, including cannabidiol and THC. THC is the main psychoactive constituent and cannabidiol seems to have no psychoactive properties. In addition, there are two synthetical cannabinoids approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, dronabinol and nabilone, which are molecules similar to a type of THC (δ-9-THC) Nabilone is also approved in Canada. Dronabinol is indicated for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in children. The use of nabilone in children is not recommended.\n    \n\n      \n      In Canada, the minimum age for cannabis consumption varies by provinces and territories, and is either 18 or 19 years. A prescription is required to administer cannabinoids among children. Clinically, cannabis has been used to treat children with epilepsy, cancer palliation and primary treatment, chronic pain, and Parkinson disease. The adverse events that clinicians need to monitor for include negative psychoactive sequelae and development of tolerance. Psychoactive sequelae may be positive, such as relaxation and euphoria, or negative, such as anxiety and irritability. In 2016, CADTH completed a Summary of Abstracts report on the use of cannabis in children with medical conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy, posttraumatic stress disorder, or neurodegenerative diseases, and five non-randomized studies were identified. However, there were no control groups in the five studies included in the report.– It is unclear whether there is new evidence or clinical guidance for the use of medical cannabis in children with mental health conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, or pain disorders, particularly in comparison with other possible therapies for those conditions. There is a need to review the clinical effectiveness of cannabis for pediatric care, as well as clinical guidelines."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoid-based drugs modeled on cannabinoids originally isolated from marijuana are now known to significantly impact the functioning of the endocannabinoid system of mammals. This system operates not only in the brain but also in organs and tissues in the periphery including the immune system. Natural and synthetic cannabinoids are tricyclic terpenes, whereas the endogenous physiological ligands are eicosanoids. Several receptors for these compounds have been extensively described, CB1 and CB2, and are G protein-coupled receptors; however, cannabinoid-based drugs are also demonstrated to function independently of these receptors. Cannabinoids regulate many physiological functions and their impact on immunity is generally antiinflammatory as powerful modulators of the cytokine cascade. This anti-inflammatory potency has led to the testing of these drugs in chronic inflammatory laboratory paradigms and even in some human diseases. Psychoactive and nonpsychoactive cannabinoid-based drugs such as Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, HU-211, and ajulemic acid have been tested and found moderately effective in clinical trials of multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, arthritis, and neuropathic pain. Furthermore, although clinical trials are not yet reported, preclinical data with cannabinoid-based drugs suggest efficacy in other inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis."

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant and has been used to manage neuropathic pain. Gabapentin is not without side effects and there is also potential for misuse. Side effects associated with gabapentin include somnolence, dizziness, peripheral edema and gait disturbances. Gabapentinoids (including gabapentin) in high doses may result in sedative and psychedelic effects. Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) but does not bind to the GABA receptors. Its mechanism of action is through binding to calcium channels and modulating the influx of calcium and thereby bestowing antiepileptic, analgesic and sedative effects. Recent research also suggests that gabapentin acts by blocking new synapse formation. Gabapentin is available in various dosages and formulations. Besides the immediate release gabapentin there is an extended release, gastro-retentive formulation and an extended release gabapentin prodrug (enacarbil) that rapidly hydrolyses to gabapentin.\n    \n\n      \n      The purpose of this report is to review the clinical efficacy and safety of gabapentin compared with placebo in adults with neuropathic pain."

'Cannabis' describes three separate forms - herbal cannabis, 'hemp' products, pharmaceutical-grade regulated cannabinoid-based medical products (CBMP). In Australia, CBMP became available for prescription in November 2016. Herbal cannabis with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is illegal, and cannabidiol (CBD) in herbal extracts, are both unregulated and unreliable sources of cannabinoids. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), delineated in the late 1990s, has increased the understanding and interest in research for appropriate clinical indications. The ubiquitous ECS has homeostatic and anti-inflammatory effects and comprises cannabinoid receptors, endocannabinoids and degrading enzymes. Phytocannabinoids are partial agonists of the ECS. In pre-clinical studies, THC and CBD produce beneficial effects in chronic pain, anxiety, sleep and inflammation. Systematic reviews often conflate herbal cannabis and CBMP, confusing the evidence. Currently large randomised controlled trials are unlikely to be achieved. Other methodologies with quality end-points are required. Rich, valuable high-quality real-world evidence for the safe and effective use of CBMP provides an opportunity to examine benefits and potential harms. Evidence demonstrates benefit of CBMP in multiple sclerosis, chronic neuropathic pain, chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, resistant paediatric epilepsy, anxiety and insomnia. CBMP are well tolerated with few serious adverse events. Additional clinical benefits are promising in many other resistant chronic conditions. Pharmaceutical grade prescribed CBMP has proven clinical benefits and provides another clinical option in the physician's pharmacopeia."

This review summarizes preclinical and clinical studies on the role of the endocannabinoid system and exogenous cannabinoids in anaesthesia and pain management.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      It has recently been shown that the endocannabinoid system is involved in the effects of the widely used anaesthetic drug propofol.

In patients, the treatment of acute pain often requires relatively high doses of cannabinoids, which are associated with considerable side-effects such as dizziness and sedation. In contrast, preclinical and clinical data suggest that lower doses of cannabinoids may be effective for the treatment of allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain.

            "title": "Should Oncologists Recommend Cannabis?",
            "abstract": "Cannabis is a useful botanical with a wide range of therapeutic potential. Global prohibition over the past century has impeded the ability to study the plant as medicine. However, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been developed as a stand-alone pharmaceutical initially approved for the treatment of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting in 1986. The indication was expanded in 1992 to include treatment of anorexia in patients with the AIDS wasting syndrome. Hence, if the dominant cannabinoid is available as a schedule III prescription medication, it would seem logical that the parent botanical would likely have similar therapeutic benefits. The system of cannabinoid receptors and endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) has likely developed to help us modulate our response to noxious stimuli. Phytocannabinoids also complex with these receptors, and the analgesic effects of cannabis are perhaps the best supported by clinical evidence. Cannabis and its constituents have also been reported to be useful in assisting with sleep, mood, and anxiety. Despite significant in vitro and animal model evidence supporting the anti-cancer activity of individual cannabinoids-particularly THC and cannabidiol (CBD)-clinical evidence is absent. A single intervention that can assist with nausea, appetite, pain, mood, and sleep is certainly a valuable addition to the palliative care armamentarium. Although many healthcare providers advise against the inhalation of a botanical as a twenty-first century drug-delivery system, evidence for serious harmful effects of cannabis inhalation is scant and a variety of other methods of ingestion are currently available from dispensaries in locales where patients have access to medicinal cannabis. Oncologists and palliative care providers should recommend this botanical remedy to their patients to gain first-hand evidence of its therapeutic potential despite the paucity of results from randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials to appreciate that it is both safe and effective and really does not require a package insert."

            "abstract": "The recent identification of cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous lipid ligands has triggered an exponential growth of studies exploring the endocannabinoid system and its regulatory functions in health and disease. Such studies have been greatly facilitated by the introduction of selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists and inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolism and transport, as well as mice deficient in cannabinoid receptors or the endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme fatty acid amidohydrolase. In the past decade, the endocannabinoid system has been implicated in a growing number of physiological functions, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in peripheral organs. More importantly, modulating the activity of the endocannabinoid system turned out to hold therapeutic promise in a wide range of disparate diseases and pathological conditions, ranging from mood and anxiety disorders, movement disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, to cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, glaucoma, obesity/metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis, to name just a few. An impediment to the development of cannabinoid medications has been the socially unacceptable psychoactive properties of plant-derived or synthetic agonists, mediated by CB(1) receptors. However, this problem does not arise when the therapeutic aim is achieved by treatment with a CB(1) receptor antagonist, such as in obesity, and may also be absent when the action of endocannabinoids is enhanced indirectly through blocking their metabolism or transport. The use of selective CB(2) receptor agonists, which lack psychoactive properties, could represent another promising avenue for certain conditions. The abuse potential of plant-derived cannabinoids may also be limited through the use of preparations with controlled composition and the careful selection of dose and route of administration. The growing number of preclinical studies and clinical trials with compounds that modulate the endocannabinoid system will probably result in novel therapeutic approaches in a number of diseases for which current treatments do not fully address the patients' need. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview on the current state of knowledge of the endocannabinoid system as a target of pharmacotherapy."

For decades, research on CBD has been hindered due to the status of cannabis (C. sativa L.) as an illicit drug. Limited safety data show that CBD is well-tolerated in dogs, with insufficient information on the safety profile of CBD in cats. Upon oral supplementation of CBD, elevation in liver enzymes was observed for both dogs and cats, and pharmacokinetics of CBD are different in the two species. There is a significant gap in the literature on the therapeutic use of CBD in cats, with no feline data on anxiety, pain, and inflammation management. There is evidence that chronic osteoarthritic pain in dogs can be reduced by supplementation with CBD. Furthermore, experiments are required to better understand whether CBD has an influence on noise-induced fear and anxiolytic response. Preliminary evidence exists to support the analgesic properties of CBD in treating chronic canine osteoarthritis; however, there are inter- and intra-species differences in pharmacokinetics, tolerance, dosage, and safety of CBD. Therefore, to validate the anxiety management, pain management, and anti-inflammatory efficacy of CBD, it is essential to conduct systematic, randomized, and controlled trials.

            "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two best known and most extensively studied phytocannabinoids within Cannabis sativa. An increasing number of preclinical studies and clinical trials have been conducted with one or both compounds, often probing their therapeutic effects in conditions such as paediatric epilepsy, anxiety disorders or chronic pain. Accurate monitoring of THC and CBD and their metabolites is essential for tracking treatment adherence and pharmacokinetics. However, fully validated methods for the comprehensive analysis of major Phase I CBD metabolites are yet to be developed due to a historical lack of commercially available reference material. In the present study, we developed, optimised and validated a method for the simultaneous quantification of CBD, THC and their major Phase I metabolites 6-hydroxy-CBD (6-OH-CBD), 7-hydroxy-CBD (7-OH-CBD), 7-carboxy-CBD (7-COOH-CBD), 11-hydroxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC) and 11-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-COOH-THC) as per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. The method is accurate, reproducible, sensitive and can be carried out in high-throughput 96-well formats, ideal for larger scale clinical trials. Deuterated internal standards for each analyte were crucial to account for variable matrix effects between plasma lots. The application of the method to plasma samples, taken from people who had been administered oral CBD as part of an open-label trial of CBD effects in anxiety disorders, demonstrated its immediate utility in ongoing and upcoming clinical trials. The method will prove useful for future studies involving CBD and/or THC and can likely accommodate the inclusion of additional metabolites as analytical reference materials become commercially available."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoids and opioids share several pharmacologic properties and may act synergistically. The potential pharmacokinetics and the safety of the combination in humans are unknown. We therefore undertook a study to answer these questions. Twenty-one individuals with chronic pain, on a regimen of twice-daily doses of sustained-release morphine or oxycodone were enrolled in the study and admitted for a 5-day inpatient stay. Participants were asked to inhale vaporized cannabis in the evening of day 1, three times a day on days 2-4, and in the morning of day 5. Blood sampling was performed at 12-h intervals on days 1 and 5. The extent of chronic pain was also assessed daily. Pharmacokinetic investigations revealed no significant change in the area under the plasma concentration-time curves for either morphine or oxycodone after exposure to cannabis. Pain was significantly decreased (average 27%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9, 46) after the addition of vaporized cannabis. We therefore concluded that vaporized cannabis augments the analgesic effects of opioids without significantly altering plasma opioid levels. The combination may allow for opioid treatment at lower doses with fewer side effects."

Self-rated cannabis efficacy, defined as a function of initial and final symptom ratings, was investigated across the included symptom clusters of cramps, pelvic pain, gastrointestinal pain, nausea, depression, and low libido. Cannabis dosage form, dose and cannabinoid ratio information was also recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total number of 252 participants identifying as suffering endometriosis recorded 16193 sessions using cannabis between April 2017 and February 2020. The most common method of ingestion was inhalation (n = 10914, 67.4%), with pain as the most common reported symptom being treated by cannabis (n = 9281, 57.3%). Gastrointestinal symptoms, though a less common reason for cannabis usage (15.2%), had the greatest self-reported improvement after use. Inhaled forms had higher efficacy for pain, while oral forms were superior for mood and gastrointestinal symptoms. Dosage varied across ingestion methods, with a median dose of 9 inhalations (IQR 5 to 11) for inhaled dosage forms and 1 mg/mL (IQR 0.5 to 2) for other ingested dosage forms. The ratio of THC to CBD had a statistically significant, yet clinically small, differential effect on efficacy, depending on method of ingestion.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cannabis appears to be effective for pelvic pain, gastrointestinal issues and mood, with effectiveness differing based on method of ingestion. The greater propensity for use of an inhaled dosage delivery may be due to the rapid onset of pain-relieving effects versus the slower onset of oral products. Oral forms appeared to be superior compared to inhaled forms in the less commonly reported mood or gastrointestinal categories. Clinical trials investigating the tolerability and effectiveness of cannabis for endometriosis pain and associated symptoms are urgently required."

A protocol-guided scoping review conduct. Searches of bibliographic databases (e.g., MEDLINE®, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library) and gray literature were performed. Two people selected and charted data from systematic reviews. Categorizations emerged during data synthesis. The reporting of results from systematic reviews was performed at a high level appropriate for a scoping review.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After screening 1975 citations, 72 systematic reviews were included. The reviews covered many conditions, the most common being pain management. Several reviews focused on management of pain as a symptom of conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), injury, and cancer. After pain, the most common symptoms treated were spasticity in MS, movement disturbances, nausea/vomiting, and mental health symptoms. An assessment of review findings lends to the understanding that, although in a small number of reviews results showed a benefit for reducing pain, the analysis approach and reporting in other reviews was sub-optimal, making it difficult to know how consistent findings are when considering pain in general. Adverse effects were reported in most reviews comparing cannabis with placebo (49/59, 83%) and in 20/24 (83%) of the reviews comparing cannabis to active drugs. Minor adverse effects (e.g., drowsiness, dizziness) were common and reported in over half of the reviews. Serious harms were not as common, but were reported in 21/59 (36%) reviews that reported on adverse effects. Overall, safety data was generally reported study-by-study, with few reviews synthesizing data. Only one review was rated as high quality, while the remaining were rated of moderate (n = 36) or low/critically low (n = 35) quality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Results from the included reviews were mixed, with most reporting an inability to draw conclusions due to inconsistent findings and a lack of rigorous evidence.

NO can provoke migraine-like attacks in migraineurs and initiates a self-amplifying process in the trigeminal system, probably leading to central sensitization.

            "abstract": "The taste of sucrose is commonly used to provide pain relief in newborn humans and is innately analgesic to neonatal rodents. In adulthood, sucrose remains a strong motivator to feed, even in potentially hazardous circumstances (ie, threat of tissue damage). However, the neurobiological mechanisms of this endogenous reward-pain interaction are unclear. We have developed a simple model of sucrose drinking-induced analgesia in Sprague-Dawley rats (6-10 weeks old) and have undertaken a behavioral and pharmacological characterization using the Hargreaves' test of hind-paw thermal sensitivity. Our results reveal an acute, potent, and robust inhibitory effect of sucrose drinking on thermal nociceptive behaviour that unlike the phenomenon in neonates is independent of endogenous opioid signalling and does not seem to operate through classical descending inhibition of the spinal cord circuitry. Experience of sucrose drinking had a conditioning effect whereby the apparent expectancy of sucrose enabled water alone (in euvolemic animals) to elicit a short-lasting placebo-like analgesia. Sweet taste alone, however, was insufficient to elicit analgesia in adult rats intraorally perfused with sucrose. Instead, the sucrose analgesia phenomenon only appeared after conditioning by oral perfusion in chronically cannulated animals. This sucrose analgesia was completely prevented by systemic dosing of the endocannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant. These results indicate the presence of an endogenous supraspinal analgesic circuit that is recruited by the context of rewarding drinking and is dependent on endocannabinoid signalling. We propose that this hedonic sucrose-drinking model may be useful for further investigation of the supraspinal control of pain by appetite and reward."

Peripheral immune cells, neurons and glia express CB2; however, the involvement of CB2 from these cells in neuropathic pain remains unresolved. We explored spontaneous neuropathic pain through on-demand self-administration of the selective CB2 agonist JWH133 in wild-type and knockout mice lacking CB2 in neurons, monocytes or constitutively. Operant self-administration reflected drug-taking to alleviate spontaneous pain, nociceptive and affective manifestations. While constitutive deletion of CB2 disrupted JWH133-taking behavior, this behavior was not modified in monocyte-specific CB2 knockouts and was increased in mice defective in neuronal CB2 knockouts suggestive of increased spontaneous pain. Interestingly, CB2-positive lymphocytes infiltrated the injured nerve and possible CB2transfer from immune cells to neurons was found. Lymphocyte CB2depletion also exacerbated JWH133 self-administration and inhibited antinociception. This work identifies a simultaneous activity of neuronal and lymphoid CB2that protects against spontaneous and evoked neuropathic pain."

Thus, pain modulation is particularly applicable to the practice of medicine. This review summarizes the existing literature on pain modulation. Here, we critically reviewed the literature from PubMed on pain modulation published primarily within the past 5 years in high impact journals. Specifically, we have discussed important anatomical landmarks of pain modulation and outlined the endogenous networks and underlying mechanisms of clinically relevant pain modulatory methods. The Gate Control Theory is briefly presented with discussion on the capacity of pain modulation to cause both hyper- and hypoalgesia. An emphasis has been given to highlight key areas in pain research that, because of unanswered questions or therapeutic potential, merit additional scientific scrutiny.

It reviews the role of cannabis in the treatment of chronic pain, cognitive and neurological adverse effects, special cases and addiction.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Cannabinoids work through the endocannabinoids system and inhibit the release of GABA and glutamate in the brain, impact neuromodulation, as well as dopamine, acetylcholine and norepinephrine release. They affect reward, learning and pain. The use of cannabis is increasing nationally and world-wide for both recreational and medicinal purposes, however, there is relatively only low quality evidence to the efficacy and adverse effects of this. Cannabis and its derivatives may be used for treatment of chronic pain. They are via CB1 receptors that are thought to modulate nociceptive signals in the brain. CB2 receptors in the DRG likely affect pain integration in the afferent pathways, and peripherally CB2 also affects noradrenergic pathways influencing pain. A large proportion of users may see more than 50% of chronic pain alleviation compared with placebo. Cannabis affects cognition, most notably executive function, memory and attention, and may deteriorate the boundary between emotional and executive processing. Cannabis impairs memory in the short run, which become more significant with chronic use, and may also be accompanied by poorer effort, slower processing and impacted attention. It is generally believed that long-term use and earlier age are risk factor for neurocognitive deficits; neuroimaging studies have shown reduced hippocampal volume and density. Executive functions and memory are worse in adolescent users versus adults. Cannabis addiction is different and likely less common than other addictive substances, but up to 10% of users meet criteria for lifetime cannabis dependence. Addiction patterns may be linked to genetic and epigenetic differences. It is still unclear whether abstinence reverses patterns of addiction, and more research is required into this topic.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Cannabis use has become more abundant for both medical and recreational use. It carries likely benefits in the form of analgesia, anti-emesis and improved appetite in chronic patients. The evidence reviewing adverse effects of this use are still limited, however, exiting data points to a clear link with neurocognitive deterioration, backed by loss of brain volume and density. Addiction is likely complex and variable, and no good data exists to support treatment at this point. It is becoming clear that use in earlier ages carries a higher risk for long-term deficits. As with any other drug, these risks should be considered alongside benefits prior to a decision on cannabis use."

A prospective and randomized study was performed on 21 knees of 21 patients. The ligament reconstruction was performed by single-incision arthroscopy using autogenous hamstring tendon. On completion of the surgery, thermosensors were implanted in the suprapatellar pouch and the intracondylar notch, and the intraarticular temperature was monitored while the joint was cooled. Cooling was performed in one group at 5 degrees C (N = 7) and in another at 10 degrees C (N = 7), for 48 hours. A control group (N = 7) did not undergo cryotherapy. The cooled groups showed three temperature phases: a low-temperature phase immediately after the ligament reconstruction, followed by a temperature-rising phase and a thermostatic phase. The control group had no low-temperature phase and immediately entered a thermostatic phase. During the low-temperature phase in the treated groups, the temperature of the suprapatellar pouch and of the intercondylar notch were significantly lower than the body temperature. The pain score and the number of times an analgesic had to be administered were both significantly lower in the 10 degrees C group than in the control group.

Objectives: To investigate the safety and tolerability of a range of doses of cannabidiol (CBD), a nonintoxicating component of cannabis, and it's effect on common parkinsonian symptoms. Methods: In this open-label study Coloradans with PD, substantial rest tremor, not using cannabis received plant-derived highly purified CBD (Epidiolex®; 100 mg/mL). CBD was titrated from 5 to 20-25 mg/kg/day and maintained for 10-15 days. Results: Fifteen participants enrolled, two were screen failures. All 13 participants (10 male), mean (SD) age 68.15 (6.05), with 6.1 (4.0) years of PD, reported adverse events, including diarrhea (85%), somnolence (69%), fatigue (62%), weight gain (31%), dizziness (23%), abdominal pain (23%), and headache, weight loss, nausea, anorexia, and increased appetite (each 5%). Adverse events were mostly mild; none serious. Elevated liver enzymes, mostly a cholestatic pattern, occurred in five (38.5%) participants on 20-25 mg/kg/day, only one symptomatic. Three (23%) dropped out due to intolerance. Ten (eight male) that completed the study had improvement in total and motor Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores of 7.70 (9.39, mean decrease 17.8%, p=0.012) and 6.10 (6.64, mean decrease 24.7%, p=0.004), respectively.

Smoking marijuana, or ingesting extracts from the whole plant orally (in baked goods, teas, and so forth), introduces variable amounts of THC, CBD, and other minor cannabinoids into the systemic circulation, where they ultimately reach the central and peripheral nervous systems. Alternatively, products containing THC, CBD, or a combination of both compounds, can be ingested as oral tablets or via sprays applied to the oral mucosal membranes. These products may provide a more predictable method for delivering a known amount of specific cannabinoids into the body. Although there is still a need for randomized controlled trials, preliminary studies have suggested that medical marijuana and related cannabinoids may be beneficial in treating people with chronic pain, inflammation, spasticity, and other conditions seen commonly in physical therapist practice. Physical therapists, therefore, should be aware of the options that are available for patients considering medical marijuana and should be ready to provide information for these patients. Clinicians also should be aware that marijuana can produce untoward effects on cognition, coordination, balance, and cardiovascular and pulmonary function and should be vigilant for any problems that may arise if patients are using cannabinoids during physical rehabilitation."

            "abstract": "The search for a biomarker for suicide risk is a longstanding pursuit in clinical psychiatry. Literature addressing the role of endocannabinoids in suicide attempters (SA) is sparse. This cross-sectional study is aimed at comparing 8 AM serum concentrations of 4 endogenous cannabinoids (anandamide, AEA; 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG; N-palmitoiletanolamida, PEA; and oleoylethanolamide, OEA) in 30 suicide attempters (SA) and 12 psychiatric controls (PC). 8 AM AEA and PEA serum levels were higher in SA compared to PC without controlling for cannabis use (n = 42) (3.58 ± 5.77 vs. 1.62 ± 2.49, F = 3.04, P = 0.089; and 3.31 ± 4.82 vs. 1.21 ± 1.20, F = 6.22, p = 0.017, respectively). Serum ACTH was higher in PC compared to SA (32.11 ± 21.60 vs. 20.05 ± 9.96, F = 9.031, p = 0.0.005). After controlling for cannabis use in the urine test (n = 28), 8 AM AEA and PEA serum levels remained higher in SA compared to PC (4.57 ± 6.38 vs. 0.64 ± 1.11, F = 4.852, P = 0.037; and 4.35 ± 5.46 vs. 1.21 ± 1.25, F = 4.125, p = 0.053, respectively). The present study offers preliminary evidence about the role of AEA and PEA in suicidal behavior (SB). Furthermore, in the context of the mental pain model of SB, our findings suggest that some endocannabinoids may play a role in the pathophysiology of SB. Our pilot study deserves replication by other studies with bigger sample sizes."

            "abstract": "Based on patient reports, animal data, and in vitro experiments, evidence has emerged indicating a positive effect of cannabinoids as symptomatic treatment of spasticity and pain in multiple sclerosis. The recently published CAMS study was the first multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial to examine the efficacy of cannabinoids on symptoms related to MS. There was no treatment effect of cannabinoids on the primary outcome measure, a difference in the reduction of spasticity as assessed by the so-called Ashworth score. In contrast, significant effects on patient-reported spasticity and pain were documented. A major problem of the study was a high degree of patient unmasking in the active treatment group. In this review, the results of the CAMS study are discussed in the context of previous trials, the putative mechanism of action of cannabinoids and their adverse event profile."

In this study (ASPIRE), we aimed to assess eltrombopag, an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, for thrombocytopenia (grade 4) treatment in adult patients with advanced MDS or AML.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      ASPIRE consisted of an open-label, double-blind phase for 8 weeks and a randomised, double-blind phase (parts 1 and 2, reported here) for 12 weeks, and an open-label extension (part 3). Eligible patients were men and women aged 18 years or older, with intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS or AML, with bone marrow blasts of 50% or less, and had either grade 4 thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow insufficiency (platelet counts <25 × 109 per L) or grade 4 thrombocytopenia before platelet transfusion, with 25 × 109 platelets per L or greater after transfusion. Additionally, eligible patients had at least one of the following within the screening period of 4 weeks: platelet transfusion, symptomatic bleeding, or platelet count of less than 10 × 109 per L. During part 1, patients received eltrombopag, and dose-escalation criteria for part 2 were determined. In part 2, we randomly allocated patients 2:1 using an interactive voice-response system to eltrombopag or placebo, stratified by baseline platelet count (<10 × 109 platelets per L vs ≥10 × 109 platelets per L) and disease (MDS vs AML). In parts 1 and 2, patients received supportive standard of care and initiated eltrombopag or placebo at 100 mg per day (50 mg per day for patients of east-Asian heritage) to a maximum of 300 mg per day (150 mg per day for patients of east-Asian heritage). The part 2 primary objective was assessed by a composite primary endpoint of clinically relevant thrombocytopenic events (CRTE) during weeks 5-12, defined as one of the following events, either alone or in combination: grade 3 or worse haemorrhagic adverse events; platelet counts of less than 10 × 109 per L; or platelet transfusions. Efficacy analyses were based on intention to treat; clinically meaningful efficacy was defined as 30% absolute difference between groups.

In part 2 we randomly allocated 145 patients to receive supportive care plus eltrombopag (n=98) or placebo (n=47); similar proportions had MDS (50 [51%] patients to eltrombopag, 22 (47%) patients to placebo) or AML (48 [49%] patients to eltrombopag, 25 [53%] patients to placebo). Average weekly CRTE proportions from weeks 5-12 were significantly lower with eltrombopag (54% [95% CI 43-64]) than with placebo (69% [57-80], odds ratio [OR] 0·20, 95% CI 0·05-0·87; p=0·032) although the difference between treatment groups was less than 30%. The most common grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events were fatigue (six [6%] in the eltrombopag group and one [2%] in the placebo group), hypokalaemia (six [6%] and two [4%]), pneumonia (five [5%] and five [11%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [5%] and six [13%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 56 (58%) eltrombopag-treated patients and 32 (68%) placebo-treated patients. Seven eltrombopag recipients and two placebo recipients had serious adverse events that were suspected to be study drug-related (eltrombopag: acute kidney injury, arterial thrombosis, bone pain, diarrhoea, myocardial infarction, pyrexia, retinal vein occlusion, n=1 each; placebo: vomiting, white blood cell count increased, n=1 each). Two eltrombopag recipients (arterial thrombosis n=1; myocardial infarction n=1) and no placebo recipients experienced fatal serious adverse events suspected to be study drug-related.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      No new safety concerns were noted with eltrombopag and the trial met the primary objective of a reduction in CRTEs; eltrombopag might be a treatment option for thrombocytopenic patients with AML or MDS who are ineligible for other treatment and who are not receiving disease-modifying treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      Novartis Pharma AG."

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of cannabinoids for chronic non-cancer pain. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL and clinicaltrials.gov were searched up to December 2018. Information on the type, dosage, route of administration, pain conditions, pain scores, and adverse events were extracted for qualitative analysis. Meta-analysis of analgesic efficacy was performed. Meta-regression was performed to compare the analgesic efficacy for different pain conditions (neuropathic versus non-neuropathic pain). Risk of bias was assessed by The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the strength of the evidence was assessed using the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Forty-three randomized controlled trials were included. Meta-analysis was performed for 33 studies that compared cannabinoids to placebo, and showed a mean pain score (scale 0-10) reduction of -0.70 (p < 0.001, random effect). Meta-regression showed that analgesic efficacy was similar for neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain (Difference = -0.14, p = 0.262). Inhaled, oral, and oromucosal administration all provided statistically significant, but small reduction in mean pain score (-0.97, -0.85, -0.45, all p < 0.001). Incidence of serious adverse events was rare, and non-serious adverse events were usually mild to moderate. Heterogeneity was moderate. The GRADE level of evidence was low to moderate. Pain intensity of chronic non-cancer patients was reduced by cannabinoids consumption, but effect sizes were small. Efficacy for neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain was similar."

There exist three different ways of applying local anaesthetics: (1) pre-incisional peritonsillar; (2) post-tonsillectomy wound infiltration; (3) post-tonsillectomy packing with soaked gauze. The objective of the study is the evaluation of differences of pain reduction comparing the three different techniques of application. The study design mainly includes intra-individual, prospective and double-blinded. One hundred and eighty patients (3-45 years) with recurrent tonsillitis were included. The charts of 156 were eligible for analysis. Bupivacaine was applied on both sides randomized in different ways. Pain on each side was registered for 6 days on the ward by a blinded nurse. When directly compared with the other two application methods, the post-tonsillectomy injection of bupivacaine provides significantly better results during the monitored time period. Postoperative bleeding was observed in 11 (7.3%) cases without any correlation to an application procedure. No other adverse effects were observed. In conclusion, post-tonsillectomy infiltration of the wounds with bupivacaine is superior to pre-incisional infiltration technique as well as post-tonsillectomy packing of the wounds with 0.5% bupivacaine-soaked gauze swab."

Sixty-six patients with 97 lesions who met our inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups. One group was administered with the topical liposomal form of azithromycin twice daily. The other group was treated by weekly intralesional injections of glucantime with a volume of 0.5-2 cm3 into each lesion till complete blanching of the lesion occurred. Clinical evaluations were performed weekly during the treatment course (8 weeks) by a single dermatologist for both groups. Per-protocol analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.764 (0.714-0.821).

We performed an international prospective cohort study including patients undergoing elective surgery in October 2020. Isolation was defined as the period before surgery during which patients did not leave their house or receive visitors from outside their household. The primary outcome was postoperative pulmonary complications, adjusted in multivariable models for measured confounders. Pre-defined sub-group analyses were performed for the primary outcome. A total of 96,454 patients from 114 countries were included and overall, 26,948 (27.9%) patients isolated before surgery. Postoperative pulmonary complications were recorded in 1947 (2.0%) patients of which 227 (11.7%) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who isolated pre-operatively were older, had more respiratory comorbidities and were more commonly from areas of high SARS-CoV-2 incidence and high-income countries. Although the overall rates of postoperative pulmonary complications were similar in those that isolated and those that did not (2.1% vs 2.0%, respectively), isolation was associated with higher rates of postoperative pulmonary complications after adjustment (adjusted OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.05-1.36, p = 0.005). Sensitivity analyses revealed no further differences when patients were categorised by: pre-operative testing; use of COVID-19-free pathways; or community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.

In this study, we expanded on previous findings related to the 3 SNPs in the opioid receptor mu subunit (OPRM1 rs1799971), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT rs4680), and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH rs324420) genes associated with placebo hypoalgesia and tested the effect of a 3-way interaction on placebo hypoalgesia. Using 2 well-established placebo procedures (verbal suggestion and learning paradigm), we induced significant placebo hypoalgesic effects in 160 healthy participants. We found that individuals with OPRM1 AA combined with FAAH Pro/Pro and those carrying COMT met/met together with FAAH Pro/Pro showed significant placebo effects. Participants with COMT met/val alleles showed significant placebo effects independently of OPRM1 and FAAH allele combinations. Finally, the model that included the placebo procedure and genotypes predicted placebo responsiveness with a higher accuracy (area under the curve, AUC = 0.773) as compared to the SNPs alone indicating that genetic variants can only partially explain the placebo responder status. Our results suggest that the endogenous mu-opioid system with a larger activation in response to pain in the met/val allele carriers as well as the synergism between endogenous mu-opioid system and cannabinoids might play the most relevant role in driving hypoalgesic responses. Future epistasis studies with larger sample sizes will help us to fully understand the complexity of placebo effects and explain the mechanisms that underlie placebo responsiveness."

            "abstract": "We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluating the analgesic efficacy of vaporized cannabis in subjects, the majority of whom were experiencing neuropathic pain despite traditional treatment. Thirty-nine patients with central and peripheral neuropathic pain underwent a standardized procedure for inhaling medium-dose (3.53%), low-dose (1.29%), or placebo cannabis with the primary outcome being visual analog scale pain intensity. Psychoactive side effects and neuropsychological performance were also evaluated. Mixed-effects regression models demonstrated an analgesic response to vaporized cannabis. There was no significant difference between the 2 active dose groups' results (P > .7). The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve 30% pain reduction was 3.2 for placebo versus low-dose, 2.9 for placebo versus medium-dose, and 25 for medium- versus low-dose. As these NNTs are comparable to those of traditional neuropathic pain medications, cannabis has analgesic efficacy with the low dose being as effective a pain reliever as the medium dose. Psychoactive effects were minimal and well tolerated, and neuropsychological effects were of limited duration and readily reversible within 1 to 2 hours. Vaporized cannabis, even at low doses, may present an effective option for patients with treatment-resistant neuropathic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Perspective:\n        \n      \n      The analgesia obtained from a low dose of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (1.29%) in patients, most of whom were experiencing neuropathic pain despite conventional treatments, is a clinically significant outcome. In general, the effect sizes on cognitive testing were consistent with this minimal dose. As a result, one might not anticipate a significant impact on daily functioning."

            "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the most represented phytocannabinoids in Cannabis sativa plants. However, CBD may present with a different activity compared with the psychotomimetic THC. Most typically, CBD is reported to be used in some medical conditions, including chronic pain. Conversely, the main aim of this systematic review is to assess and summarise the available body of evidence relating to both efficacy and safety of CBD as a treatment for psychiatric disorders, alone and/or in combination with other treatments. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effect of CBD in a range of psychopathological conditions, such as substance use; psychosis, anxiety, mood disturbances, and other psychiatric (e.g., cognitive impairment; sleep; personality; eating; obsessive-compulsive; post-traumatic stress/PTSD; dissociative; and somatic) disorders. For data gathering purposes, the PRISMA guidelines were followed. The initial search strategy identified some n = 1301 papers; n = 190 studies were included after the abstract's screening and n = 27 articles met the inclusion criteria. There is currently limited evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of CBD for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, available trials reported potential therapeutic effects for specific psychopathological conditions, such as substance use disorders, chronic psychosis, and anxiety. Further large-scale RCTs are required to better evaluate the efficacy of CBD in both acute and chronic illnesses, special categories, as well as to exclude any possible abuse liability."

To address these limitations, among a sample of PWH with pain interference enrolled in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, we performed a target trial emulation study to compare the impact of four cannabis use strategies on pain interference. Among those receiving long-term opioid therapy (LTOT), we also explored impact of these strategies on ≥ 25% LTOT dose reduction. Among the analytic sample (N = 1284), the majority were men with a mean age of 50. Approximately 31% used cannabis and 12% received LTOT at baseline. Adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, cannabis use in any of 4 longitudinal patterns was not associated with resolved pain interference over 12- to 24-month follow-up. Among 153 participants receiving LTOT at baseline, cannabis use at both baseline and follow-up was negatively associated with LTOT dose reduction compared to no use at both baseline and follow-up. These findings support other observational studies finding no association between cannabis use and improved chronic pain or LTOT reduction among PWH."

            "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, autoimmune disease of the CNS. There are currently a number of disease-modifying medications for MS that modulate or suppress the immune system; however, these medications do not directly relieve MS symptoms, which include visual deficits, gait problems, sensory deficits, weakness, tremor, spasticity and pain, among others. Pain is a common symptom in MS which has recently been estimated to be experienced by more than 40% of patients. Nociceptive pain occurs as an appropriate physiological response transmitted to a conscious level when nociceptors in bone, muscle or any body tissue are activated, warning the organism of tissue damage. Neuropathic pain is initiated as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, with no physiological advantage. Nociceptive and neuropathic pain in MS may be present concurrently and at different stages of the disease, and may be associated with other symptoms. Central neuropathic pain has been reported to be among the most common pain syndromes in MS. It is described as constant, often spontaneous, burning occurring more frequently in the lower limbs. Treatment typically includes tricyclic antidepressants and antiepileptic medications, although studies have been conducted in relatively small samples and optimal dosing has not been confirmed. Cannabinoids have been among the few treatments studied in well designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for central neuropathic pain. In the largest of these trials, which included 630 subjects, a 15-week comparison between Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and placebo was performed. More patients receiving active treatment perceived an improvement in pain than those receiving placebo, although approximately 20% of subjects reported worsening of pain while on active treatment. Trigeminal neuralgia, while affecting less than 5% of patients with MS, is the most studied pain syndrome. The pain can be extreme and is typically treated with carbamazepine, although adverse effects can mimic an MS exacerbation. Painful topic spasms occur in approximately 11% of the MS population and are treated with antispasticity medications such as baclofen and benzodiazepines. Gabapentin has also demonstrated efficacy, but all studies have included small sample sizes. In general, evidence for treating pain in MS is limited. Many clinical features of pain are often unrecognized by clinicians and are difficult for patients to describe. Treatment is often based on anecdotal reports and clinical experience. We present a review of treatment options for pain in MS, which should serve to update current knowledge, highlight shortcomings in clinical research and provide indications towards achieving evidence-based treatment of pain in MS."

During the past few years, legal systems around the world have enacted large scale adoption of the legalization of both medical and recreational cannabis. Anesthetists should therefore be prepared to treat patients who used cannabis and are undergoing elective or emergency operations. However, the interactions between cannabinoids and general anesthetic agents and the possible implications for patient care are not yet fully understood.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The study aimed to examine how preoperative use of cannabis affects the anesthesia process, and whether this use requires special attention by the anesthesiologists during surgery. Hence, we examined the effect of preoperative administration of cannabis extract Sativex (nabiximols) on obtained BIS value relative to the concentration of anesthetic gases.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Twenty-seven patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the following regimes: high dose cannabis (6), low dose cannabis (8), active placebo (6) and placebo (7). The study drugs were administered as premedication 20 minutes before induction of general anesthesia in a double-blind fashion. Cannabis was administered in the form of nabiximols (Sativex®), which is a highly-standardized extract of cannabis plants containing known drug dosages. During the surgery, hemodynamic parameters were monitored, and the anesthesia depth was measured using a BIS monitor, which is based on brain activity analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found a significant effect of treatment groups on bispectral index (BIS) after controlling for minimum alveolar concentration (MAC).

We speculate that the cannabinoid-induced increase in BIS may be the result of changes in EEG activity rather than an indication of a shallower anesthetic state. However, this hypothesis should be examined in further studies. The clinical importance of this study is that with patients who use cannabis adjacent to general anesthesia induction, one cannot rely on the BIS monitoring for the purpose of determining the patient sedative state."

The underlying mechanism of action remains largely unclear. These issues were addressed in parallel in the clinical and preclinical studies below. In this preliminary study, 25 patients with acute stress symptoms were administered a single intravenous bolus of high-dose hydrocortisone (100-140 mg) or placebo within 6 h of a traumatic event in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study. Early single high-dose hydrocortisone intervention attenuated the core symptoms of both the acute stress and of subsequent PTSD in patients. High-dose hydrocortisone treatment given in the first few hours after a traumatic experience was associated with significant favorable changes in the trajectory of exposure to trauma, as expressed by the reduced risk of the development of PTSD post-trauma. In parallel, a comparative study of morphological arborization in dentate gyrus and its modulating molecules was performed in stress-exposed animals treated with high-dose hydrocortisone. Steroid-treated stressed animals displayed significantly increased dendritic growth and spine density, with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and obtunded postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) levels. The animal study provided insights into the potential mechanism of this intervention, as it identified relevant morphological and biochemical associations to the clinical observations.

After a single vapor inhalation, THC and CBD plasma concentrations, pressure and electrical pain thresholds, spontaneous pain scores, and drug high were measured for 3 hours. None of the treatments had an effect greater than placebo on spontaneous or electrical pain responses, although more subjects receiving Bediol displayed a 30% decrease in pain scores compared to placebo (90% vs 55% of patients, P = 0.01), with spontaneous pain scores correlating with the magnitude of drug high (ρ = -0.5, P < 0.001). Cannabis varieties containing THC caused a significant increase in pressure pain threshold relative to placebo (P < 0.01). Cannabidiol inhalation increased THC plasma concentrations but diminished THC-induced analgesic effects, indicative of synergistic pharmacokinetic but antagonistic pharmacodynamic interactions of THC and CBD. This experimental trial shows the complex behavior of inhaled cannabinoids in chronic pain patients with just small analgesic responses after a single inhalation. Further studies are needed to determine long-term treatment effects on spontaneous pain scores, THC-CBD interactions, and the role of psychotropic symptoms on pain relief."

Therefore, topical therapy with cannabinoid receptor agonist seems likely to suppress local burning pain.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      In an open-labeled trial, 8 patients with facial postherpetic neuralgia received a cream containing the cannabinoid receptor agonist N-palmitoylethanolamine. The course of symptoms was scored with the visual analog scale.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      5 of 8 patients (62.5 %) experienced a mean pain reduction of 87.8 %. Therapy was tolerated by all patients. No unpleasant sensations or adverse events occurred.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Topical cannabinoid receptor agonists are an effective and well-tolerated adjuvant therapy option in postherpetic neuralgia."

The GAD-7 was administered at the time of the first visit to the clinic and subsequently over the follow-up time period of up to 3.2 years. Overall changes in GAD-7 scores were computed (mean change) and categorized as: no change (<1 point); improvement; or worsening-over time.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 37,303 patients had initial GAD-7 scores recorded and 5,075 (13.6%) patients had subsequent GAD-7 follow-up scores.

Average GAD-7 scores were 9.11 (SD 6.6) at the baseline and after an average of 282 days of follow-up (SD 264) the average final GAD-7 score recorded was 9.04 (SD 6.6): mean change -0.23 (95% CI, -0.28 to -0.17, t[5,074]: -8.19, p-value <0.001). A total of 4,607 patients (90.8%) had no change in GAD-7 score from their initial to final follow-up, 188 (3.7%) had a clinically significant decrease, and 64 (1.3%) noted a clinically significant increase in their GAD-7 scores.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overall, there was a statistically significant decrease in GAD-7 scores over time (in particular, in the 6-12-month period). However, this change did not meet the threshold to be considered clinically significant. Thus, we did not detect clinical improvements or detriment in GAD-7 scores in medically authorized cannabis patients. However, future well-controlled clinical trials are needed to fully examine risks or benefits associated with using medical cannabis to treat anxiety conditions."

Selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors have been found to reduce pain in painful neuropathy. The new anticonvulsant lacosamide may have some effect in painful polyneuropathy, whereas levetiracetam has failed to relieve postmastectomy and spinal cord injury pain. The role of the old anticonvulsant phenytoin is still unsettled. A recent trial has found an effect of cannabinoids also in peripheral neuropathic pain. Various topical treatments such as topical lidocaine, topically applied capsaicin in high concentrations (8%), and botulinum toxin have recently been shown to have a pain-relieving effect in various peripheral neuropathic pain conditions. Spinal cord and transcranial magnetic stimulation are stimulation therapies with some evidence for efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Treating neuropathic pain remains a great challenge, and the treatment has to be individualized to the single patient, taking into account side effects, pain type, comorbidities, and drug interactions."

Healthy adults (N = 29) with no history of drug use disorder received combinations of placebo, hydromorphone (4 mg; oral), and dronabinol (2.5 mg, 5.0 mg, 10 mg; oral). Primary outcomes were quantitative sensory testing (QST) measures of acute (thermal, pressure pain; thermal, punctate probe temporal summation; cold pressor; conditioned pain modulation) and chronic pain (capsaicin 10% topical cream with thermal rekindling), measures of drug abuse liability, cognitive functioning, and adverse events. Subgroup analyses were conducted within opioid-responders (endorsed >20 on a Drug Effect visual analog scale during the hydromorphone-only condition) and nonresponders. A consistent dose-effect relationship of dronabinol on hydromorphone across all measures was not observed. Analgesia only improved in the hydromorphone + dronabinol 2.5 mg condition. Hydromorphone + dronabinol 2.5 mg showed the lowest and hydromorphone+dronabinol 5 mg showed the highest risk for abuse. Hydromorphone+dronabinol 10 mg produced a high rate of dysphoric effects, and hydromorphone+dronabinol 5 mg and hydromorphone + dronabinol 10 mg produced AEs. Subgroup analyses showed subjective effects and abuse risk was increased among opioid responders and largely absent among nonresponders. Overall, only hydromorphone+dronabinol 2.5 mg modestly enhanced hydromorphone-based analgesia and hydromorphone + dronabinol 5 mg and 10 mg increased risk for abuse and AEs. These data can help inform opioid-sparing efforts in clinical pain populations. Demonstration that potential opioid effects varied as a function of participant opioid sensitivity (e.g., responder status) is a novel finding that warrants additional research."

            "abstract": "Hemopressin is the first peptide ligand to be described for the CB₁ cannabinoid receptor. Hemopressin acts as an inverse agonist in vivo and can cross the blood-brain barrier to both inhibit appetite and induce antinociception. Despite being highly effective, synthetic CB₁ inverse agonists are limited therapeutically due to unwanted, over dampening of central reward pathways. However, hemopressin appears to have its effect on appetite by affecting satiety rather than reward, suggesting an alternative mode of action which might avoid adverse side effects. Here, to resolve the neuronal circuitry mediating hemopressin's actions, we have combined blood-oxygen-level-dependent, pharmacological-challenge magnetic resonance imaging with c-Fos functional activity mapping to compare brain regions responsive to systemic administration of hemopressin and the synthetic CB₁ inverse agonist, AM251. Using these complementary methods, we demonstrate that hemopressin activates distinct neuronal substrates within the brain, focused mainly on the feeding-related circuits of the mediobasal hypothalamus and in nociceptive regions of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and dorsal raphe (DR). In contrast to AM251, there is a distinct lack of activation of the brain reward centres, such as the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex, which normally form a functional activity signature for the central action of synthetic CB₁ receptor inverse agonists. Thus, hemopressin modulates the function of key feeding-related brain nuclei of the mediobasal hypothalamus, and descending pain pathways of the PAG and DR, and not higher limbic structures. Thus, hemopressin may offer behaviourally selective effects on nociception and appetite, without engaging reward pathways."

            "abstract": "Herbs and spices have a traditional history of use, with strong roles in cultural heritage, and in the appreciation of food and its links to health. Demonstrating the benefits of foods by scientific means remains a challenge, particularly when compared with standards applied for assessing pharmaceutical agents. Pharmaceuticals are small-molecular-weight compounds consumed in a purified and concentrated form. Food is eaten in combinations, in relatively large, unmeasured quantities under highly socialised conditions. The real challenge lies not in proving whether foods, such as herbs and spices, have health benefits, but in defining what these benefits are and developing the methods to expose them by scientific means.\n    \n\n\n          Cultural aspects:\n        \n      \n      The place of herbs and spices in the diet needs to be considered in reviewing health benefits. This includes definitions of the food category and the way in which benefits might be viewed, and therefore researched. Research may focus on identifying bioactive substances in herbs and spices, or on their properties as a whole food, and/or be set in the context of a dietary cuisine.\n    \n\n\n          The role of herbs and spices in health:\n        \n      \n      The antioxidant properties of herbs and spices are of particular interest in view of the impact of oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis. There is level III-3 evidence (National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC] levels of evidence) that consuming a half to one clove of garlic (or equivalent) daily may have a cholesterol-lowering effect of up to 9%. There is level III-1 evidence that 7.2 g of aged garlic extract has been associated with anticlotting (in-vivo studies), as well as modest reductions in blood pressure (an approximate 5.5% decrease in systolic blood pressure). A range of bioactive compounds in herbs and spices have been studied for anticarcinogenic properties in animals, but the challenge lies in integrating this knowledge to ascertain whether any effects can be observed in humans, and within defined cuisines. Research on the effects of herbs and spices on mental health should distinguish between cognitive decline associated with ageing and the acute effects of psychological and cognitive function. There is level I and II evidence for the effect of some herbal supplements on psychological and cognitive function. There is very limited scientific evidence for the effects of herbs and spices on type 2 diabetes mellitus, with the best evidence being available for the effect of ginseng on glycaemia, albeit based on four studies. More research is required, particularly examining the effects of chronic consumption patterns. With increasing interest in alternatives to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in the management of chronic inflammation, research is emerging on the use of food extracts. There is level II evidence for the use of ginger in ameliorating arthritic knee pain; however, the improvement is modest and the efficacy of ginger treatment is ranked below that of ibuprofen. More definitive research is required.\n    \n\n\n          Public health and dietary implications:\n        \n      \n      Recommendations for intakes of food in the Australian guide to healthy eating do not yet include suggested intakes of herbs and spices. Future consideration should be given to including more explicit recommendations about their place in a healthy diet. In addition to delivering antioxidant and other properties, herbs and spices can be used in recipes to partially or wholly replace less desirable ingredients such as salt, sugar and added saturated fat in, for example, marinades and dressings, stir-fry dishes, casseroles, soups, curries and Mediterranean-style cooking. Vegetable dishes and vegetarian options may be more appetising when prepared with herbs and spices.\n    \n\n\n          Future directions:\n        \n      \n      As several metabolic diseases and age-related degenerative disorders are closely associated with oxidative processes in the body, the use of herbs and spices as a source of antioxidants to combat oxidation warrants further attention. Immediate studies should focus on validating the antioxidant capacity of herbs and spices after harvest, as well as testing their effects on markers of oxidation. This will work in parallel with clinical trials that are aiming to establish antioxidants as mediators of disease prevention. From a dietary perspective, the functionality of herbs and spices will be exposed through consideration of their properties as foods. As with most foods, the real benefits of including them in the diet are likely to emerge with a better understanding of the attributes of health that are best supported by food, and in methodological developments addressing the evidence base for their effects. These developments are well underway through evidence-based frameworks for substantiating health claims related to foods. At present, recommendations are warranted to support the consumption of foods rich in bioactive components, such as herbs and spices. With time, we can expect to see a greater body of scientific evidence supporting the benefits of herbs and spices in the overall maintenance of health and protection from disease."

Results: 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included for analysis (7 evaluating non pharmacologic interventions, 20 pharmacologic therapies). Non-pharmacologic studies (n = 742) involved seven different therapeutic modalities. Only Acupuncture/Moxibustion showed pain reduction over placebo, Gracely Pain Scale Mean (SD): Acu/Moxa 0.85 (0.12), placebo 1.10 (0.09), p = 0.05. Pharmacologic studies, involving 2516 patients revealed efficacy for capsaicin 8% over placebo (mean difference -8.04 [95% CI: -14.92 -1.15], smoked cannabis (where pooling data for meta-analysis was not possible) and recombinant Nerve Growth Factor. Conclusion: Despite various modalities for pain control in HIV-SN, strongest evidence exists for capsaicin 8% and smoked cannabis, although of low methodological quality. Among non-pharmacologic modalities, only Acu/Moxa gave a marginal beneficial effect in one study, possibly limited by inherent methodological flaws."

            "title": "Cannabinoids: Medical implications.",
            "abstract": "Herbal cannabis has been used for thousands of years for medical purposes. With elucidation of the chemical structures of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) and with discovery of the human endocannabinoid system, the medical usefulness of cannabinoids has been more intensively explored. While more randomized clinical trials are needed for some medical conditions, other medical disorders, like chronic cancer and neuropathic pain and certain symptoms of multiple sclerosis, have substantial evidence supporting cannabinoid efficacy. While herbal cannabis has not met rigorous FDA standards for medical approval, specific well-characterized cannabinoids have met those standards. Where medical cannabis is legal, patients typically see a physician who \"certifies\" that a benefit may result. Physicians must consider important patient selection criteria such as failure of standard medical treatment for a debilitating medical disorder. Medical cannabis patients must be informed about potential adverse effects, such as acute impairment of memory, coordination and judgment, and possible chronic effects, such as cannabis use disorder, cognitive impairment, and chronic bronchitis. In addition, social dysfunction may result at work/school, and there is increased possibility of motor vehicle accidents. Novel ways to manipulate the endocannbinoid system are being explored to maximize benefits of cannabinoid therapy and lessen possible harmful effects."

            "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system regulates nociception and aversion and mediates fear-conditioned analgesia (FCA). We investigated the effects of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597, which inhibits the catabolism of the endocannabinoid anandamide and related N-acylethanolamines, on expression of FCA and fear and pain related behaviour per se in rats. We also examined associated alterations in the expression of the signal transduction molecule phospho-Akt in the periaqueductal grey (PAG) by immunoblotting. FCA was modelled by assessing formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour in an arena previously paired with footshock. URB597 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced FCA and increased fear-related behaviour in formalin-treated rats. Conditioned fear per se in non-formalin-treated rats was associated with increased expression of phospho-Akt in the PAG. URB597 reduced the expression of fear-related behaviour in the early part of the trial, an effect that was accompanied by attenuation of the fear-induced increase in phospho-Akt expression in the PAG. Intra-plantar injection of formalin also reduced the fear-induced increase in phospho-Akt expression. These data provide evidence for a role of FAAH in FCA, fear responding in the presence or absence of nociceptive tone, and fear-evoked increases in PAG phospho-Akt expression. In addition, the results suggest that fear-evoked activation of Akt signalling in the PAG is abolished in the presence of nociceptive tone."

            "abstract": "Human heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) has a high potential as an early marker for myocardial infarction (MI) being more specific than myoglobin. FABP is a low molecular mass cytoplasmic protein (15 kDa) that is released early after the onset of ischemia and it may be useful for rapid confirmation or exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Immunochemically assayed FABP, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and enzymatically assayed creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were determined serially in plasma and serum samples from 218 patients presenting with chest pain and suspected MI. In the 94 patients with confirmed MI, FABP rose to a maximum level (577.6 +/- 43.8 microg/L) 3 hours after the onset of symptoms and returned to normal within 30 hours. The FABP level peaked 7-9 hours earlier than CPK (2288 +/- 131 U/L) and cTnI (357.1 +/- 23.9 microg/L). CPK took 50-70 hours to return to normal level and cTnI returned to normal level over 70 hours. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for FABP were calculated as 0.871 at admission and 0.995 one hour after admission, whereas for CPK the areas were 0.711 and 0.856 and for cTnI the areas were 0.677 and 0.845, indicating that the FABP test gave a better diagnostic classification at the early stage being reached by cTnI (0.995) only 8 hours after admission. For FABP, both sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) increased quickly to 100% for samples monitored just one hour after admission. By using only two samples, one at admission and one 1 hour post admission, sequential FABP monitoring can reliably diagnose AMI patients 1 hour after admission and 100% of non-AMI patients can be excluded with no false negative results. The late markers cTnI and CPK have the similar diagnostic performance only 7 hours later. Thus measurement of FABP in plasma or serum allows the earliest immunochemical confirmation or exclusion of AMI."

Differences reached statistical significance (P < .05) in 3 and 5 of the assessments, respectively. Patient satisfaction was higher in group A in the pre- (P < .05) and postoperative periods (P<.03). The block failed to achieve surgical anesthesia in 85% (17/20) of the patients, and additional anesthesia was needed. The anatomic study failed to support the existence of a defined \"psoas compartment\" previously described, and supported the clinical findings. Injected dye was found in the region of the origin of the sciatic nerve (essential for the production of anesthesia for hip surgery) in only 26% (4/15) of cadavers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The CPCB seems to be an appropriate technique for efficient and safe perioperative pain control.

Five male volunteers were given placebo, 50 mg CBN, 25 mg delta9-THC, 12.5 mg delta9-THC + 25 mg CBN, and 25 mg delta9-THC + 50 mg CBN (orally). Administrations were spaced 1 week apart. With physiological measures, delta9-THC produced an increase in heart rate while CBN did not. When combined, no change of the delta9-THC effect occurred. No changes occurred on the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, or body temperature. With psychophysical measures no changes occurred in pain thresholds or skin sensitivity as a function of drug treatment. In time estimates of the passage of 1 minute, delta9-THC alone produced underestimates of the passage of 1 minute and CBN alone had no effect. In combination the two drugs had a tendency to produce significant overestimates and underestimates of the passage of 1 minute. On a 66-item adjective-pair drug reaction scale, the volunteers reported feeling drugged, drunk, dizzy, and drowsy under the delta9-THC condition, but not under the CBN condition. With combined drug treatment, volunteers reported feeling more drugged, drunk, dizzy, and drowsy than under the delta9-THC condition alone. None of the drug treatments produced significant changes on other items which included items on perception, emotion, cognition and sociability. It appears that CBN increases the effect of delta9-THC on some aspects of physiological and psychological processes, but that these effects are small and cannot account for the greater potency which has been reported when plant material is used."

Increasingly, the merits of palliative care have been established earlier in the disease trajectory where treatment outcomes may include increased survival and maintenance of function. There is strong public support for the availability of medicinal cannabis, particularly for people with palliative diagnoses. There are several areas where there is potential for symptom benefits through modulation of the endocannabinoid system, though clinical data to date has been inconclusive in key symptoms such as pain and nausea, and data from other settings such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting not readily extrapolated. Ideally exploration of medicinal cannabinoids should occur within a clinical trial to accelerate the evidence base to inform practice. In people with refractory symptoms, the consideration of unregistered products or off-label prescribing should be guided by the potential influences of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and drug-drug interactions, supported by an informed discussion with the patient, and regular review of net clinical benefit."

Patients who had failed to gain adequate analgesia from existing medication were treated with THC/CBD spray or placebo as an add-on treatment, in a double-blind manner, for 14 weeks to investigate the efficacy of the medication in MS-induced neuropathic pain. This parallel-group phase of the study was then followed by an 18-week randomized-withdrawal study (14-week open-label treatment period plus a double-blind 4-week randomized-withdrawal phase) to investigate time to treatment failure and show maintenance of efficacy. A total of 339 patients were randomized to phase A (167 received THC/CBD spray and 172 received placebo). Of those who completed phase A, 58 entered the randomized-withdrawal phase. The primary endpoint of responder analysis at the 30 % level at week 14 of phase A of the study was not met, with 50 % of patients on THC/CBD spray classed as responders at the 30 % level compared to 45 % of patients on placebo (p = 0.234). However, an interim analysis at week 10 showed a statistically significant treatment difference in favor of THC/CBD spray at this time point (p = 0.046). During the randomized-withdrawal phase, the primary endpoint of time to treatment failure was statistically significant in favor of THC/CBD spray, with 57 % of patients receiving placebo failing treatment versus 24 % of patients from the THC/CBD spray group (p = 0.04). The mean change from baseline in Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (p = 0.028) and sleep quality NRS (p = 0.015) scores, both secondary endpoints in phase B, were also statistically significant compared to placebo, with estimated treatment differences of -0.79 and 0.99 points, respectively, in favor of THC/CBD spray treatment. The results of the current investigation were equivocal, with conflicting findings in the two phases of the study. While there were a large proportion of responders to THC/CBD spray treatment during the phase A double-blind period, the primary endpoint was not met due to a similarly large number of placebo responders. In contrast, there was a marked effect in phase B of the study, with an increased time to treatment failure in the THC/CBD spray group compared to placebo. These findings suggest that further studies are required to explore the full potential of THC/CBD spray in these patients."

The evidence for other add-on ASMs for overall seizure cessation or reduction was low to very low with high- to low-certainty evidence for AE leading to study discontinuation. Future research should consider outcome reporting of overall seizure reduction (applying automated seizure detection devices), impact on development, cognition and behaviour; future research should also investigate age-specific efficacy of ASMs and target underlying aetiologies."

Methodological quality was assessed using the Jadad scale.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Eight randomized control trials met the inclusion criteria for review. Most trials found analgesic effects from cannabinoids when compared to placebo, although not all associations reached statistical significance. The analgesic effects of cannabinoids were also limited by dose-dependent side effects. Side effects most commonly reported were changes in cognition, sedation, and dizziness.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for practice:\n        \n      \n      There is evidence that cannabinoids are effective adjuvants for cancer pain not completely relieved by opioid therapy, but there is a dearth of high-quality studies to support a stronger conclusion. Cannabinoids appear to be safe in low and medium doses. Methodological limitations of the trials limited the ability to make sound conclusions. Further research is warranted before efficacy, safety, and utility of cannabinoids for cancer pain can be determined."

            "abstract": "Introduction and aims:\n        \n      \n      The US Drug Enforcement Agency classifies marijuana as an illegal substance, yet in 22 states marijuana is legal for medicinal use. In 1996, California legalised the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, but population-based data describing medical marijuana users in the state has not been available. Our aim was to examine the demographic differences between users and non-users of medical marijuana in California utilising population-based data.\n    \n\n\n          Design and methods:\n        \n      \n      We used data from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2012, an annual, random-digit-dial state-wide telephone survey that collects health data from a representative adult sample (n = 7525). Age-adjusted prevalence rates were estimated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Five percent of adults in California reported ever using medical marijuana, and most users believed that medical marijuana helped alleviate symptoms or treat a serious medical condition. Prevalence was similar when compared by gender, education and region. Prevalence of ever using medical marijuana was highest among white adults and younger adults ages 18-24 years, although use was reported by every racial/ethnic and age group examined in our study and ranged from 2% to 9%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our study's results lend support to the idea that medical marijuana is used equally by many groups of people and is not exclusively used by any one specific group. As more states approve marijuana use for medical purposes, it is important to track medical marijuana use as a health-related behaviour and risk factor."

Patients unresponsive to conservative treatment modalities pose a therapeutic challenge to the treating clinician. The efficacy of intramuscular botulinum toxin injections for recalcitrant cases is still not well established due to mixed results from clinical trials. The Diagnostic Criteria of Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) classified chronic muscle pain broadly into a localized pattern (when pain is localized to the site of palpation or the muscle palpated) and a referring pattern (when the pain spreads beyond the boundary of the muscle being palpated). The medical records of 25 consecutive patients treated with botulinum were analysed retrospectively. Significant pain reduction was achieved in 69.2% of the patients with localized myofascial pain and 16.7% of the patients with referring myofascial pain (P=0.015). Seventy-seven per cent of the patients with localized myofascial pain reported using less analgesic throughout the follow-up period, whereas only 25% of the patients with referring myofascial pain (P=0.017). The effects of botulinum toxin in responsive patients subsided after a mean of 3.21 months. Patients with localized myofascial pain benefited from botulinum toxin injections, but patients with referring myofascial pain responded poorly to this treatment."

Cannabis users should be advised not to drive for at least 3 to 4 hours after smoking, for at least 6 hours after oral ingestion, and for at least 8 hours if they experience a subjective \"high\" (level II evidence). The maximum recommended dose is 1 inhalation 4 times per day (approximately 400 mg per day) of dried cannabis containing 9% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (level III evidence). Physicians should avoid referring patients to \"cannabinoid\" clinics (level III evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Future guidelines should be based on systematic review of the literature on the safety and effectiveness of smoked cannabis.

Fifty percent nitrous oxide was administered by the surgeon who sutured the laceration. A nurse monitored the child throughout the procedure. At the end of the procedure, pain scores were evaluated by the surgeon and nurse using the FLACC (face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability) scale, a structured observational-behavioral scale for measurement of pain.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixty patients between the ages of 1 and 16 years participated in the study.

These cytokines can induce peripheral and central sensitization, leading to pain augmentation. Recently, a frequently used local anesthetic, lidocaine, was introduced as a part of a perioperative pain management technique. In addition to its analgesic effects, lidocaine has an antiinflammatory property, decreasing the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines.

However, direct testing of the involvement of cannabinoid brain systems in psychiatric syndromes is essential for further development. In the Pharmacological Imaging of the Cannabinoid System (PhICS) study, the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in cognitive brain function is assessed by comparing acute effects of the cannabinoid agonist Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain function between healthy controls and groups of psychiatric patients showing cognitive dysfunction. This article describes the objectives and methods of the PhICS study and presents preliminary results of the administration procedure on subjective and neurophysiological parameters. Core elements in the methodology of PhICS are the administration method (THC is administered by inhalation using a vaporizing device) and a comprehensive use of pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) combining several types of MRI scans including functional MRI (fMRI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) to measure brain perfusion, and resting-state fMRI. Additional methods like neuropsychological testing further specify the exact role of the endocannabinoid system in regulating cognition. Preliminary results presented in this paper indicate robust behavioral and subjective effects of THC. In addition, fMRI paradigms demonstrate activation of expected networks of brain regions in the cognitive domains of interest. The presented administration and assessment protocol provides a basis for further research on the involvement of the endocannabionoid systems in behavior and in psychopathology, which in turn may lead to development of therapeutic opportunities of cannabinoid ligands."

            "abstract": "Neuropathic pain in humans results from an injury or disease of the somatosensory nervous system at the peripheral or central level. Despite the considerable progress in pain management methods made to date, peripheral neuropathic pain significantly impacts patients' quality of life, as pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods often fail or induce side effects. Topical treatments are gaining popularity in the management of peripheral neuropathic pain, due to excellent safety profiles and preferences. Moreover, topical treatments applied locally may target the underlying mechanisms of peripheral sensitization and pain. Recent studies showed that peripheral sensitization results from interactions between neuronal and non-neuronal cells, with numerous signaling molecules and molecular/cellular targets involved. This narrative review discusses the molecular/cellular mechanisms of drugs available in topical formulations utilized in clinical practice and their effectiveness in clinical studies in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. We searched PubMed for papers published from 1 January 1995 to 30 November 2020. The key search phrases for identifying potentially relevant articles were \"topical AND pain\", \"topical AND neuropathic\", \"topical AND treatment\", \"topical AND mechanism\", \"peripheral neuropathic\", and \"mechanism\". The result of our search was 23 randomized controlled trials (RCT), 9 open-label studies, 16 retrospective studies, 20 case (series) reports, 8 systematic reviews, 66 narrative reviews, and 140 experimental studies. The data from preclinical studies revealed that active compounds of topical treatments exert multiple mechanisms of action, directly or indirectly modulating ion channels, receptors, proteins, and enzymes expressed by neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and thus contributing to antinociception. However, which mechanisms and the extent to which the mechanisms contribute to pain relief observed in humans remain unclear. The evidence from RCTs and reviews supports 5% lidocaine patches, 8% capsaicin patches, and botulinum toxin A injections as effective treatments in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. In turn, single RCTs support evidence of doxepin, funapide, diclofenac, baclofen, clonidine, loperamide, and cannabidiol in neuropathic pain states. Topical administration of phenytoin, ambroxol, and prazosin is supported by observational clinical studies. For topical amitriptyline, menthol, and gabapentin, evidence comes from case reports and case series. For topical ketamine and baclofen, data supporting their effectiveness are provided by both single RCTs and case series. The discussed data from clinical studies and observations support the usefulness of topical treatments in neuropathic pain management. This review may help clinicians in making decisions regarding whether and which topical treatment may be a beneficial option, particularly in frail patients not tolerating systemic pharmacotherapy."

Cannabinoids are known to decrease somatic pain perception, but their effect on visceral sensitivity in IBS remains unclear.

            "abstract": "Although placebos have long been considered a nuisance in clinical research, over recent years they have become an active and productive field of research. Indeed, the placebo effect represents an elegant model to understand how the brain works. It is worth knowing that there is not a single but many placebo effects, with different mechanisms across different systems, medical conditions and therapeutic interventions. For example, brain mechanisms of expectation, anxiety and reward are all involved, as well as a variety of learning phenomena. There is also some experimental evidence of different genetic variants in placebo responsiveness. Pain and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease represent the most productive models to better understand the neurobiology of the placebo effect. In these medical conditions the neural networks involved have indeed been identified: that is, opioid, cannabinoid, cholecystokinin, cyclooxygenase, and dopamine modulatory networks in pain; and part of the basal ganglia circuitry in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. Overall, there is today compelling evidence that placebos and drugs share common biochemical pathways and activate the same receptor pathways, which suggests possible interference between social stimuli and therapeutic rituals on one hand and pharmacological agents on the other. The same holds true for the nocebo effect, the opposite phenomenon of placebo. The assessment of patients&rsquo; expectations should become the rule in clinical trials in order to allow us a better interpretation of therapeutic outcomes when comparing placebo and active treatment groups. Administering drugs covertly is another way to identify the placebo psychobiological component without the administration of any placebo, and this provides important information on the role of patient&rsquo;s expectations in the therapeutic outcome. A further in-depth analysis of placebo and nocebo phenomena will certainly provide important information in the near future for a better understanding of human biology, medicine and society."

            "abstract": "Cannabis has been used to treat pain for thousands of years. However, since the early part of the 20th century, laws restricting cannabis use have limited its evaluation using modern scientific criteria. Over the last decade, the situation has started to change because of the increased availability of cannabis in the United States for either medical or recreational purposes, making it important to provide the public with accurate information as to the effectiveness of the drug for joint pain among other indications. The major psychotropic component of cannabis is Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), one of some 120 naturally occurring phytocannabinoids. Cannabidiol (CBD) is another molecule found in herbal cannabis in large amounts. Although CBD does not produce psychotropic effects, it has been shown to produce a variety of pharmacological effects. Hence, the overall effects of herbal cannabis represent the collective activity of THC, CBD and a number of minor components. The action of THC is mediated by two major G-protein coupled receptors, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and CB2, and recent work has suggested that other targets may also exist. Arachidonic acid derived endocannabinoids are the normal physiological activators of the two cannabinoid receptors. Natural phytocannabinoids and synthetic derivatives have produced clear activity in a variety of models of joint pain in animals. These effects are the result of both inhibition of pain pathway signalling (mostly CB1) and anti-inflammatory effects (mostly CB2). There are also numerous anecdotal reports of the effectiveness of smoking cannabis for joint pain. Indeed, it is the largest medical request for the use of the drug. However, these reports generally do not extend to regulated clinical trials for rheumatic diseases. Nevertheless, the preclinical and human data that do exist indicate that the use of cannabis should be taken seriously as a potential treatment of joint pain."

Recent research has demonstrated the underlying mechanisms of cannabinoid analgesia via endocannabinoids, an endogenous system of retrograde neuromodulatory messengers that work in tandem with endogenous opioids. Additional receptor and non-receptor mechanisms of cannabinoid drugs have pertinent activity, including anti-carcinogenesis and neuroprotection, that may be of key importance in aging and terminal patient populations. The results of clinical trials with synthetic and plant-based cannabinoids suggest that the role of formulation and delivery system is critical in optimizing the risk-benefit profile of cannabinoid products. Synergy between opioids and cannabinoids may produce opioid-sparing effects, as well as extend the duration of analgesia and reduce opioid tolerance and dependence. This article reviews the mechanism of action of cannabinoids, examines marketed agents and those in clinical trials, and addresses their role in treatment of chronic pain, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and HIV/ AIDS. The ability of cannabinoid medicines to treat pain, associated sleep disorders, appetite loss, muscle spasm and a wide variety of other symptoms suggests that such agents may in the future play an important role in palliative care."

Methodological quality was assessed using both AMSTAR-2 and techniques important for bias reduction in pain studies. Of the 106 articles read, 57 were self-declared systematic reviews, most published since 2010. They included any type of cannabinoid, cannabis, or CBM, at any dose, however administered, in a broad range of pain conditions. No review examined the effects of a particular cannabinoid, at a particular dose, using a particular route of administration, for a particular pain condition, reporting a particular analgesic outcome. Confidence in the results in the systematic reviews using AMSTAR-2 definitions was critically low (41), low (8), moderate (6), or high (2). Few used criteria important for bias reduction in pain. Cochrane reviews typically provided higher confidence; all industry-conflicted reviews provided critically low confidence. Meta-analyses typically pooled widely disparate studies, and, where assessable, were subject to potential publication bias. Systematic reviews with positive or negative recommendation for use of cannabinoids, cannabis, or CBM in pain typically rated critically low or low (24/25 [96%] positive; 10/12 [83%] negative).

This urge is often accompanied by pain or other uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations, it either occurs or worsens during rest, particularly in the evening and/or at night, and temporarily improves with activity. Affecting nearly 3% of the North American and European populations in its moderate-to-severe form, RLS has a considerable negative impact on the quality of life, and sleep and is associated with significant morbidity. Although new developments have deepened our understanding of the disorder, yet, the corresponding pathophysiologic features that underlie the sensorimotor presentation are still not fully understood. Usually, symptoms respond well to dopamine agonists (DA), anticonvulsants, or opiates, used either alone or in any combination, but still, a subset of patients remains refractory to medical therapy and serious side effects such as augmentation and impulse control disorder may occur in patients with RLS under DA. Convincing treatment alternative are lacking but recently patients' spontaneous reports of a remarkable and total remission of RLS symptoms following cannabis use has been reported. The antinociceptive effect of marijuana has been documented in many painful neurological conditions and the potential benefit of cannabis use in patients with refractory RLS should, therefore, be questioned by robust clinical trials. Here, we review basic knowledge of RLS and the putative mechanisms by which cannabis may exert its analgesic effects."

Due to the slow temporal experience of pain, multiple studies now show that the time evolution of its magnitude can be captured with continuous online ratings. Here we use such ratings to model quantitatively the temporal dynamics of thermal pain perception. We show that a differential equation captures the details of the temporal evolution in pain ratings in individual subjects for different stimulus pattern complexities, and also demonstrates strong predictive power to infer pain ratings, including readouts based only on brain functional images."

Clinical evidence is emerging for its use in managing pain conditions with different etiologies. We review the efficacy and safety of nabilone for various types of pain as well as its abuse potential, precautions and contraindications, and drug interactions; summarize pertinent clinical practice guidelines; and provide recommendations for dosing, monitoring, and patient education. Citations involving nabilone were identified through systematic reviews evaluating cannabinoids for pain. A systematic search (updated July 23, 2015) of the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Eight randomized controlled trials, two prospective cohort trials, and one retrospective chart review were retrieved. Cancer pain, chronic noncancer pain, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and pain associated with spasticity were the pain conditions evaluated. Nabilone was most commonly used as adjunctive therapy and led to small but significant reductions in pain. The most common adverse drug reactions included euphoria, drowsiness, and dizziness. Nabilone was rarely associated with severe adverse drug reactions requiring drug discontinuation, and the likelihood of abuse was thought to be low. Although the optimal role of nabilone in the management of pain is yet to be determined, certain clinical practice guidelines consider nabilone as a third-line agent."

We sought to compare the efficacy of the cannabinoid nabilone as either monotherapy or adjuvant therapy with a first-line medication for NeP, gabapentin, in a patient population with PN-NeP. Patients diagnosed with PN-NeP were permitted to initiate monotherapy (nabilone or gabapentin) or add one of these two medications (adjuvant therapy) to their existing NeP treatment regimen in a non-randomized open-label nature. Baseline data collected included a primary outcome (visual analog scores [VAS] of pain) and secondary outcomes (quality of life [EuroQol 5 Domains and Short-Form 36] assessments and assessments of sleep [Medical Outcomes Sleep Study Scale {MOSSS}], anxiety and depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale], and pain [Brief Pain Inventory]). Reassessment and modulation of dosing and/or medications occurred at 3- and 6-month intervals. Medication adverse effects and drug efficacy, as well as questionnaires, were assessed at 6 months. Matched analysis of variance testing was performed to compare 3- and 6-month scores with baseline, as well as to compare therapies at equal time points. Significant improvements in pain VAS were seen in all treatment groups at 6 months. Numerous sleep parameters within MOSSS, Brief Pain Inventory, and Short-Form 36 improved in patients receiving nabilone or gabapentin either as monotherapy or adjuvant treatment. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A scores were significantly improved in all treatment groups. Sleep adequacy and the sleep problems index within the MOSSS improved in nabilone monotherapy patients in particular. The benefits of monotherapy or adjuvant therapy with nabilone appear comparable to gabapentin for management of NeP. We advocate for head-to-head randomized, double-blind studies for current therapies for NeP in order to determine potential advantages beneficial in this patient population."

Plasma levels of ACTH, somatotropin, glucose and free glycerol were markedly elevated in all patients (n = 20) intra- and postoperatively, whereas cortisol and prolactin remained unchanged.

A retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted from July 2011 to July 2017 of adult (age > 18) inpatients excluding psychiatric, parturient, and hospice patients. Three machine learning models were trained and tested: random forest (RF), linear support vector machine, and logistic regression. We compared the models' performance to the traditional Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) using sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the Curve for Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) and Precision-Recall curves (AUC-PR).

Recent research has suggested a role for endogenous cannabinoids in the descending inhibition of dorsal horn cells via a supraspinal site of action. We have recently demonstrated [J. Physiol. 506(2) (1998) 459] that the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars alpha (GiA) is a major source of such descending modulation, and importantly, that this system is activated in response to noxious stimulation. We have therefore investigated the role of CB1 receptor activation in mediating the antinociceptive effects of activation of GiA in models of acute and chronic pain. Microinjections (0.5 microl 60% DMSO) of either WIN 55,212-2 (5 microg, selective CB1 agonist), SR141716A (50 microg, competitive CB1 antagonist), both compounds together, or vehicle alone into GiA were performed prior to these tests in a randomised, blind manner. In control animals, WIN 55,212-2 markedly increased withdrawal latencies in the tail flick test and reduced responses to subcutaneous formalin. These effects were blocked by co-administration of SR141716A. These data suggest that activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptor subtypes in GiA leads to behavioural analgesia. In animals with partial sciatic nerve ligation, microinjection of drugs and injection of formalin were performed contralaterally to the site of ligation. Partial sciatic nerve ligation significantly reduced behavioural responses to contralaterally applied formalin. Microinjection of SR141716A to GiA reversed this inhibition of responses to formalin in animals with partial sciatic nerve ligation. These data provide evidence that endogenous CB1 receptor ligands are involved in GiA mediated antinociception, and that this system is important for the modulation of nociceptive transmission in an animal model of chronic neuropathic pain."

BTP should be adequately controlled with a stable dose of a short-acting oral opioid. So far, no drug is available for the treatment of BTP in cancer patients in Iran, so we designed the first study in Iran to investigate the effect of sublingual fentanyl in relief of pain episodes in these patients.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sublingual fentanyl in the treatment of breakthrough pain in cancer patients.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      This study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in cancer patients with breakthrough pain (at least 1-4 episodes of acute pain with moderate to severe pain daily) referred to the pain clinic of Akhtar and Masih Daneshvari hospitals in 2019. The study consisted of two stages: 100 patients were selected by simple, non-random sampling and entered the open-label titration phase. The primary efficacy endpoint was the sum of pain intensity difference over 30 min post-administration. Secondary efficacy endpoints included pain intensity difference (PID) and pain relief (PR) throughout the 60-min post-dose assessment period. In the double-blind study, patients were randomly divided into two groups of placebo (n=50) and intervention (sublingual fentanyl tablet) (n=50). For evaluation of efficacy, 10 episodes were treated in each group and the results were recorded by the patient. (Clinical trial registration: IRCT20131124015515N8).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 100 patients entered the titration phase, primary efficacy of sublingual fentanyl was 3.5±0.6 and secondary efficacy of sublingual fentanyl (60 min, after treatment) was 0.3±0.6 which was statistically significant. In the titration phase, the treatment success rate was 100%. In the double-blind phase of the study, the pain intensity in multiple episodes showed a significant improvement at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after drug administration (P=0.0001). The intensity of pain in each episode was significantly decreased compared to the next episode (P=0.0001). The mean frequency of pain episodes in the sublingual fentanyl group showed a significant decrease (P=0.0001). The most common adverse drug events in the titration phase were drowsiness (20%), dizziness (7%), and nausea 4%, and in the double-blind phase only drowsiness (12%).

            "abstract": "Even though the initial treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is conservative, knowledge of the clinical effects of supplements and of some methods of physiotherapy is still preliminary. Many biological mechanisms can support the administration of shock wave therapy (ESWT) or of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) based nutraceutical, conjugated linoleic acid (GLA), anti-oxidants and Echinacea angustifolia for CTS. The shock waves reduce the nerve compression, produce an anti-inflammatory action, and accelerate the regeneration of neuropathy. ALA and GLA induce antioxidant protective actions, reduce inflammation, promote neuroregeneration, and decrease pain. The Echinacea modulates the endogenous cannabinoid system.The aim of study is to verify the efficiency of shock wave therapy versus nutraceutical composed of ALA, GLA, and Echinacea in CTS. Sixty patients were enrolled in this study and they were randomly assigned to one of two treatments. Both groups showed significant improvements in pain, symptoms' severity and functional scores, and electrodiagnostic results until the sixth month. We verified a trend to a better pain regression in the nutraceutical group. The presence of the medicinal Echinacea represents an added value to the antioxidant effect in ALA and GLA, which can justify this result. ESWT or the association of ALA, GLA, and Echinacea proved to be two effective treatments for controlling symptoms and improving the evolution of CTS."

The effect of denervation on limb function was assessed in vivo in four dogs with the elbow randomly selected for the procedure. Primary outcome measures were static bodyweight distribution and distal limb mechanical sensory thresholds; secondary outcome measures were subjectively scored lameness, neurological function and pain on manipulation. Histology was performed on all resected tissues to determine whether nerves had been resected. Denervation was achieved by separate medial and lateral surgical approaches. In testing the developed surgical protocol, 111/130 resected samples contained nerve tissue in the healthy cadaveric elbows and 18/20 in the in vivo study. Limb function and sensation were not altered by elbow joint denervation. The protocol developed for denervation of the canine elbow appears feasible and does not result in any sensory or motor deficits of the forelimb."

This double-blind clinical trial enrolled three equal-sized block-randomized groups of patients (n = 105) scheduled for hand and forearm surgery at Arak, Iran in 2019, who received: (i) ropivacaine (40 mL/0.5%) + dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg), (ii) ropivacaine (40 mL/0.5%) + fentanyl (1 μg/kg), and (iii) ropivacaine (40 mL/0.5%) + verapamil (2.5 mg), respectively. We recorded some vital signs such as mean arterial pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, onset of complete sensory and motor block, duration of the block, opioid use, as well as pain score at recovery and certain time points (2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours post-operation). Adding dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine (40 mL/0.5%) prolonged the duration of sensory (P = 0.001) and motor block (P = 0.001) in compared to adding fentanyl and verapamil and it also shortens the time to onset of sensory (P = 0.001) and motor block (P = 0.001). There is a significant difference between three groups in terms of visual analog scale mean and the lowest pain score was obtained in the dexmedetomidine group (P = 0.001), significant time trend (P = 0.001), as well as the time and groups interaction (P = 0.001). Dexmedetomidine was concluded to be associated with alleviated pain; reduced opioid use; short onset of sensory block; and prolonged duration of sensory and motor block. It hence is recommended to lengthen the duration of axillary block and to help relieve postoperative pain and ultimately to move to cut down the postoperative opioid use in forearm surgery.

Epidiolex® is the only product that has undergone rigorous pharmacokinetic assessment and testing in clinical trials; it was approved as a non-scheduled drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of intractable childhood-onset seizures. However, studies investigating CBD for other medical conditions are limited in number and often lack the scientific rigor, controls, or sample sizes required to draw clinically meaningful conclusions. Although Epidiolex® is safe for human consumption, recent changes in regulation of commercially available CBD products have resulted in limited quality control and products marketed with unknown CBD bioavailability.

Turmeric trials have demonstrated some promise as adjuvant treatment for IBD, though not in other GI disease processes. Evidence suggests that the use of cannabis and turmeric is potentially beneficial in IBD and IBS; however, neither has been compared to standard therapy in IBD, and thus should not be recommended as alternative treatment for IBD.

Cannabidiol could offer a novel treatment, but it is unclear which doses might be efficacious or safe. Therefore, we aimed to identify efficacious doses and eliminate inefficacious doses in a phase 2a trial using an adaptive Bayesian design.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, adaptive Bayesian trial at the Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit (University College London, London, UK). We used an adaptive Bayesian dose-finding design to identify efficacious or inefficacious doses at a-priori interim and final analysis stages. Participants meeting cannabis use disorder criteria from DSM-5 were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) in the first stage of the trial to 4-week treatment with three different doses of oral cannabidiol (200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg) or with matched placebo during a cessation attempt by use of a double-blinded block randomisation sequence. All participants received a brief psychological intervention of motivational interviewing. For the second stage of the trial, new participants were randomly assigned to placebo or doses deemed efficacious in the interim analysis. The primary objective was to identify the most efficacious dose of cannabidiol for reducing cannabis use. The primary endpoints were lower urinary 11-nor-9-carboxy-δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH):creatinine ratio, increased days per week with abstinence from cannabis during treatment, or both, evidenced by posterior probabilities that cannabidiol is better than placebo exceeding 0·9. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis.

At final analysis, cannabidiol 400 mg and 800 mg exceeded primary endpoint criteria (0·9) for both primary outcomes. For urinary THC-COOH:creatinine ratio, the probability of being the most efficacious dose compared with placebo given the observed data was 0·9995 for cannabidiol 400 mg and 0·9965 for cannabidiol 800 mg. For days with abstinence from cannabis, the probability of being the most efficacious dose compared with placebo given the observed data was 0·9966 for cannabidiol 400 mg and 0·9247 for cannabidiol 800 mg. Compared with placebo, cannabidiol 400 mg decreased THC-COOH:creatinine ratio by -94·21 ng/mL (95% interval estimate -161·83 to -35·56) and increased abstinence from cannabis by 0·48 days per week (0·15 to 0·82). Compared with placebo, cannabidiol 800 mg decreased THC-COOH:creatinine ratio by -72·02 ng/mL (-135·47 to -19·52) and increased abstinence from cannabis by 0·27 days per week (-0·09 to 0·64).

These studies have also suggested that modulating the activity of the endocannabinoid system holds therapeutic promise for a broad range of diseases, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders; obesity/metabolic syndrome; cachexia; chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; and tissue injury and pain, amongst others. However, clinical trials with globally acting CB1 antagonists in obesity/metabolic syndrome, and other studies with peripherally-restricted CB1/2 agonists and inhibitors of the endocannabinoid metabolizing enzyme in pain, have introduced unexpected complexities, suggesting that a better understanding of the pathophysiological role of the endocannabinoid system is required to devise clinically successful treatment strategies."

Important drawbacks to advance in the development of these therapies are the limited translational value of the animal models now available and the elucidation of the complex neuronal and immune pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain. One of the neurotransmitter systems participating in neuropathic pain control that has recently raised a particular interest is the endocannabinoid system. This system is highly expressed in neurons and immune cells, and it plays a crucial role in the development of neuropathic pain. Preclinical studies have provided important findings, revealing the potential interest of the endocannabinoid system for the treatment of neuropathic pain. These studies have reported the analgesic effects of cannabinoid agonists in multiple neuropathic pain models, and they have identified specific targets within this system to develop more effective and safe analgesic compounds. However, further studies using more relevant neuropathic pain animal models are required to confirm these interesting results. Several clinical studies suggest that cannabinoids significantly reduced neuropathic pain, although most of these trials fail the required standards of quality. The different pain patient populations included in the systematic reviews also make it difficult to get adequate conclusions. Therefore, additional clinical trials that consider an adequate number of patients, the use active treatments as controls, and longer duration of administration are required to have an adequate profile of the effectiveness and safety of cannabinoids in neuropathic pain."

Fifty individuals with chronic nonspecific knee pain was randomly allocated to 2 groups: the LLCH group and the placebo group. All subjects underwent 1 hour of conventional physical therapy twice per week for 2 weeks at the outpatient clinic and they were asked to accomplish 1 hour of therapeutic exercise at home each day between sessions. The LLCH group applied LLCH knee wraps for 6 hours at home before home exercise while placebo group took a placebo ibuprofen. (This was done since placebo heat is impossible to use since subjects would notice that the wraps were cold) Before, during, and after intervention, pain intensity, active range of motion of the knee (AROM), knee strength, and home exercise compliance were measured. The LLCH group showed pain attenuation after 2 weeks of therapy sessions (p ≤ 0.05). AROM and strength of the knee significantly improved over time compared to the placebo group. Home exercise compliance was significantly higher in the LLCH group than placebo group (p ≤ 0.05). These results indicated that the use of LLCH as an adjunct to conventional physical therapy for chronic knee pain significantly improved pain attenuation and recovery of strength and movement in patients with chronic knee pain."

Eleven studies met inclusion criteria and were mostly low or very low quality. Seven examined pharmacologic interventions (gabapentin, pregabalin, capsaicin, analgesics including opioids) and four examined non-pharmacologic interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy, self-hypnosis, smoked cannabis). The only controlled studies with positive results were of capsaicin and cannabis, and had short-term follow-up (≤12 weeks).

Currently there are no treatments for post Ebola sequelae. We hypothesize that cannabidiol (CBD) may attenuate some of these post Ebola sequelae, several of which have been postulated to result from inflammation and/or an autoimmune response. CBD has anti-inflammatory actions in various animal models. Clinical studies have shown that oral administration of CBD, compared to placebo, significantly reduces anxiety, has antinociceptive and anticonvulsant actions, and may be therapeutic for insomnia. Overall, CBD has a number of pharmacological effects that may significantly improve the mental and somatic health of patients suffering from post Ebola sequelae. In humans, CBD, at therapeutic doses, does not: 1) elicit dependence or tolerance; 2) significantly alter heart rate or blood pressure; 3) affect gastrointestinal transit; 4) produce significant cognitive or psychomotor impairments. Mild sedation and nausea are the most commonly reported adverse effects associated with CBD.CBD, based on its pharmacological effects and favorable safety profile, should be considered as a treatment for individuals with post Ebola sequelae."

We enrolled patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome who presented at these hospitals. Eligible patients were at least 16 years old, had hip pain with radiographic features of cam or pincer morphology but no osteoarthritis, and were believed to be likely to benefit from hip arthroscopy. Patients with bilateral femoroacetabular impingement syndrome were eligible; only the most symptomatic hip was randomly assigned to treatment and followed-up. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy (an individualised, supervised, and progressive physiotherapist-led programme of conservative care). Randomisation was stratified by impingement type and recruiting centre and was done by research staff at each hospital, using a central telephone randomisation service. Patients and treating clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but researchers who collected the outcome assessments and analysed the results were masked. The primary outcome was hip-related quality of life, as measured by the patient-reported International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) 12 months after randomisation, and analysed in all eligible participants who were allocated to treatment (the intention-to-treat population). This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN64081839, and is closed to recruitment.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between July 20, 2012, and July 15, 2016, we identified 648 eligible patients and recruited 348 participants: 171 participants were allocated to receive hip arthroscopy and 177 to receive personalised hip therapy. Three further patients were excluded from the trial after randomisation because they did not meet the eligibility criteria. Follow-up at the primary outcome assessment was 92% (319 of 348 participants). At 12 months after randomisation, mean iHOT-33 scores had improved from 39·2 (SD 20·9) to 58·8 (27·2) for participants in the hip arthroscopy group, and from 35·6 (18·2) to 49·7 (25·5) in the personalised hip therapy group. In the primary analysis, the mean difference in iHOT-33 scores, adjusted for impingement type, sex, baseline iHOT-33 score, and centre, was 6·8 (95% CI 1·7-12·0) in favour of hip arthroscopy (p=0·0093). This estimate of treatment effect exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (6·1 points). There were 147 patient-reported adverse events (in 100 [72%] of 138 patients) in the hip arthroscopy group) versus 102 events (in 88 [60%] of 146 patients) in the personalised hip therapy group, with muscle soreness being the most common of these (58 [42%] vs 69 [47%]). There were seven serious adverse events reported by participating hospitals. Five (83%) of six serious adverse events in the hip arthroscopy group were related to treatment, and the one in the personalised hip therapy group was not.

Immediately after contusion, they were administrated fasudil intrathecally for 4 weeks. GFP rat-derived BMSCs (2.5x10(6)) were injected into the lesion site 14 days after contusion. Locomotor recovery was assessed for 9 weeks with BBB scoring. Sensory tests were conducted at 8 weeks. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected into the sensory-motor cortex at 9 weeks. In addition to an untreated control group, the study also included a fasudil-only group and a BMSC-only group in order to compare the effects of combined therapy vs. single-agent therapy. Animals were perfused transcardially 11 weeks after contusion, and histological examinations were performed. The combined therapy group showed statistically better locomotor recovery than the untreated control group at 8 and 9 weeks after contusion. Neither of the two single-agent treatments improved open field locomotor function. Sensory tests showed no statistically significant difference by treatment. Histological and immunohistochemical studies provided some supporting evidence for better locomotor recovery following combined therapy. The average area of the cystic cavity was significantly smaller in the fasudil+BMSC group than in the control group. The number of 5-HT nerve fibers was significantly higher in the fasudil+BMSC group than in the control group on the rostral side of the lesion site. BDA-labeled fibers on the caudal side of the lesion epicenter were observed only in the fasudil+BMSC group. On the other hand, only small numbers of GFP-labeled grafted cells remained 9 weeks after transplantation, and these were mainly localized at the site of injection. Double immunofluorescence studies showed no evidence of differentiation of grafted BMSCs into glial cells or neurons. The Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil combined with BMSC transplantation resulted in better locomotor recovery than occurred in the untreated control group. However, the data failed to demonstrate significant synergism from combined therapy compared with the levels of recovery following single-agent treatment."

            "abstract": "The case for marijuana's medical use is primarily from anecdotal clinical reports, human studies of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and animal studies on constituent compounds. The authors believe that while a key policy issue is to keep marijuana out of the hands of children, its use for medicinal purposes should be resolved by scientific research and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review. Weighed against possible benefits are increased risks such as cancer, pulmonary problems, damage to the immune system, and unacceptable psychological effects. More study is needed to determine the efficacy of marijuana as an antiemetic for cancer patients, as an appetite stimulant for AIDS and cancer patients, as a treatment for neuropathic pain, and as an antispasmodic for multiple sclerosis patients. If this new research shows marijuana to have important medical uses, FDA approval could be sought. However, the better response is accelerated development of delivery systems other than smoking for key ingredients, as well as the identification of targeted molecules that deliver beneficial effects without intoxicating effects. If the National Institutes of Health conducts research on marijuana, we would propose parallel trials on those indications under careful controls making marijuana available to appropriate patients who fail to benefit from standard existing treatments. This effort would begin after efficacy trials and sunset no later than 5 years. If this open-trial mechanism is adopted, the compassion that Americans feel for seriously ill individuals would have an appropriate medical/scientific outlet and not need to rely on referenda that can confuse adolescents by disseminating misleading information about marijuana effects."

It summarizes patient outcomes as reported in systematic reviews of randomized controlled trial evidence. We searched 10 electronic databases to February 2014, screened reviews of reviews, and consulted topic experts. We used a bubble plot as a visual overview of the distribution of evidence and synthesized results narratively in an executive summary. In total, 81 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria and the largest review included 109 mindfulness RCTs. Most research is available for general overviews on health benefits or psychological wellbeing. Reviews on chronic illness, depression, substance use, somatization, distress, and mental illness included 10 or more RCTs. Reviews suggest differential effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and other mindfulness-based interventions, and definitions of “mindfulness-based” varied. The most consistent effect was reported for depression but published meta-analyses also indicated effects compared to passive control of MBSR on overall health, chronic illness, and psychological variables; MBCT for mental illness; and mindfulness interventions for somatization disorders. Limited evidence is also available for mindfulness interventions for pain, anxiety, and psychosis compared to passive control groups. More detail is provided for priority areas post-traumatic stress disorder, stress, depression, and wellness. The evidence map provides a broad overview (not detailed or definitive effectiveness evidence) over the existing research to help interpret the state of the evidence to inform policy and clinical decision making."

            "abstract": "GW Pharmaceuticals is undertaking a major research programme in the UK to develop and market distinct cannabis-based prescription medicines [THC:CBD, High THC, High CBD] in a range of medical conditions. The cannabis for this programme is grown in a secret location in the UK. It is expected that the product will be marketed in the US in late 2003. GW's cannabis-based products include selected phytocannabinoids from cannabis plants, including D9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The company is investigating their use in three delivery systems, including sublingual spray, sublingual tablet and inhaled (but not smoked) dosage forms. The technology is protected by patent applications. Four different formulations are currently being investigated, including High THC, THC:CBD (narrow ratio), THC:CBD (broad ratio) and High CBD. GW is also developing a specialist security technology that will be incorporated in all its drug delivery systems. This technology allows for the recording and remote monitoring of patient usage to prevent any potential abuse of its cannabis-based medicines. GW plans to enter into agreements with other companies following phase III development, to secure the best commercialisation terms for its cannabis-based medicines. In June 2003, GW announced that exclusive commercialisation rights for the drug in the UK had been licensed to Bayer AG. The drug will be marketed under the Sativex brand name. This agreement also provides Bayer with an option to expand their license to include the European Union and certain world markets. GW was granted a clinical trial exemption certificate by the Medicines Control Agency to conduct clinical studies with cannabis-based medicines in the UK. The exemption includes investigations in the relief of pain of neurological origin and defects of neurological function in the following indications: multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury, peripheral nerve injury, central nervous system damage, neuroinvasive cancer, dystonias, cerebral vascular accident and spina bifida, as well as for the relief of pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and also pain relief in brachial plexus injury. The UK Government stated that it would be willing to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 to permit the introduction of a cannabis-based medicine. GW stated in its 2002 Annual Report that it was currently conducting five phase III trials of its cannabis derivatives, including a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a sublingual spray containing High THC in more than 100 patients with cancer pain in the UK. Also included is a phase III trial of THC:CBD (narrow ratio) being conducted in patients with severe pain due to brachial plexus injury, as are two more phase III trials of THC:CBD (narrow ratio) targeting spasticity and bladder dysfunction in multiple sclerosis patients. Another phase III trial of THC:CBD (narrow ratio) in patients with spinal cord injury is also being conducted. Results from the trials are expected during 2003. Three additional trials are also in the early stages of planning. These trials include a phase I trial of THC:CBD (broad ratio) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a phase I trial of High CBD in patients with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and a preclinical trial of High CBD in various CNS disorders (including epilepsy, stroke and head injury). GW Pharmaceuticals submitted an application for approval of cannabis-based medicines to UK regulatory authorities in March 2003. Originally GW hoped to market cannabis-based prescription medicines by 2004, but is now planning for a launch in the UK towards the end of 2003. Several trials for GW's cannabis derivatives have also been completed, including four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials conducted in the UK. The trials were initiated by GW in April 2002, to investigate the use of a sublingual spray containing THC:CBD (narrow ratio) in the following medical conditions: pain in spinal cord injury, pain and sleep in MS and spinal cord injury, neuropathic pain in MS and general neuropathic pain (presented as allodynia). Results from these trials show that THC:CBD (narrow ratio) caused statistically significant reductions in neuropathic pain in patients with MS and other conditions. In addition, improvements in other MS symptoms were observed as well. Phase II studies of THC:CBD (narrow ratio) have also been completed in patients with MS, spinal cord injury, neuropathic pain and a small number of patients with peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus or AIDS. A phase II trial of THC:CBD (broad ratio) has also been completed in a small number of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as has a trial of High CBD in patients with neurogenic symptoms. A phase II trial has also been evaluated with High THC in small numbers of patients for the treatment of perioperative pain. The phase II trials provided positive results and confirmed an excellent safety profile for cannabis-based medicines. GW Pharmaceuticals received an IND approval to commence phase II clinical trials in Canada in patients with chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury in 2002. Following meetings with the US FDA, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Office for National Drug Control Policy, and National Institute for Drug Abuse, GW was granted an import license from the DEA and has imported its first cannabis extracts into the US. Preclinical research with these extracts in the US is ongoing."

            "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterised by repeated inflammatory/demyelinating events within the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to relapsing-remitting neurological insults, leading to loss of function, patients are often left with residual, troublesome symptoms such as spasticity and pain. These greatly diminish \"quality of life\" and have prompted some patients to self-medicate with and perceive benefit from cannabis. Recent advances in cannabinoid biology are beginning to support these anecdotal observations, notably the demonstration that spasticity is tonically regulated by the endogenous cannabinoid system. Recent clinical trials may indeed suggest that cannabis has some potential to relieve, pain, spasms and spasticity in MS. However, because the CB(1) cannabinoid receptor mediates both the positive and adverse effects of cannabis, therapy will invariably be associated with some unwanted, psychoactive effects. In an experimental model of MS, and in MS tissue, there are local perturbations of the endocannabinoid system in lesional areas. Stimulation of endocannabinoid activity in these areas either through increase of synthesis or inhibition of endocannabinoid degradation offers the positive therapeutic potential of the cannabinoid system whilst limiting adverse events by locally targeting the lesion. In addition, CB(1) and CB(2) cannabinoid receptor stimulation may also have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential as the endocannabinoid system controls the level of neurodegeneration that occurs as a result of the inflammatory insults. Therefore cannabinoids may not only offer symptom control but may also slow the neurodegenerative disease progression that ultimately leads to the accumulation of disability."

            "abstract": "Experiences of social rejection represent a major source of distress and in particular peer rejection during adolescence has been implicated in various psychiatric disorders. Moreover, experimentally induced acute social rejection alters pain perception in humans, implicating overlapping neurocircuits for social and physical pains. We recently demonstrated that rearing of adolescent Wistar rats with inadequate, less playful play partners (Fischer 344) persistently decreases pain sensitivity, although the detailed mechanisms mediating the aversiveness during the social encounter remained unsettled. With the present study we examined the behavioral performance during acute interaction of female adolescent Wistar rats with either age-matched same-strain partners or rats from the Fischer 344 strain. We here identify the low responsiveness upon playful attacks, which appears to be characteristic for social play in the Fischer 344 strain, as one of the main aversive components for adolescent Wistar animals during cross-strain encounters, which subsequently diminishes thermal pain reactivity. A detailed behavioral analysis further revealed increased ultrasonic vocalization at 50kHz and an increased frequency of playful attacks for adolescent Wistar animals paired with a Fischer 344 rat compared to same-strain control pairs. Finally, an acute injection of a subthreshold dose of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor inverse agonist/antagonist SR141716 before the social encounter abolished enhanced play-soliciting behavior in Wistar/Fischer 344 pairs as well as the behavioral consequences of the rejection experience in adolescent Wistar rats, further emphasizing an important modulatory role of the endocannabinoid system in mediating the effects of social behavior and social pain."

This review compiles tolerability and safety data from clinical trials that investigated nabiximols for spasticity and/or chronic pain.Areas covered: Systematic searches identified 38 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or post-RCT open-label studies reporting safety data: 15 in spasticity; 16 in neuropathic pain; six in chronic cancer pain; and one in rheumatoid arthritis pain. In RCTs, discontinuation rates due to adverse events (AEs) for nabiximols and placebo were lower in spasticity studies (5.4% and 2.8%) than in neuropathic pain (12.9% and 5.3%) or cancer pain (19.5% and 16.6%) studies. The most consistently identified AEs were dizziness, nausea and fatigue in spasticity or neuropathic pain studies; and dizziness, nausea, vomiting and somnolence in cancer pain studies. Serious AE (SAE) rates for nabiximols and placebo were higher in cancer pain (21.8% and 16.9%) than in MS spasticity (4.7% vs. 0.8%) and neuropathic pain (4.1% vs. 3.1%) studies despite similar dose ranges.

LP analysis revealed 4 distinct neurobehavioral phenotypes at 2 weeks after injury: emotionally resilient (419 individuals [23.8%]), cognitively impaired (368 individuals [20.9%]), cognitively resilient (620 individuals [35.3%]), and neuropsychiatrically distressed (with cognitive weaknesses; 350 individuals [19.9%]). Adding LP group to models including demographic characteristics, medical history, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and other injury characteristics was associated with significantly improved estimation of association with 6-month outcome (GOSE R2 increase = 0.09-0.19; SWLS R2 increase = 0.12-0.22; QOLIBRI-OS R2 increase = 0.14-0.32; RPQ R2 = 0.13-0.34).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      In this cohort study of patients with TBI presenting to US level-1 trauma centers, qualitatively distinct profiles of symptoms and cognitive functioning were identified at 2 weeks after TBI.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, and PsychINFO for double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials of cannabinoids for chronic pain, with a primary outcome related to pain. The primary review outcome is adherence to the 2004 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Harms extension. Secondary outcomes included type, reporting method, frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), trial participant withdrawals, and reasons for withdrawals.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 43 studies (4436 participants) were included.

The median CONSORT score was 7. On average, 3 to 4 recommendations of the CONSORT guidelines were not being met in trials. Seventeen trials did not provide their method of AE assessment, 14 trials did not report on serious AEs and, 7 trials provided no quantitative data about AEs.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Better harms assessment and reporting are needed in chronic pain cannabinoid trials.

Feeding poor children with known streptococcal infections prevented rheumatic fever. Subsequently, it was found to alter the course of influenza. Unfortunately, there is little known about its pharmacokinetics. Palmitoylethanolamide targets nonclassical cannabinoid receptors rather than CB1 and CB2 receptors. Palmitoylethanolamide will only indirectly activate classical cannabinoid receptors by an entourage effect. There are a significant number of prospective and randomized trials demonstrating the pain-relieving effects of PEA. There is lesser evidence of benefit in patients with nonpain symptoms related to depression, Parkinson disease, strokes, and autism. There are no reported drug-drug interactions and very few reported adverse effects from PEA. Further research is needed to define the palliative benefits to PEA."

In previous reports, a dose-dependent increase in bowel adhesions was observed in talc-treated animals in comparison with control animals. Although various methods have been devised to prevent peritoneal adhesions, each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we have attempted to reassess the effect of a carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution in the reduction of peritoneal adhesions induced by an intraperitoneal injection of a talc suspension in mice.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of a talc suspension, followed by an injection of a CMC solution or vehicle. Two weeks after the injection, any adherent bowel mass was removed en bloc, weighed, and histologically observed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The administration of talc induced severe bowel adhesions. CMC treatment was unable to completely inhibit the development of bowel adhesions, but treatment did reduce their weight in a dose-dependent manner. According to a histopathologic analysis, the bowel adhesions were composed of a conglomerate of talc aggregate and granulation tissue. The conglomerate was divided into two zones: the cell-rich marginal zone and the cell-scarce central zone. The injection of CMC specifically reduced the width of the marginal zone and the number of infiltrated cells.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study demonstrated that CMC inhibited bowel adhesions induced by talc in mice. In addition, this is the first report on the effect of CMC on talc peritonitis accompanied by a detailed histologic examination. Our experimental model is very simple and easy to use.

            "abstract": "Early diagnosis of sacroiliitis may lead to preventive treatment which can significantly improve the patient's quality of life in the long run. Oftentimes, a CT scan of the lower back or abdomen is acquired for suspected back pain. However, since the differences between a healthy and an inflamed sacroiliac joint in the early stages are subtle, the condition may be missed. We have developed a new automatic algorithm for the diagnosis and grading of sacroiliitis CT scans as incidental findings, for patients who underwent CT scanning as part of their lower back pain workout. The method is based on supervised machine and deep learning techniques. The input is a CT scan that includes the patient's pelvis. The output is a diagnosis for each sacroiliac joint. The algorithm consists of four steps: (1) computation of an initial region of interest (ROI) that includes the pelvic joints region using heuristics and a U-Net classifier; (2) refinement of the ROI to detect both sacroiliiac joints using a four-tree random forest; (3) individual sacroiliitis grading of each sacroiliiac joint in each CT slice with a custom slice CNN classifier, and; (4) sacroiliitis diagnosis and grading by combining the individual slice grades using a random forest. Experimental results on 484 sacroiliiac joints yield a binary and a 3-class case classification accuracy of 91.9% and 86%, a sensitivity of 95% and 82%, and an Area-Under-the-Curve of 0.97 and 0.57, respectively. Automatic computer-based analysis of CT scans has the potential of being a useful method for the diagnosis and grading of sacroiliitis as an incidental finding."

From March 2001 to March 2007, 87 patients underwent implant placement surgery with MN lateralization. All patients had panoramic radiograph and CT scans taken preoperatively. Patients completed questionnaires to report NDs 1 week after surgery, and at the end of each month within the year after surgery.

All patients reported NDs in the first week: anaesthesia in 81 sites, hypoesthesia in nine sites, burning in nine sites, pain in eight sites, pinching in two sites, and tickling in one site. The sites with NDs decreased to 29 sites (26%) at the end of first month, and to three sites (3%) at the end of the sixth month with no changes to the end of the year. 82 patients were satisfied with the result of nerve lateralization after 1 year. The mean time for full recovery of MN was 37+/-15 days. These findings indicate that concerning NDs, MN lateralization is a useful method for placing implants in the atrophic posterior mandible."

The goal of this study was to experimentally test the effects of CBD and expectancies for receiving CBD on human pain reactivity. Using a crossover, 2 × 2 factorial balanced placebo design, drug administration (given inactive substance or given active CBD) and verbal instruction sets (told inactive substance or told active CBD) were experimentally manipulated. Fifteen healthy adults each completed four separate experimental sessions. Participants were randomly assigned to different counterbalanced manipulation conditions at each session: control (told inactive-given inactive); expectancy (told active CBD-given inactive); drug (told inactive-given active CBD); and expectancy + drug (told active CBD-given active CBD). Primary outcomes were pain threshold, tolerance, intensity, unpleasantness, conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and offset analgesia (OA). There was a significant main effect of instructions on OA, such that the OA response was significantly larger when participants were told that they received CBD, regardless of drug content. Pain unpleasantness was significantly reduced in the drug, expectancy, and expectancy + drug conditions, relative to the control condition. The drug and expectancy conditions separately improved CPM, whereas the expectancy + drug and control conditions produced the lowest CPM change scores. We did not detect significant effects for pain threshold, tolerance, or intensity. Our results indicated that separate pain outcomes can be differentially affected by CBD and/or expectancies for receiving CBD. Future investigations of the psychological and pharmacological mechanisms underlying CBD analgesia are warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Chronic pain affects a significant proportion of the population and presents a major challenge to clinicians and pain specialists. Despite the availability of pharmacologic treatment options such as opioids, many patients continue to experience persistent pain. Cannabinoids present an alternative option with some data on efficacy; however, to date, a systematic review of adverse events (AEs) assessment and reporting in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving cannabinoids has not been performed. As a result, it is unclear whether a clear profile of cannabinoid-associated AEs has been accurately detailed in the literature. As cannabinoids are likely to become readily available for patients in the near future, it is important to study how well AEs have been reported in trials so that the safety profile of cannabinoids can be better understood.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      With a potentially enormous shift toward cannabinoid use for managing chronic pain and spasticity, this study aims to reveal the adequacy of AE reporting and cannabinoid-specific AEs in this setting. Spasticity is a major contributor to chronic pain in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), with a comorbidity of 75%. Many cannabinoid studies have been performed in MS-related painful spasticity with relevant pain outcomes, and these studies will be included in this review for comprehensiveness. The primary outcome will be the quality of AE assessment and reporting by adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Secondary outcomes will include the type of AE, method of AE reporting, severity of AE, frequency of AEs, patient withdrawals, and reasons for withdrawals.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We will perform a systematic review by searching for primary reports of double-blind, randomized controlled trials of cannabinoids compared with placebo and any active comparator treatments for chronic pain, with a primary outcome directly related to pain (eg, pain intensity, pain relief, and pain-related interference).

The natural history of Scheuermann kyphosis remains controversial, with conflicting reports as to the severity of pain and physical disability. Since we cannot predict which kyphotic curves will progress, we are unable to determine effectiveness of brace treatment. Physical therapy is scarcely mentioned in the literature as an effective treatment for Scheuermann kyphosis. Although there is little evidence that physical therapy alone can alter the natural history of Scheuermann's disease, it is often used as the first choice of treatment. Brace treatment appears to be more effective if an early diagnosis is made, prior to the curvature angle exceeding 50° in patients continuing to grow. Surgical treatment is rarely indicated for severe kyphosis (>75°) with curve progression, refractory pain, or a neurologic deficit. Rigorous methodology clinical trials are essential to evaluate the efficacy of conservative interventions, especially different exercises and manual therapies and their combinations with braces."

            "abstract": "The pharmacological inhibition of anandamide (AEA) hydrolysis by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) attenuates pain in animal models of osteoarthritis (OA) but has failed in clinical trials. This may have occurred because AEA also activates transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), which contributes to pain development. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of the dual FAAH-TRPV1 blocker OMDM-198 in an MIA-model of osteoarthritic pain. We first investigated the MIA-induced model of OA by (1) characterizing the pain phenotype and degenerative changes within the joint using X-ray microtomography and (2) evaluating nerve injury and inflammation marker (ATF-3 and IL-6) expression in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of osteoarthritic rats and differences in gene and protein expression of the cannabinoid CB1 receptors FAAH and TRPV1. Furthermore, we compared OMDM-198 with compounds acting exclusively on FAAH or TRPV1. Osteoarthritis was accompanied by the fragmentation of bone microstructure and destroyed cartilage. An increase of the mRNA levels of ATF3 and IL-6 and an upregulation of AEA receptors and FAAH in the dorsal root ganglia were observed. OMDM-198 showed antihyperalgesic effects in the OA model, which were comparable with those of a selective TRPV1 antagonist, SB-366,791, and a selective FAAH inhibitor, URB-597. The effect of OMDM-198 was attenuated by the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM-251, and by the nonpungent TRPV1 agonist, olvanil, suggesting its action as an \"indirect\" CB1 agonist and TRPV1 antagonist. These results suggest an innovative strategy for the treatment of OA, which may yield more satisfactory results than those obtained so far with selective FAAH inhibitors in human OA."

Clinical findings were documented with use of a new clinical pain score and with a visual analogue scale. A global assessment of the result of treatment was also provided by the patient and the attending doctor.

During the last 15 years, numerous studies have demonstrated that the opening of some of these K(+) channels plays an important role in the antinociception induced by agonists of many G-protein-coupled receptors (alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, opioid, GABA(B), muscarinic M(2), adenosine A(1), serotonin 5-HT(1A) and cannabinoid receptors), as well as by other antinociceptive drugs (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], tricyclic antidepressants, etc.) and natural products. Several specific types of K(+) channels are involved in antinociception. The most widely studied are the ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP)), members of the K(ir) family, which participate in the antinociception induced by many drugs that activate them in both the central and the peripheral nervous system. The opening of G-protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K(+) channels (GIRK or K(ir)3), K(v)1.1 and two types of K(Ca) channels, the small- and large-conductance calcium-activated K(+) channels (SK and BK channels, respectively), also play a role in the antinociceptive effect of different drugs and natural products. Recently, drugs that open K(+) channels by direct activation (such as openers of neuronal K(v)7 and K(ATP) channels) have been shown to produce antinociception in models of acute and chronic pain, which suggests that other neuronal K(+) channels (e.g. K(v)1.4 channels) may represent an interesting target for the development of new K(+) channel openers with antinociceptive effects."

Clozapine re-challenge following an episode of myocarditis is controversial, with a very limited literature, although it may be crucial in the recovery of certain patients. To date and to the best of our knowledge, only 10 of 22 studied cases reported successful clozapine retrial after myocarditis. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 22-year-old Hispanic man with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and polysubstance use disorder (methamphetamine, cannabis, and alcohol) initiated on aggressive clozapine titration after lack of response to several other therapies. Approximately 16 days after clozapine trial, the patient developed cardiac function impairment, presenting with chest pain, notable elevation in several biomarkers (troponin: 0.72 ng/ml, ESR >100 mm/h, CRP: 20.8 mg/dl, and BNP: 999 ng/ml), and a depressed ejection fraction at 25%. Further assessments also showed positive hepatitis A serology. Following discontinuation of clozapine and providing supportive care, the patient's physical symptoms resolved. He had a relapse of psychotic symptoms, which were refractory to treatment with other antipsychotic agents. Subsequently, the patient underwent a second clozapine trial under close monitoring, with resolution of his psychosis. Repeated echocardiography demonstrated improved EF to 50%, transaminitis was resolved, repeat blood test results were normalized, and the patient was discharged while he was stabilized and asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS This case adds to the previous case reports and suggests that clinicians may consider clozapine re-challenge following an episode of myocarditis based on clinical judgment, on a case-by-case basis, and under close monitoring. We highlight the need for development of clinical guidelines for clozapine re-challenge."

To assist clinicians in directly addressing this pain, this article presents a treatment approach and algorithm based on best evidence. The usual approach for mild to moderate pain is to start with a nonopioid analgesic. If this is inadequate or poorly tolerated, and if there is an element of sleep loss, it is then reasonable to add an antidepressant with analgesic qualities. If there is a component of neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, then a trial of one of the gabapentinoids is appropriate. If these steps are inadequate, then an opioid analgesic may be added. For moderate to severe pain, one would initiate a trial of chronic opioid earlier. Cannabinoids and topicals may also be appropriate as single agents or in combination."

The efficacy for Enterobacter faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100% and 73%, respectively. 4) As side effects, pain at the injection site was reported by one patient and abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 2 patients. All of these reactions were mild and resolved shortly after the completion of treatment. Based on these findings, it is concluded that this intramuscular preparation of IPM/CS is effective for treating complicated urinary tract infections."

            "abstract": "Reperfusion of tissues subjected to prolonged ischaemia results in ischaemic/reperfusion injury. Fortunately, there are strategies that can be applied to attenuate this injury. These include ischaemic pre- and post-conditioning; both have been shown experimentally to reduce ischaemic/reperfusion injury by up to 75%. The molecular mechanisms of ischaemic conditioning involve the activation of surface G-protein-coupled receptors for adenosine, bradykinin, opioids, and cannabinoids. These in turn stimulate growth receptors which then trigger the activation of cytoprotective pathways resulting in a reduction in apoptosis via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 kinase route and a reduction in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs) via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Opening of mPTPs can cause cell death. Recently, activated surface tumour necrosis factor-α receptors have been shown to also contribute to cytoprotection by activating the Janus kinase and the signal transducer and activating factor of transcription-3 pathway. Research into the mechanisms of ischaemic conditioning is still ongoing and hopefully, with the better understanding of this phenomenon, new therapeutic strategies, with possible translation into meaningful clinical trials, will be developed to reduce ischaemic/reperfusion injury."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several surgical methods are accepted for the treatment of chronic anal fissure. The most popular are anal dilatation (AD) and left lateral sphincterotomy (LLS). The objective of the current study was to prospectively evaluate the results of these two procedures in terms of recurrence rate, complications and patient satisfaction. METHODS: The study enrolled all patients who required operation for chronic anal fissure in the Division of General Surgery, Campus Golda, Rabin Medical Center, between the years 1997 and 2001. Exclusion criteria were acute anal fissure or inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients participated in the study, at an average age of 42.4 years (SD=12.5). The patients were randomly assigned to two groups; one for LLS (53 patients, 49.1%) and one for AD (55 patients, 50.9%). The study protocol included a questionnaire and a physical examination performed 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months after operation. The questionnaire contained questions about pain, bloody stool, incontinence for gas, fluid or hard feces, during the day or night, and soiling. The patients were also asked about their satisfaction on an analog scale from 1 to 10. The average follow-up was 11.2 months (SD=4.1). Minor incontinence occurred in 8 patients of AD group and in 2 patients of LLS group (p<0.005). Recurrence occurred in 6 cases of the AD group and in one case of the LLS group (p<0.003). Satisfaction score was insignificantly higher in the LLS group (9.1+/-0.8 in the LLS group and 7.4+/-2.0 in the AD group). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LLS is the preferred method for the treatment for chronic anal fissure."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      This review is one of a series on drugs used to treat fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown aetiology characterised by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep problems and fatigue affecting approximately 2% of the general population. People often report high disability levels and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Drug therapy focuses on reducing key symptoms and disability, and improving HRQoL. Cannabis has been used for millennia to reduce pain and other somatic and psychological symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of cannabinoids for fibromyalgia symptoms in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE to April 2016, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, three clinical trial registries, and contact with trial authors.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We selected randomised controlled trials of at least four weeks' duration of any formulation of cannabis products used for the treatment of adults with fibromyalgia.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted the data of all included studies and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence was derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for drop-outs; at least 200 participants in the comparison, eight to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design), second tier evidence from data that did not meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers (i.e. data from at least 200 participants) in the comparison, and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that were considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included two studies with 72 participants. Overall, the two studies were at moderate risk of bias. The evidence was derived from group mean data and completer analysis (very low quality evidence overall). We rated the quality of all outcomes according to GRADE as very low due to indirectness, imprecision and potential reporting bias.The primary outcomes in our review were participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) much or very much improved, withdrawal due to adverse events (tolerability) and serious adverse events (safety). Nabilone was compared to placebo and to amitriptyline in one study each. Study sizes were 32 and 40 participants. One study used a cross-over design and one used a parallel group design; study duration was four or six weeks. Both studies used nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, with a bedtime dosage of 1 mg/day. No study reported the proportion of participants experiencing at least 30% or 50% pain relief or who were very much improved. No study provided first or second tier (high to moderate quality) evidence for an outcome of efficacy, tolerability and safety. Third tier (very low quality) evidence indicated greater reduction of pain and limitations of HRQoL compared to placebo in one study. There were no significant differences to placebo noted for fatigue and depression (very low quality evidence). Third tier evidence indicated better effects of nabilone on sleep than amitriptyline (very low quality evidence). There were no significant differences between the two drugs noted for pain, mood and HRQoL (very low quality evidence). More participants dropped out due to adverse events in the nabilone groups (4/52 participants) than in the control groups (1/20 in placebo and 0/32 in amitriptyline group). The most frequent adverse events were dizziness, nausea, dry mouth and drowsiness (six participants with nabilone). Neither study reported serious adverse events during the period of both studies. We planned to create a GRADE 'Summary of findings' table, but due to the scarcity of data we were unable to do this. We found no relevant study with herbal cannabis, plant-based cannabinoids or synthetic cannabinoids other than nabilone in fibromyalgia.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found no convincing, unbiased, high quality evidence suggesting that nabilone is of value in treating people with fibromyalgia. The tolerability of nabilone was low in people with fibromyalgia."

Usage patterns and adverse effects, including withdrawal symptoms were also explored. Methods: Cannabidiol-predominant cannabis users were recruited online to complete an online survey assessing CBG use patterns, conditions treated with CBG-predominant cannabis (containing >50% CBG), perceived efficacy, associated adverse events, and withdrawal symptoms. One hundred twenty-seven eligible participants (U.S. residents ages 21+ who reported using CBG-predominant cannabis in the past 6 months) completed the survey. Results: Most of the samples (n=65; 51.2%) reported use of CBG-predominant products solely for medical purposes (n=46; 36.2% reported use for medical and recreational purposes; n=8; 6.3% reported recreational use only, and n=8 were missing). The most common conditions the complete sample reported using CBG to treat were anxiety (51.2%), chronic pain (40.9%), depression (33.1%), and insomnia/disturbed sleep (30.7%). Efficacy was highly rated, with the majority reporting their conditions were \"very much improved\" or \"much improved\" by CBG. Furthermore, 73.9% claimed superiority of CBG-predominant cannabis over conventional medicines for chronic pain, 80% for depression, 73% for insomnia, and 78.3% for anxiety. Forty-four percent of CBG-predominant cannabis users reported no adverse events, with 16.5% noting dry mouth, 15% sleepiness, 11.8% increased appetite, and 8.7% dry eyes. Around 84.3% reported no withdrawal symptoms, with sleep difficulties representing the most frequently endorsed withdrawal symptom (endorsed by two respondents). Conclusions: This is the first patient survey of CBG-predominant cannabis use to date, and the first to document self-reported efficacy of CBG-predominant products, particularly for anxiety, chronic pain, depression, and insomnia. Most respondents reported greater efficacy of CBG-predominant cannabis over conventional pharmacotherapy, with a benign adverse event profile and negligible withdrawal symptoms. This study establishes that humans are employing CBG and suggests that CBG-predominant cannabis-based medicines should be studied in randomized controlled trials."

Cannabis products have historically been used for chronic pain and are attracting renewed pharmaceutical interest. Nabilone is a synthetic cannabinoid licensed in Canada for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. We have used nabilone off-label for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain since 1999. In this article, we review our clinical experience of 20 adult patients with chronic noncancer pain who had been treated with nabilone and followed up for an average of 1.5 years. Prior to nabilone therapy, patients had used a wide range of therapies, including 11 who had used cannabis. Fifteen patients reported subjective overall improvement with nabilone, and nine reported reduced pain intensity. Beneficial effects on sleep and nausea were the main reasons for continuing use. Intolerable side effects were experienced in three patients (palpitations, urinary retention, dry mouth). Nabilone may be a useful addition to pain management and should be further evaluated in randomized controlled trials."

            "abstract": "Research on the antiepileptic effects of (endo-)cannabinoids has remarkably progressed in the years following the discovery of fundamental role of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system in controlling neural excitability. Moreover, an increasing number of well-documented cases of epilepsy patients exhibiting multi-drug resistance report beneficial effects of cannabis use. Pre-clinical and clinical research has increasingly focused on the antiepileptic effectiveness of exogenous administration of cannabinoids and/or pharmacologically induced increase of eCBs such as anandamide (also known as arachidonoylethanolamide [AEA]). Concomitant research has uncovered the contribution of neuroinflammatory processes and peripheral immunity to the onset and progression of epilepsy. Accordingly, modulation of inflammatory pathways such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was pursued as alternative therapeutic strategy for epilepsy. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous fatty acid amide related to the centrally and peripherally present eCB AEA, and is a naturally occurring nutrient that has long been recognized for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Neuroprotective and anti-hyperalgesic properties of PEA were evidenced in neurodegenerative diseases, and antiepileptic effects in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), maximal electroshock (MES) and amygdaloid kindling models of epileptic seizures. Moreover, numerous clinical trials in chronic pain revealed that PEA treatment is devoid of addiction potential, dose limiting side effects and psychoactive effects, rendering PEA an appealing candidate as antiepileptic compound or adjuvant. In the present study, we aimed at assessing antiepileptic properties of PEA in a mouse model of acute epileptic seizures induced by systemic administration of kainic acid (KA). KA-induced epilepsy in rodents is assumed to resemble to different extents human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) depending on the route of KA administration; intracerebral (i.c.) injection was recently shown to most closely mimic human TLE, while systemic KA administration causes more widespread pathological damage, both in brain and periphery. To explore the potential of PEA to exert therapeutic effects both in brain and periphery, acute and subchronic administration of PEA by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection was assessed on mice with systemically administered KA. Specifically, we investigated: (i) neuroprotective and anticonvulsant properties of acute and subchronic PEA treatment in KA-induced seizure models, and (ii) temporal dynamics of eCB and eicosanoid (eiC) levels in hippocampus and plasma over 180 min post seizure induction in PEA-treated and non-treated KA-injected mice vs. vehicle injected mice. Finally, we compared the systemic PEA treatment with, and in combination with, pharmacological blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in brain and periphery, in terms of anticonvulsant properties and modulation of eCBs and eiCs. Here, we demonstrate that subchronic administration of PEA significantly alleviates seizure intensity, promotes neuroprotection and induces modulation of the plasma and hippocampal eCB and eiC levels in systemic KA-injected mice."

And 2 × 10(5) osteolytic NCTC2472 cells in α-MEM were injected into medullary cavity of right distal femur to induce bone cancer pain in a murine model while sham mice received an injection of only α-MEM. All mice were tested for pain-related behaviors at pre-inoculation and at Days 5, 7, 10 and 14 post-inoculation. The tests included paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT) and paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL). Group J and Group D were injected intrathecally with 2 µg JWH015 dissolved in 4% DMSO and only 4% DMSO respectively in a 5 µl. volume. Pain behavior tests were performed before and at 1, 6, 24, 48 and 72 h after an intrathecal injection.

Thermal hyperalgesia appeared at Day 10 post-inoculation. The value of PWTL was (16.9 ± 0.4) s (P < 0.05) at Day 10 and declined to (11.5 ± 0.7) s at Day 14 post-inoculation. The threshold of thermal hyperalgesia increased to (15.7 ± 1.9) g at 6 h after an intrathecal injection of JWH015, peaked at (18.6 ± 2.3) g at 12 h, became alleviated after 48 h and recovered to the pre-dosing levels at 72 h. (2) Western blot: From Day 5 post-inoculation, the ratio of CB2/β-actin increased gradually. Compared with the ratio of 0.190 ± 0.010 at Day 5 post-inoculation, the ratio of CB2/β-actin increased to 0.660 ± 0.010 at Day 14 post-inoculation (P < 0.05); compared with the ratio of 0.903 ± 0.006 in group D at 12 h after an intrathecal injection of JWH015, the ratio of CB2/β-actin 0.510 ± 0.010 significantly decreased (P < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The cannabinoid 2 receptor plays an important role in the formation of bone cancer pain."

            "abstract": "Regulatory approvals for Epidiolex (purified cannabidiol) in the treatment of childhood drug resistant epilepsy have set a precedent for the use of cannabinoids as a prescribed medicine. Two common reasons cited for the use and prescription of cannabis-based products are pain and insomnia. Unlike drug resistant epilepsy, the level of evidence of efficacy in pain is poorly developed. The lowest quality trials with the greatest methodological shortcomings suggest some benefit, a level of evidence that is inconsistent with widespread prescribing. The evidence in insomnia is scant. Ongoing trial development and critical review of the literature should not be overshadowed by increasing permissiveness towards cannabis use and anecdotal reports of efficacy."

As a result, a corresponding wide range of treatments have been employed to treat patients with NP, including antiepileptic drugs, opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, cholecystokinin receptor antagonists, adenosine, lipoic acid, cannabinoids, isosorbide dinitrate, dronabinol, capsaicin, protein kinase C inhibitors, aldose reductase inhibitors, and VR-1 receptor modulators. Many of these compounds are limited by marginal efficacy and clinically significant adverse events; few have been evaluated in well-controlled, large-scale clinical trials. At present, the only agents approved for the treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia are lidocaine patches 5%, duloxetine, gabapentin, and pregabalin. Of these, only pregabalin is indicated for both conditions."

            "abstract": "Constituents of the Cannabis plant, cannabinoids, may be of therapeutic value in neurologic diseases. The most abundant cannabinoids are Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, which possesses psychoactive properties, and cannabidiol, which has no intrinsic psychoactive effects, but exhibits neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies. A small number of high-quality clinical trials support the safety and efficacy of cannabinoids for treatment of spasticity of multiple sclerosis, pain refractory to opioids, glaucoma, nausea and vomiting. Lower level clinical evidence indicates that cannabinoids may be useful for dystonia, tics, tremors, epilepsy, migraine and weight loss. Data are also limited in regards to adverse events and safety. Common nonspecific adverse events are similar to those of other CNS 'depressants' and include weakness, mood changes and dizziness. Cannabinoids can have cardiovascular adverse events and, when smoked chronically, may affect pulmonary function. Fatalities are rare even with recreational use. There is a concern about psychological dependence, but physical dependence is less well documented. Cannabis preparations may presently offer an option for compassionate use in severe neurologic diseases, but at this point, only when standard-of-care therapy is ineffective. As more high-quality clinical data are gathered, the therapeutic application of cannabinoids will likely expand."

            "abstract": "Identification of antigenic peptides expressed on cancer cells enables us to treat cancer patients with peptide-based immunotherapy. Although optimal protocols for peptide-based vaccines have not yet been elucidated, boosting the immune system could be a better approach than priming the immune system to elicit prompt and potent peptide-specific T-cell responses in cancer patients. With this possibility in mind, the authors undertook a clinical trial in which cancer patients were vaccinated with peptides (maximum 4) after confirmation of pre-existing peptide-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) precursors in the periphery. Fourteen patients (seven with melanoma and seven with other types of cancer) positive for either HLA-A24 or HLA-A2 were enrolled in this study. Fourteen and 16 peptides were used to screen for HLA-A24+ and HLA-A2+ patients, respectively. The vaccination was well tolerated, and the only adverse effects were local pain and fever. Kinetic analysis revealed that peptide-reactive CTLs increased after peptide vaccination in 7 of 14 patients. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactive to the administered peptides was detected in 2 patients before vaccination, although it became detectable in 8 of the other 12 patients after the peptide vaccination. Stable disease for more than 6 months was observed in five patients (one with melanoma and four with other types of cancer); all of these patients showed increased levels of peptide-specific IgG. These results indicate that peptide vaccination of patients showing evidence of pre-existing peptide-specific CTL precursors can be applied in further clinical trials aimed at the treatment of melanoma and other types of cancer."

            "abstract": "Although pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) was described as a key vasoregulator in human skin, little is known about its expression in mouse skin. As it is important to investigate PACAP signaling in translational mouse dermatitis models, we determined its presence, regulation, and role in neurogenic and non-neurogenic cutaneous inflammatory mechanisms. The mRNA of PACAP and its specific receptor PAC1 was detected with real-time PCR in several skin regions at comparable levels. PACAP-38-immunoreactivity measured with radioimmunoassay was similar in plantar and dorsal paw skin and the ear but significantly smaller in the back skin. PACAP and PAC1 mRNA, as well as PACAP-38 and PAC1 protein expression, significantly increased in the plantar skin after intraplantar administration of capsaicin (50 μl, 100 μg ml(-1)), an agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor, evoking chiefly neurogenic inflammation without inflammatory cell accumulation. Intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA; 50 μl, 1 mg ml(-1)) also increased PACAP/PAC1 mRNA but not the PACAP peptide. Capsaicin-induced neurogenic paw edema, but not CFA-evoked non-neurogenic swelling, was significantly smaller in PACAP-deficient mice throughout a 24-hour period. To our knowledge, we provide previously unreported evidence for PACAP and PAC1 expression upregulation during skin inflammation of different mechanisms and for its pro-inflammatory function in neurogenic edema formation."

In addition, NPs were assessed by using the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI). In 2018, the patient progressed to severe AD stage and presented with progressive NPs (anxiety, suspected delusions, agitation, aggressive behavior, and suspected pain due to long immobility). Consequently, off-label treatment with low-dose dronabinol was initiated, which facilitated a reduction of psychopharmacological treatment from six to three psychotropics. At the same time, the patient's emotional state improved, while disruptive behavior, aggression, and sedation decreased significantly.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Most health economic evaluations in mental care include outcome measures aimed at specific aspects of health, like symptom improvement, functional improvement and quality of life instead of generic preference based outcome measures. The health economic guidelines (NICE) recommend to include a generic preference based outcome measure, like EQ-5D, in health economic evaluations in order to allow for comparisons of health related quality of life of patient groups across different diseases, providing information particular useful to support health policy decisions and cost-effectiveness analysis. Although the EQ-5D is by far the most widespread outcome measure within the context of economic evaluations, its validity in psychiatric populations has not yet been established unambiguously. An increasing number of articles have tested the validity of the EQ-5D in comparisons with clinical measures in mental health, but only few studies have addressed the correlation between the EQ-5D and a condition-specific quality of life measure in mental health.\n    \n\n\n          Aims of the study:\n        \n      \n      The aim of the article is to test for a potential correlation between the preferred generic outcome measure in health economic evaluations EQ-5D and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA) in order to assess to what extent quality of life dimensions measured by a psychiatric quality of life measure are captured in the EQ-5D in a population of patients with schizophrenia and cannabis abuse.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data analysed is a part of a study of 103 patients with schizophrenia and abuse of cannabis participating in a randomized controlled trial testing a specialized addiction intervention during the period 2008-09. The correlation of the EQ-5D and scores of MANSA was assessed using the Spearman's correlation coefficient. In addition, we tested how the EQ-5D and MANSA correlated with PANSS, GAF and WHO-DAS in order to make comparisons with earlier studies.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found moderate, statistically significant correlations between the EQ-5D index score and MANSA total score (rho = 0.358**). The dimensions 'Mobility', 'Self-Care' and 'Pain/discomfort' on the EQ-5D were overall not sensitive in this population, while the dimensions 'Usual activities' and 'Anxiety/depression' were moderately correlated with MANSA. The EQ-5D and MANSA both showed statistically significant moderate correlations with the clinical measures in the study PANSS, GAF and WHO-DAS.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Our results suggest that the EQ-5D and MANSA are complementary measures rather than substitutes.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for health policies:\n        \n      \n      Mental health interventions often seek to improve the patients' quality of life in a broader perspective, like improving the patients' relationship with family, friends and other network, financial situation, employment and accommodation. If the EQ-5D is used as a single outcome in health economic evaluations of e.g. mental health community interventions, these factors may be overlooked. Based on a relatively small sample, we therefore recommend applying the EQ-5D together with condition-specific quality of life measures in future health economic evaluations in mental health."

While conventional oncology focuses on targeted medicine, research on LCS101 adopts a multi-targeted approach, examining its preclinical (in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo) and clinical (randomized controlled trial, pragmatic) effects. This includes examining the formula's impact on the immune system, selective anticancer effects, and improved chemotherapy-related symptoms and quality of life. Effects on the Immune System: In murine splenic cell cultures, LCS101 significantly increased T-cell proliferation and macrophage tumor necrosis factor-α production. Blood samples from healthy volunteers exposed to LCS101 showed a dose-dependent increase in natural killer cell activity; and a randomized controlled trial showed significantly lower rates of leucopenia/neutropenia and anemia in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Selective Anticancer Effects: In vitro LCS101 demonstrated selective growth inhibition (on XTT viability assay) in human breast and prostate cancer cell lines, without any harmful effects on normal human epithelial cells. The anticancer effects were attributed to reactive oxygen species activity. Cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil on breast cancer cell lines were significantly increased following exposure to LCS101, with a protective effect in normal cells. Symptom Relief and Quality of Life: Clinical research shows that patients taking LCS101 during chemotherapy are less likely to report symptoms such as fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      LCS101 exhibits multi-targeted effects, with significant implications for cancer care.

In addition serum electrolytes (Na+, K+) and plasma osmolality have been controlled regularly. Patients in group A (n = 10) received Fentanyl epidurally (0.1-0.2 mg diluted with 0.9% saline solution) for treatment of postoperative pain, whereas in group B (n = 10) systemic opiate therapy was performed by intramuscular application of piritramide (Dipidolor, 15-25 mg). There was a significant increase in ADH in all patients, whereas serum electrolytes (Na+, K+) and plasma osmolality stayed within normal range. ADH-levels in group A (epidural opiate), however, were significantly lower than mean values in group B (systemic opiate application). The postoperative increase in ADH is interpreted as a reaction to stress and trauma, being less pronounced, when epidural opiate therapy is performed for postoperative pain treatment."

Single-dose AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) values for taranabant increased approximately linearly with dose up to 200 mg, with slightly less than dose-proportional increases in AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) values for doses >200 mg. Plasma taranabant had a biphasic disposition, with a median t(max) of 1 to 2.5 hours and a terminal elimination t((1/2)) of 38 to 69 hours. Coadministration of taranabant with a high-fat meal led to a 14% increase in C(max) and a 74% increase in AUC(0-infinity). Clinical adverse experiences associated with single doses of taranabant were generally mild and transient. Of the 198 clinical adverse experiences reported, the most common drug-related ones were nausea (36), headache (22), drowsiness (14), abdominal discomfort/abdominal pain/stomachache (14), hiccups (9), dizziness (8), decreased appetite (7), increased bowel movement (7), mood change (6), tiredness (4), vomiting (4), and sweating increased (4).

Results: Of the 2,967 invited specialists from 20 territories, 2,074 (69.9%) took part. The majority of respondents (60.5%) were from China. Of the respondents, 42% worked in intensive care units (ICUs) where respiratory therapists were present; 78.9% used a spontaneous breathing trial as the initial weaning step; 44.3% frequently/always used pressure support (PS) alone, 53.4% intermittent spontaneous breathing trials with PS in between, and 19.8% synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with PS as a weaning mode.

Of these, 78.2% frequently always followed the protocol. A multivariate analysis involving a modified Poisson regression analysis showed that working in an ICU with a weaning protocol and frequently/always following it was positively associated with an upper-middle-income territory, a university-affiliated hospital, or in an ICU that employed respiratory therapists; and negatively with a low-income or lower-middle-income territory or a public hospital. There was no significant association with \"in-house\" intensivist at night, multidisciplinary ICU, closed ICU, or nurse-patient ratio.

            "abstract": "Understanding how the body regulates pain is fundamental to develop rational strategies to combat the growing prevalence of chronic pain states, opioid dependency, and the increased financial burden to the medical care system. Pain is the most prominent reason why Americans seek medical attention and extensive literature has identified the importance of the endocannabinoid pathway in controlling pain. Modulation of the endocannabinoid system offers new therapeutic opportunities for the selective control of excessive neuronal activity in several pain conditions (acute, inflammatory, chronic, and neuropathic). Cannabinoids have a long history of medicinal use and their analgesic properties are well documented; however, there are major impediments to understanding cannabinoid pain modulation. One major issue is the presence of psychotropic side effects associated with D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or synthetic derivatives, which puts an emphatic brake on their use. This dose-limiting effect prevents the appropriate degree of analgesia . Animal studies have shown that the psychotropic effects are mediated via brain cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors, while analgesic activity in chronic pain states may be mediated via CB1R action in the spinal cord, brainstem, peripheral sensory neurons, or immune cells. The development of appropriate therapies is incumbent on our understanding of the role of peripheral versus central endocannabinoid-driven analgesia. Recent physiological, pharmacological, and anatomical studies provide evidence that one of the main roles of the endocannabinoid system is the regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and/or glutamate release. This article will review this evidence in the context of its implications for pain. We first provide a brief overview of CB1R's role in the regulation of nociception, followed by a review of the evidence that the peripheral endocannabinoid system modulates nociception. We then look in detail at regulation of central-mediated analgesia, followed up with evidence that cannabinoidmediated modulation of pain involves modulation of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in key brain regions. Finally, we discuss cannabinoid action on non-neuronal cells in the context of inflammation and direct modulation of neurons. This work stands to reveal long-standing controversies in the cannabinoid analgesia area that have had an impact on failed clinical trials and implementation of therapeutics targeting this system."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Cannabis use for pain relief is commonly reported, yet laboratory studies and clinical trials suggest that cannabinoids are weak analgesics, and it is unclear whether perceived reductions in pain from before to after cannabis use relate to factors such as dose, method of administration, phytocannabinoid content, or the age or gender of the user. We determined whether inhalation of cannabis decreased self-reported pain ratings as well as whether user gender, age, time, method of administration, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD) content, or dose of cannabis contribute to changes in these ratings. We also examined whether tolerance may develop to the analgesic effects of cannabis over time. Materials and Methods: Archival data were obtained from Strainprint®, a medical cannabis app that allows patients to track symptoms before and after using different strains and doses of cannabis. Latent change score models and multilevel models were used to analyze data from 131,582 sessions in which inhaled cannabis was used to treat \"muscle pain,\" \"joint pain,\" or \"nerve pain.\" Results: For all three pain symptoms, severity ratings decreased significantly after cannabis use. Women reported higher baseline and postcannabis pain severity than did men, and men reported larger decreases in pain than did women. Neither THC nor CBD content nor their interaction predicted reductions in pain ratings. However, vaping was associated with larger reductions in joint pain ratings than was smoking, and lower doses were associated with larger reductions in nerve pain ratings. Additionally, for all three pain symptoms, the dose of cannabis used to manage pain increased significantly over time. Conclusions: Inhaled cannabis reduces self-reported pain severity by ∼42-49%. However, these reductions appear to diminish across time, and patients use larger doses across time, suggesting that analgesic tolerance develops with continued use."

Patients in group A had open-door laminoplasty, and patients in group B underwent French-door laminoplasty with reattachment of the spinous process and extensor musculatures. The following criteria were evaluated: operation time, blood loss, perioperative complications, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores, recovery rates, axial pain, and short-form 36 (SF-36). For radiographic evaluation, cervical lordosis was reviewed as lordotic angles, which were measured at C2-C7.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Although the operation time was significantly less in group A as compared with group B, the mean blood loss in group A was significantly more than group B. Perioperative complications occurred more frequently in group A than in group B. Although there were no significant differences in postoperative JOA scores and recovery rates between the 2 groups, axial pain was significantly decreased in group B at final follow-up. The scores of every subscale of the SF-36 were higher in group B than group A.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Perioperative complications occurred more frequently in open-door laminoplasty than in French-door laminoplasty. JOA scores and recovery rates suggested that both open-door and French-door laminoplasties could be similarly effective in decompressing the spinal cord. Axial pain was improved in French-door laminoplasty but became worse in open-door laminoplasty. SF-36 suggested that French-door laminoplasty could be more beneficial than open-door laminoplasty for patients with cervical compressive myelopathy."

            "abstract": "The safety and tolerability of quinupristin/dalfopristin were assessed in both comparative and non-comparative trials (2298 quinupristin/dalfopristin-treated patients). In comparative clinical trials, the most frequent systemic adverse events related to quinupristin/dalfopristin were nausea (4.6%), diarrhoea (2.7%), vomiting (2.7%) and skin rash (2.5%). The comparator group showed similar rates, except that nausea was significantly more common (7.2%; P = 0.01). In non-comparative trials, arthralgia and myalgia were reported most frequently but were reversible upon treatment discontinuation. The renal, inner ear, cardiovascular and central nervous systems were not implicated as significant target organs for toxicity. The most frequent local adverse events related to infusion of quinupristin/dalfopristin were inflammation, pain, oedema, infusion site reaction and thrombophlebitis. Results of laboratory tests while on therapy were comparable for quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator groups, except that increases in conjugated bilirubin of >5 x the upper limit of normal were reported in 5.5% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients; increases in total bilirubin of >5 x the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.5%. Comparator recipients more frequently had increases in alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated metabolism of drugs including midazolam, nifedipine, terfenadine and cyclosporin. Therefore, plasma drug monitoring and/or dosage reduction of these agents is prudent. Concomitant administration of drugs that can prolong the electrocardiographic QTc interval should be avoided. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is visually and chemically compatible with commonly used drugs of various classes, but it is not compatible with sodium chloride solution and certain other drugs, including some antimicrobials. Therefore, when prescribing quinupristin/dalfopristin, clinicians should be aware of the potential for peripheral venous intolerance, arthralgias and myalgias, increases in conjugated bilirubin, interactions with drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme and certain physico-chemical incompatibilities. However, multiple studies have shown that the safety and tolerability of quinupristin/dalfopristin are generally favourable, and that it provides clear benefits to ill patients with severe gram-positive infections."

We analysed the available evidence to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of all types of medicinal cannabinoids in treating symptoms of various mental disorders.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and April 30, 2018. We also searched for unpublished or ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. We considered all studies examining any type and formulation of a medicinal cannabinoid in adults (≥18 years) for treating depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis, either as the primary condition or secondary to other medical conditions. We placed no restrictions on language, publication status, or study type (ie, both experimental and observational study designs were included). Primary outcomes were remission from and changes in symptoms of these mental disorders. The safety of medicinal cannabinoids for these mental disorders was also examined. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as odds ratios (ORs) for disorder remission, adverse events, and withdrawals and as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059372, CRD42017059373, CRD42017059376, CRD42017064996, and CRD42018102977).\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      83 eligible studies (40 randomised controlled trials, n=3067) were included: 42 for depression (23 randomised controlled trials; n=2551), 31 for anxiety (17 randomised controlled trials; n=605), eight for Tourette syndrome (two randomised controlled trials; n=36), three for ADHD (one randomised controlled trial; n=30), 12 for post-traumatic stress disorder (one randomised controlled trial; n=10), and 11 for psychosis (six randomised controlled trials; n=281). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) improved anxiety symptoms among individuals with other medical conditions (primarily chronic non-cancer pain and multiple sclerosis; SMD -0·25 [95% CI -0·49 to -0·01]; seven studies; n=252), although the evidence GRADE was very low. Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) worsened negative symptoms of psychosis in a single study (SMD 0·36 [95% CI 0·10 to 0·62]; n=24). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental disorders examined but did increase the number of people who had adverse events (OR 1·99 [95% CI 1·20 to 3·29]; ten studies; n=1495) and withdrawals due to adverse events (2·78 [1·59 to 4·86]; 11 studies; n=1621) compared with placebo across all mental disorders examined. Few randomised controlled trials examined the role of pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      There is scarce evidence to suggest that cannabinoids improve depressive disorders and symptoms, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. There is very low quality evidence that pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) leads to a small improvement in symptoms of anxiety among individuals with other medical conditions. There remains insufficient evidence to provide guidance on the use of cannabinoids for treating mental disorders within a regulatory framework. Further high-quality studies directly examining the effect of cannabinoids on treating mental disorders are needed.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      Therapeutic Goods Administration, Australia; Commonwealth Department of Health, Australia; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council; and US National Institutes of Health."

            "abstract": "Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is one of the most common types of intractable pain. We reported that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of primary motor cortex relieves pain for patients who were refractory to medical treatment. But the mechanism is unclear. In the present study, we investigated relations between the characteristics of CPSP and the results of fiber tracking, which is the only noninvasive method of evaluating the anatomical connectivity of white matter pathways. Fiber tracking of the corticospinal tract (CST) and thalamocortical tract (TCT) was investigated in 17 patients with CPSP. The stroke lesion was located in a supratentorial region in all cases (corona radiata, one case; thalamus, seven cases; putamen, nine cases). Relations between the delineation ratio (defined as the ratio of the cross section of the affected side to that of the unaffected side) of the CST and of the TCT, manual muscle test score, pain score, region of pain, and efficacy of rTMS were evaluated. Fiber tracking was successful in 13 patients with the stroke lesion involving the TCT. The rTMS-effective group had higher delineation ratio of the CST (p=0.02) and the TCT (p=0.005) than the rTMS-ineffective group. Previous studies suggested that an intact CST allows pain control but did not discuss the TCT. Our results suggest that the TCT also plays a role in pain reduction by rTMS of the primary motor cortex and that the efficacy of rTMS for patients with CPSP is predictable by fiber tracking."

            "abstract": "Various lifestyle factors including physical activity and obesity, stress, sleep, and smoking may modify the risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). In patients with established IBD, these lifestyle factors may significantly impact the natural history and clinical outcomes. Recreational exercise decreases the risk of flare and fatigue in patients with IBD. In contrast, obesity increases the risk of relapse and is associated with higher anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain and higher health care utilization. Obesity also modifies pharmacokinetics of biologic agents unfavorably and is associated with a higher risk of treatment failure. Sleep disturbance is highly prevalent in patients with IBD, independent of disease activity, and increases the risk of relapse and chronic fatigue. Similarly, stress, particularly perceived stress rather than major life events, may trigger symptomatic flare in patients with IBD, although its impact on inflammation is unclear. Cigarette smoking is associated with unfavorable outcomes including the risk of corticosteroid dependence, surgery, and disease progression in patients with Crohn's disease; in contrast, smoking does not significantly impact outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis, although some studies suggest that it may be associated with a lower risk of flare. The effect of alcohol and cannabis use in patients with IBD is inconsistent, with some studies suggesting that cannabis may decrease chronic pain in patients with IBD, without a significant effect of biological remission. Although these lifestyle factors are potentially modifiable, only a few interventional studies have been conducted. Trials of structured exercise and psychological therapy including mindfulness-based therapies such as meditation and yoga and gut-directed hypnotherapy have not consistently demonstrated benefit in clinical and/or endoscopic disease activity in IBD, although may improve overall quality of life."

            "abstract": "Cardiac inflammatory responses appear to play a pivotal role in scar formation after acute myocardial infarction. Monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a cytokine with chemotactic activity for mononuclear phagocytes, but also for NK cells, T cells, mast cells, and basophils. To investigate the possible involvement of MCAF/MCP-1 in the pathogenesis, its course was studied in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Twenty-three consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction and 18 patients with angina pectoris were studied. Cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma levels of interleukin IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-2 were below the detection limit of our method. IL-6 and interferon-gamma were detected in 17.4%, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in 13.0% of patients with acute myocardial infarction, but the frequency was not statistically significantly different from that in angina pectoris. The plasma level of MCAF/MCP-1 in myocardial infarction tended to increase at 3 h after the onset of chest pain (133 +/- 19 pg/ml, P= 0.06) and was significantly elevated at 9 h (143 +/- 20 pg/ml) when compared with that in angina pectoris (87 +/- 6 pg/ml, P<0.05). The MCAF/MCP-1 level remained increased during the 24-hours observation period (P<0.01), and maximum level (168 +/- 13 pg/ml) was seen at 24 hour. The level of MCAF/ MCP-1 correlated significantly with the plasma level of another chemokine, IL-8, at 12 h after the onset of chest pain (r=0.51, P<0.05), suggesting that common stimuli mediate the release of both cytokines in myocardial infarction. The identification of MCAF/MCP-1 as an inflammatory mediator in acute myocardial infarction suggests that mononuclear phagocytes may play an important role in the early stage of the disease."

There were no significant differences in T in each item. IA of the group that had experienced more than 7 months of the condition was significantly low. Although the frequency of joint mobilization by physical therapists in the hospital setting showed no relationship with IA or T, IA was significantly higher and T was significantly shorter in the group that performed self-exercise every day than in the groups that performed less.

Antipsychotic medication remains a mainstay of treatment and management for patients under the team case load; hence a need exists for a detailed look into the prescription patterns of such medications.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to look into the prescribing patterns of antipsychotics for a sample of 50 patients in the South Herefordshire community team during the year of 2016 (from Jan 2016 to Dec 2016), as well as investigate whether these antipsychotics were licensed to be used for the corresponding diagnoses of these patients. We also looked into whether patients were prescribed antipsychotics within BNF limits. As a part of this audit we looked into whether patients were made aware that they were on unlicensed antipsychotics or on above the BNF maximum doses of antipsychotics.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      A random sample of 50 patients was taken from the case load of the South community team as is documented on RIO. The mean age of the patients in the sample was 46.1 (SD= ±14.6) Sample selection was done by selecting every seventh patient in the patient case load (if not using antipsychotics the next patient was chosen). Patients studied involved those with F1-F19 Mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use, F20-F29 Schizophrenia/Schizotypal/Delusional disorder, F31 Bipolar affective disorders, F32 Depression, F40-F48 Anxiety Neurotic and stress related disorders and somatoform disorders, F50-F59 Behaviour syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors, F60-F69 Disorders of adult personality and behaviour. The patients selected had to be followed up by the recovery team during the year 2016 and they had to be on an antipsychotic medication at any point during that time period. A scale was utilized to help the orderly collection of information as dose, patient diagnoses, comorbid substance use etc. SPC was relied upon for investigating the licensing of the different antipsychotics.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      It was found that the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic was Quetiapine (28.07%) followed by Olanzapine (24.56%), Aripiprazole (14.04%) and Depot drugs (12.28%). It was found that the most commonly used depot drugs were Modecate and Depixol. It was also found that 14% of our patients were prescribed two antipsychotics at the same time. Unlicensed antipsychotics made up 17.54% of all prescribed antipsychotics. It was also found that no documentation on the system evidenced that patients were told about the use of unlicensed antipsychotics. Quetiapine and olanzapine made up 60 % of the unlicensed antipsychotics followed by risperidone and aripiprazole 40%. The conditions that were found to be given unlicensed medications were anxiety neurotic and stress related disorders and somatoform disorders (F40-48), disorders of adult personality and behaviour (F60-F69) and multiple conditions. The most common daily doses prescribed for Aripiprazole were found to be 5, 10 and 15 mg doses. For Quetiapine, it was the 300mg dose and for Olanzapine it was found to be the 10mg dose. In all but one patient antipsychotics were prescribed within BNF limits. One patient was prescribed Olanzapine 25 mg (BNF maximum dose 20 mg). Polypharmacy was found to be used more in the multiple diagnosis and schizophrenia conditions. Patients with schizophrenia and adult personality disorders were found to be the most patients who abused alcohol, cannabis and prescription opioid analgesic medications.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Antipsychotics have a range of central nervous system effects and there are situations where it becomes necessary to use them off-license. However, it is essential to explain to the patient about the unlicensed use of antipsychotics and document this on the system. The effects of unlicensed antipsychotics need to be carefully monitored and their benefits regularly assessed and recorded. Antipsychotics interact with physical health medication and could adversely affect the physical health condition. Hence it is necessary to look into healthier means of pain management and review the long term prescription of opioid analgesics. It is important to investigate more into how to manage comorbidities such as substance misuse of alcohol and cannabis and whether cross referral between services is the best way to address this issue.

            "abstract": "Noncardiac chest pain is associated with poor quality of life and high care expenditure. The majority of noncardiac chest pain is either gastresophageal reflux disease related or due to esophageal motility disorders, and the rest are considered functional chest pain (FCP) due to central and peripheral hypersensitivity. Current treatment of FCP improves 40-50% of patients. Cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2) modulate release of neurotransmitters; CB1 is located in the esophageal epithelium and reduces excitatory enteric transmission and potentially could reduce esophageal hypersensitivity. We performed a prospective study to evaluate its effects on pain threshold, frequency, and intensity in FCP. Subjects with FCP received dronabinol (5 mg, twice daily; n = 7; average age, 44 years; mean body mass index, 26.7) or placebo (n = 6; average age, 42 years; mean body mass index, 25.9) for 28 days (4 weeks). Chest pain, general health, and anxiety/depression questionnaires were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Subjects underwent an esophageal balloon distention test prior to treatment and on last day of the study. Dronabinol increased pain thresholds significantly (3.0 vs. 1.0; P = 0.03) and reduced pain intensity and odynophagia compared to placebo (0.18 vs. 0.01 and 0.12 vs. 0.01, respectively, P = 0.04). Depression and anxiety scores did not differ between the groups at baseline or after treatment. No significant adverse effects were observed. In this novel study, dronabinol increased pain threshold and reduced frequency and intensity of pain in FCP. Further, large scale studies are needed to substantiate these findings.\n"

            "abstract": "In humans, various sites like cannabinoid receptors (CBR) having a binding affinity with cannabinoids are distributed on the surface of different cell types, where endocannabinoids (ECs) and derivatives of fatty acid can bind. The binding of these substance(s) triggers the activation of specific receptors required for various physiological functions, including pain sensation, memory, and appetite. The ECs and CBR perform multiple functions via the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1); cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), having a key effect in restraining neurotransmitters and the arrangement of cytokines. The role of cannabinoids in the immune system is illustrated because of their immunosuppressive characteristics. These characteristics include inhibition of leucocyte proliferation, T cells apoptosis, and induction of macrophages along with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. The review seeks to discuss the functional relationship between the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and anti-tumor characteristics of cannabinoids in various cancers. The therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for cancer-both in vivo and in vitro clinical trials-has also been highlighted and reported to be effective in mice models in arthritis for the inflammation reduction, neuropathic pain, positive effect in multiple sclerosis and type-1 diabetes mellitus, and found beneficial for treating in various cancers. In human models, such studies are limited; thereby, further research is indispensable in this field to get a conclusive outcome. Therefore, in autoimmune disorders, therapeutic cannabinoids can serve as promising immunosuppressive and anti-fibrotic agents."

            "abstract": "There is a growing amount of evidence to suggest that cannabis and individual cannabinoids may be effective in suppressing certain symptoms of multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, including spasticity and pain. Anecdotal evidence is to be found in newspaper reports and also in responses to questionnaires. Clinical evidence comes from trials, albeit with rather small numbers of patients. These trials have shown that cannabis, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, and nabilone can produce objective and/or subjective relief from spasticity, pain, tremor, and nocturia in patients with multiple sclerosis (8 trials) or spinal cord injury (1 trial). The clinical evidence is supported by results from experiments with animal models of multiple sclerosis. Some of these experiments, performed with mice with chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (CREAE), have provided strong evidence that cannabinoid-induced reductions in tremor and spasticity are mediated by cannabinoid receptors, both CB(1) and CB(2). Endocannabinoid concentrations are elevated in the brains and spinal cords of CREAE mice with spasticity, and in line with this observation, spasticity exhibited by CREAE mice can be ameliorated by inhibitors of endocannabinoid membrane transport or enzymic hydrolysis. Research is now needed to establish whether increased endocannabinoid production occurs in multiple sclerosis. Future research should also be directed at obtaining more conclusive evidence about the efficacy of cannabis or individual cannabinoids against the signs and symptoms of these disorders, at devising better modes of administration for cannabinoids and at exploring strategies that maximize separation between the sought-after therapeutic effects and the unwanted effects of these drugs."

Cannabis is also considered to have potential medical benefits, and medical marijuana has been legislated in many parts of the world. However, a recent meta-analysis found that cannabinoids were associated with only modest benefits for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, small and inconsistent benefits for pain and spasticity, and inconclusive benefits for other indications such as improvement of appetite and weight, reduction in tic severity, and improvement of mood or sleep. On the flip side, cannabinoids and cannabis have acute and long-term adverse effects. In randomized controlled trials, cannabinoids increase the risk of total adverse events, serious adverse events, and dropout due to adverse events. Cannabis impairs cognition, and driving after cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents, including fatal accidents. Long-term cannabis use may lead to dependence, respiratory conditions, psychosis, and possibly cancer, as well. Cannabis use during pregnancy may compromise certain pregnancy outcomes such as fetal growth, and use during adolescence may compromise neurodevelopment, social adjustment, and vocational success. The composition and bioavailability of cannabis vary across preparations of the substance and routes of administration; this limits the ability to generalize the findings of studies. The findings of older research may no longer apply to current strains of cannabis that are higher in psychotogenic content.

Cannabinoid-based medicine (CBM) has shown an ability to inhibit some symptoms associated with dementia, and the adverse effects are often minimal; yet, little research has explored the use of CBM among this population.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      To monitor the safety of a purified dose of CBM oil (3:2 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol) on behaviour symptoms, quality of life and discomfort caused by pain.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      We will carry out an 18-week, randomised, double-blind crossover trial that consists of a 2-week eligibility period, two 6-week treatment cycles, and two 2-week washout periods (between both cycles and after the second treatment cycle). We aim to recruit 50 participants with dementia who are living in residential aged-care facilities. The participants will be randomised into two groups and will receive a dose of either CBM oil or placebo for the first treatment cycle and the opposite medication for the second.

This report reviews the current evidence on effectiveness and harms of epidural, facet joint, and sacroiliac corticosteroid injections for low back pain conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Data Sources:\n        \n      \n      A prior systematic review (searches through July 2008), electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Libraries from January 2008 through October 2014), reference lists, and clinical trials registries.\n    \n\n\n          Review Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using predefined criteria, we selected randomized trials of patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, nonradicular back pain, or chronic postsurgical back pain that compared effectiveness or harms of epidural, facet joint, or sacroiliac corticosteroid injections versus placebo or other interventions. We also included randomized trials that compared different injection techniques and large (sample sizes >1000) observational studies of back injections that reported harms. The quality of included studies was assessed, data were extracted, and results were summarized qualitatively and using meta-analysis on outcomes stratified by immediate- (1 week to ≤2 weeks), short- (2 weeks to ≤3 months), intermediate- (3 months to <1 year), and long-term (>1 year) followup.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Seventy-eight randomized trials of epidural injections, 13 trials of facet joint injections, and one trial of sacroiliac injections were included. For epidural corticosteroid injections versus placebo interventions for radiculopathy, the only statistically significant effects were on mean improvement in pain at immediate-term followup (weighted mean difference [WMD] −7.55 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI −11.4 to −3.74) (strength of evidence [SOE]: moderate), mean improvement in function at immediate-term followup when an outlier trial was excluded (standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.33, 95% CI −0.56 to −0.09) (SOE: low), and risk of surgery at short-term followup (relative risk [RR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.92) (SOE: low). The magnitude of effects on pain and function was small, did not meet predefined thresholds for minimum clinically important differences, and there were no differences on outcomes at longer-term followup. Evidence on effects of different injection techniques, patient characteristics, or comparator interventions estimates was limited and did not show clear effects. Trials of epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy versus nonplacebo interventions did not clearly demonstrate effectiveness (SOE: insufficient to low).\n    \n\n      \n      Evidence was limited for epidural corticosteroid injections versus placebo interventions for spinal stenosis (SOE: low to moderate) or nonradicular back pain (SOE: low), but showed no differences in pain, function, or likelihood of surgery.\n    \n\n      \n      Studies found no clear differences between various facet joint corticosteroid injections (intra-articular, extra-articular [peri-capsular], or medial branch) and placebo interventions (SOE: low to moderate). There was insufficient evidence from one very small trial to determine effects of peri-articular sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injections injection (SOE: insufficient).\n    \n\n      \n      Serious harms from injections were rare in randomized trials and observational studies, but harms reporting was suboptimal (SOE: low).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy were associated with immediate improvements in pain and might be associated with immediate improvements in function, but benefits were small and not sustained, and there was no effect on long-term risk of surgery. Evidence did not suggest that effectiveness varies based on injection technique, corticosteroid, dose, or comparator. Limited evidence suggested that epidural corticosteroid injections are not effective for spinal stenosis or nonradicular back pain and that facet joint corticosteroid injections are not effective for presumed facet joint pain. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate effectiveness of sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injections."

            "abstract": "We conducted a randomized control study to compare the effects of pain, QOL, bone metabolism and fracture healing by administering bisphosphonate (BP) or weekly teriparatide preparation (W-TPTD) to 43 patients (5 males and 38 females) with fresh spinal vertebral compression fractures for osteoporosis. The patients were aged between 61 and 93 years old (mean 78.1 years). In principle, a MRI was used for any diagnosis of new vertebral fractures. From this study, lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD), after 24 weeks of administration, showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in both the BP group (mean 5.3%) and in the W-TPTD group (mean 4.9%). The W-TPTD group showed a better Roland-Morris disability Questionnaire (RDQ) improvement throughout the whole period of the study compared with the BP group, the difference was statistically significant after 24 weeks of administration (p < 0.05). The EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) and visual analogue scale (VAS) score significantly improved over time in both groups (p < 0.05). The fracture-healing rate was observed in 45% of the BP group and 73% of the W-TPTD group at Week 12, and a statistically significant higher fracture-healing rate was obtained in the W-TPTD group compared to the BP group (p < 0.05). The mean time of fracture-healing was 3.9 months for the BP group and 2.8 months in the W-TPTD group. Statistically significant faster fracture-healing was observed in the W-TPTD group (p < 0.05). At Week 12 and Week 24, P1NP was significantly higher in the W-TPTD group compared to that of the BP group (p < 0.05). TRACP-5b showed no major fluctuations during the study period in either group. These results suggest that W-TPTD may promote better fracture healing of any new osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures compared with a BP."

We also included the following types of post-licensure analyses: case-control studies, self-controlled case series, and multivariate risk factor analyses. We conducted an electronic search of PubMed from inception through August 2013, and reviewed Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices statements, vaccine package inserts, and previously published reviews to identify studies. Scientific Information Packets were requested from vaccine manufacturers.\n    \n\n\n          Review methods:\n        \n      \n      We reviewed the methodology of the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) consensus report \"Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality\" and accepted their findings. We augmented their work with new studies and additional vaccines. For studies not included in the IOM report, we abstracted data on the presence or absence of adverse health outcomes, characteristics of patients, study design, and vaccine description, including brand, potency, dosage, timing, and formulation, where available. We excluded formulations not used in the United States. The McHarm instrument was used to evaluate the quality of adverse events collection and reporting in each study. We were unable to pool results; we rated the overall strength of evidence (SOE) as high, moderate, low, or insufficient by using guidance suggested by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for its Effective Health Care Program.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 20,478 titles were identified; after title, abstract, and full-text review, 166 studies were accepted for abstraction. The vast majority of studies either did not investigate or could not identify risk factors for adverse events (AEs) associated with vaccination. Similarly, the severity of AEs was inconsistently reported, as was information that would make independent severity determination possible.\n    \n\n      \n      SOE was high for the following associations in nonpregnant adults: seasonal influenza vaccine and arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, pain at injection site; 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS); and a lack of association between influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and cardiovascular events in the elderly. Risk of GBS was estimated at 1.6 excess cases per million persons vaccinated. SOE was high for the following associations in children and adolescents: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and febrile seizures in children under age 5; lack of association between MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders; and varicella vaccine and disseminated Oka strain varicella zoster virus with associated complications (i.e., meningitis, encephalitis) in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies. There is moderate SOE that vaccines against rotavirus are associated with intussusception in children; risk was estimated as 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses, depending on brand. Moderate-strength evidence exists regarding human papillomavirus vaccine and a lack of association with onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and GBS. Moderate-strength evidence shows no association between inactivated influenza vaccine and serious AEs in pregnant women.\n    \n\n      \n      Evidence was insufficient to make conclusions regarding whether several routinely recommended vaccines are associated with serious conditions such as multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious adverse events; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. Careful consideration should be given to the investigation of research gaps, including patient risk factors that may be associated with AEs; however, important factors must be taken into account when determining whether studies are warranted, including the severity and frequency of the AE being studied and the challenges of conducting sufficiently powered studies when investigating rare events."

            "abstract": "Quince (Cydonia oblonga Mill) is a popular medicinal herb in different traditional medicines. Concentrated quince fruit extract, also known as quince sauce (QS), is traditionally used for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of QS versus ranitidine on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in pregnant women. We compared the efficacy of 4 weeks of ranitidine (150 mg, twice daily) with the efficacy of QS (10 mg, after meals) on 137 pregnant women with GERD. Their General Symptom Score (GSS) and Major Symptom Score (MSS) were compared at the baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after intervention. After 2 weeks of the study, the mean GSS score of the QS group was significantly lower compared with the ranitidine group (p = .036). Although, the GSS value at the end of the study had no difference between groups (p = .074). However, the MSS of the different symptoms of the two groups at 2 weeks and 4 weeks had no significant differences. It seems that the efficacy of QS for the management of pregnancy-related GERD is similar to ranitidine. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Quince is a traditional gastric tonic, an appetiser, and a remedy for nausea/vomiting and epigastric pain. Also, there are several previous positive experiences about quince products for GERD treatment. What do the results of this study add? It seems that the efficacy of QS for the management of pregnancy-related GERD is similar to ranitidine. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? QS can be suggested as an alternative medicine for pregnant patients with GERD."

            "abstract": "Single injections in the anterior region of the thoracic paravertebral space (TPVS) have been reported to generate a multisegmental longitudinal spreading pattern more frequently than those in the posterior region of the TPVS. In this trial, we examined the hypothesis that a continuous thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) administered through a catheter inserted into the anterior region of the TPVS allows a wider sensory block dispersion. Fifty consecutive patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery were enrolled. Before the surgery, an infusion catheter was inserted into the TPVS through a needle placed adjacent to either the parietal pleura (group A) or internal intercostal membrane (group P) using an ultrasound-guided intercostal transverse approach according to a randomized allocation schedule. A chest radiograph was obtained postoperatively after injection of 10 mL of radiopaque dye through the catheter. Thereafter, 20 mL of 0.375% levobupivacaine was injected via the catheter, followed by commencement of continuous TPVB with 0.25% levobupivacaine at 8 mL/h. The primary outcome was the number of blocked dermatomes at 24 h after surgery. The secondary outcomes included radiopaque dye spreading patterns, the number of segments reached by the radiopaque dye, the number of blocked dermatomes at 2 h after surgery, and pain scores. The median (interquartile range [range]) number of blocked dermatomes 24 h after surgery was 3 (2.75-4 [1-6]) in group A (n = 22) and 2 (1.5-3 [0-7]) in group P (n = 25; p = 0.037). No significant differences in the other outcomes were found between the groups. In conclusion, a continuous TPVB administered using a catheter supposedly inserted into the anterior region of the TPVS allows a wider sensory block dispersion than a catheter inserted into the posterior region of the TPVS.

All studies reporting the use of EMDA to enhance the intravesical administration of therapeutic drugs for urological conditions were included. Two reviewers independently screened all articles, searched the reference lists of retrieved articles, and performed the data extraction. Thirty-two studies were included. The use of EMDA has been reported in the following urological conditions: (1) nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); (2) overactive bladder; (3) bladder pain syndrome; (4) radiation cystitis; (5) detrusor acontractility; and (6) for analgesia prior to transurethral procedures. Overall, most studies are nonrandomized trials with small numbers of patients. The use of EMDA is reported to be safe and effective in all these conditions, with the highest level of evidence in NMIBC in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. However, the low overall quality of evidence limits the conclusions that can be reached. The use of EMDA to improve the efficacy of intravesical treatments is promising, but the low overall quality of the evidence base has limited its widespread use. Future studies should compare EMDA to passive diffusion and current standard of care in large, randomized, and long-term studies to determine the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of this modality."

However, the psychotropic effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound of Cannabis sativa, are of concern. Thus, the interest in the isolated constituents without psychotropic activity, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidivarin (CBDV) is growing. CBD and CBDV are lipophilic molecules with poor oral bioavailability and are mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. The pharmacodynamics of CBD is the best explored, being able to interact with diverse molecular targets, like cannabinoid receptors, G protein-coupled receptor-55, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Considering the therapeutic potential, several clinical trials are underway to study the efficacy of CBD and CBDV in different pathologies, such as neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders and pain conditions. The anti-cancer properties of CBD have also been demonstrated by several pre-clinical studies in different types of tumour cells. Although less studied, CBDV, a structural analogue of CBD, is receiving attention in the last years. CBDV exhibits anticonvulsant properties and, currently, clinical trials are underway for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. Despite the benefits of these phytocannabinoids, it is important to highlight their potential interference with relevant physiologic mechanisms. In fact, CBD interactions with CYP450 enzymes and with drug efflux transporters may have serious consequences when co-administered with other drugs. This review summarizes the therapeutic advances of CBD and CBDV and explores some aspects of their pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and possible interactions. Moreover, it also highlights the therapeutic potential of CBD and CBDV in several medical conditions and clinical applications."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To determine if medical marijuana provides pain relief for patients with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) and to determine the therapeutic dose, adverse effects, and specific indications.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      In April 2014, MEDLINE and EMBASE searches were conducted using the terms chronic noncancer pain, smoked marijuana or cannabinoids, placebo and pain relief, or side effects or adverse events.\n    \n\n\n          Study selection:\n        \n      \n      An article was selected for inclusion if it evaluated the effect of smoked or vaporized cannabinoids (nonsynthetic) for CNCP; it was designed as a controlled study involving a comparison group, either concurrently or historically; and it was published in English in a peer-review journal. Outcome data on pain, function, dose, and adverse effects were collected, if available. All articles that were only available in abstract form were excluded. Synthesis A total of 6 randomized controlled trials (N = 226 patients) were included in this review; 5 of them assessed the use of medical marijuana in neuropathic pain as an adjunct to other concomitant analgesics including opioids and anticonvulsants. The 5 trials were considered to be of high quality; however, all of them had challenges with masking. Data could not be pooled owing to heterogeneity in delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol potency by dried weight, differing frequency and duration of treatment, and variability in assessing outcomes. All experimental sessions in the studies were of short duration (maximum of 5 days) and reported statistically significant pain relief with nonserious side effects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There is evidence for the use of low-dose medical marijuana in refractory neuropathic pain in conjunction with traditional analgesics. However, trials were limited by short duration, variability in dosing and strength of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and lack of functional outcomes. Although well tolerated in the short term, the long-term effects of psychoactive and neurocognitive effects of medical marijuana remain unknown. Generalizing the use of medical marijuana to all CNCP conditions does not appear to be supported by existing evidence. Clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing medical marijuana for patients, especially in those with nonneuropathic CNCP."

            "abstract": "Increases in cancer diagnosis have tremendous negative impacts on patients and their families, and major societal and economic costs. The beneficial effect of chemotherapeutic agents on tumor suppression comes with major unwanted side effects such as weight and hair loss, nausea and vomiting, and neuropathic pain. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which can include both painful and non-painful symptoms, can persist 6 months or longer after the patient's last chemotherapeutic treatment. These peripheral sensory and motor deficits are poorly treated by our current analgesics with limited effectiveness. Therefore, the development of novel treatment strategies is an important preclinical research focus and an urgent need for patients. Approaches to prevent CIPN have yielded disappointing results since these compounds may interfere with the anti-tumor properties of chemotherapeutic agents. Nevertheless, the first (serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants) and second (5% lidocaine patches, 8% capsaicin patches and weak opioids such as tramadol) lines of treatment for CIPN have shown some efficacy. The clinical challenge of CIPN management in cancer patients and the need to target novel therapies with long-term efficacy in alleviating CIPN are an ongoing focus of research. The endogenous cannabinoid system has shown great promise and efficacy in alleviating CIPN in preclinical and clinical studies. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms through which the platinum, taxane, and vinca alkaloid classes of chemotherapeutics may produce CIPN and the potential therapeutic effect of drugs targeting the endocannabinoid system in preclinical and clinical studies, in addition to cannabinoid compounds diffuse mechanisms of action in alleviation of CIPN."

The results reported to date have not been consistent. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not the concentration of SPLI or that of beta-ENDLI in CSF demonstrated any potential for assessing the degree of subjective pain in various spinal diseases. SPLI in CSF was measured by radioimmunoassay in 158 patients with a spinal disease; involving 57 patients with a lumbar disc herniation (LDH), 38 with lumbar canal stenosis (LCS), 46 with cervical myelopathy (CM) and 17 with cervical radiculopathy (CR), and also in 20 healthy controls. beta-ENDLI in CSF was measured in 25 of these same patients; involving 12 with LDH, seven with LCS and six with CM, and also five of the same controls. The concentration of serum SPLI was also measured in 50 of these 158. The severity of pain was self-evaluated by each patient using a linear visual analogue scale (VAS). Their Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was also calculated objectively using the clinical findings. Correlations were investigated among the concentrations of SPLI and beta-ENDLI in the CSF and the VAS and JOA clinical assessments of these patients. The concentration of SPLI in CSF was significantly higher in various spinal diseases than in control (P < 0.05), and was correlated with the severity on the VAS and with the JOA score. However, beta-ENDLI was not correlated with either the VAS or the JOA score. We conclude that the measurement of the SPLI concentration in CSF has the potential for assessing objectively the severity of pain associated with various spinal diseases."

            "abstract": "Pain is an ambiguous perception: the same pain stimulation can be perceived differently in different contexts, producing different experiences, ranging from mild to unbearable pain. It can be even experienced as a rewarding sensation within the appropriate context. Overall, placebo and nocebo effects appear to be very good models to understand how the psychosocial context modulates the experience of pain. In this review, we examine the effects of different contexts on pain, with a specific focus on the neurobiological mechanisms. Positive and rewarding contexts inform the patients that an effective treatment is being delivered and are capable of producing pain relief through the activation of specific systems such as opioids, cannabinoids and dopamine. Conversely, a negative context can produce pain exacerbation and clinical worsening through the modulation of different systems, such as the activation of cholecystokinin and the deactivation of opioids and dopamine. In addition, when a therapy is delivered unbeknownst to the patient, its effects are reduced. A better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of the context-pain interaction is a challenge both for future pain research and for good clinical practice."

This study addresses the hypothesis that metabolic stressors, such as acidosis, may induce the release of POMC derivatives into the cardiovascular system not only from the pituitary but also from other sites of POMC expression. In our study, we investigated the liberation of POMC derivatives from peripheral tissues under a state of acidosis achieved by tourniquet-induced ischemia, alteration of lactate concentration, and base excess. In eight patients undergoing knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia, catheters were inserted into the femoral vein proximally to thigh tourniquet location. Blood was drawn from these catheters 5 min before and 40 s, 5 min, and 10 min after tourniquet deflation to measure plasma concentrations of N-acetyl-beta-endorphin immunoreactive material (IRM), beta-endorphin IRM, authentic beta-endorphin, adrenocorticotropin, lactate, pH, and base excess. In five of eight patients, we found a significant increase of beta-endorphin IRM levels 40 s after tourniquet deflation compared with predeflation levels; 5 and 10 min after tourniquet deflation, the beta-endorphin IRM levels were below the detection limit. Thus beta-endorphin IRM was released from ischemic limb tissues into the cardiovascular system. Only a small part of the determined beta-endorphin IRM corresponded to authentic beta-endorphin. Forty seconds after tourniquet deflation, the beta-endorphin IRM concentration correlated with base excess (r < 0.71; P < 0.05); no significant correlations were found with pH or lactate levels. Thus it was shown here for the first time that ischemic stress may induce the release of beta-endorphin IRM from nonpituitary tissues."

            "abstract": "The capsaicin (vanilloid) receptor, TRPV1, is a heat-activated cation channel modulated by inflammatory mediators and contributes to acute and chronic pain. TRPV1 channel is one of the most researched and targeted mechanisms for the development of novel analgesics. Over the years, natural products have contributed enormously to the development of important therapeutic drugs used currently in modern medicine. A literature review was conducted using Medline, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Searching the literature resulted in listing 136 natural compounds that interacted with TRPV1 channel. These compounds were phytochemicals that belong to different chemical groups including vanilloids, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, terpenyl phenols, fatty acids, cannabinoids, sulfur_containing compounds, etc. Other natural TRPV1 modulators were of animal, fungal or bacterial origin. Some natural products were small agonists or antagonists of TRPV1. Others were protein venoms. Most in vitro studies utilized electrophysiological or calcium imaging techniques to study calcium flow through the channel using primary cultures of rat dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. Other studies used hTRPV1 or rTRPV1 expressed in HEK239, CHO cells or Xenopus oocytes. In vivo studies concentrated on different pain models conducted mainly in mice and rats. In conclusion, natural products are highly diverse in their modulatory action on TRPV1. Many gaps in natural product research are present in distinguishing modality-specific from polymodal antagonists. Species' differences in TRPV1 functionality must be taken into account in any future study. Proceeding into clinical trials needs more efforts to discover potent TRPV1 antagonists devoid of hyperthermia, the main side effect."

Eight drugs are in Phase III trials at present. Strategies that may show promise over existing treatments include topical therapies, analgesic combinations and, in future, gene-related therapies. Recent years have heralded an explosion of pharmaceutical development in neuropathic pain, reflecting advanced knowledge of neurobiology and a heightened perception of the commercial value of neuropathic pain therapeutics.

Whether LY2828360 suppresses neuropathic pain has not been reported, and its signaling profile is unknown. In vitro, LY2828360 was a slowly acting but efficacious G protein-biased CB2 agonist, inhibiting cAMP accumulation and activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling while failing to recruit arrestin, activate inositol phosphate signaling, or internalize CB2 receptors. In wild-type (WT) mice, LY2828360 (3 mg/kg per day i.p. × 12 days) suppressed chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain produced by paclitaxel without producing tolerance. Antiallodynic efficacy of LY2828360 was absent in CB2 knockout (KO) mice. Morphine (10 mg/kg per day i.p. × 12 days) tolerance developed in CB2KO mice but not in WT mice with a history of LY2828360 treatment (3 mg/kg per day i.p. × 12 days). LY2828360-induced antiallodynic efficacy was preserved in WT mice previously rendered tolerant to morphine (10 mg/kg per day i.p. × 12 days), but it was absent in morphine-tolerant CB2KO mice. Coadministration of LY2828360 (0.1 mg/kg per day i.p. × 12 days) with morphine (10 mg/kg per day × 12 days) blocked morphine tolerance in WT but not in CB2KO mice. WT mice that received LY2828360 coadministered with morphine exhibited a trend (P = 0.055) toward fewer naloxone-precipitated jumps compared with CB2KO mice. In conclusion, LY2828360 is a slowly signaling, G protein-biased CB2 agonist that attenuates chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain without producing tolerance and may prolong effective opioid analgesia while reducing opioid dependence. LY2828360 may be useful as a first-line treatment in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and may be highly efficacious in neuropathic pain states that are refractive to opioid analgesics."

EFIC convened a European group of experts, drawn from a diverse range of basic science and relevant clinical disciplines, to prepare a position paper to empower and inform specialist and nonspecialist prescribers on appropriate use of cannabis-based medicines for chronic pain. The expert panel reviewed the available literature and harnessed the clinical experience to produce these series of recommendations. Therapy with cannabis-based medicines should only be considered by experienced clinicians as part of a multidisciplinary treatment and preferably as adjunctive medication if guideline-recommended first- and second-line therapies have not provided sufficient efficacy or tolerability. The quantity and quality of evidence are such that cannabis-based medicines may be reasonably considered for chronic neuropathic pain. For all other chronic pain conditions (cancer, non-neuropathic noncancer pain), the use of cannabis-based medicines should be regarded as an individual therapeutic trial. Realistic goals of therapy have to be defined. All patients must be kept under close clinical surveillance. As with any other medical therapy, if the treatment fails to reach the predefined goals and/or the patient is additionally burdened by an unacceptable level of adverse effects and/or there are signs of abuse and misuse of the drug by the patient, therapy with cannabis-based medicines should be terminated.\n    \n\n\n          Significance:\n        \n      \n      This position paper provides expert recommendations for nonspecialist and specialist healthcare professionals in Europe, on the importance and the appropriate use of cannabis-based medicines as part of a multidisciplinary approach to pain management, in properly selected and supervised patients."

It also foregrounds recent development of molecules belonging to diverse chemical classes as potential FAAH inhibitors bobbing up from in-depth chemical, mechanistic and computational studies published since 2015-November 2019, focusing on their potency. This review will assist readers to obtain rationale on FAAH as potential target for addressing various disease conditions, acquiring significant knowledge on recently established inhibitor scaffolds and their development potentials. New technologies including MD-MM simulations and 3D-QSAR studies allow mechanistic characterization of enzyme. Assessment of in-vitro and in-vivo efficacy of existing FAAH inhibitors will facilitate researchers to design novel ligands utilizing modern drug design methods. The discussions will also impose precaution in decision making process, quashing possibility of late stage failure."

            "title": "Amygdala activity contributes to the dissociative effect of cannabis on pain perception.",
            "abstract": "Cannabis is reported to be remarkably effective for the relief of otherwise intractable pain. However, the bases for pain relief afforded by this psychotropic agent are debatable. Nonetheless, the frontal-limbic distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the brain suggests that cannabis may target preferentially the affective qualities of pain. This central mechanism of action may be relevant to cannabinoid analgesia in humans, but has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, on brain activity related to cutaneous ongoing pain and hyperalgesia that were temporarily induced by capsaicin in healthy volunteers. On average, THC reduced the reported unpleasantness, but not the intensity of ongoing pain and hyperalgesia: the specific analgesic effect on hyperalgesia was substantiated by diminished activity in the anterior mid cingulate cortex. In individuals, the drug-induced reduction in the unpleasantness of hyperalgesia was positively correlated with right amygdala activity. THC also reduced functional connectivity between the amygdala and primary sensorimotor areas during the ongoing-pain state. Critically, the reduction in sensory-limbic functional connectivity was positively correlated with the difference in drug effects on the unpleasantness and the intensity of ongoing pain. Peripheral mechanisms alone cannot account for the dissociative effects of THC on the pain that was observed. Instead, the data reveal that amygdala activity contributes to interindividual response to cannabinoid analgesia, and suggest that dissociative effects of THC in the brain are relevant to pain relief in humans."

            "title": "Enhanced endocannabinoid tone as a potential target of pharmacotherapy.",
            "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system is up-regulated in numerous pathophysiological states such as inflammatory, neurodegenerative, gastrointestinal, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, pain, and cancer. It has been suggested that this phenomenon primarily serves an autoprotective role in inhibiting disease progression and/or diminishing signs and symptoms. Accordingly, enhancement of endogenous endocannabinoid tone by inhibition of endocannabinoid degradation represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of many diseases. Importantly, this allows for the avoidance of unwanted psychotropic side effects that accompany exogenously administered cannabinoids. The effects of endocannabinoid metabolic pathway modulation are complex, as endocannabinoids can exert their actions directly or via numerous metabolites. The two main strategies for blocking endocannabinoid degradation are inhibition of endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes and inhibition of endocannabinoid cellular uptake. To date, the most investigated compounds are inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme that degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide. However, application of FAAH inhibitors (and consequently other endocannabinoid degradation inhibitors) in medicine became questionable due to a lack of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials and serious adverse effects evoked by one specific compound. In this paper, we discuss multiple pathways of endocannabinoid metabolism, changes in endocannabinoid levels across numerous human diseases and corresponding experimental models, pharmacological strategies for enhancing endocannabinoid tone and potential therapeutic applications including multi-target drugs with additional targets outside of the endocannabinoid system (cyclooxygenase-2, cholinesterase, TRPV1, and PGF2α-EA receptors), and currently used medicines or medicinal herbs that additionally enhance endocannabinoid levels. Ultimately, further clinical and preclinical studies are warranted to develop medicines for enhancing endocannabinoid tone."

Thereafter, a group-specific desflurane concentration was administered using Dixon's up-and-down technique. After a \"wash out\" and equilibration period, patients were observed for defense movements up to 1 minute after skin incision. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded before induction of anesthesia (baseline), at surgical incision, as well as 2 and 4 minutes thereafter.

In this study, we compared the standard surgical removal method with two different Er,Cr:YSGG laser settings in order to find the best treatment method. In 33 dental arches, the following three treatment groups were comparatively evaluated: (1) surgical stripping, (2) removal with laser setting 1 (4.5 W, 50 Hz, 100% water, 80% air, 60 μs, 800 μm Tip; MZ8), and (3) laser setting 2 (2.5 W, 50 Hz, 20% water, 40% air, 700 μs, 800 μm Tip; MZ8). We comparatively evaluated pain, patient satisfaction and wound healing, treatment time, and the amount of bleeding. Re-pigmentation was evaluated after 1 and 12 months by Hedin and Dummet pigmentation scores. Laser setting 1 had the best results regarding pain and patient satisfaction, although not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Wound healing results were better using lasers compared to surgical stripping (P < 0.05). Laser setting 1 was a faster procedure with mild amounts of bleeding. The least amount of bleeding was seen with laser setting 2. After 1 month, only two cases of the laser setting 2-treated areas showed an isolated pigmented area in the papilla; at 12 months, the mean Hedin indexes were still less than 2 and mean Dummett index less than 1 in all treatment techniques, with the lowest scores seen in the laser setting 1 sites. Based on our results, Er,Cr:YSGG laser can be more convenient for gingival depigmentation compared to surgical blade. Although not statistically significant, laser setting 1 with shorter pulse duration and higher water spray showed better overall results. However, laser setting 2, with longer pulse duration and less water spray, resulted in better coagulative effects and can be used to control bleeding wherever necessary in clinical practice."

A total of five male regular marijuana users participated in three test sessions during which they smoked cigarettes containing 0% (placebo) and 3. 55% Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) (active). Each of four controlled smoking bouts per session, spaced at 40-min intervals, consisted of nine puffs from active and placebo cigarettes (three cigarettes, three puffs per cigarette, one puff per min). During successive bouts, participants smoked 0, 3, 6 and 9 (0, 3, 9 and 18 cumulative) puffs from active marijuana cigarettes, with the remainder of puffs from placebo cigarettes. Test sessions were identical, except for naltrexone 0, 50 or 200 mg p.o. (randomized, double-blind) administration 1 h before the first smoking bout on the different days. Before smoking, between smoking bouts and postsmoking, participants completed an assessment battery that included antinociceptive (finger withdrawal from radiant heat stimulation), biological, subjective, observer-rated signs and performance measures. Marijuana produced significant dose-dependent antinociception (increased finger withdrawal latency) and biobehavioral effects. Naltrexone did not significantly influence marijuana dose-effect curves, suggesting no role of endogenous opiates in marijuana-induced antinociception under these conditions."

Safety, ankle-brachial index, resting pain on a 10-cm visual analog scale, wound healing, and walking distance were evaluated before treatment and at 2 months after injection. No serious adverse event caused by gene transfer was detected over a follow-up of 6 months. Of particular importance, no peripheral edema, in contrast to that seen after treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor, was observed. In addition, the systemic HGF protein level did not increase during the study. At 2 months after gene transfer, the mean ± SD ankle-brachial index increased from 0.46 ± 0.08 to 0.59 ± 0.13 (P<0.001), the mean ± SD size of the largest ischemic ulcers decreased from 3.08 ± 1.54 to 2.32 ± 1.88 cm (P=0.007), and the mean ± SD visual analog scale score decreased from 5.92 ± 1.67 to 3.04 ± 2.50 cm (P=0.001). An increase in ankle-brachial index by >0.1, a reduction in ulcer size by >25%, and a reduction in visual analog scale score by >2 cm at 2 months after gene transfer were observed in 11 (64.7%) of 17 limbs, 18 (72%) of 25 ulcers, and 8 (61.5%) of 13 limbs, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Intramuscular injection of naked HGF plasmid is safe and feasible and can achieve successful improvement of ischemic limbs as sole therapy."

            "abstract": "Despite all the development of modern medicine, around 100 compounds derived from natural products were undergoing clinical trials only at the end of 2013. Among these natural substances in clinical trials, we found the resveratrol (RES), a pharmacological multi-target drug. RES analgesic properties have been demonstrated, although the bases of these mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the involvement of opioid and cannabinoid systems in RES-induced peripheral antinociception. Paw withdrawal method was used and hyperalgesia was induced by carrageenan (200 μg/paw). All drugs were given by intraplantar injection in male Swiss mice (n = 5). RES (100 μg/paw) administered in the right hind paw induced local antinociception that was antagonized by naloxone, non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, and clocinnamox, μOR selective antagonist. Naltrindole and nor-binaltorfimine, selective antagonists for δOR and kOR, respectively, did not reverse RES-induced peripheral antinociception. CB1R antagonist AM251, but not CB2R antagonist AM630, antagonized RES-induced peripheral antinociception. Peripheral antinociception of RES intermediate-dose (50 μg/paw) was increased by: (i) bestatin, inhibitor of endogenous opioid degradation involved-enzymes; (ii) MAFP, inhibitor of anandamide amidase; (iii) JZL184, inhibitor of 2-arachidonoylglycerol degradation involved-enzyme; (iv) VDM11, endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor. Acute and peripheral administration of RES failed to affect the amount of μOR, CB1R and CB2R. Experimental data suggest that RES induces peripheral antinociception through μOR and CB1R activation by endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid releasing."

Recent evidence clearly demonstrates analgesic and anti-spasticity effects that will probably prove to be clinically useful. Reduction of intraocular pressure in glaucoma and bronchodilation in asthma are not sufficiently strong, long lasting or reliable to provide a valid basis for therapeutic use. The anticonvulsant effect of cannabidiol is sufficiently promising to warrant further properly designed clinical trials. There is still a major lack of long term pharmacokinetic data and information on drug interactions. For all the present and probable future uses, pure cannabinoids, administered orally, rectally or parenterally, have been shown to be effective, and they are free of the risks of chronic inflammatory disease of the airways and upper respiratory cancer that are associated with the smoking of crude cannabis. Smoking might be justified on compassionate grounds in terminally ill patients who are already accustomed to using cannabis in this manner. Future research will probably yield new synthetic analogues with better separation of therapeutic effects from undesired psychoactivity and other side effects, and with solubility properties that may permit topical administration in the eye, or aerosol inhalation for rapid systemic effect without the risks associated with smoke inhalation."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of inhaling marijuana, or ethanol-extracted placebo smoke in the mouse model of cannabinoid activity by assessing inhibition of spontaneous activity, antinociception, catalepsy, and body temperature. In order to determine dosimetry, blood levels of Delta9-THC were obtained following either marijuana exposure or intravenous injection of Delta(9)-THC. Inhalation exposure to marijuana produced dose-related increases in antinociception and catalepsy, with estimated ED50 doses of Delta9-THC of 2.4 and 3.8 mg/kg, respectively. However, hypothermia and locomotor depression occurred in both the placebo- and marijuana-exposed mice. The CB1 receptor antagonist, SR 141716A antagonized the antinociceptive effects of marijuana (AD50 = 0.6 mg/kg), but only slightly decreased marijuana-induced catalepsy, and failed to alter either the hypothermic or locomotor depressive effects. In contrast, SR 141716A antagonized the antinociceptive, cataleptic, and hypothermic effects of intravenously administered Delta9-THC in mice that were exposed to air alone, though all subjects exhibited locomotor depression, possibly related to the restraint. In accordance with reports of others, these data suggest that exposure to smoke alone has pharmacological consequences. Our findings also indicate that marijuana-induced antinociception is mediated through a CB1-receptor mechanism of action and are consistent with the notion that Delta9-THC is mainly responsible for this effect."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is frequently used to measure frailty in critically ill adults. There is wide variation in the approach to analysing the relationship between the CFS score and mortality after admission to the ICU. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of modelling approach on the association between the CFS score and short-term mortality and quantify the prognostic value of frailty in this context.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We analysed data from two multicentre prospective cohort studies which enrolled intensive care unit patients ≥ 80 years old in 26 countries. The primary outcome was mortality within 30-days from admission to the ICU. Logistic regression models for both ICU and 30-day mortality included the CFS score as either a categorical, continuous or dichotomous variable and were adjusted for patient's age, sex, reason for admission to the ICU, and admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median age in the sample of 7487 consecutive patients was 84 years (IQR 81-87). The highest fraction of new prognostic information from frailty in the context of 30-day mortality was observed when the CFS score was treated as either a categorical variable using all original levels of frailty or a nonlinear continuous variable and was equal to 9% using these modelling approaches (p < 0.001). The relationship between the CFS score and mortality was nonlinear (p < 0.01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Knowledge about a patient's frailty status adds a substantial amount of new prognostic information at the moment of admission to the ICU.

            "abstract": "Cannabinoids bind not only to classical receptors (CB1 and CB2) but also to certain orphan receptors (GPR55 and GPR119), ion channels (transient receptor potential vanilloid), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Cannabinoids are known to modulate a multitude of monoamine receptors. Structurally, there are 3 groups of cannabinoids. Multiple studies, most of which are of moderate to low quality, demonstrate that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and oromucosal cannabinoid combinations of THC and cannabidiol (CBD) modestly reduce cancer pain. Dronabinol and nabilone are better antiemetics for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) than certain neuroleptics, but are not better than serotonin receptor antagonists in reducing delayed emesis, and cannabinoids have largely been superseded by neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists and olanzapine; both cannabinoids have been recommended for breakthrough nausea and vomiting among other antiemetics. Dronabinol is ineffective in ameliorating cancer anorexia but does improve associated cancer-related dysgeusia. Multiple cancers express cannabinoid receptors directly related to the degree of anaplasia and grade of tumor. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that cannabinoids may have anticancer activity. Paradoxically, cannabinoid receptor antagonists also have antitumor activity. There are few randomized smoked or vaporized cannabis trials in cancer on which to judge the benefits of these forms of cannabinoids on symptoms and the clinical course of cancer. Smoked cannabis has been found to contain Aspergillosis. Immunosuppressed patients should be advised of the risks of using \"medical marijuana\" in this regard."

Randomized, controlled clinical trials of Sativex as add-on therapy provide conclusive evidence of its efficacy in the treatment of more than 1500 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related resistant spasticity. The primary end point in clinical trials was the mean change from baseline in the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) spasticity score. The first pivotal clinical trial included 189 patients treated for 6 weeks with Sativex (n = 124) or placebo (n = 65). At study end, there was a significant reduction from baseline in patient-recorded NRS spasticity scores with Sativex compared with placebo (-1.18 vs -0.63; p = 0.048). In the second pivotal trial, 337 patients with MS-related resistant spasticity received Sativex (n = 167) or placebo (n = 170) over a 15-week period. In the per-protocol analysis (79% of the patient population), mean baseline NRS spasticity score was reduced significantly in patients receiving Sativex compared with placebo: -1.3 versus -0.8 points (p = 0.035). The third pivotal clinical trial, evaluating the sustained efficacy of Sativex, had a two-phase study design: in phase A (n = 572), 47% of patients were initial responders (improvement ≥ 20%) after 4 weeks of single-blind Sativex treatment who then entered phase B, a randomized, double-blind, 12-week placebo comparison. At the end of phase B, the change in NRS spasticity score improved by a further 0.04 units in initial responders treated with Sativex, but decreased by 0.81 units in placebo recipients (p = 0.0002). Significant improvements in quality-of-life measures from baseline to week 16 were also observed in patients receiving Sativex. The most common treatment-related adverse events with Sativex were mild-to moderate and transient episodes of dizziness, fatigue or somnolence. Sativex does not exhibit the side effects typically associated with recreational cannabis use and there are no signs of drug tolerance or withdrawal syndrome, or any evidence of drug misuse or abuse. Sativex oromucosal spray appears to be a useful and welcomed option for the management of resistant spasticity in MS patients. Although the management of MS has been improved by the availability of disease-modifying agents that target the underlying pathophysiological processes of the disease, a clear need remains for more effective symptomatic treatments, especially as regards MS-related spasticity and pain."

In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose trial, we investigated 40 women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy. Randomization took place when postoperative patient-controlled analgesia was discontinued on the second postoperative day. When patients requested further analgesia, they received a single, identical capsule of either oral delta-9-THC 5 mg (n=20) or placebo (n=20) in a double-blind fashion. The primary outcome measure was summed pain intensity difference (SPID) at 6 h after administration of study medication derived from visual analogue pain scores on movement and at rest. Secondary outcome measures were time to rescue medication and adverse effects of study medication. Mean (SD) VAS pain scores before medication in the placebo and delta-9-THC groups were 6.3(2.6) and 6.4(1.3)cm on movement, and 3.2(1.9) and 3.3(0.9) on rest, respectively. There were no significant differences in mean (95% confidence interval of the difference) SPID at 6 h between the groups [placebo 7.9, delta-9-THC 4.3(-1.8 to 9.0)cm h on movement; placebo 8.8, delta-9-THC 4.9(-0.2 to 8.1)cm h at rest] and time to rescue analgesia [placebo 217, delta-9-THC 163(-22 to 130)min].

            "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a series of well-known conditions caused by diseases or lesions to the somatosensory system. Due to the better understanding of the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain, previously unexplored therapies have been used with encouraging results. As such, Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), Alpha-lipoic-acid (ALA), cannabinoids, Clonidine, EMA401, Botulinum Toxin type A, and new voltage-gated sodium channel blockers, can be cited. Furthermore, new modalities in neuromodulation such as high-frequency spinal cord stimulation, burst stimulation, dorsal root ganglion stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and many others have been showing exciting results. Besides, changing paradigms may occur with the advent of optogenetics and a better understanding of epigenetic regulation. This article reviews the published literature on the treatment of NP. Despite the interesting results, randomized controlled trials are demanded for the majority of the therapies previously mentioned."

Currently, cannabinoids find a role in pain control. Post mortem and other studies report EC system abnormalities in depression, schizophrenia and suicide.

However, the lack of comprehensive descriptions of patients in the literature has made comparison and evaluation impossible. We aim to investigate the risk of systemic ADs in patients with IC/BPS in Taiwan using a population-based administrative database. Methods: This study evaluated 1,095 patients newly diagnosed with IC/BPS between 2000 and 2013, using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. These patients were randomly matched by demographic characteristics with a comparison cohort of individuals without IC/BPS at a ratio of 1:20. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyze the risk of ADs, adjusting for age, sex, urbanization, length of hospital stay, and comorbidities adjustment. Sensitivity analysis by propensity score was used to adjust for confounding factors. Results: The adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) of ADs for IC/BPS patients was 1.409 (95% CI 1.152-1.725). The subgroup analysis indicated that female or 45-60 years of age had a greater risk of ADs. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis of primary outcomes indicated that IC/BPS had greater incidence with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (aHR = 2.767, 95% CI 1.039-7.368), ankylosing spondylitis (aHR = 2.429, 95% CI 1.264-4.67), rheumatoid arthritis (aHR = 1.516, 95% CI 1.001-2.296), and Sjogren's syndrome (aHR = 1.962, 95% CI 1.37-2.809). Conclusion: IC/BPS was associated with the development of ADs in our study population, especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome.

Twenty-four cases with anterior cervical fusion using a titanium mesh with local autograft and anterior plating were reviewed.

The SITS group reported higher patient satisfaction scores than the 3P-VATS group, patients in the 3P-VATS group tended to receive higher total doses of analgesics (NSAIDs) after surgery compared with those in the SITS group, although these differences were not statistically significant.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our experience demonstrated that SITS decreased postoperative pain and resulted in higher patient satisfaction compared with the conventional three-port VATS.

            "title": "Cannabinoid Activity-Is There a Causal Connection to Spasmolysis in Clinical Studies?",
            "abstract": "Cannabinoid drugs are registered for postoperative nausea and emesis, Tourette syndrome and tumor-related anorexia, but are also used for spasticity and pain relief, among other conditions. Clinical studies for spasmolysis have been equivocal and even conclusions from meta-analyses were not consistent. This may be due to uncertainty in diagnostic criteria as well as a lack of direct spasmolytic activity (direct causality). In this review we used the Hill criteria to investigate whether a temporal association is causal or spurious.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic literature search was performed to identify all clinical trials of cannabinoids for spasticity. Studies were evaluated for dose dependency and time association; all studies together were analyzed for reproducibility, coherence, analogy and mechanistic consistency. A Funnel plot was done for all studies to identify selection or publication bias.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. The spasmolytic activity (effect strength) was weak, with a nonsignificant small effect in most studies and a large effect only in a few studies (\"enriched\" studies, low patient numbers). No dose dependency was seen and plotting effect size vs. daily dose resulted in a slope of 0.004. Most studies titrated the cannabinoid to the optimum dose, e.g., 20 mg/d THC. The effect decreased with longer treatment duration (3-4 months). The spasmolytic effect is consistent for different European countries but not always within a country, nor is the effect specific for an etiology (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, others). For other criteria like plausibility, coherence or analogous effects, no data exist to support or refute them. In most studies, adverse effects were frequently reported indicating a therapeutic effect only at high doses with relevant side effects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Current data do not support a specific spasmolytic effect; a general decrease in CNS activity analogous to benzodiazepines appears more likely. Whether individual patients or specific subgroups benefit from cannabinoids is unclear. Further studies should compare cannabinoids with other, nonspecific spasmolytic drugs like benzodiazepines."

            "abstract": "Introduction: The potential use of cannabis and cannabinoid products for the treatment of low-back pain is an important area for investigation. As one of the leading reasons to visit a primary care provider, low-back pain results in a significant burden of disease in both the United States' economic and health care systems. Given the current opioid epidemic, it is important to seek novel analgesics and understand their efficacy for myriad pain conditions, including low-back pain. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was performed using multiple online databases to assess the association of cannabis use and low-back pain in the literature. Results: A total of 124 articles were produced via our search methods, 73 abstracts in total were screened, 16 articles underwent full-text review, and 6 articles were included in qualitative synthesis. Discussion: This systematic literature review reveals a lack of primary research investigating cannabis as a potential treatment of low-back pain and highlights the need for further investigation with well-designed clinical trials. There remain substantial political and legal barriers to performing such research. Conclusion: Although there is a considerable body of work on the usage of cannabinoid products for many medical conditions, including the treatment of chronic pain, more directed clinical research into their utility as an analgesic for low-back pain and related symptoms needs to be addressed."

In a previous study, the authors found that patients treated with patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) exhibited attenuated proinflammatory cytokine response in the postoperative period. In the present study, the authors examined whether preemptive analgesia continued with PCEA may further attenuate the proinflammatory cytokine response and reduce pain sensitivity in the postoperative period. They compared cytokine production in two groups of patients, one receiving PCEA, the other receiving preemptive epidural analgesia continued by PCEA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Female patients hospitalized for transabdominal hysterectomy were randomly assigned to one of two pain management techniques: PCEA or preemptive epidural analgesia followed by PCEA (PA + PCEA). Postoperative pain was assessed using the visual analog scale. Blood samples were collected before, 24, 48, and 72 h following surgery. Production of the following cytokines was assessed in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells: interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, IL-1ra, IL-10, and IL-2.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients of the PA + PCEA group exhibited lower pain scores throughout the 72 h postoperatively, compared with patients of the PCEA group.

Hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) is the major nontetrahydrocannabinol component of cannabis and has been promoted as a potential treatment for a wide variety of disparate inflammatory conditions. Here, we evaluated CBD for its ability to modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro and in murine models of induced inflammation and further validated the ability of a liposomal formulation to increase bioavailability in mice and in humans. Subsequently, the therapeutic potential of both naked and liposomally encapsulated CBD was explored in a 4-week, randomized placebo-controlled, double-blinded study in a spontaneous canine model of OA. In vitro and in mouse models, CBD significantly attenuated the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α while elevating levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10. In the veterinary study, CBD significantly decreased pain and increased mobility in a dose-dependent fashion among animals with an affirmative diagnosis of OA. Liposomal CBD (20 mg/day) was as effective as the highest dose of nonliposomal CBD (50 mg/day) in improving clinical outcomes. Hematocrit, comprehensive metabolic profile, and clinical chemistry indicated no significant detrimental impact of CBD administration over the 4-week analysis period. This study supports the safety and therapeutic potential of hemp-derived CBD for relieving arthritic pain and suggests follow-up investigations in humans are warranted."

Although growing evidence supports the use of inhaled cannabis for neuropathic pain, the lack of standard inhaled dosing plays a major obstacle in cannabis becoming a \"main stream\" pharmacological treatment for neuropathic pain. The objective of this study was to explore the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, efficacy, and ease of use of a novel portable thermal-metered-dose inhaler (tMDI) for cannabis in a cohort of eight patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain and on a stable analgesic regimen including medicinal cannabis. In a single-dose, open-label study, patients inhaled a single 15.1 ± 0.1 mg dose of cannabis using the Syqe Inhaler device. Blood samples for Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-hydroxy-Δ(9)-THC were taken at baseline and up to 120 minutes. Pain intensity (0-10 VAS), adverse events, and satisfaction score were monitored following the inhalation. A uniform pharmacokinetic profile was exhibited across all participants (Δ(9)-THC plasma Cmax ± SD was 38 ± 10 ng/mL, Tmax ± SD was 3 ± 1 minutes, AUC₀→infinity ± SD was 607 ± 200 ng·min/mL). Higher plasma Cmax increase per mg Δ(9)-THC administered (12.3 ng/mL/mg THC) and lower interindividual variability of Cmax (25.3%), compared with reported alternative modes of THC delivery, were measured. A significant 45% reduction in pain intensity was noted 20 minutes post inhalation (P = .001), turning back to baseline within 90 minutes. Tolerable, lightheadedness, lasting 15-30 minutes and requiring no intervention, was the only reported adverse event. This trial suggests the potential use of the Syqe Inhaler device as a smokeless delivery system of medicinal cannabis, producing a Δ(9)-THC pharmacokinetic profile with low interindividual variation of Cmax, achieving pharmaceutical standards for inhaled drugs."

Several previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of intra-articular (IA) pethidine as a compound, which has local anesthetic and opioid agonist properties, on postoperative pain relief in arthroscopic knee surgery (AKS). This study compared the postoperative analgesic effect of pre- and post-surgical IA pethidine administration in AKS.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Seventy-five patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II undergoing AKS with general anesthesia were enrolled in this double-blind study. Patients were randomized in three equal groups to receive either 50 mg IA pethidine before surgical incision incision and saline after skin closure (PS), saline before surgical incision and pethedine after skin closure (SP), and only saline at two different times (SS). In each patient with operated knee joint, pain at rest and joint movement was evaluated at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after surgery completion using Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA)-repeated measure, t-paired, and Chi-square tests.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Postoperative pain score at rest and joint movement in PS group was significantly lower than those in other groups. The time (Mean ± SD) between completion of operation and patient's request for morphine, total morphine consumption (Mean ± SD) in postoperative 24 h, and the numbers of patients requesting analgesic in PS, SP, SS, groups were: 5.2 ± 1.3, 3.3 ± 1.5, and 2 ± 1.3 h (P < 0.05); 4.4 ± 2.4, 8.7 ± 2, and 11.6 ± 4.4 mg (P < 0.05); 11, 18, and 21 persons (P < 0.05), respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The present study shows that preemptive intra-articular pethidine 50 mg injection is more effective than preventive injection for postoperative pain relief at rest and joint movement in arthroscopic knee surgery."

In the United States, 23 states and Washington DC (May 2015) have introduced laws to permit the medical use of cannabis. Within the European Union, medicinal cannabis laws and praxis vary wildly between Countries.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      to provide evidence for benefits and harms of cannabis (including extracts and tinctures) treatment for adults in the following indications: control of spasticity and pain in patients with multiple sclerosis; control of pain in patients with chronic neuropathic pain; control of nausea and vomiting in adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EMBASE from inception to September 2016. We also searched for on-going studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal. All searches included also non-English language literature. All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the safety and efficacy of cannabis (including extracts and tinctures) compared with placebo or other pharmacological agents were included. Three authors independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of studies identified in the literature searches for their eligibility. For studies considered eligible, we retrieved full texts. Three investigators independently extracted data. For the assessment of the quality of evidence, we used the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and GRADE working Group.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      41 trials (4,550 participants) were included; 15 studies considered efficacy and safety of cannabis for patients with multiple sclerosis, 12 for patients with chronic pain, and 14 for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The included studies were published between 1975 and 2015, and the majority of them were conducted in Europe. We judged almost 50% of these studies to be at low risk of bias. The large majority (80%) of the comparisons were with placebo; only 8 studies included patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy comparing cannabis with other antiemetic drugs. Concerning the efficacy of cannabis (compared with placebo) in patients with multiple sclerosis, confidence in the estimate was high in favour of cannabis for spasticity (numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale, but not the Ashworth scale) and pain. For chronic and neuropathic pain (compared with placebo), there was evidence of a small effect; however, confidence in the estimate is low and these results could not be considered conclusive. There is uncertainty whether cannabis, including extracts and tinctures, compared with placebo or other antiemetic drugs reduces nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer requiring chemotherapy, although the confidence in the estimate of the effect was low or very low. In the included studies, many adverse events were reported and none of the studies assessed the development of abuse or dependence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      there is incomplete evidence of the efficacy and safety of medical use of cannabis in the clinical contexts considered in this review. Furthermore, for many of the outcomes considered, the confidence in the estimate of the effect was again low or very low. To give conclusive answers to the efficacy and safety of cannabis used for medical purposes in the clinical contexts considered, further studies are needed, with higher quality, larger sample sizes, and possibly using the same diagnostic tools for evaluating outcomes of interest."

            "title": "Drug Discovery and Development for Pain.",
            "abstract": "Two decades ago, systemic drugs indicated for pain belonged roughly to three mechanistic classes: the opioids, the nonselective NSAIDs, and the anticonvulsants, the latter class represented by a single member, carbamazepine. As of this writing, there are approximately 10 classes of drugs approved for use in the management of pain in the United States and Canada. Recent additions to the pharmacopoeia for pain exemplify two significantly differing pathways for bringing new pain therapies to market.\n    \n\n      \n      On the one hand, there are drugs that have been in clinical use for some time for other indications, which have been shown to have analgesic efficacy and subsequently have obtained additional label indications for the treatment of pain. Examples in this category include the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (launched as an antihypertensive in 1966; gained approval for epidural use in the treatment of cancer pain 1996), and the anticonvulsant gabapentin (launched as an anticonvulsant 1994; gained approval for neuropathic pain in 2002). A number of additional marketed drugs have repeatedly demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in pain states in controlled studies but lack specific label approval for this indication. For example, randomized, controlled studies have demonstrated the utility of older tricyclic antidepressants including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine in chronic pain states; due to the preponderance of supportive evidence these drugs are considered useful pain therapeutics.\n    \n\n      \n      Ongoing advances in the understanding of pain mechanisms continue to reveal opportunities for the creative use of drugs of known pharmacology. In addition, many older, marketed drugs reveal a surprising richness of pharmacology when studied using new methods. Due to their potential for benefit, and also due in no small part to the lengthy and complex process required for the development and regulatory approval of novel drugs, there are many obvious advantages to the study of approved medications for the treatment of pain. The ability to conduct clinical trials with a substance that is already approved for use in humans provides for immediate testing of a hypothesis. Furthermore, since approved drugs have by definition already amassed the requisite preclinical and clinical safety data, positive results from such trials lead to a much shorter path to new regulatory approval, and thus the considerable costs of years of study involved in novel compound discovery and development are avoided.\n    \n\n      \n      There are, however, limitations to this approach. Existing drugs may not have the ideal pharmacological or pharmacokinetic properties required. In addition, while the cost outlay of repurposing approved drugs is far less than that of inventing new ones, the retur on investment may be poor. Market protection for drugs with older patents may be limited, and from a purely business standpoint, cost analyses of investing in new research for such older drugs may be unfavorable. In addition, as safety regulation becomes more stringent, pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to assume safety liabilities of drugs that were originally approved under less rigorous requirements.\n    \n\n      \n      On the other hand, recent advances in research have resulted in the development of entirely novel classes of drugs, specifically developed as analgesics and brought forward with pain as an initial indication. These include COX2-selective inhibitors (celecoxib launched 1999 for pain and inflammation), the N-type calcium channel inhibitor ziconotide (launched 2005), the triptan class of serotonin receptor subtype 1B/D agonists (sumatriptan launched early 1990s), and newer cannabinoids such as Sativex, launched in Canada 2005 for the treatment of pain and spasticity due to multiple sclerosis.\n    \n\n      \n      Because of the lengthy and complex evaluation required to bring a compound to market, the failure rate of new compounds is extremely high, as are the costs of development. The current estimate of the expenditure required to bring a new compound to market hovers near US $1 billion., Hundreds of thousands of compounds may be screened in order to identify one or two compounds that are considered suitable clinical candidates. Industry estimates are that these clinical candidates have about a 90% chance of failure during the most costly stage of evaluation, clinical trials. In general, across therapeutic areas, reasons for failure include disappointing pharmacokinetic properties in humans, unacceptable clinical safety profiles, and lack of clinical efficacy. Compounds may also fail to reach the marketplace due to other advances in the therapeutic field (for example, the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors supplanting the tricyclic antidepressants) or commercial reasons, such as the inability of a company to support an orphan drug program. Nevertheless, drug discovery for pain is an exciting, fast-paced, and rewarding field. Both the investigation of the analgesic effects of marketed drugs and the pioneering of novel drug classes are active areas of research and development: a survey of industry pipeline databases reveals more than 25 different mechanistic classes of compounds in various stages of evaluation."

Tizanidine appears to be no more effective than comparator drugs such as baclofen and has a slightly different side-effects profile. Despite claims that it causes less muscle weakness, there was very little evidence that tizanidine performed any better in this respect than other drugs, although it is more expensive. The findings of this review are consistent with reviews of the same treatments for spasticity derived from other aetiologies. There is good evidence that both botulinum toxin (BT) and intrathecal baclofen are effective in reducing spasticity, and both are associated with functional benefit. However, they are invasive, and substantially more expensive. None of the studies included in the review of pain were designed specifically to evaluate the alleviation of pain in patients with MS and there was no consistency regarding the use of validated outcome measures. It was suggested that, although expensive, the use of intrathecal baclofen may be associated with significant savings in hospitalisation costs in relation to bed-bound patients who are at risk of developing pressure sores, thus enhancing its cost-effectiveness. No studies of cost-effectiveness were identified in the review of pain. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, tizanidine, intrathecal baclofen and BT and of the potential cost-effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in the treatment of spasticity in MS.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Many of the interventions identified are not licensed for the alleviation of pain or spasticity in MS and the lack of evidence relating to their effectiveness may also limit their widespread use. Indeed, forthcoming information relating to the use of cannabinoids in MS may result in there being better evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments than of any of the currently used drugs. It may therefore be of value to carry out double-blind randomised controlled trials of interventions used in current practice, where outcomes could include functional benefit and impact on quality of life. Further research into the development and validation of outcomes measures for pain and spasticity may also be useful, as perhaps would cost-utility studies."

            "abstract": "The South African (SA) Constitutional Court recently decriminalised the private cultivation, possession and use of cannabis by adults. Cannabis contains varying amounts of the cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), depending on various cultivation factors. No commercial plant-derived cannabis products are currently registered by the SA Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) for medical use. Such products are therefore unregulated, but are freely available in SA, and may be of inadequate quality and unverified composition, and not guaranteed to be safe or effective. SAHPRA has to date approved only one synthetic medical cannabis product, dronabinol. Evidence supporting benefit from medical cannabis exists for two drug-resistant childhood forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Adjuvant therapy with medical cannabis can reduce seizure frequency for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome by 18.8% and 22.8%, respectively, and may be beneficial for other rare forms of epilepsy. There is moderate evidence for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting with the synthetic cannabinoids. Multiple sclerosis-associated spasticity showed a small clinical improvement in self-reported spasticity when a purified form of THC/CBD was added to existing therapy. Currently, low-level or no convincing evidence exists for the use of medical cannabis for chronic pain, sleep and weight disorders, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Cannabis is associated with a greater risk of adverse effects than active and placebo controls, and may be involved in clinically significant drug-drug interactions. The evolving regulatory and legal landscape on the use of medical cannabis will guide prescription and recreational use in the coming years."

Methods: Single-dose pharmacokinetics was performed using two different doses of CBD enriched (2 and 8 mg/kg) oil. Thereafter, a randomized placebo-controlled, veterinarian, and owner blinded, cross-over study was conducted. Dogs received each of two treatments: CBD oil (2 mg/kg) or placebo oil every 12 h. Each treatment lasted for 4 weeks with a 2-week washout period. Baseline veterinary assessment and owner questionnaires were completed before initiating each treatment and at weeks 2 and 4. Hematology, serum chemistry and physical examinations were performed at each visit. A mixed model analysis, analyzing the change from enrollment baseline for all other time points was utilized for all variables of interest, with a p ≤ 0.05 defined as significant. Results: Pharmacokinetics revealed an elimination half-life of 4.2 h at both doses and no observable side effects. Clinically, canine brief pain inventory and Hudson activity scores showed a significant decrease in pain and increase in activity (p < 0.01) with CBD oil. Veterinary assessment showed decreased pain during CBD treatment (p < 0.02). No side effects were reported by owners, however, serum chemistry showed an increase in alkaline phosphatase during CBD treatment (p < 0.01). Clinical significance: This pharmacokinetic and clinical study suggests that 2 mg/kg of CBD twice daily can help increase comfort and activity in dogs with OA."

Many disease-ameliorating effects of cannabinoids-endocannabinoids are receptor mediated, but many are not, indicating non-CBR signaling pathways. Cannabinoids-endocannabinoids are anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, anti-metastatic and pro-apoptotic in most cancers, in vitro and in vivo in animals. They signal through p38, MAPK, JUN, PI3, AKT, ceramide, caspases, MMPs, PPARs, VEGF, NF-κB, p8, CHOP, TRB3 and pro-apoptotic oncogenes (p53,p21 waf1/cip1) to induce cell cycle arrest, autophagy, apoptosis and tumour inhibition. Paradoxically they are pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic in some cancers. Differences in receptor expression and concentrations of cannabinoids in cancer and immune cells can elicit anti- or pro-cancer effects through different signal cascades (p38MAPK or PI3/AKT). Similarities between effects of cannabinoids-endocannabinoids, omega-3 LCPUFA and CLAs/CLnAs as anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, anti-invasive anti-cancer agents indicate common signaling pathways. Evidence in vivo and in vitro shows EPA and DHA can form endocannabinoids that: (i) are ligands for CB(½) receptors and possibly TRPV-1, (ii) have non-receptor mediated bioactivity, (iii) induce cell cycle arrest, (iii) increase autophagy and apoptosis, and (iv) augment chemotherapeutic actions in vitro. They can also form bioactive, eicosanoid-like products that appear to be non-CBR ligands but have effects on PPARs and NF-kB transcription factors. The use of cannabinoids in cancer treatment is currently limited to chemo- and radio-therapy-associated nausea and cancer-associated pain apart from one trial on brain tumours in patients. Further clinical studies are urgently required to determine the true potential of these intriguing, low toxicity compounds in cancer therapy. Particularly in view of their synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic agents similar to that observed for n-3 LCPUFA."

Due to the relatively unsuccessful treatments, we designed β-D-mannuronic (M2000) with the beneficial effects in various experimental models as a novel non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The aims of our present study were: first, to compare the therapeutic effects of M2000, as a novel designed NSAID, with naproxen and placebo in Iranian patients with AS during 12 weeks; second, to evaluate the effect of M2000 on gene expression of cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-1/COX-2), a key enzyme in the initiation of inflammatory pathways in AS patients; and third, to assess the activity of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the presence/absence of M2000 at the different doses in the murine macrophage, J774 cell line. This was a sub-study of phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with three treatment arms: M2000, naproxen, and placebo. The outcome measures were the mean changes from baseline to week 12. The gene expression was assessed by real-time PCR. The COX-1 and COX-2 activities were evaluated by ELISA in J774 cell line induced by LPS and arachidonic acid (AA). Our findings demonstrated that M2000 had beneficial therapeutic effects on pain, stiffness, and inflammation, whereas no adverse effects were observed following the use of M2000 after 12 weeks. The analysis of gene expression showed that M2000 could effectively reduce the expression levels of COX-1 and COX-2 in comparison with untreated patients. In addition, the enzymatic activities in the presence of M2000 were significantly less than LPS- and AA-treated groups. Our results indicate that M2000, as a novel designed NSAID with immunosuppressive properties, can be considered as one of the therapeutic options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases without adverse events.

During the in-patient phases, participants took oral THC capsules (0, 10 mg) five times/day, 1 h prior to smoking marijuana (0.00, 3.04% THC). Active and placebo marijuana were smoked on in-patient days 1-8, while only placebo marijuana was smoked on days 9-14, that is, marijuana abstinence. Placebo THC was administered each day, except during one of the abstinence phases (days 9-14), when active THC was given. Mood, psychomotor task performance, food intake, and sleep were measured. Oral THC administered during marijuana abstinence decreased ratings of 'anxious', 'miserable', 'trouble sleeping', 'chills', and marijuana craving, and reversed large decreases in food intake as compared to placebo, while producing no intoxication. Study 2 was a 58-day, outpatient/in-patient design. Participants were maintained on each divalproex dose (0, 1500 mg/day) for 29 days each. Each maintenance condition began with a 14-day outpatient phase for medication induction or clearance and continued with a 15-day in-patient phase. Divalproex decreased marijuana craving during abstinence, yet increased ratings of 'anxious', 'irritable', 'bad effect', and 'tired.' Divalproex worsened performance on psychomotor tasks, and increased food intake regardless of marijuana condition. Thus, oral THC decreased marijuana craving and withdrawal symptoms at a dose that was subjectively indistinguishable from placebo. Divalproex worsened mood and cognitive performance during marijuana abstinence. These data suggest that oral THC, but not divalproex, may be useful in the treatment of marijuana dependence."

            "abstract": "Although cannabis has been known for ages as an \"alternative medicine\" to provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety, and inflammation, there had always been a limited scientific review to prove and establish its use in clinics. Early studies carried out by Carlini's group in Brazil suggested that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid present in Cannabis sativa, has anticonvulsant properties in animal models and reduced seizure frequency in limited human trials. Over the past few years, the potential use of cannabis extract in refractory epilepsy, including childhood epilepsies such as Dravet's syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, has opened a new era of treating epileptic patients. Thus, a considerable number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have provided strong evidence that phytocannabinoids has anticonvulsant properties, as well as being promising in the treatment of different neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, neurodegenerative disorders and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given the advances of cannabinoids, especially CBD, in the treatment of epilepsy, would the same expectation regarding the treatment of other neuropsychiatric disorders be possible? The present review highlights some contributions from Brazilian researchers and other studies reported elsewhere on the history, pre-clinical and clinical data underlying the use of cannabinoids for the already widespread treatment of refractory epilepsies and the possibility of use in the treatment of some neuropsychiatric disorders."

The further development of medicinal cannabinoids has been challenged with problems. These include the psychoactivity of cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonists and the lack of availability of highly selective cannabinoid receptor full agonists (for the CB1 or CB2 receptor), as well as problems of pharmacokinetics. Global activation of cannabinoid receptors is usually undesirable, and so enhancement of local endocannabinoid receptor activity with indirect cannabimimetics is an attractive strategy for therapeutic modulation of the endocannabinoid system. However, existing drugs of this type tend to be metabolized by the same enzymes as their target endocannabinoids and are not yet available in a form that is clinically useful. A potential solution to these problems may now have been suggested by the discovery that paracetamol (acetaminophen) exerts its analgesic (and probably anti-pyretic) effects by its degradation into an anandamide (an endocannabinoid) reuptake inhibitor (AM404) within the body, thus classifying it as pro-drug for an indirect cannabimimetic. Given the proven efficacy and safety of paracetamol, the challenge now is to develop related drugs, or entirely different substrates, into pro-drug indirect cannabimimetics with a similar safety profile to paracetamol but at high effective dose titrations."

Patients with chronic pain have reported using smoked cannabis to relieve pain, improve sleep and improve mood.\n## METHODS\nAdults with post-traumatic or postsurgical neuropathic pain were randomly assigned to receive cannabis at four potencies (0%, 2.5%, 6% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol) over four 14-day periods in a crossover trial. Participants inhaled a single 25-mg dose through a pipe three times daily for the first five days in each cycle, followed by a nine-day washout period. Daily average pain intensity was measured using an 11-point numeric rating scale. We recorded effects on mood, sleep and quality of life, as well as adverse events.\n## RESULTS\nWe recruited 23 participants (mean age 45.4 [standard deviation 12.3] years, 12 women [52%]), of whom 21 completed the trial. The average daily pain intensity, measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale, was lower on the prespecified primary contrast of 9.4% v. 0% tetrahydrocannabinol (5.4 v. 6.1, respectively; difference = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-1.4). Preparations with intermediate potency yielded intermediate but nonsignificant degrees of relief. Participants receiving 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol reported improved ability to fall asleep (easier, p = 0.001; faster, p < 0.001; more drowsy, p = 0.003) and improved quality of sleep (less wakefulness, p = 0.01) relative to 0% tetrahydrocannabinol. We found no differences in mood or quality of life. The most common drug-related adverse events during the period when participants received 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol were headache, dry eyes, burning sensation in areas of neuropathic pain, dizziness, numbness and cough.\n## CONCLUSION\nA single inhalation of 25 mg of 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol herbal cannabis three times daily for five days reduced the intensity of pain, improved sleep and was well tolerated.

Cannabinoid(1) (CB(1)) receptors play an important role in nociception and aversion. However, their role in fear-conditioned analgesia has not been investigated. This study investigated the effects of systemic administration of the CB(1) receptor antagonist, SR141716A (1 mg/kg, i.p.), on fear-conditioned analgesia and conditioned aversion in rats. Twenty-four hours after receiving footshock, rats exhibited reduced formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour, increased freezing and increased defecation when tested in the footshock apparatus, compared with non-footshocked formalin-injected rats. SR141716A attenuated fear-conditioned analgesia, freezing and defecation. Importantly, SR141716A had no effect on formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour over an equivalent time period in rats not receiving footshock. SR141716A had no effect on contextually induced freezing during the first half of the test trial in rats receiving intra-plantar injection of saline. Administration of SR1417176A did, however, attenuate short-term extinction of contextually induced freezing and ultrasound emission in rats receiving intra-plantar saline, compared with vehicle-treated saline controls. These data suggest an important role for the CB(1) receptor in mediating fear-conditioned analgesia and provide evidence for differential modulation of conditioned aversive behaviour by CB(1) receptors during tonic, persistent pain."

In addition, many drugs that are used for NP cause adverse reactions. Luteolin is a naturally occurring flavonoid with diverse pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticancer. We sought to investigate luteolin effects on chronic, acute and neuropathic pain as well as its potential to increase morphine anti-nociceptive effects in mice. Methods Albino mice (20-25 g) were randomly divided into 14 groups (n=7) including morphine 1 mg/kg body weight +luteolin (5 mg/kg body weight), morphine (9 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), luteolin (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight), imipramine 40 mg/kg body weight and normal saline (NS) (0.9 %) as vehicle and subjected to hot plate test. Formalin test was done in the following groups: NS, diclofenac sodium (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), morphine (9 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) and luteolin (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight). Results Administration of luteolin single dose (5 and 10 mg/kg body weight) significantly reduced neuropathic pain ( p<0.05$\\rm{p}<0.05$) in comparison to negative control. Anti-nociceptive effects of luteolin were comparable to imipramine as the standard positive control ( p<0.001$\\rm{p}<0.001$).

Current symptomatic therapies for multiple sclerosis are in some cases ineffective and may have a high risk of serious side effects. This has led some multiple sclerosis patients to self-medicate with cannabis, which anecdotal evidence suggests may be beneficial in controlling symptoms such as spasticity, pain, tremor and bladder dysfunction. In support of these claims, results from experimental studies have suggested that cannabinoid-based treatments may be beneficial in a wide number of diseases. Furthermore, recent research in animal models of multiple sclerosis has demonstrated the efficacy of cannabinoids in controlling disease-induced symptoms such as spasticity and tremor, as well as in ameliorating the severity of clinical disease. However, these initially promising results have not yet been fully translated into the clinic. Although cannabinoid treatment of multiple sclerosis symptoms has been shown to be both well tolerated and effective in a number of subjective tests in several small-scale clinical trials, objective measures demonstrating the efficacy of cannabinoids are still lacking. Currently, a number of large-scale phase III clinical trials are under way to further elucidate the use of cannabinoids in the symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis. This review highlights the recent advances in our understanding of the endocannabinoid system, discusses both the experimental and clinical evidence for the use of cannabinoids to treat multiple sclerosis and explores possible future strategies of cannabinoid therapy in multiple sclerosis."

Cannabinoids seem to work no better than placebo for visceral pain and conferred only modest analgesic effect in cancer pain. Cannabinoids do many good things - they appear to be effective in treating certain types of pain without the issues of tolerance associated with opioids. Negatively, marijuana currently has a very murky legal status all over the world - laws regulating its use are inconsistent and in flux. Thus, both patients and prescribers may be unsure about whether or not it is an appropriate form of pain control. Cannabinoid-based analgesia has been linked to potential memory deficits and cognitive impairment. A great deal more remains to be elucidated about cannabinoids which may emerge to play an important role in the treatment of neuropathic and possibly other painful conditions. There remains a great deal more to learn about the role of cannabinoids in pain management."

            "title": "Therapeutic Efficacy of Cannabidiol (CBD): A Review of the Evidence from Clinical Trials and Human Laboratory Studies.",
            "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Global policy changes have increased access to products containing cannabidiol (CBD), a primary constituent of hemp and cannabis. The CBD product industry has experienced tremendous growth, in part, because CBD is widely touted as an effective therapeutic for myriad health conditions. However, only 1 CBD product (Epidiolex®) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to date. There is substantial interest among consumers and the medical and scientific communities regarding the therapeutic potential of CBD, including for novel indications that are not recognized by the FDA. The purpose of this review was to synthesize available evidence from clinical research regarding the efficacy of CBD as a therapeutic.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Human laboratory studies and clinical trials (e.g., randomized controlled trials and single-arm, open label trials) evaluating the efficacy of CBD as a therapeutic were identified for various medical conditions, including epilepsy, anxiety, pain/inflammation, schizophrenia, various substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and others. There is clear evidence supporting the utility of CBD to treat epilepsy. For other health conditions reviewed, evidence was often mixed and/or there was a general lack of well-powered randomized, placebo-controlled studies to draw definitive conclusions.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Rigorous, controlled evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of CBD is lacking for many health conditions. Possible concerns with the use of CBD as a therapeutic include the potential for adverse effects (e.g., liver toxicity), drug-drug interactions, and lack of sufficient regulatory oversight of retail CBD products."

            "abstract": "Rationale:\n        \n      \n      Interest persists in characterizing potential interactions between Delta(9)-tetrahydocannabinol (THC) and other marijuana constituents such as cannabidiol (CBD). Such interactions may have important implications for understanding the long-term health consequences of chronic marijuana use as well as for attempts to develop therapeutic uses for THC and other CB(1) agonists.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      We investigated whether CBD may modulate the pharmacological effects of intravenously administered THC or inhaled marijuana smoke on hypoactivity, antinociception, catalepsy, and hypothermia, the well characterized models of cannabinoid activity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Intravenously administered CBD possessed very little activity on its own and, at a dose equal to a maximally effective dose of THC (3 mg/kg), failed to alter THC's effects on any measure. However, higher doses of CBD (ED(50)=7.4 mg/kg) dose-dependently potentiated the antinociceptive effects of a low dose of THC (0.3 mg/kg). Pretreatment with 30 mg/kg CBD, but not 3 mg/kg, significantly elevated THC blood and brain levels. No interactions between THC and CBD were observed in several variations of a marijuana smoke exposure model. Either quantities of CBD were applied directly to marijuana, CBD and THC were both applied to placebo plant material, or mice were pretreated intravenously with 30 mg/kg CBD before being exposed to marijuana smoke.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      As the amount of CBD found in most marijuana strains in the US is considerably less than that of THC, these results suggest that CBD concentrations relevant to what is normally found in marijuana exert very little, if any, modulatory effects on CB(1)-receptor-mediated pharmacological effects of marijuana smoke."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      This review is one of a series on drugs used to treat chronic neuropathic pain. Estimates of the population prevalence of chronic pain with neuropathic components range between 6% and 10%. Current pharmacological treatment options for neuropathic pain afford substantial benefit for only a few people, often with adverse effects that outweigh the benefits. There is a need to explore other treatment options, with different mechanisms of action for treatment of conditions with chronic neuropathic pain. Cannabis has been used for millennia to reduce pain. Herbal cannabis is currently strongly promoted by some patients and their advocates to treat any type of chronic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of cannabis-based medicines (herbal, plant-derived, synthetic) compared to placebo or conventional drugs for conditions with chronic neuropathic pain in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      In November 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registries for published and ongoing trials, and examined the reference lists of reviewed articles.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We selected randomised, double-blind controlled trials of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based medicines against placebo or any other active treatment of conditions with chronic neuropathic pain in adults, with a treatment duration of at least two weeks and at least 10 participants per treatment arm.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Three review authors independently extracted data of study characteristics and outcomes of efficacy, tolerability and safety, examined issues of study quality, and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. For efficacy, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for pain relief of 30% and 50% or greater, patient's global impression to be much or very much improved, dropout rates due to lack of efficacy, and the standardised mean differences for pain intensity, sleep problems, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychological distress. For tolerability, we calculated number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) for withdrawal due to adverse events and specific adverse events, nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders. For safety, we calculated NNTH for serious adverse events. Meta-analysis was undertaken using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 16 studies with 1750 participants. The studies were 2 to 26 weeks long and compared an oromucosal spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) (10 studies), a synthetic cannabinoid mimicking THC (nabilone) (two studies), inhaled herbal cannabis (two studies) and plant-derived THC (dronabinol) (two studies) against placebo (15 studies) and an analgesic (dihydrocodeine) (one study). We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study quality. We defined studies with zero to two unclear or high risks of bias judgements to be high-quality studies, with three to five unclear or high risks of bias to be moderate-quality studies, and with six to eight unclear or high risks of bias to be low-quality studies. Study quality was low in two studies, moderate in 12 studies and high in two studies. Nine studies were at high risk of bias for study size. We rated the quality of the evidence according to GRADE as very low to moderate.Primary outcomesCannabis-based medicines may increase the number of people achieving 50% or greater pain relief compared with placebo (21% versus 17%; risk difference (RD) 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.09); NNTB 20 (95% CI 11 to 100); 1001 participants, eight studies, low-quality evidence). We rated the evidence for improvement in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) with cannabis to be of very low quality (26% versus 21%;RD 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.17); NNTB 11 (95% CI 6 to 100); 1092 participants, six studies). More participants withdrew from the studies due to adverse events with cannabis-based medicines (10% of participants) than with placebo (5% of participants) (RD 0.04 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07); NNTH 25 (95% CI 16 to 50); 1848 participants, 13 studies, moderate-quality evidence). We did not have enough evidence to determine if cannabis-based medicines increase the frequency of serious adverse events compared with placebo (RD 0.01 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.03); 1876 participants, 13 studies, low-quality evidence).Secondary outcomesCannabis-based medicines probably increase the number of people achieving pain relief of 30% or greater compared with placebo (39% versus 33%; RD 0.09 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.15); NNTB 11 (95% CI 7 to 33); 1586 participants, 10 studies, moderate quality evidence). Cannabis-based medicines may increase nervous system adverse events compared with placebo (61% versus 29%; RD 0.38 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.58); NNTH 3 (95% CI 2 to 6); 1304 participants, nine studies, low-quality evidence). Psychiatric disorders occurred in 17% of participants using cannabis-based medicines and in 5% using placebo (RD 0.10 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15); NNTH 10 (95% CI 7 to 16); 1314 participants, nine studies, low-quality evidence).We found no information about long-term risks in the studies analysed.Subgroup analysesWe are uncertain whether herbal cannabis reduces mean pain intensity (very low-quality evidence). Herbal cannabis and placebo did not differ in tolerability (very low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The potential benefits of cannabis-based medicine (herbal cannabis, plant-derived or synthetic THC, THC/CBD oromucosal spray) in chronic neuropathic pain might be outweighed by their potential harms. The quality of evidence for pain relief outcomes reflects the exclusion of participants with a history of substance abuse and other significant comorbidities from the studies, together with their small sample sizes."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoids, when co-administered with opioids, may enable reduced opioid doses without loss of analgesic efficacy (ie, an opioid-sparing effect). The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the opioid-sparing potential of cannabinoids. Eligible studies included pre-clinical and clinical studies for which the outcome was either analgesia or opioid dose requirements. Clinical studies included controlled studies and case series. We searched Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, and Embase. Nineteen pre-clinical and nine clinical studies met the search criteria. Seventeen of the 19 pre-clinical studies provided evidence of synergistic effects from opioid and cannabinoid co-administration. Our meta-analysis of pre-clinical studies indicated that the median effective dose (ED50) of morphine administered in combination with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) is 3.6 times lower (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95, 6.76; n=6) than the ED50 of morphine alone. In addition, the ED50 for codeine administered in combination with delta-9-THC was 9.5 times lower (95% CI 1.6, 57.5, n=2) than the ED50 of codeine alone. One case series (n=3) provided very-low-quality evidence of a reduction in opioid requirements with cannabinoid co-administration. Larger controlled clinical studies showed some clinical benefits of cannabinoids; however, opioid dose changes were rarely reported and mixed findings were observed for analgesia. In summary, pre-clinical studies provide robust evidence of the opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids, whereas one of the nine clinical studies identified provided very-low-quality evidence of such an effect. Prospective high-quality-controlled clinical trials are required to determine the opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids."

These lesions are classified as cystic lymphatic malformation (macrocystic, microcystic or mixed), generalized lymphatic anomaly, and Gorham-Stout disease. LAs occur mainly in childhood, and present with various symptoms including chronic airway problems, recurrent infection, and organ disorders. Individuals with LAs often experience progressively worsening symptoms with a deteriorating quality of life. Although limited treatment options are available, their efficacy has not been validated in prospective clinical trials, and are usually based on case reports. Thus, there are no validated standards of care for these patients because of the lack of prospective clinical trials.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This open-label, single-arm, multicenter, prospective study will assess the efficacy and safety of a mammalian target of the rapamycin inhibitor sirolimus in the treatment of intractable LAs.

The primary endpoint is the response rate of radiological volumetric change of the target lesion confirmed by central review at 52 weeks after treatment. The secondary endpoints are the response rates at 12 and 24 weeks, respiratory function, pleural effusion, ascites, blood coagulation parameters, bleeding, pain, quality of life, activities of daily living, adverse events, side effects, laboratory examinations, vital signs, and pharmacokinetic data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      This is among the first multicenter studies to evaluate sirolimus treatment for intractable LAs, and few studies to date have focused on the standard assessment of the efficacy for LAs treatment.

All surgeries were performed by one surgeon. Postoperative changes in hemoglobin, the blood transfusion rate, changes in creatinine levels, operation time, analgesic need, hospitalization time, and complication rate were compared between the groups. No significant differences were observed in age, gender, stone size, and surgery side between the groups (P<0.05). The operation time was significantly lower in the totally tubeless PCNL group than in the standard PCNL group (P=0.005). Pethidine requirements were significantly higher in the standard PCNL group than the totally tubeless PCNL group (P=0.007). Hospitalization time was significantly higher in the standard PCNL group than in the totally tubeless PCNL group (P<0.0001). The complication rate was 15% in the standard PCNL group and 9.1% in the totally tubeless PCNL group (P=0.73). The totally tubeless PCNL technique is safe and effective, even for patients with staghorn stones. This technique is associated with decreased pain, analgesic needs, and operative and hospitalization time. We believe that a normal peristaltic ureter is the best drainage tube."

            "abstract": "In the recent years, prolotherapy is increasingly being used in the field of musculoskeletal medicine. However, few studies have investigated its effectiveness in plantar fasciitis (PF). The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided dextrose prolotherapy with radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in the treatment of chronic PF. This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 59 patients with chronic PF. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups receiving three sessions of radial ESWT (29 patients) vs. two sessions of ultrasound-guided intrafascial 2 cc dextrose 20% injection (30 patients). The following outcome measures were assessed before and then six weeks and 12 weeks after the treatments: pain intensity by visual analog scale (VAS), daily life and exercise activities by Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), and the plantar fascia thickness by ultrasonographic imaging. The VAS and FAAM scales showed significant improvements of pain and function in both study groups 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the treatments. A significant reduction was noted for plantar fascia thickness at these intervals (all p < .05). The inter-group comparison revealed that except for the FAAM-sport subscale which favored ESWT, the interaction effects of group and time were not significant for other outcome measures. Dextrose prolotherapy has comparable efficacy to radial ESWT in reducing pain, daily-life functional limitation, and plantar fascia thickness in patients with PF. No serious adverse effects were observed in either group. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, randomized controlled trial."

However, there are many adverse events due to L-asparaginase, including acute pancreatitis. The pathology of L-asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) remains unclear. We compared patients who developed AAP (n=29) and random matched controls (n=36) who had been enrolled in the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study of the ALL-02 protocol. AAP and control patients were matched for age, sex, treatment, and protocol risk. We examined correlations between AAP development and clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and concomitant medication. Abdominal pain and nausea were common presenting symptoms for AAP. There was an increased risk of AAP in patients using gastric acid-suppressing agents and antithrombin (AT) supplementation. Mean fibrinogen and AT levels before the onset of AAP were lower in AAP patients than in controls. Decreased AT and fibrinogen levels resulting from the strong suppression of protein synthesis by L-asparaginase were predictive signs for AAP. Our epidemiological approach should prove clinically useful for the diagnosis the AAP as early as possible."

Increasing creatinine values in patients treated with hydroxyethyl starch have been described in some case reports. These have also been some clinical signs such as pain in the renal region, and swelling of kidney parenchyma, but no differential and sensitive parameters of renal function have supported these possible side effects of hydroxyethyl starch. Twenty-five patients were randomly allocated to a control and a treatment group. In the treatment group, patients received 12 ml per kg body-weight hydroxyethyl starch 10% (200/0.5) daily. A non-invasive diagnostic spectrum of renal function was performed. Specific tubular proteins (alpha 1-microglobulin, Tamm-Horsfall protein), glomerular parameters (immunoglobulin G, albumin), and the brush border enzyme acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, were examined. Additionally, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, Apache-II-score, breathing therapy, infusions, transfusion, and all medical interventions were documented. Both groups were comparable with regard to drug therapy. Apache-II-score, and fluid management. There were differences in tubular function between the two groups. Patients undergoing HES therapy showed increased excretion of alpha 1-microglobulin. Tamm-Horsfall-protein and of brush border enzyme acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. No significant differences were detectable in glomerular functions (glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow), albumin, and IgG. Correlates of tubular damage after hydroxyethyl starch therapy were seen in intensive care patients. Many influences of intensive therapy act on renal function, and further studies with larger cohorts are necessary. With regard to the documented localisation of the tubular damage in the HES group, colloid therapy with hydroxyethyl starch in renal dysfunction should be monitored carefully by means of sensitive markers."

            "abstract": "Evidence on the use and efficacy of medical cannabis for children is limited. We examined clinical and epidemiological characteristics of medical cannabis treatment and caregiver-reported effects in children and adolescents in Switzerland. We collected clinical data from children and adolescents (< 18 years) who received Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), or a combination of the two between 2008 and 2019 in Switzerland. Out of 205 contacted families, 90 agreed to participate. The median age at the first prescription was 11.5 years (interquartile range (IQR) 6-16), and 32 patients were female (36%). Fifty-one (57%) patients received CBD only and 39 (43%) THC. Patients were more likely to receive THC therapy if one of the following symptoms or signs were present: spasticity, pain, lack of weight gain, vomiting, or nausea, whereas seizures were the dominant indication for CBD therapy. Improvements were reported in 59 (66%) study participants. The largest treatment effects were reported for pain, spasticity, and frequency of seizures in participants treated with THC, and for those treated with pure CBD, the frequency of seizures. However, 43% of caregivers reported treatment interruptions, mainly because of lack of improvement (56%), side effects (46%), the need for a gastric tube (44%), and cost considerations (23%).Conclusions: The effects of medical cannabis in children and adolescents with chronic conditions are unknown except for rare seizure disorders, but the caregiver-reported data analysed here may justify trials of medical cannabis with standardized concentrations of THC or CBD to assess its efficacy in the young. What is Known: • The use of medical cannabis (THC and CBD) to treat a variety of diseases among children and adolescents is increasing. • In contrast to adults, there is no evidence to support the use of medical cannabis to treat chronic pain and spasticity in children, but substantial evidence to support the use of CBD in children with rare seizure disorders. What is New: • This study provides important insights into prescription practices, dosages, and treatment outcomes in children and adolescents using medical cannabis data from a real-life setting. • The effects of medical cannabis in children and adolescents with chronic conditions shown in our study support trials of medical cannabis for chronic conditions."

            "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms, including pain, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, and depression to name a few, are increasingly recognized and often just as disabling at motor symptoms. The mainstay of treatment is dopamine replacement; however, the beneficial effects tend to wane over time with disease progression, and patients often experience motor fluctuations and medication side effects. The lack of a disease-modifying intervention and the shortcomings of traditional symptomatic medications have led many patients to pursue complementary therapies to alleviate motor and non-motor symptoms associated with PD. The term complementary implies that the therapy is used along with conventional medicine and may include supplements, manipulative treatments (chiropractic, massage), exercise-based programs, and mind-body practices. As these practices become more widespread in Western medicine, there is a growing interest in evaluating their effects on a number of medical conditions, PD included. In this review, we provide an update on clinical trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of complementary treatments for patients with PD, specifically focusing on acupuncture, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, yoga, and cannabis."

            "abstract": "Although extracts from the cannabis plant have been used medicinally for thousands of years, it is only within the last 2 decades that our understanding of cannabinoid physiology and the provision of evidence for therapeutic benefit of cannabinoids has begun to accumulate. This review provides a background to advances in our understanding of cannabinoid receptors and the endocannabinoid system, and then considers how cannabinoids may help in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). The relative paucity of treatments for MS-related symptoms has led to experimentation by patients with MS in a number of areas including the use of cannabis extracts. An increasing amount of evidence is now emerging to confirm anecdotal reports of symptomatic improvement, particularly for muscle stiffness and spasms, neuropathic pain and sleep and bladder disturbance, in patients with MS treated with cannabinoids. Trials evaluating a role in treating other symptoms such as tremor and nystagmus have not demonstrated any beneficial effects of cannabinoids. Safety profiles of cannabinoids seem acceptable, although a slow prolonged period of titration improves tolerability. No serious safety concerns have emerged. Methodological issues in trial design and treatment delivery are now being addressed. In addition, recent experimental evidence is beginning to suggest an effect of cannabinoids on more fundamental processes important in MS, with evidence of anti-inflammation, encouragement of remyelination and neuroprotection. Trials are currently under way to test whether cannabinoids may have a longer term role in reducing disability and progression in MS, in addition to symptom amelioration, where indications are being established."

Chronic pain is the most common indication, as health claims data and the accompanying survey show. From the point of view of the law, a prescription is indicated in cases of serious illness, missing or not indicated established therapeutic approaches and a not entirely remote prospect of improvement of the illness or its symptoms. This describes a broader indication spectrum than can currently be based on randomised controlled clinical trials. There is weak evidence of low efficacy for neuropathic pain. For pain related to spasticity and cancer-related pain there is evidence of improvements in quality of life, but effects on pain are of little relevance. For all other indications, only an individual therapeutic trial can be justified based on the available external evidence. However, this usually corresponds to the demand of \"a not entirely remote prospect\" of a noticeably positive effect of medical cannabis. It is also problematic that almost no long-term studies for the application and efficacy of flowers and extracts are available.Current knowledge on the use of cannabis-based drugs and, more clearly, medical cannabis for chronic pain is insufficient. The increase in the number of countries with marketing authorisations or exemptions for medicinal cannabis or cannabis-based drugs for chronic pain will also pave the way for larger empirical and population-based studies that will further improve the evidence base of research and clinical use."

Although the use of serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, as well as neurokinin-1 inhibitors, has reduced rates of acute emesis, many patients still experience acute vomiting; moreover, these agents have reduced efficacy in preventing nausea, delayed CINV, and breakthrough CINV. Nausea, in particular, continues to have a major--and often overlooked--impact on patients' quality of life. Optimizing the treatment for CINV likely will involve combinations of agents that inhibit the numerous neurotransmitter systems involved in nausea and vomiting reflexes. Cannabinoids are active in many of these systems, and two oral formulations, dronabinol (Marinol) and nabilone (Cesamet), are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in CINV refractory to conventional antiemetic therapy. Agents in this class have shown superiority to dopamine receptor antagonists in preventing CINV, and there is some evidence that the combination of a dopamine antagonist and cannabinoid is superior to either alone and is particularly effective in preventing nausea. The presence of side effects from the cannabinoids may have slowed their adoption into clinical practice, but in a number of comparative clinical trials, patients have expressed a clear preference for the cannabinoid, choosing its efficacy over any undesired effects. Improvement in antiemetic therapy across the entire spectrum of CINV will involve the use of agents with different mechanisms of action in concurrent or sequential combinations, and the best such combinations should be identified. In this effort, the utility of the cannabinoids should not be overlooked."

            "title": "Targeting the endocannabinoid system for management of HIV-associated neuropathic pain: A systematic review.",
            "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and antiretroviral therapy can independently induce HIV-associated neuropathic pain (HIV-NP). There is a dearth of drugs or therapeutic modalities that can alleviate HIV-NP. Smoked cannabis has been reported to improve pain measures in patients with neuropathic pain. Cannabis, phytocannabinoids, and the endocannabinoids such N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), produce some of their effects via cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). Endocannabinoids are degraded by various enzymes such as fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu using various key words and their combinations for published papers that studied HIV-NP and cannabis, cannabinoids, or endocannabinoids up to 27th December 2020. All original research articles that evaluated the efficacy of molecules that modulate the endocannabinoid system (ECS) for the prevention and/or treatment of pain in HIV-NP animal models and patients with HIV-NP were included. The PubMed search produced a total of 117 articles, whereas the Google Scholar search produced a total of 9467 articles. Amongst the 13 articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria 11 articles were found in both searches whereas 2 articles were found in Google Scholar only. The clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu searches produced five registered trials of which three were completed and with results. Ten preclinical studies found that the endocannabinoids (2-AG and AEA), synthetic mixed CB1R/CB2R agonist WIN 55,212-2, a CB2R-selective phytocannabinoid β-caryophyllene, synthetic CB2R-selective agonists (AM1710, JWH015, JWH133 and Gp1a, but not HU308); FAAH inhibitors (palmitoylallylamide, URB597 and PF-3845) and a drug combination of indomethacin plus minocycline, which produces its effects in a CBR-dependent manner, either prevented the development of and/or attenuated established HIV-NP. Two clinical trials demonstrated greater efficacy of smoked cannabis over placebo in alleviating HIV-NP, whereas another clinical trial demonstrated that cannabidivarin, a cannabinoid that does not activate CBRs, did not reduce HIV-NP. The available preclinical results suggest that targeting the ECS for prevention and treatment of HIV-NP is a plausible therapeutic option. Clinical evidence shows that smoked cannabis alleviates HIV-NP. Further research is needed to find out if non-psychoactive drugs that target the ECS and are delivered by other routes than smoking could be useful as treatment options for HIV-NP."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoids combined with opioids produce synergistic antinociceptive effects, decreasing the lowest effective antinociceptive opioid dose (i.e., opioid-sparing effects) in laboratory animals. Although pain patients report greater analgesia when cannabis is used with opioids, no placebo-controlled studies have assessed the direct effects of opioids combined with cannabis in humans or the impact of the combination on abuse liability. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study determined if cannabis enhances the analgesic effects of low dose oxycodone using a validated experimental model of pain and its effects on abuse liability. Healthy cannabis smokers (N = 18) were administered oxycodone (0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg, PO) with smoked cannabis (0.0, 5.6% Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) and analgesia was assessed using the Cold-Pressor Test (CPT). Participants immersed their hand in cold water (4 °C); times to report pain (pain threshold) and withdraw the hand from the water (pain tolerance) were recorded. Abuse-related effects were measured and effects of oxycodone on cannabis self-administration were determined. Alone, 5.0 mg oxycodone increased pain threshold and tolerance (p ≤ 0.05). Although active cannabis and 2.5 mg oxycodone alone failed to elicit analgesia, combined they increased pain threshold and tolerance (p ≤ 0.05). Oxycodone did not increase subjective ratings associated with cannabis abuse, nor did it increase cannabis self-administration. However, the combination of 2.5 mg oxycodone and active cannabis produced small, yet significant, increases in oxycodone abuse liability (p ≤ 0.05). Cannabis enhances the analgesic effects of sub-threshold oxycodone, suggesting synergy, without increases in cannabis's abuse liability. These findings support future research into the therapeutic use of opioid-cannabinoid combinations for pain."

            "abstract": "The cannabis plant and its derivatives have been exploited for centuries for recreational and medicinal purposes, with millions of regular users around the world. The recreational use of cannabis is reflective of its neuropsychiatric effects, such as anxiolysis and euphoria. However, cannabis appears to have an emerging therapeutic role, especially in chronic disease and as an adjunct to cancer treatment. Increasing evidence supports cannabis in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and for pain management; however, studies are limited, particularly by difficulties associated with standardized dosing estimates and inability to accurately assess biologic activities of compounds in cannabis and derivative products. Smoking cannabis has not been proved to be a risk factor in the development of lung cancer, but the data are limited by small studies, misclassification due to self-reporting of use, small numbers of heavy cannabis smokers, and confounding of the risk associated with known causative agents for lung cancer (such as parallel chronic tobacco use). Cannabis and its biologically effective derivatives warrant additional research, ideally, controlled trials in which the cannabidiol and the delta-9-tetrahydrocabinol strength and use are controlled and documented."

Many women's health topics remain under investigated. Few studies address cannabis's potential to treat vulvodynia symptoms despite their dramatic impact on quality of life. Women who had used cannabis and who reported experiencing vulvodynia symptoms (N = 38) completed an online survey assessing symptoms, expectancies regarding cannabis-associated relief from vulvodynia symptoms, cannabis use, and cannabis-related problems. Generally, women expected cannabis to have moderate to large effects on vulvodynia symptoms (d = .63-1.19). Nevertheless, women expected greater relief for burning/stabbing pain than for itching and pain associated with tampon insertion, as well greater relief for dyspareunia than for pain associated with tampon insertion. Those whose symptoms were worse expected more relief from cannabis treatment. Expectations of cannabis-induced relief did not increase frequency of use or problems.

We tested the hypothesis that activation of CB2 receptor by MDA7 modulates microglial dysregulation, suppresses the overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in microglia in the dorsal horn, and attenuates the central sensitization and pain behavior induced by paclitaxel. For 4 consecutice days, groups of rats randomly received saline or 1.0 mg/kg of paclitaxel daily intraperitoneally for a total cumulative dose of 4 mg/kg. MDA7 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally or vehicle were administered 15 min before administering paclitaxel for 4 days and then continued for another 10 days. Behavioral and molecular studies were performed. Paclitaxel induced the expression of CB2 receptors and production of interleukin (IL)-6 in microglia in the dorsal horn. MDA7 attenuated the expression of IL-6 and promoted the expression of IL-10. Paclitaxel induced epigenetic upregulation of IRF8 and P2X purinoceptor 4 (P2X4) in microglia and subsequently increased the expression of alpha isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIα), transcriptional factors p-CREB and ΔFosB, leading to the overproduction of BDNF in microglia. Paclitaxel also upregulated the expression of glutamate receptor subunits GluR1 and NR2B, decreased the expression of K+-Cl- cotransporter, and induced mechanical allodynia in rats. All of the aforementioned molecular changes were attenuated by MDA7. Our data show that MDA7 attenuated paclitaxel-induced molecular and behavioral changes in rats. Perspective: This study provides evidence that paclitaxel induced microglia dysregulation and epigenetically upregulated the microglial expression of BDNF, which led to sensitization of dorsal horn neurons and mechanical allodynia in rats. The CB2 agonist MDA7 alleviated these pathological processes. MDA7 represents an innovative therapeutic approach for treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoids have been used for pain relief for centuries and recent studies have investigated their analgesic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, as well as clinical efficacy, in treating chronic pain. We report an open-label study addressed to evaluate the effect and adverse events of orally administered Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) in 13 patients with chronic nonmalignant pain (CNMP) unresponsive to conventional pharmacotherapy. The effect of the treatment was assessed on an eight-item HRQoL questionnaire. Five out of 13 patients reported adequate response to the treatment while eight patients reported inadequate or no response. Seven patients did not experience any adverse events (AEs), six patients reported AEs, two of which discontinued the treatment. We conclude that oral THC may be a valuable therapeutic option for selected patients with CNMP that are unresponsive to previous treatments, though further research is warranted to characterize those patients."

            "abstract": "Anandamide, an endocannabinoid, is degraded by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase which can be inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The present work was designed to study the peripheral interactions between anandamide and ibuprofen (a non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor) in the rat formalin test. We first determined the ED50 for anandamide (0.018 microg +/- 0.009), ibuprofen (0.18 microg +/- 0.09), and their combination (0.006 microg +/- 0.002). Drugs were given 15 min before a 2.5% formalin injection into the dorsal surface of the right hind paw. Results were analyzed using isobolographic analysis. The antinociceptive interaction between anandamide and ibuprofen was synergistic. To further investigate the mechanisms by which the combination of anandamide with ibuprofen produced their antinociceptive effects, we used specific antagonists for the cannabinoid CB1 (AM251; 80 microg) and CB2 (AM630; 25 microg) receptors. We demonstrated that the antinociceptive effects of ibuprofen were not antagonized by either AM251 or AM630 and that those of anandamide were antagonized by AM251 but not by AM630. The synergistic antinociceptive effects of the combination of anandamide with ibuprofen were completely antagonized by AM251 but only partially inhibited by AM630. In conclusion, locally (hind paw) injected anandamide, ibuprofen or combination thereof decreased pain behavior in the formalin test. The combination of anandamide with ibuprofen produced synergistic antinociceptive effects involving both cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. Comprehension of the mechanisms involved needs further investigation."

            "abstract": "The major psychoactive constituent of Cannabis sativa, delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta(9)-THC), and endogenous cannabinoid ligands, such as anandamide, signal through G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors localised to regions of the brain associated with important neurological processes. Signalling is mostly inhibitory and suggests a role for cannabinoids as therapeutic agents in CNS disease where inhibition of neurotransmitter release would be beneficial. Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients with disorders such as multiple sclerosis smoke cannabis to relieve disease-related symptoms. Cannabinoids can alleviate tremor and spasticity in animal models of multiple sclerosis, and clinical trials of the use of these compounds for these symptoms are in progress. The cannabinoid nabilone is currently licensed for use as an antiemetic agent in chemotherapy-induced emesis. Evidence suggests that cannabinoids may prove useful in Parkinson's disease by inhibiting the excitotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate and counteracting oxidative damage to dopaminergic neurons. The inhibitory effect of cannabinoids on reactive oxygen species, glutamate and tumour necrosis factor suggests that they may be potent neuroprotective agents. Dexanabinol (HU-211), a synthetic cannabinoid, is currently being assessed in clinical trials for traumatic brain injury and stroke. Animal models of mechanical, thermal and noxious pain suggest that cannabinoids may be effective analgesics. Indeed, in clinical trials of postoperative and cancer pain and pain associated with spinal cord injury, cannabinoids have proven more effective than placebo but may be less effective than existing therapies. Dronabinol, a commercially available form of delta(9)-THC, has been used successfully for increasing appetite in patients with HIV wasting disease, and cannabinoid receptor antagonists may reduce obesity. Acute adverse effects following cannabis usage include sedation and anxiety. These effects are usually transient and may be less severe than those that occur with existing therapeutic agents. The use of nonpsychoactive cannabinoids such as cannabidiol and dexanabinol may allow the dissociation of unwanted psychoactive effects from potential therapeutic benefits. The existence of other cannabinoid receptors may provide novel therapeutic targets that are independent of CB(1) receptors (at which most currently available cannabinoids act) and the development of compounds that are not associated with CB(1) receptor-mediated adverse effects. Further understanding of the most appropriate route of delivery and the pharmacokinetics of agents that act via the endocannabinoid system may also reduce adverse effects and increase the efficacy of cannabinoid treatment. This review highlights recent advances in understanding of the endocannabinoid system and indicates CNS disorders that may benefit from the therapeutic effects of cannabinoid treatment. Where applicable, reference is made to ongoing clinical trials of cannabinoids to alleviate symptoms of these disorders."

This study aimed to clarify the epidemiological indices and factors related to PGD in Japanese people. This population-based cohort study included 1575 local Japanese residents. PGD, center edge angle, and joint space width were measured radiographically. We investigated the relationship between PGD and spino-pelvic parameters. Factors associated with PGD were examined using multiple logistic regression analysis, with the presence/absence of PGD as an objective variable, and sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and the presence/absence of hip pain or spino-pelvic parameters as explanatory variables. In the entire cohort, 4.9% (10.6% men, 2.1% women) had PGD on at least one side. A trend was observed between PGD and increasing age in both men and women (men: p < 0.0001, women: p = 0.0004). No relationship was observed between PGD and hip pain (risk ratio 1.0 [95% confidence interval 0.97-1.03]). Factors significantly associated with PGD were age, sex, and BMI in the multivariate model. Acquired factors may be related to PGD in Japanese people as the PGD prevalence increased with age and PGD was not significantly associated with hip pain. This study provides new insights into the etiology and clinical significance of PGD."

Over time, the use of medical cannabis has been increasingly adopted by Western medicine and is thus a rapidly emerging field that all pain physicians need to be aware of. Several randomized controlled trials have shown a significant and dose-dependent relationship between neuropathic pain relief and tetrahydrocannabinol - the principal psychoactive component of cannabis. Despite this, barriers exist to use from both the patient perspective (cost, addiction, social stigma, lack of understanding regarding safe administration) and the physician perspective (credibility, criminality, clinical evidence, patient addiction, and policy from the governing medical colleges). This review addresses these barriers and draws attention to key concerns in the Canadian medical system, providing updated treatment approaches to help clinicians work with their patients in achieving adequate pain control, reduced narcotic medication use, and enhanced quality of life. This review also includes case studies demonstrating the use of medical marijuana by patients with neuropathic low-back pain, neuropathic pain in fibromyalgia, and neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. While significant preclinical data have demonstrated the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis for treating pain in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer, further studies are needed with randomized controlled trials and larger study populations to identify the specific strains and concentrations that will work best with selected cohorts."

This research presents the first study regarding the effectiveness of different singly administered high doses of buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist (of μ-opioid receptors), a potent opioid antagonist (of κ-receptors) and a partial agonist of nociception receptors) in reducing suicidal ideation in acutely depressed people with co-morbid opiate dependence. It follows small studies that suggest that ultra-low-dose buprenorphine may be useful in reducing suicidal ideation.

Out of 51 participants, there were 47 patients; 16 (34.04%) received 32 mg, 17 (36.17%) received 64 mg, and 14 (29.78%) received 96 mg of sublingual buprenorphine. They were evaluated by using psychometric assessment of the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSSI) and interviews based on DSM-5 criteria. A placebo group was not included because of the high probability of severe withdrawal without active pharmacological treatment. The study was conducted with appropriate precautions and monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular measures.

Given limited harms data from analgesic clinical trials, we conducted an overview of systematic reviews focused on all harms possibly relevant to patients receiving cannabinoids for pain management. This PROSPERO-registered, PRISMA-compliant systematic overview identified 79 reviews, encompassing over 2200 individual reports about psychiatric and psychosocial harms, cognitive/behavioral effects, motor vehicle accidents, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer-related, maternal/fetal, and general harms. Reviews, and their included studies, were of variable quality. Available evidence suggests variable associations between cannabis exposure (ranging from monthly to daily use based largely on self-report) and psychosis, motor vehicle accidents, respiratory problems, and other harms. Most evidence comes from settings other than that of pain management (eg, nonmedicinal and experimental) but does signal a need for caution and more robust harms evaluation in future studies. Given partial overlap between patients receiving cannabinoids for pain management and individuals using cannabinoids for other reasons, lessons from the crisis of oversupply and overuse of opioids in some parts of the world emphasize the need to broadly consider harms evidence from real-world settings. The advancement of research on cannabinoid harms will serve to guide optimal approaches to the use of cannabinoids for pain management. In the meantime, this evidence should be carefully examined when making risk-benefit considerations about the use of cannabinoids, cannabis, and cannabis-based medicine for chronic pain."

We examine this issue in chronic back pain (CBP) patients who participated in a double-blind brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) clinical trial. We recently reported that when the 30 CBP participants were treated, for 2 weeks, with topical analgesic or no drug patches, pain and brain activity decreased independently of treatment type and thus were attributed to placebo responses. Here we examine in the same group brain markers for predicting placebo responses--that is, for differentiating between posttreatment persistent CBP (CBPp) and decreasing CBP (CBPd) groups. At baseline, pain and brain activity for rating spontaneous fluctuations of back pain were not different between the 2 groups. However, on the basis of brain activity differences after treatment, we identified that at baseline the extent of information shared (functional connectivity) between left medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral insula accurately (0.8) predicted posttreatment groups. This was validated in an independent cohort. Additionally, by means of frequency domain contrasts, we observe that at baseline, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex high-frequency oscillations also predicted treatment outcomes and identified an additional set of functional connections distinguishing treatment outcomes. Combining medial and lateral prefrontal functional connections, we observe a statistically higher accuracy (0.9) for predicting posttreatment groups. These findings indicate that placebo response can be identified a priori at least in CBP, and that neuronal population interactions between prefrontal cognitive and pain processing regions predetermine the probability of placebo response in the clinical setting."

It is effective and well tolerated in the clinical management of adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), ankylosing spondylitis, soft tissue disorders and post operative dental pain. Oxaprozin has a high oral bioavailability (95%), with peak plasma concentrations at 3 to 5 hours after dosing. It is metabolised in the liver by oxidative and conjugative pathways and readily eliminated by the renal and faecal routes. Oxaprozin's strong analgesic qualities are particularly useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions such as periarthritis of the shoulder, since it exhibits actions such as inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes, inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and of metalloproteases, and modulates the endogenous cannabinoid system. This editorial addresses the accompanying paper by Barbara Heller and Rosanna Tarricone on the management of shoulder periarthritis pain, in which they studied the efficacy and safety of oxaprozin compared to the comparator drug diclofenac over a 15 day period. Both oxaprozin and diclofenac compared well in the primary study endpoint of reduction in shoulder pain. Oxaprozin and diclofenac were well tolerated and oxaprozin showed better improvement in shoulder function and in the mental health item of the SF-36 quality of life component. The study by Heller and Tarricone is an addition to the large number of clinical trials which demonstrate that oxaprozin has equal efficacy in comparison with standard doses of commonly used anti-rheumatic agents such as aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin etc. in several different painful musculoskeletal conditions."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite improvements in medical care, patients with advanced cancer still experience substantial symptom distress. There is increasing interest in the use of medicinal cannabinoids, but there is little high quality evidence to guide clinicians. This study aims to define the role of cannabidiol (CBD) in the management of symptom burden in patients with advanced cancer undergoing standard palliative care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and design:\n        \n      \n      This study is a multicentre, randomised, placebo controlled, two arm, parallel trial of escalating doses of oral CBD. It will compare efficacy and safety outcomes of a titrated dose of CBD (100 mg/mL formulation, dose range 50 mg to 600 mg per day) against placebo. There is a 2-week patient determined titration phase, using escalating doses of CBD or placebo to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief with tolerable side effects. This is then followed by a further 2-week assessment period on the stable dose determined in collaboration with clinicians.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      A major strength of this study is that it will target symptom burden as a whole, rather than just individual symptoms, in an attempt to describe the general improvement in wellbeing previously reported by some patients in open label, non controlled trials of medicinal cannabis. Randomisation with placebo is essential because of the well-documented over reporting of benefit in uncontrolled trials and high placebo response rates in cancer pain trials. This will be the first placebo controlled clinical trial to evaluate rigorously the efficacy, safety and acceptability of CBD for symptom relief in advanced cancer patients. This study will provide the medical community with evidence to present to patients wishing to access medicinal cannabis for their cancer related symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration number:\n        \n      \n      ALCTRN12618001220257 Registered 20/07/2018."

            "abstract": "It was our goal to compare the Proseal-laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) with the classical laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in a german multicenter trial. Handling of the instruments and application criteria were to be tested. 7 anaesthesia departments were able to take part in this study. 280 patients could be investigated after approval of the ethics committee of the medical faculty of the university of Goettingen. 145 patients received the PLMA and 135 the LMA. The surgical interventions were small to moderate procedures with a duration of at least 20 minutes in the sections general surgery, trauma/orthopedic surgery, urology, vascular surgery, gynecology, ENT-surgery and ophthalmology. There was equivalence of the two instruments PLMA and LMA concerning duration and ease of insertion, endoscopic position check, observations on emergence, potential for injury and some postoperative complaints. This equivalence could be confirmed statistically. Laryngospasm was observed in three, Bronchospasm in two patients with the PLMA, in no one with the LMA. In one case of laryngospasm and another of bronchospasm a mechanism of supraglottic laryngeal stenosis has been involved which may occur in rare instances with the PLMA. This mechanism is due to the double cuff of the PLMA with the instruments proximity to the laryngeal inlet. The seal pressure in both groups differs significantly (p = 0.001). The mean value for the seal pressure was 29,3 +/- 0,21 mbar for the PLMA and 20,9 +/- 0,21 mbar for the LMA. In the PLMA the gastric tube could be positioned with the first attempt in 118 patients, with the second attempt in 17 cases. In 10 patients the gastric tube could not be placed. Contrary to the LMA the tip of the PLMA cuff may be bent in some cases with loss of airway safety and positioning of the gastric tube. The symptoms sore throat and painful swallowing on the first postoperative day were more frequent with LMA application. These differences could be confirmed statistically (sore throat p = 0.01, painful swallowing p = 0.04). They may be explained by the more rigid LMA compared to the PLMA and by the fact that the LMA in this study was older than the PLMA, loosing plasticizer. The drainage tube within the PLMA offers safety from aspiration in patients with no primary aspiration risk, additional reassurance for a correct position and a better stability of the airway. Our data may support a wider indication range for the PLMA compared with the LMA. The PLMA may be applied in laparoscopies and lower abdominal surgical interventions. Careful clinical observation will show, if the minimal invasiveness of the PLMA offers an advantage for these patients. The PLMA should not be applied in patients with increased aspiration risk."

            "abstract": "Placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, but are known to alleviate symptoms across a variety of clinical conditions. Associative learning and cognitive expectations both play important roles in placebo responses, however we are just beginning to understand how interactions between these processes lead to powerful effects. Here, we review the psychological principles underlying placebo effects and our current understanding of their brain bases, focusing on studies demonstrating both the importance of cognitive expectations and those that demonstrate expectancy-independent associative learning. To account for both forms of placebo analgesia, we propose a dual-process model in which flexible, contextually driven cognitive schemas and attributions guide associative learning processes that produce stable, long-term placebo effects. According to this model, the placebo-induction paradigms with the most powerful effects are those that combine reinforcement (e.g., the experience of reduced pain after placebo treatment) with suggestions and context cues that disambiguate learning by attributing perceived benefit to the placebo. Using this model as a conceptual scaffold, we review and compare neurobiological systems identified in both human studies of placebo analgesia and behavioral pain modulation in rodents. We identify substantial overlap between the circuits involved in human placebo analgesia and those that mediate multiple forms of context-based modulation of pain behavior in rodents, including forebrain-brainstem pathways and opioid and cannabinoid systems in particular. This overlap suggests that placebo effects are part of a set of adaptive mechanisms for shaping nociceptive signaling based on its information value and anticipated optimal response in a given behavioral context."

            "abstract": "Many people with fibromyalgia use cannabidiol (CBD) products despite limited rigorous evidence of benefit. In the current study, we conducted a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey of N = 878 people with fibromyalgia to investigate naturalistic decision making around CBD product choices, use patterns, and dosing. We subgrouped participants based on use of high-THC cannabis (HTC) in the past year (yes/no) as previous studies have shown that HTC use influences CBD use patterns. The study population was largely female (93.6%), white (91.5%) and 55.5 years old on average. Participants typically purchased CBD products online or at dispensaries, with purchasing driven by personal research (63%) rather than endorsement from medical professionals (16%). Overall, tinctures and topicals were the most common administration routes endorsed. However, participants in the past-year HTC group used inhalation routes far more frequently than those who did not (39.8% vs 7.1%). Among participants using CBD tinctures or edibles, the average dose per session was 16 mg and 24 to 27 mg per day, although approximately one-third of participants did not know what dose of CBD they used. Participants using both inhalation and non-inhalation administration routes reported greater symptom relief than those using non-inhalation routes alone. However, there was no consistent relationship between CBD dose and reported effects, possibly due to expectancy effects around CBD products or interindividual variability. Our granular investigation reveals variability of CBD product dosing practices for fibromyalgia, and how past-year HTC use influences CBD product use. Future clinical trials should investigate the potential benefits of low-dose (<50mg) botanical CBD products. PERSPECTIVE: This article shows that past-year HTC use strongly influences how people with fibromyalgia choose and use CBD products. Participants typically used <50 mg/d of CBD, and there was no relationship between higher CBD dose and reported therapeutic benefit. Future clinical trials should investigate therapeutic benefits of low dose CBD."

Because of the pain-relieving effects of cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor agonists in inflammation pain, incision pain, and neuropathic pain models, we tested whether spinal CB2 receptor activation would induce antihyperalgesia in cancer pain. Our previous study showed that the 2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NR2B) receptor in the spinal cord participates in bone cancer pain in mice. In the present study, we also tested the cannabinoid effect on the expression of NR2B.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Seventy-two mice were randomly allocated to 7 different groups: (1) control; (2) sham and tumor-bearing mice, which include (3) V; (4) J1; (5) J2; (6) J3; and (7) J4. In the groups of tumor-bearing mice, C(3)H/Hej mice were implanted with NCTC2472 fibrosarcoma cells into the femur bone to induce bone cancer-related pain behaviors. The sham mice were implanted with minimal essential medium α modification, whereas the control mice received no injection. On day 14 after implantation, tumor-invoked tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were assessed. Tumor-bearing mice were assigned to intrathecal administration of the CB2 receptor agonist JWH015 (0.5, 1, and 2 μg), CB2 receptor antagonist AM630 (2 μg), or vehicle, and the assessment of withdrawal thresholds was then performed. Tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were assessed before administration and at 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after administration. Spinal NR2B activation of all tumor-bearing mice at 12 hours and 72 hours were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At day 14 after operation, tumor-evoked tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were higher in tumor-bearing mice compared with the sham and control mice. Intrathecal administration of JWH015 dose dependently attenuated tumor-evoked tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia but this effect was prevented by intrathecal administration of AM630 30 minutes before. The mRNA expression of NR2B was similar to this result. At 12 hours after administration, the expression of NR2B mRNA in the spinal cord was lower in mice that were administered JWH015 compared with the vehicle group. However, this phenomenon was reversed in the group that was preadministered AM630.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These data indicated that intrathecal administration of cannabinoid receptor agonists might relieve cancer pain, probably by reducing NR2B-dependent activity in the spinal cord.

The quality of included studies was assessed, data were extracted, and results were summarized qualitatively based on the totality of the evidence.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 2,545 citations identified at the title and abstract level, a total of 156 publications were included. Most trials enrolled patients with pain symptoms of at least moderate intensity (e.g., >5 on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale for pain). Across interventions, pain intensity was the most commonly reported outcome, followed by back-specific function. When present, observed benefits for pain were generally in the small (5 to 10 points on a 0- to 100-point visual analog scale or 0.5 to 1.0 points on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale) to moderate (10 to 20 points) range. Effects on function were generally smaller than effects on pain; in some cases, there were positive effects on pain but no effects on function, and fewer studies measured function than pain. Benefits were mostly measured at short-term followup. For acute low back pain, evidence suggested that NSAIDs (strength of evidence [SOE]: low to moderate), skeletal muscle relaxants (SOE: moderate), opioids (SOE: low), exercise (SOE: low), and superficial heat (SOE: moderate) are more effective than placebo, no intervention, or usual care, and that acetaminophen (SOE: low) and systemic corticosteroids (SOE: low) are no more effective than placebo. For chronic low back pain, effective therapies versus placebo, sham, no treatment, usual care, or wait list are NSAIDs, opioids, tramadol, duloxetine, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, and exercise (SOE: moderate) and benzodiazepines, psychological therapies, massage, yoga, tai chi, and low-level laser therapy (SOE: low); spinal manipulation was as effective as other active interventions (SOE: moderate). Few trials evaluated the effectiveness of treatments for radicular low back pain, but the available evidence found that benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, traction, and spinal manipulation were not effective or were associated with small effects (SOE: low). Relatively few trials directly compared the effectiveness of different medications or different nonpharmacological therapies, or compared pharmacological versus nonpharmacological therapies, and they generally found no clear differences in effects. Pharmacological therapies were associated with increased risk of adverse events versus placebo (SOE: low to moderate). Trials were not designed or powered to detect serious harms from pharmacological therapies. Although rates appeared to be low and there was not an increased risk of serious harms versus placebo, this does not rule out significant risk from some treatments. For nonpharmacological therapies, assessment of harms was suboptimal, but serious harms appeared to be rare (SOE: low).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological noninvasive treatments for low back pain are associated with small to moderate, primarily short-term effects on pain versus placebo, sham, wait list, or no treatment. Effects on function were generally smaller than effects on pain. More research is needed to understand optimal selection of treatments, effective combinations and sequencing of treatments, effectiveness of treatments for radicular low back pain, and effectiveness on outcomes other than pain and function."

            "abstract": "As medical use of cannabis is increasingly legalized worldwide, a better understanding of the medical and hazardous effects of this drug is imperative. The pain associated with rheumatic diseases is considered a prevalent indication for medicinal cannabis in various countries. Thus far, preliminary clinical trials have explored the effects of cannabis on rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia; preliminary evidence has also found an association between the cannabinoid system and other rheumatic conditions, including systemic sclerosis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The potential medicinal effects of cannabis could be attributable to its influence on the immune system, as it exerts an immunomodulatory effect on various immune cells, including T cells, B cells and macrophages. However, the available evidence is not yet sufficient to support the recommendation of cannabinoid treatment for rheumatic diseases."

The current state of knowledge was reviewed; many knowledge gaps and research needs were identified that require further investigation. Common themes included the need to better understand the underlying mechanisms of pain in pancreatic diseases, the relationship of visceral neural pathways and central pain centers, the role of behavioral factors and disorders on the perception of pain, and differences in pain perception and processes in children when compared with adults. In addition, the role of genetic risk factors for pain and the mechanisms and role of placebos in pain treatment were discussed. Methods of pain assessment including quantitative sensory testing were examined, as well as the process of central sensitization of pain. Finally, newer approaches to pain management including cognitive behavioral therapy, nerve stimulation, experimental (nonopioid) drugs, and cannabinoid compounds were covered."

The aim of this prospective study was to compare the retromuscular sublay technique with the intraperitoneal underlay technique for primary umbilical hernias.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      from February 2004 to April 2007, all patients treated for umbilical hernias with maximum diameters of 3 cm were prospectively followed. During the first period of 15 months, all patients were treated with retromuscular repair using a large pore mesh (Vypro). After that period, for all patients, mesh repair using an intraperitoneal Ventralex patch was performed. All patients underwent general anesthesia. This analysis included 116 patients, of whom 56 had retromuscular repair (group I; mean age, 54.8 years; mean body mass index, 28.2 kg/m(2)) and 60 had open intraperitoneal repair (group II; mean age, 48.1 years; mean body mass index, 29.4 kg/m(2)). Operating time was evaluated as skin-to-skin time, and drain management was noted for both techniques. Follow-up was ≥ 2 years for all patients, and both early and late complications were registered, including seroma and hematoma formation, wound infection, fistula formation, and recurrence rates. Preoperative and postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (range, 0-10) on the day of the first outpatient visit; on postoperative days 1, 7, and 21; and after 1 year. Quality of life was estimated using the EQ-5D questionnaire 1 year after surgery. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 15 software. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used to analyze continuous variables, and repeated-measures analysis of variance was used for visual analogue scale scores. The χ(2) test and Fisher's exact test were used to assess the differences between categorical data. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      the mean operative times were 79.9 minutes in group I and 33.9 minutes in group II (P < .001). The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in group I (3.8 vs 2.1 days, P < .001). Seromas and superficial wound infections in the early postoperative period were not different between both groups, although seromas occurred more frequent in the retromuscular group. Postoperative visual analogue scale scores were significantly lower with the intraperitoneal technique at all time points (P < .003, repeated-measures analysis of variance). However, 3 patients with the Ventralex patch had to be readmitted for severe pain. The recurrence rate was higher with the intraperitoneal repair (n = 5 [8.3%] vs n = 2 [3.6%]) than for the retromuscular mesh repair, but not statistically significant. Quality of life was comparable in the two groups after 1 year.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      the open intraperitoneal technique using a Ventralex mesh for umbilical hernias seems a very elegant and quick technique. However, possibly because of the less controllable mesh deployment, recurrence rates seem higher. In case open mesh repair is the preferred treatment, a retromuscular repair should be the first choice."

            "abstract": "Advances in cannabis research have paralleled developments in opioid pharmacology whereby a psychoactive plant extract has elucidated novel endogenous signalling systems with therapeutic significance. Cannabinoids (CBs) are chemical compounds derived from cannabis. The major psychotropic CB delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) was isolated in 1964 and the first CB receptor (CB(1)R) was cloned in 1990. CB signalling occurs via G-protein-coupled receptors distributed throughout the body. Endocannabinoids are derivatives of arachidonic acid that function in diverse physiological systems. Neuronal CB(1)Rs modulate synaptic transmission and mediate psychoactivity. Immune-cell CB(2) receptors (CB(2)R) may down-regulate neuroinflammation and influence cyclooxygenase-dependent pathways. Animal models demonstrate that CBRs play a fundamental role in peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal nociception and that CBs are effective analgesics. Clinical trials of CBs in multiple sclerosis have suggested a benefit in neuropathic pain. However, human studies of CB-mediated analgesia have been limited by study size, heterogeneous patient populations, and subjective outcome measures. Furthermore, CBs have variable pharmacokinetics and can manifest psychotropism. They are currently licensed as antiemetics in chemotherapy and can be prescribed on a named-patient basis for neuropathic pain. Future selective peripheral CB(1)R and CB(2)R agonists will minimize central psychoactivity and may synergize opioid anti-nociception. This review discusses the basic science and clinical aspects of CB pharmacology with a focus on pain medicine."

As patients with painful terminal diseases may face unbearable pain, there is a need for more potent analgesics. Although opioid-based therapeutic agents received attention to manage severe pain, their adverse drug effects and mortality rate associated with opioids overdose are the major concerns. Evidences from clinical trials showed therapeutic benefits of cannabis, especially delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinoids reduced neuropathic pain intensity in various conditions. Also, there are reports on using combination cannabinoid therapies for chronic pain management. The association of cannabis dependence and addiction has been discussed much and the reports mentioned that it can be comparatively lower than other substances such as nicotine and alcohol. More countries have decided to legalise the medicinal use of cannabis and marijuana. Healthcare professionals should keep themselves updated with the changing state of medical cannabis and its applications. The pharmacokinetics and safety of medical cannabis need to be studied by conducting clinical research. The complex and variable chemically active contents of herbal cannabis and methodological limitations in the administration of cannabis to study participants, make the clinical research difficult."

The topic areas balance, hypertension, falls, quality of life, cognitive performance, and vestibulopathy have also been the focus of research; included reviews identified 10 or more pertinent RCTs per topic. Statistically significant effects across existing studies were reported for hypertension, falls outside of institutions, cognitive performance, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pain, balance confidence, depression, and muscle strength. However, review authors cautioned that firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to methodological limitations in the original studies and/or an insufficient number of research studies."

Chronic pain is a significant secondary condition following SCI, and traditional treatments (e.g. opioids, NSAIDs) are often criticized for providing inadequate relief. As a result, there is increasing interest in and use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medications as an alternative means of pain control.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this review was to examine the scientific evidence on the effect of cannabis/cannabinoids upon pain intensity in SCI by mapping the current literature.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two hundred and fifty-two studies were identified by searching electronic databases for articles published through February 2020. In addition, reviewers scanned the reference lists of identified articles and examined clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished data in this area.

Since then, the effects of cannabis as a medicine have been researched more systematically. To summarize the scientific knowledge, the German Federal Ministry of Health commissioned an expertise.The project \"Cannabis: Potential and Risks: a Scientific Analysis\" (CaPRis), which started in 2016, aimed at analyzing the potential of medicinal cannabis and the risks of recreational cannabis use. A search of systematic reviews (SRs) and randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted in five international databases (publication date: 2006-2017). For the medical use of cannabis 16 SRs (of 186 RCTs) were included from a global search and nine further RCTs were comprised from a de novo search. All studies were methodologically assessed.Evidence for the efficacy of cannabis medicine (given as an adjunct to other medication) was found in patients with chronic pain and spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. Benefits were also found for appetite stimulation, improvement of nausea, and weight gain in patients with cancer, HIV/AIDS or in palliative care. Effects were often small. For other physical or mental disorders, only few or no controlled human studies are available. Adverse effects of cannabis medicine are often reported; severe adverse effects were mentioned in single cases only.To provide reliable treatment recommendations for clinicians and patients, more large-sized RCTs with follow-up assessments, consistent outcome measures, and active comparisons are needed."

Legalization of cannabis in Canada may attract increasing interest from patients for its medical use in refractory symptom management, but its indications and long-term adverse health impacts are poorly established, creating a challenge for clinicians to support its use. In this review, we summarize key clinical studies and the level of evidence for nonsynthetic cannabinoids in the treatment of common symptoms encountered in advanced stages of CKD, including chronic pain, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, pruritus, and insomnia.\n    \n\n\n          Sources of information:\n        \n      \n      Medline and Embase.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE (inception to March 1, 2018) on cannabis and CKD symptoms of interest, complemented with a manual review of bibliographies. Studies that examined synthetic cannabinoids that are manufactured to mimic the effects of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol such as dronabinol, levonantradol, nabilone, and ajulemic acid were excluded. We focused on studies with higher level of evidence where available, and quality of studies was graded based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence (1a to 5).\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Based on studies conducted in patients without renal impairment, those treated with nonsynthetic cannabinoids were 43% to 300% more likely to report a ≥30% reduction in chronic neuropathic pain compared with placebo. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend nonsynthetic cannabinoids for other medical indications, although preliminary investigation into topical endocannabinoids for uremia-induced pruritus in end-stage renal disease is promising. Finally, any benefits of cannabis may be offset by potential harms in the form of cognitive impairment, increased risk of mortality post-myocardial infarction, orthostatic hypotension, respiratory irritation, and malignancies (with smoked cannabis).\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      Nonsynthetic cannabinoid preparations were highly variable between studies, sample sizes were small, and study durations were short.

The Japan Low Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JLEQ) and Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM) were applied as primary outcomes. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and safety evaluation were secondary outcomes. We enrolled 120 participants aged ≥20 y (36 men and 84 women: mean ± SD age = 40.8 ± 10.9 y). The participants were randomly allocated to either the active group (daily ingestion of 594 mg l-serine and 149 mg EPA) or placebo group.

            "abstract": "The 'monoamine hypothesis' is insufficient in approaching the aetiology of psychiatric disorders or in developing novel therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory regulation plays an important role in pathophysiology and therapeutic mechanism across the major psychiatric disorders. \"Inflammation theory\" might not be the full answer for the big picture of mental disorders, but it might explain high occurrence of somatic symptoms and comorbidity of physical illness in certain subtypes of the heterogeneous groups. Due to the complexity of clinical manifestations and bio-psycho-social etiology, each single treatment shows only small effectiveness with limited effect sizes when compared with placebo. Unfortunately, clinicians are still struggling with trial-and-error practice without any reliable clinical or biological markers to predict therapeutic responses. Therefore, it is important to open up our minds to integrative approaches such dietary modification and nutraceutical prescription. In this special issue, we included 15 papers discussing the role of nutrition (blueberries, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, melatonergic agonist, S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine, Cannabidiol and Kratom) in the context of immunoregulation across different psychiatric disorders from depression, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia to alcohol-induced dementia and anorexia nervosa. Moreover, we also included research in perinatal depression that highlight the role of estradiol and the component of breast milk and the association with the neurodevelopment of the offspring. In addition, several articles focused on the role of microbiota in mental health and pain as recent research has pointed to the gut-brain axis as a main regulator of brain, behaviour and immunity. Lastly, inflammatory mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders including alcohol induced dementia and anorexia nervosa are also highlighted in the special issue."

Many different drugs are used to control the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, periods of relapse and the progression of the disease but it is in the potential management of spasticity, pain and lower urinary tract symptoms that cannabinoids have excited interest. At present, there are relatively few published, controlled clinical studies that support the efficacy of cannabinoids in this context and the evidence that is available is contradictory. On the other hand, the results of unpublished clinical trials are more encouraging and there are other major clinical trials underway. The results of animal studies are also consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous cannabinoids and their receptors are involved in the generation of spasticity and pain."

            "abstract": "The endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system plays an important role in fear-conditioned analgesia (FCA) and expression and extinction of conditioned fear. The hippocampus has an established role in both pain and conditioned fear and is a substrate for endocannabinoid activity. This study aimed to investigate the role of the endocannabinoid system in the ventral hippocampus (vHip) in FCA and in fear responding in the presence of nociceptive tone. Fear-conditioned rats displayed significantly increased freezing and 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalisation and a reduction in formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour (ie, FCA) upon re-exposure to a context previously paired with footshock. Tissue levels of the endocannabinoids, anandamide, and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, as well as the fatty acid amide, palmitoylethanolamide, were significantly higher in the vHip of fear-conditioned rats compared with non-fear-conditioned controls. URB597 (inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase [FAAH]), administered bilaterally into the vHip, significantly enhanced FCA during the entire trial and increased fear responding in formalin-treated rats early in the trial. The URB597-induced enhancement of FCA was blocked by intra-vHip administration of the cannabinoid(1) (CB(1)) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant. Intra-vHip rimonabant alone had no effect on the expression of FCA, and URB597 did not significantly alter formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour in non-fear-conditioned rats. These data suggest an important role for the endocannabinoid system in the vHip in FCA, whereby levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and the FAAH substrates palmitoylethanolamide and anandamide are increased in rats expressing FCA, and pharmacological inhibition of FAAH in the vHip enhances this form of endogenous analgesia via a CB(1) receptor-dependent mechanism."

            "abstract": "The placebo effect is the clinical benefit caused by interaction with a caregiver and health care system in the absence of a biologically active intervention and has been used successfully for millennia. The placebo response results from the interaction of psychosocial mechanisms, human relationships, and preconceptions functioning in specific neuroanatomic locations with known genes and neurotransmitters. It occurs with or without the administration of an inactive substance to deliberately deceive patients. Our purpose is to review the history, benefits, and mechanisms of the placebo effect. The placebo response results from classic conditioning and positive expectations about outcome expressed by the caregiver. The outcomes are usually symptoms such as pain rather than biological outcomes such as death, and the powerful placebo may account for more than half the effect of treatment in many situations. The placebo effect results from activation of opioid, cannabinoid, and dopaminergic pathways involved in reward, expectancy, conditioning, and pain modulation. Eleven specific anatomic features in the brain identified by positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are involved. Polymorphisms in the structural genes for catecholamine O-methyltransferase and fatty acid amide oxidase significantly influence the placebo response. The placebo effect may be important in symptom suppression in angina, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. In the absence of deliberate deception, there are no ethical issues and given its potency, the time has come to consider how best to use the placebo in clinical practice."

            "abstract": "The endogenous cannabimimetic compound, and anandamide analogue, N-palmitoyl-ethanolamine (PEA), was shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in experimental models of visceral, neuropathic and inflammatory pain by acting via several possible mechanisms. However, only scant data have been reported on the regulation of PEA levels during pathological conditions in animals or, particularly, humans. We review the current literature on PEA and report the results of three separate studies indicating that its concentrations are significantly increased during three different inflammatory and neuropathic conditions, two of which have been assessed in humans, and one in a mouse model. In patients affected with chronic low back pain, blood PEA levels were not significantly different from those of healthy volunteers, but were significantly and differentially increased (1.6-fold, P<0.01, N=10 per group) 30 min following an osteopathic manipulative treatment. In the second study, the paw skin levels of PEA in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathic pain were found to be significantly higher (1.5-fold, P<0.005, N=5) than those of control mice. In the third study, colonic PEA levels in biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis were found to be 1.8-fold higher (P<0.05, N=8-10) than those in healthy subjects. These heterogeneous data, together with previous findings reviewed here, substantiate the hypothesis that PEA is an endogenous mediator whose levels are increased following neuroinflammatory or neuropathic conditions in both animals and humans, possibly to exert a local anti-inflammatory and analgesic action."

Magnitude of effects were described as small, moderate, or large using previously defined criteria, and strength of evidence was assessed. Meta-analyses were conducted where data allowed, stratified by duration within each intervention type, using random effects models.

Function was not found to be improved with duloxetine for low back pain or pregabalin/gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Moderate improvement in quality of life was seen with duloxetine in patients with neuropathic pain, and small improvements in patients with osteoarthritis, but evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions for other drugs and conditions. While most comparisons of drugs and doses did not identify differences, diclofenac improved pain and function moderately more than celecoxib. In the intermediate term, limited evidence (1 RCT) showed memantine moderately improved pain, function, and quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia; improvements in pain, but not function, were maintained in the intermediate term with duloxetine and milnacipran for fibromyalgia. Other drugs studied, including acetaminophen (osteoarthritis), capsaicin (neuropathic pain), cannabis (neuropathic pain), amitriptyline (fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain), and cyclobenzaprine (fibromyalgia) had no clear effects. Withdrawal from study due to adverse events was significantly increased with nonopioid drugs, with the greatest increase over placebo seen with cannabis. Large increases in risk of adverse events were seen with pregabalin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, dizziness, peripheral edema, sedation, and weight gain), gabapentin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain), and cannabis (nausea, dizziness).

Improvement in function was not found with duloxetine for low back pain and pregabalin/gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Intermediate- and long-term outcomes were mostly not assessed. Increased incidence of drug class–specific adverse events led to withdrawal from treatment in some patients, suggesting that careful consideration of patient characteristics is needed in selecting nonopioid drug treatments."

More robust evidence exists for treatment of chronic pain conditions through meta-analysis and systemic reviews. Cannabinoid therapy exhibits moderate efficacy as a treatment for some chronic pain conditions. Investigations included a broad spectrum of chronic pain conditions, including neuropathic, musculoskeletal, inflammatory, and central pain conditions, and reveal reduction in pain and improvement of quality of life with limited adverse effects.

Future larger, higher quality clinical research studies with standardized pure extracts will better guide appropriate medical use going forward. At present, evidence for a multitude of therapeutic applications is emerging for cannabinoid treatment approaches. With emphasis placed on patient-centered clinical decisions, cannabinoids hold promise of treatment for athletes with chronic pain conditions. Clinicians who treat the athletic community must consider legal and ethical issues when discussing and recommending the use of cannabinoids, with acknowledgment of inconsistencies in purity of various formulations and concerns of drug testing."

It occurs at all stages of the disease and can be an onset symptom preceding motor dysfunction. Pain is correlated with a deterioration in patients' quality of life and increased prevalence of depression. In the later stages of ALS, pain can be severe enough to require increased use of sedative and analgesic drugs, and is among the events that predict clinical deterioration and death. The site of pain depends on the pain type or underlying mechanism (eg, painful cramps, nociceptive pain, or neuropathic pain). Given the multifactorial nature of pain in patients with ALS, different treatments have been suggested, ranging from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs for neuropathic pain, opioids, and cannabinoids, to physical therapy strategies and preventive assistive devices. Further understanding of the pathophysiology is crucial to drive assessment in clinical trials of therapeutic strategies targeted at specific mechanisms and studies of individualised therapies."

Effects in humans are unclear. Dronabinol (DRO), a nonselective CBR agonist, inhibits colonic motility and sensation. The aim of this study was to compare effects of DRO and placebo (PLA) on colonic motility and sensation in healthy volunteers. Fifty-two volunteers were randomly assigned (double-blind) to a single dose of 7.5 mg DRO or PLA postoperative with concealed allocation. A balloon-manometric assembly placed into the descending colon allowed assessment of colonic compliance, motility, tone, and sensation before and 1 h after oral ingestion of medication, and during fasting, and for 1 h after 1,000-kcal meal. There was an overall significant increase in colonic compliance (P = 0.045), a borderline effect of relaxation in fasting colonic tone (P = 0.096), inhibition of postprandial colonic tone (P = 0.048), and inhibition of fasting and postprandial phasic pressure (P = 0.008 and 0.030, respectively). While DRO did not significantly alter thresholds for first gas or pain sensation, there was an increase in sensory rating for pain during random phasic distensions at all pressures tested and in both genders (P = 0.024). In conclusion, in humans the nonselective CBR agonist, DRO, relaxes the colon and reduces postprandial colonic motility and tone. Increase in sensation ratings to distension in the presence of relaxation of the colon suggests central modulation of perception. The potential for CBR to modulate colonic motor function in diarrheal disease such as irritable bowel syndrome deserves further study."

In recent years, a number of nations have introduced specific laws to allow patients to use cannabis preparations to treat a variety of medical conditions. In 2015, the Italian government authorized the use of cannabis to treat several diseases, including chronic pain generally, spasticity in multiple sclerosis, cachexia and anorexia among AIDS and cancer patients, glaucoma, Tourette syndrome, and certain types of epilepsy.

            "abstract": "Pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncommon inflammatory disorder characterized by neutrophilic infiltration of the skin. It can present as skin papules or pustules that progress into painful ulcers. 30-40% of the cases are associated with other systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and proliferative hematological disorders. Uniquely, this condition has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The rarity of this disorder poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We present a case of a 55-year-old female with a history of SLE and chronic right leg ulcer, presented with increased pain from the ulcer associated with a mild flare of her cutaneous lupus; examination revealed circumferential skin ulcer measuring about 25 cm extending around the right leg above the ankle with prominent fibrinous material and surrounding erythema. Blood work showed elevated WBC with neutrophilic predominance. Serology revealed a positive ANA, elevated RNP, smith, and SSA/Ro antibodies with normal anti-CCP level. Skin biopsy was taken, and it showed a diffuse neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. The patient was then treated with topical and systemic steroids and sequentially with dapsone, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and cyclosporine for over a two-year period but failed to show any improvement. Therefore, a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy was attempted and produced a dramatic response after two-month infusions characterized by shrinking in the size of the ulcer and resolving pain. We believe that refractory PG poses a therapeutic challenge, and despite a lack of specific guidelines, IVIG can be attempted if initial suppressive treatment fails to show signs of improvement."

Urban and Hashold have shown that it is a safe, simplified alternative to dorsal column stimulation, especially because laminectomy is not required if the electrodes are inserted percutaneously. Percutaneous epidural neurostimulation is also advantageous because there can be a diagnostic trial period before permanent internalization and implantation. This diagnostic and therapeutic modality has been used in 36 patients during the past 3 years at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Eleven of these patients had acute intractable pain, which was defined as pain of less than 1 year in duration. Initial postimplantation results from the 36 patients indicate that spinal epidural neurostimulation is most effective in treating the intractable pain of diabetes, arachnoiditis, and post-traumatic and postamputation neuroma. Long term follow-up, varying from 1 year to 3 years postimplantation in the 20 initially responding patients, indicates that the neurostimulation continues to provide significant pain relief (50% or greater) in a majority of the patients who experienced initial significant pain relief."

Additionally, the included studies were extremely heterogeneous. Only 7 studies reported on the patients' history of prior consumption of CBMs. Furthermore, since cannabinoids are surrounded by considerable controversy in the media and society, cannabinoids have marked effects, so that inadequate blinding of the placebo could constitute an important source of limitation in these types of studies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The current systematic review suggests that CBMs might be effective for chronic pain treatment, based on limited evidence, primarily for neuropathic pain (NP) patients.

Since the introduction of Computer-Controlled Local Anesthetic Delivery Systems to dentistry, many studies have compared its efficacy and safety to conventional anesthesia. However, very few studies have compared single tooth anesthesia (STA) and traditional local anesthesia.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      To compare pain rating, changes in blood pressure, and heart rate during the local anesthetic injection. The secondary objectives were to measure the patients' level of satisfaction and the differences in anesthetic efficiency between the STA system and traditional local infiltration.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A randomized controlled trial was conducted and a total of 80 patients with dental restorative needs were enrolled for the study. The patients were evaluated for their general physical status and oral clinical findings before enrollment. Information regarding perceived pain, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, and patients' satisfaction was collected using an electronic data form and was analyzed using paired and unpaired t-tests.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No significant difference was noted in perceived pain (P = 0.59) and systolic blood pressure (P = 0.09) during anesthetic injection using both traditional and STA techniques. STA patients had a significantly higher heart rate during anesthesia, although a statistically significant difference was noted among the traditional anesthesia and the STA groups even before anesthesia. During the restorative procedure, less pain was perceived by STA patients on the Wong-Baker FACES pain scale, which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Analyses of post-procedure patient responses showed that STA patients had a significantly better treatment experience and preferred to have the same method of injection in the future (P = 0.04).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      STA system can provide less painful and more comfortable restorative treatment procedures in comparison to the traditional infiltration technique."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoids are emerging as potential options for neuropathic pain treatment. This study evaluated an oral cannabinoid, nabilone, in the treatment of refractory human diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPN). We performed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study with an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design. DPN subjects with a pain score ≥ 4 (0-10 scale) continued regular pain medications and were administered single-blinded adjuvant nabilone for 4 weeks. Subjects achieving ≥ 30% pain relief (26/37) were then randomized and treated with either flexible-dose nabilone 1-4 mg/day (n=13) or placebo (n=13) in a further 5-week double-blind treatment period, with 30% (11/37) of subjects deemed run-in-phase nabilone nonresponders. For nabilone run-in-phase responders, there was an improvement in the change in mean end-point neuropathic pain vs placebo (mean treatment reduction of 1.27; 95% confidence interval 2.29-0.25, P=0.02), with an average nabilone dose at end point of 2.9 ± 1.1mg/day, and improvements from baseline for the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Medical Outcomes Study sleep scale problems index, and the European Quality of Life-5-Domains index score (each P<0.05). Nabilone run-in-phase responders reported greater global end-point improvement with nabilone than with placebo (100% vs 31%; P<0.05). Medication-related confusion led to discontinuation in 2/37 subjects during single-blind nabilone treatment. Potential unmasking occurred in 62% of both groups. Flexible-dose nabilone 1-4 mg/day was effective in relieving DPN symptoms, improving disturbed sleep, quality of life, and overall patient status. Nabilone was well tolerated and successful as adjuvant in patients with DPN."

The conduct and reporting of each test was done blind to other test results. Clinically significant cancer was defined as Gleason score ≥4 + 3 or a maximum cancer core length 6 mm or longer.

            "abstract": "Cannabis sativa and its extracts have been used for centuries, both medicinally and recreationally. There is accumulating evidence that exogenous cannabis and related cannabinoids improve symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], such as pain, loss of appetite, and diarrhoea. In vivo, exocannabinoids have been demonstrated to improve colitis, mainly in chemical models. Exocannabinoids signal through the endocannabinoid system, an increasingly understood network of endogenous lipid ligands and their receptors, together with a number of synthetic and degradative enzymes and the resulting products. Modulating the endocannabinoid system using pharmacological receptor agonists, genetic knockout models, or inhibition of degradative enzymes have largely shown improvements in colitis in vivo. Despite these promising experimental results, this has not translated into meaningful benefits for human IBD in the few clinical trials which have been conducted to date, the largest study being limited by poor medication tolerance due to the Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol component. This review article synthesises the current literature surrounding the modulation of the endocannabinoid system and administration of exocannabinoids in experimental and human IBD. Findings of clinical surveys and studies of cannabis use in IBD are summarised. Discrepancies in the literature are highlighted together with identifying novel areas of interest."

            "abstract": "Cannabis has been employed medicinally throughout history, but its recent legal prohibition, biochemical complexity and variability, quality control issues, previous dearth of appropriately powered randomised controlled trials, and lack of pertinent education have conspired to leave clinicians in the dark as to how to advise patients pursuing such treatment. With the advent of pharmaceutical cannabis-based medicines (Sativex/nabiximols and Epidiolex), and liberalisation of access in certain nations, this ignorance of cannabis pharmacology and therapeutics has become untenable. In this article, the authors endeavour to present concise data on cannabis pharmacology related to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) et al., methods of administration (smoking, vaporisation, oral), and dosing recommendations. Adverse events of cannabis medicine pertain primarily to THC, whose total daily dose-equivalent should generally be limited to 30mg/day or less, preferably in conjunction with CBD, to avoid psychoactive sequelae and development of tolerance. CBD, in contrast to THC, is less potent, and may require much higher doses for its adjunctive benefits on pain, inflammation, and attenuation of THC-associated anxiety and tachycardia. Dose initiation should commence at modest levels, and titration of any cannabis preparation should be undertaken slowly over a period of as much as two weeks. Suggestions are offered on cannabis-drug interactions, patient monitoring, and standards of care, while special cases for cannabis therapeutics are addressed: epilepsy, cancer palliation and primary treatment, chronic pain, use in the elderly, Parkinson disease, paediatrics, with concomitant opioids, and in relation to driving and hazardous activities."

Fibromyalgia is an extremely prevalent rheumatic disease with a predisposition for comorbid anxiety and depression, which are known risk factors for suicidal behavior. Suicidality and relevant risk factors for suicidal behavior have not been thoroughly studied in patients with fibromyalgia. Objectives: To investigate the risk of suicidal ideation and attempts in patients with fibromyalgia. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the \"Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses\" (PRISMA) standards. Also, the gray literature was extensively searched. Results: Thirteen studies were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis, including 394,087 fibromyalgia patients. Sample size ranged from 44 to 199,739 subjects, mean age ranged from 45.8 to 54.5 years while the female percentage with fibromyalgia ranged from 17.1 to 100.0%. The overall suicide ideation prevalence was 29.57% (95%CI 1.84-72.07), with an OR 9.12 of (95%CI 1.42-58.77), ranging from 2.34 (95%CI 1.49-3.66) to 26.89 (95%CI 5.72-126.42). Pooled suicide attempt prevalence was 5.69% [95%CI 1.26-31.34], with an OR of 3.12 [95%CI 1.37-7.12]. Suicide risk was higher with respect to the general population with an OR of 36.77 (95%CI 15.55-96.94), as well as suicide events with an HR of 1.38 (95%CI 1.17-1.71). Determinants of suicidality were found to be: employment status, disease severity, obesity and drug dependence, chronic pain and co-morbidities, in particular depression, anxiety, poor sleep, and global mental health. However, in some cases, after adjusting for psychiatric conditions, the threshold of statistical significance was not achieved. Conclusion: Fibromyalgia patients are particularly prone to suicide, in terms of ideation, attempt, risk and events, warranting a pre-emptive screening of their mental health status. Given the few studies available, the high amount of heterogeneity, the evidence of publications bias and the lack of statistical significance when adjusting for underlying psychiatric co-morbidities, further high-quality studies should be conducted.

A total of 91 publications containing 104 studies were eligible (n = 9958 participants), including 47 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 57 observational studies. Forty-eight studies examined neuropathic pain, 7 studies examined fibromyalgia, 1 rheumatoid arthritis, and 48 other CNCP (13 multiple sclerosis-related pain, 6 visceral pain, and 29 samples with mixed or undefined CNCP). Across RCTs, pooled event rates (PERs) for 30% reduction in pain were 29.0% (cannabinoids) vs 25.9% (placebo); significant effect for cannabinoids was found; number needed to treat to benefit was 24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15-61); for 50% reduction in pain, PERs were 18.2% vs 14.4%; no significant difference was observed. Pooled change in pain intensity (standardised mean difference: -0.14, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.08) was equivalent to a 3 mm reduction on a 100 mm visual analogue scale greater than placebo groups.

There were no significant impacts on physical or emotional functioning, and low-quality evidence of improved sleep and patient global impression of change. Evidence for effectiveness of cannabinoids in CNCP is limited.

A telephone survey was conducted for pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments utilized in the last 12 months for each participant's three worst pains and the perceived helpfulness of each treatment for each pain.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred ninety (49%) participants reported at least one nonNeuP (Spinal Cord Injury Pain Instrument score < 2) in the previous 7 days. NSAIDs/aspirin, acetaminophen, opioids, and cannabinoids were the most commonly used and helpful pharmacologic treatments for overall nonNeuP locations (helpful in 77-89% of treated pains). Body position adjustment, passive exercise, massage, resistive exercise, and heat therapy were reported as the most commonly used non-pharmacological treatments for nonNeuPs. Heat therapy, aerobic exercise, massage, and body position adjustment were the most helpful non-pharmacological treatments for overall nonNeuP locations (helpful in 71-80% of treated pains). Perceived helpfulness of treatments varied by pain locations, which may be due to different mechanisms underlying pains in different locations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Results of the study may help guide clinicians in selecting pain-specific treatments for nonNeuPs. The self-reported helpfulness of heat therapy, exercise, and massage suggests a possible direction for clinical trials investigating these treatments of nonNeuP while limiting the side effects accompanying pharmacologic treatments."

            "abstract": "It is difficult to assess acute therapeutic intervention therapy, particularly in patients with unstable angina. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility of a pain-scoring method and to compare the response to sublingual administration of an isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) tablet, ISDN spray or nitroglycerin (NTG) spray. Pain scoring was assessed by the subjective grading of the patients' pain severity from 1 to 10. We studied 205 patients (mean age 66 +/- 13 years). Pain attenuation, defined as at least 50% reduction in pain intensity, occurred in the ISDN tablet, ISDN spray and NTG spray groups after 360 +/- 290, 318 +/- 289 and 233 +/- 271 s, respectively (p = 0.0005). In conclusion, pain scoring is a feasible and useful clinical method to assess antianginal therapy in unstable angina patients. Sublingual nitrate sprays, particularly NTG, seem to alleviate anginal pain faster than ISDN tablets in this patient population."

            "abstract": "Buerger's disease (BD) etiologies are poorly understood. Beyond smoking cessation, medical-surgical treatments have limited success. We hypothesized that mutations associated with arterial vasospasm (stromelysin-1 5A/6A, eNOS T-786C) and C677T-A1298C methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) interacted with cigarette-cannabis smoking, reducing vasodilatory nitric oxide (NO), promoting arterial spasm-thrombosis. Of 21 smoking BD patients (14 men [2 siblings], 7 women; 20 white, 1 African-American), compared to 21 age-gender-race matched healthy controls, 5A/6A stromelysin- 1 homozygosity was present in 7 of 21 (33%) BD cases versus 5 of 21 (24%) controls (risk ratio 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-3.7), and eNOS T-786C homozygosity was present in 3 of 21 (14%) BD cases versus 1 of 21 (5%) controls (risk ratio 3.0; 95% CI 0.3-26.6). C677T MTHFR homozygosity or compound C677T-A1298C heterozygosity was present in 7 of 21 cases (33%) versus 11 of 21 controls (52%) (risk ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.3-1.3). In 18 patients who stopped and 3 who continued smoking, all stromelysin-1 5A/6A and/or eNOS heterozygotes-homozygotes, superficial phlebitis, lower limb gangrenous ulcers, and intractable ischemic rest pain with arterial occlusion progressed despite conventional medical therapy, threatening amputation. In 15 patients, to increase vasodilatory NO via endothelial NO synthase, l-arginine (15 g/day) was given, along with folic acid (5 mg), vitamin B6 (100 mg), and B12 (2000 mg/day) to optimize homocysteine metabolism and reduce asymmetric dimethylarginine, a NO synthase inhibitor. Unexpectedly quickly and strikingly, within 8 weeks to 8 months receiving l-arginine-folic acid, 11 of 15 treated patients improved with uniform pain reduction, ulcer healing, and in 5, full recovery of previously absent peripheral pulses. In smokers homo/heterozygous for stromelysin-1 5A/6A and eNOS T-786C mutations, we speculate that the development and severity of BD are related to a gene-environment vasospastic interaction with reduced NO-mediated vasodilatation. Increasing NO production by l-arginine while optimizing homocysteine metabolism by folic acid-B6-B12 may have therapeutic benefit. Further blinded, placebo-controlled studies are needed to determine whether our observations can be generalized to larger BD cohorts."

            "abstract": "In the last decades, a lot of attention has been paid to the compounds present in medicinal Cannabis sativa L., such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), and their effects on inflammation and cancer-related pain. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) currently recognizes medicinal C. sativa as an effective treatment for providing relief in a number of symptoms associated with cancer, including pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, and anxiety. Several studies have described CBD as a multitarget molecule, acting as an adaptogen, and as a modulator, in different ways, depending on the type and location of disequilibrium both in the brain and in the body, mainly interacting with specific receptor proteins CB1 and CB2. CBD is present in both medicinal and fibre-type C. sativa plants, but, unlike Δ9-THC, it is completely nonpsychoactive. Fibre-type C. sativa (hemp) differs from medicinal C. sativa, since it contains only few levels of Δ9-THC and high levels of CBD and related nonpsychoactive compounds. In recent years, a number of preclinical researches have been focused on the role of CBD as an anticancer molecule, suggesting CBD (and CBD-like molecules present in the hemp extract) as a possible candidate for future clinical trials. CBD has been found to possess antioxidant activity in many studies, thus suggesting a possible role in the prevention of both neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. In animal models, CBD has been shown to inhibit the progression of several cancer types. Moreover, it has been found that coadministration of CBD and Δ9-THC, followed by radiation therapy, causes an increase of autophagy and apoptosis in cancer cells. In addition, CBD is able to inhibit cell proliferation and to increase apoptosis in different types of cancer models. These activities seem to involve also alternative pathways, such as the interactions with TRPV and GRP55 receptor complexes. Moreover, the finding that the acidic precursor of CBD (cannabidiolic acid, CBDA) is able to inhibit the migration of breast cancer cells and to downregulate the proto-oncogene c-fos and the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) highlights the possibility that CBDA might act on a common pathway of inflammation and cancer mechanisms, which might be responsible for its anticancer activity. In the light of all these findings, in this review we explore the effects and the molecular mechanisms of CBD on inflammation and cancer processes, highlighting also the role of minor cannabinoids and noncannabinoids constituents of Δ9-THC deprived hemp."

Patients were evaluated for effective pain relief [numerical rating scale (NRS) < 3] by 0 - 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) and functional improvement by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Effective pain relief [numeric rating scale (NRS) < 3] was observed in 77.3% (95% CI: 67‒90.5%) of patients in PIL group and 74.2% (95% CI: 62.4 - 89.4%) of patients in the TF group (P = 0.34), at 4 weeks. Mean NRS score was not significantly different between the PIL group compared to the TF group, at 4 weeks (P = 0.19). Number of patients with improved disability (measured by ODI < 20%) was not significantly different in PIL group (78% of cases) compared to the TF group (76% of cases), at 4 weeks (P = 0.21). There were no adverse effects observed in any of our patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The PIL epidural injection is as effective as TF epidural injection in improving pain and functional status, in patients with chronic lumbosacral low back pain, due to disc degeneration."

This condition is an excellent human model of central neuropathic pain as it represents an unusually homogenous group in terms of anatomical location of injury, pain descriptions and patient demographics. Forty-eight patients with at least one avulsed root and baseline pain score of four or more on an 11-point ordinate scale participated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three period crossover study. All patients had intractable symptoms regardless of current analgesic therapy. Patients entered a baseline period of 2 weeks, followed by three, 2-week treatment periods during each of which they received one of three oromucosal spray preparations. These were placebo and two whole plant extracts of Cannabis sativa L.: GW-1000-02 (Sativex), containing Delta(9)tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):cannabidiol (CBD) in an approximate 1:1 ratio and GW-2000-02, containing primarily THC. The primary outcome measure was the mean pain severity score during the last 7 days of treatment. Secondary outcome measures included pain related quality of life assessments. The primary outcome measure failed to fall by the two points defined in our hypothesis. However, both this measure and measures of sleep showed statistically significant improvements. The study medications were generally well tolerated with the majority of adverse events, including intoxication type reactions, being mild to moderate in severity and resolving spontaneously. Studies of longer duration in neuropathic pain are required to confirm a clinically relevant, improvement in the treatment of this condition."

However, there is a lack of research using individual-level data to explore this question. We aimed to investigate the longitudinal association between frequency of cannabis use and illicit opioid use among people who use drugs (PWUD) experiencing chronic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      This study included data from people in 2 prospective cohorts of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada, who reported major or persistent pain from June 1, 2014, to December 1, 2017 (n = 1,152). We used descriptive statistics to examine reasons for cannabis use and a multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects model to estimate the relationship between daily (once or more per day) cannabis use and daily illicit opioid use. There were 424 (36.8%) women in the study, and the median age at baseline was 49.3 years (IQR 42.3-54.9). In total, 455 (40%) reported daily illicit opioid use, and 410 (36%) reported daily cannabis use during at least one 6-month follow-up period. The most commonly reported therapeutic reasons for cannabis use were pain (36%), sleep (35%), stress (31%), and nausea (30%). After adjusting for demographic characteristics, substance use, and health-related factors, daily cannabis use was associated with significantly lower odds of daily illicit opioid use (adjusted odds ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.74, p < 0.001). Limitations of the study included self-reported measures of substance use and chronic pain, and a lack of data for cannabis preparations, dosages, and modes of administration.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We observed an independent negative association between frequent cannabis use and frequent illicit opioid use among PWUD with chronic pain.

It is unclear whether epidural or systemic pain therapy is superior in terms of postoperative pain relief, patients' comfort and side effects. A new therapeutic approach, intraarticular opioids, has been suggested with the detection of opioid receptors in inflamed tissue. This method has proven suitable for clinical use in small operations (e.g. knee arthroscopy). In this study, we compared epidural analgesia and intraarticular application of morphine plus \"on-demand\" intravenous analgesia to \"on-demand\" intravenous analgesia alone.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-seven patients, scheduled for total knee arthroplasty, were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: in group 1 (EPI) patients received bolus doses of morphine via an epidural catheter; in group 2 (IA) an intraarticular bolus of 1 mg of morphine was applied at the end of the operation with subsequent use of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump; group 3 (Control), in which only PCA was provided, served as control for both analgesic procedures.

After baseline measurements, nicardipine or nitroglycerin was administered by randomized continuous infusion beginning at 10 micrograms/min titrated to achieve a 10 to 12% reduction in systemic arterial pressure. Hemodynamic measurements and angiography were then repeated. Nicardipine did not change heart rate, and a small decrease (82 +/- 4 vs 75 +/- 4 beats/min) was observed with nitroglycerin, whereas mean arterial pressure decreased similarly (-11%) in both groups. Nicardipine increased (+13%) and nitroglycerin decreased (-21%) cardiac output. Although both drugs were associated with significant reductions in pulmonary artery wedge and pulmonary artery pressures, changes were greater with nitroglycerin for pulmonary artery wedge (-49% vs -26%) and pulmonary artery (-39% vs -13%) pressures, whereas only nitroglycerin reduced right atrial pressure significantly. Neither drug altered left ventricular ejection fraction or pulmonary vascular resistance, and only nicardipine decreased systemic vascular resistance significantly. Quantitative coronary angiography (videodensitometry) showed dilation of the left main, proximal, mid and distal anterior descending and circumflex segments by both nitroglycerin and nicardipine. Nicardipine dilated small (< 2 mm2) and large (> 2) arterial segments equally, whereas nitroglycerin showed a proportionately greater effect on small vessels."

Frequent acute pain with chronic pain causes significant physical and psychological morbidity, and frequent health-care utilization. Available pharmacologic therapies reduce acute pain frequency but few evidence-based therapies are available for chronic pain. Areas covered: An extensive PubMed literature search was performed with appropriate search criteria. The pathophysiology of acute pain from VOC in SCD is very complex with many events subsequent to sickle polymer formation. Sensitization of pain pathways and alterations of brain networks contributes to the experience of chronic pain. Numerous therapies targeting putative VOC mechanisms are in clinical trials, and show considerable promise. Alternative analgesic treatments for acute and chronic pain have been examined in small patient cohorts, but formal clinical trials are lacking. Expert opinion: Childhood is likely a critical window for prevention of acute and later chronic pain. New multimodal analgesic therapies are needed, particularly for chronic pain, and should be examined in clinical trials. Given the multifactorial nature of both pain and VOC, simultaneously targeting multiple mechanisms may be the optimal approach for effective preventive therapies."

From the results of experimental studies it was concluded that glutamine (Gln) enhances the production of T-cell cytokines in conditions of Gln deprivation. The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the role of a perioperative Gln infusion on intracellular inflammatory T-cell cytokine expression in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery and to evaluate the effects on systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction and ICU length of stay.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we included 78 patients (age level older than 70 years, ejection fraction less than 40%, or mitral valve replacement) undergoing elective cardiosurgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Several of these trials had positive results, suggesting that marijuana or cannabinoids may be efficacious for these indications.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      Medical marijuana is used to treat a host of indications, a few of which have evidence to support treatment with marijuana and many that do not. Physicians should educate patients about medical marijuana to ensure that it is used appropriately and that patients will benefit from its use."

            "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), which is nonintoxicating pharmacologically relevant constituents of Cannabis, demonstrates several beneficial effects. It has been found to have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. As the medicinal use of CBD is gaining popularity for treatment of various disorders, the recent flare-up of largely unproven and unregulated cannabis-based preparations on medical therapeutics may have its greatest impact in the field of neurology. Currently, as lot of clinical trials are underway, CBD demonstrates remarkable potential to become a supplemental therapy in various neurological conditions. It has shown promise in the treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, chronic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, epilepsy, and essential tremors as well as psychiatric disorders. While recent FDA-approved prescription drugs have demonstrated safety, efficacy, and consistency enough for regulatory approval in spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS) and in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes (LGS), many therapeutic challenges still remain. In the current review, the authors have shed light on the application of CBD in the management and treatment of various neurological disorders."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The ongoing opioid overdose crisis is driven largely by exposure to illicitly-manufactured fentanyl. Preliminary observational and experimental research suggests that cannabis could potentially play a role in reducing use of prescription opioids among individuals with chronic pain. However, there is limited data on the effects of cannabis on illicit opioid consumption, particularly fentanyl, especially among individuals on opioid agonist therapy (OAT). We sought to assess the longitudinal association between cannabis use and exposure to fentanyl among people on OAT.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data were drawn from two community-recruited prospective cohorts of people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada. We used generalized linear mixed-effects modeling, adjusted by relevant confounders, to investigate the relationship between cannabis use and recent fentanyl exposure (both assessed by urine drug testing) among participants on OAT between 2016 and 2018.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among the 819 participants on OAT who contributed 1989 observations over the study period, fentanyl exposure was common. At the baseline interview, fentanyl was detected in a majority of participants (431, 53 %), with lower prevalence among individuals with urine drug tests positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (47 vs. 56 %, p = 0.028). Over all study interviews, cannabis use was independently associated with reduced likelihood of being recently exposed to fentanyl (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio = 0.91, 95 % Confidence Interval: 0.83 - 0.99).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Participants on OAT using cannabis had significantly lower risk of being exposed to fentanyl. Our findings reinforce the need for experimental trials to investigate the potential benefits and risks of controlled cannabinoid administration for people on OAT."

            "title": "Opiate dependence in schizophrenia: case presentation and literature review.",
            "abstract": "In the past decade opioid pain reliever misuse among the U.S. population has increased to epidemic proportions. While the U.S. has only 4% of the world's population, Americans consume 86% of the world's opioids. In 2011, approximately 13 million people (5% of the U.S. population) reported nonmedical use of prescription opioids, which are now the second most commonly abused class of drug behind cannabis. There has been little in the way of formal study examining the association between mental illness and prescription opiate abuse, but preliminary evidence suggests a strong association. Neurobiological processes involved in psychosis and opiate abuse may partially explain this association. Despite compelling evidence of the growth in opiate misuse and the potential relationship with mental illness, patients with mental disorders and/or substance abuse are routinely excluded from randomized trials, making it impossible to better understand these phenomena. Treatment guidelines, especially regarding opioid agonists such as methadone and buprenorphine for people with mental illness, are woefully inadequate. We present the case of a young man with schizoaffective disorder who sustained an injury and developed chronic back pain. Opioids were prescribed and he quickly progressed to abusing increasing doses of opioids, which eventually led to daily heroin use. The young man struggled with repeated relapses, serious use-related consequences and suicide attempts. This case highlights the role of chronic pain and opioid prescribing, the segue from prescribed use to abuse and dependence, and the transition to heroin use. It demonstrates the difficulty patients may have in obtaining adequate treatment for co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse and how outcomes are improved when treatment is integrated to address both disorders. Comprehensive treatment must involve a combination of case management and medical management, including possible opioid replacement therapy."

Their data were entered into a database and analyzed, including age, gender, indications for surgery, operative time, blood loss, intraoperative complications, conversion rates, and postoperative complications (defined as complications occurring up to 1 month after surgery). Histologic results and outpatient follow-up were also recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Mean age at surgery was 63 years (range 21-89 years). The indications for surgery included solid renal masses in 64 cases, non-functioning kidneys in 35, and collecting system or ureteral tumors in 11; and the procedures performed were radical nephrectomy, simple nephrectomy, or nephroureterectomy, respectively. The mean operative time was 125 minutes (range 70-310 minutes). Intraoperative complications were recorded in eight cases (7.3%), including vascular injuries of the renal artery in two, and of the renal vein, inferior vena cava and right adrenal vein in one case each. Injury of the large bowel and splenic hylus was recorded in one case and malfunction of the vascular endoGIA stapler leading to severe bleeding in one case. Nine cases were converted to open surgery (8.2%), four of them urgently due to intraoperative complications, while in another five cases conversions were elective following poor progression of the laparoscopic procedure. Comparison of the complication rate at follow-up between the initial 50 and the last 60 patients revealed no change. The conversion rate dropped significantly along the learning curve with 7 cases converted among the initial 50 patients, versus 2 in the last 60. There was no perioperative mortality. In two cases we recorded major postoperative complications, including pneumothorax treated by insertion of a thoracic drain and incarcerated inguinal hernia treated by surgery, while minor complications were seen in five patients. Histologic examination showed renal cell carcinoma pT1-T3a in 62 patients, oncocytoma in 5, transitional cell carcinoma T1G2-T3G3N1 in 10, renal sarcoma in 1, metastasis from lung tumor in 1, and end-stage kidney in the remainder. Negative margins were obtained in all cases.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Laparoscopic nephrectomy may be currently considered a routine, safe and effective procedure associated with minimal morbidity. The conversion rate seemed to drop significantly after 50 cases. In view of the inherent benefits for patients, in terms of reduced pain level, faster recovery and improved cosmetic results, the laparoscopic approach has become the standard approach for nephrectomy in our institution."

Despite this growth in evidence, the findings and conclusions of these studies have been inconsistent. In this paper, we outline the current evidence for medical cannabis and cannabis-based medicines in the treatment and management of chronic non-cancer pain. We discuss limitations of the current evidence, including limitations of randomised control trials in the field, limits on generalisability of previous findings and common issues such as problems with measurements of dose and type of cannabinoids. We discuss future directions for medicinal cannabinoid research, including addressing limitations in trial design; developing frameworks to monitor for use disorder and other unintended outcomes; and considering endpoints other than 30% or 50% reductions in pain severity."

            "abstract": "Neuropathy is defined as the damage to the peripheral or central nervous system accompanied by pain, numbness, or muscle weakness, which can be due to congenital diseases or environmental factors such as diabetes, trauma, or viral infections. As current treatments are not sufficiently able to control the disease, studies focusing on the identification and discovery of new therapeutic agents are necessary. Natural products have been used for a long time for the management of different neurological problems including neuropathies. The aim of the present study is to review the current clinical data on the beneficial effects of medicinal plants in neuropathy. Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched with the keywords 'neuropathy' in the title/abstract and 'plant' or 'extract' or 'herb' in the whole text from inception until August 2017. From a total of 3679 papers, 22 studies were finally included. Medicinal plants were evaluated clinically in several types of neuropathy, including diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, and HIV-associated neuropathy. Some studies reported the improvement in pain, nerve function, nerve conduction velocity, and quality of life. Cannabis sativa (hemp), Linum usitatissimum (linseed oil), capsaicin, and a polyherbal Japanese formulation called Goshajinkigan had the most evidence regarding their clinical efficacy. Other investigated herbal medicines in neuropathy, such as Matricaria chamomilla (chamomile), Curcuma longa (turmeric), and Citrullus colocynthis (colocynth), had only one clinical trial. Thus, future studies are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of such natural medicines as a complementary or alternative treatment for neuropathy."

            "abstract": "Placebo analgesia is mediated by both opioid and nonopioid mechanisms, but so far nothing is known about the nonopioid component. Here we show that the specific CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (rimonabant or SR141716) blocks nonopioid placebo analgesic responses but has no effect on opioid placebo responses. These findings suggest that the endocannabinoid system has a pivotal role in placebo analgesia in some circumstances when the opioid system is not involved."

In humanized mouse models of SCD, a synthetic cannabinoid has been found to attenuate both chronic and acute hyperalgesia. The effect of cannabis on chronic pain in adults with SCD is unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To determine whether inhaled cannabis is more effective than inhaled placebo in relieving chronic pain in adults with SCD.\n    \n\n\n          Design, setting, and participants:\n        \n      \n      This pilot randomized clinical trial included participants with SCD with chronic pain admitted to a single inpatient clinical research center for 2 separate 5-day stays from August 2014 to April 2017. Participants inhaled either vaporized cannabis (4.4% Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol to 4.9% cannabidiol) 3 times daily or vaporized placebo cannabis. Pain and pain interference ratings using the Brief Pain Inventory were assessed throughout each 5-day period. Participants with SCD and chronic pain on stable analgesics were eligible to enroll.

            "abstract": "Placebo analgesia is an indicator of how efficiently the brain translates psychological signals conveyed by a treatment procedure into pain relief. It has been demonstrated that functional connectivity between distributed brain regions predicts placebo analgesia in chronic back pain patients. Greater network efficiency in baseline brain networks may allow better information transfer and facilitate adaptive physiological responses to psychological aspects of treatment. Here, we theorized that topological network alignments in resting state scans predict psychologically conditioned analgesic responses to acupuncture treatment in chronic knee osteoarthritis pain patients (n = 45). Analgesia was induced by building positive expectations toward acupuncture treatment with verbal suggestion and heat pain conditioning on a test site of the arm. This procedure induced significantly more analgesia after sham or real acupuncture on the test site than in a control site. The psychologically conditioned analgesia was invariant to sham versus real treatment. Efficiency of information transfer within local networks calculated with graph-theoretic measures (local efficiency and clustering coefficients) significantly predicted conditioned analgesia. Clustering coefficients in regions associated with memory, motivation, and pain modulation were closely involved in predicting analgesia. Moreover, women showed higher clustering coefficients and marginally greater pain reduction than men. Overall, analgesic response to placebo cues can be predicted from a priori resting state data by observing local network topology. Such low-cost synchronizations may represent preparatory resources that facilitate subsequent performance of brain circuits in responding to adaptive environmental cues. This suggests a potential utility of network measures in predicting placebo response for clinical use."

Thirty-three days after starting immunochemoradiotherapy (ACNU, VCR, IFN -beta, radiation), she developed neutropenia (1,000/microliters). Administration of G-CSF at doses of 125-250 micrograms/day led to an increase of peripheral neutrophil counts. Eleven days later, the patient developed sudden severe respiratory failure and cyanosis with worsening of lung shadows. Blood gas levels on room air were PaO2 49.3mmHg, PaCO2 28.0mmHg, and pH 7.46. At this time, her neutrophil count had risen to 26,080/microliters. LDH and alpha - HBD had also increased to 1,439 IU/l and 1,117IU/l respectively. Chest radiograph and CT scan demonstrated interstitial pneumonia. After treatment with methyl prednisolone, her respiratory symptoms were gradually resolved.

Symptomatic therapy of one MS symptom can cause or worsen other unwanted symptoms (anticholinergics used for bladder dysfunction produce impairment of cognition, many MS drugs produce erectile dysfunction, etc.). Appropriate symptomatic therapy is an unmet need. Several important functions/symptoms (muscle tone, sleep, bladder, pain) are mediated, in great part, in the brainstem. Cannabinoid receptors are distributed throughout the CNS irregularly: There is an accumulation of CB1 and CB2 receptors in the brainstem. Nabiximols (a combination of THC and CBD oromucosal spray) interact with both CB1 and CB2 receptors. In several clinical trials with Nabiximols for MS spasticity, the investigators report improvement not only in spasticity itself, but also in several functions/symptoms mentioned before (spasms, cramps, pain, gait, sleep, bladder function, fatigue, and possibly tremor). We can conceptualize and, therefore, hypothesize, through this indirect information, that it could be considered the existence of a broad \"Spasticity-Plus Syndrome\" that involves, a cluster of symptoms apart from spasticity itself, the rest of the mentioned functions/symptoms, probably because they are interlinked after the increase of muscle tone and mediated, at least in part, in the same or close areas of the brainstem. If this holds true, there exists the possibility to treat several spasticity-related symptoms induced by MS pathology with a single therapy, which would permit to avoid the unnecessary adverse effects produced by polytherapy.

It included both animal and human studies. Moreover, the Clinicaltrials.gov database was searched with the term 'endometriosis' for clinical trials on plant-derived agents. No restriction was set for the publication date.\n    \n\n\n          Outcomes:\n        \n      \n      Natural therapies can be assigned to three categories: (i) herbal extracts, (ii) specific plant-derived bioactive compounds and (iii) Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Agents of the first category have been shown to exert anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-oxidant effects on endometrial cells and endometriotic lesions. However, the existing evidence supporting their use in endometriosis therapy is quite limited. The most studied specific plant-derived bioactive compounds are resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, puerarin, ginsenosides, xanthohumol, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, quercetin, apigenin, carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, wogonin, baicalein, parthenolide, andrographolide and cannabinoids, with solid evidence about their inhibitory activity in experimental endometriosis models. Their mechanisms of action include pleiotropic effects on known signalling effectors: oestrogen receptor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1 and -6, tumour necrosis factor-α, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, nuclear factor-kappa B, matrix metalloproteinases as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis-related proteins. Numerous studies suggest that treatment with CHM is a good choice for endometriosis management. Even under clinical conditions, this approach has already been shown to decrease the size of endometriotic lesions, alleviate chronic pelvic pain and reduce postoperative recurrence rates.\n    \n\n\n          Wider implications:\n        \n      \n      The necessity to manage endometriosis as a chronic disease highlights the importance of identifying novel and affordable long-term safety therapeutics. For this purpose, natural plant-derived agents represent promising candidates. Many of these agents exhibit a pleiotropic action profile, which simultaneously inhibits fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, such as proliferation, inflammation, ROS formation and angiogenesis. Hence, their inclusion into multimodal treatment concepts may essentially contribute to increase the therapeutic efficiency and reduce the side effects of future endometriosis therapy."

One of the significant unmet needs in veterinary surgery and pain management is for longer acting opioids for cats to effectively bridge the gap between the in-hospital and at-home recovery periods. A proof of concept study of an extended release formulation of buprenorphine HCL (ER-Bup) was conducted using objective kinetic measures and a unilateral onychectomy model.

ER-Bup resulted in significantly decreased asymmetry in limb use during landing (PVF, p < 0.0001; VI, p < 0.0001) and walking (PVF, p = 0.0002, VI, p < 0.0001). The novel use of data collected following a jump from an elevated platform appeared to provide all desired information and was easier to collect than walking data.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study demonstrates that SC administration of ER-Bup may be an effective analgesic for a 72 h period postoperatively. Furthermore, landing onto a PSW from an elevated perch may be a useful and efficient way to assess analgesics in cats using a unilateral model of limb pain."

            "abstract": "This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study of the acute cognitive and subjective effects of nabilone 1-3 mg in healthy male volunteers. The Cognitive Drug Research computerised system (CDR system) was used to assess changes in attention, working and episodic memory. In addition, a number of self-ratings were conducted including those of mood, alertness and perceived drug effects. Impairments to attention, working and episodic memory and self-ratings of alertness were evident. Volunteers also experienced a number of subjective drug effects. These data demonstrate that acute doses of nabilone in the range 1-3 mg produce clear cognitive and subjective effects in healthy volunteers, and therefore they may be used as reference data in the future study of peripherally acting cannabinoids believed to be free from such effects."

            "abstract": "The plant Cannabis has been known for centuries to be beneficial in a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, including emesis, diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal pain. delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychotropic component of Cannabis, acts via at least two types of cannabinoid receptors, named CB1 and CB2 receptors. CB1 receptors are located primarily on central and peripheral neurons (including the enteric nervous system) where they modulate neurotransmitter release, whereas CB2 receptors are concerned with immune function, inflammation and pain. The discovery of endogenous ligands [i.e. anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG)] for these receptors indicates the presence of a functional endogenous cannabinoid system in the gastrointestinal tract. Anatomical and functional evidence suggests the presence of CB1 receptors in the myenteric plexus, which are associated with cholinergic neurons in a variety of species, including in humans. Activation of prejunctional CB1 receptors reduces excitatory enteric transmission (mainly cholinergic transmission) in different regions of the gastrointestinal tract. Consistently, in vivo studies have shown that cannabinoids reduce gastrointestinal transit in rodents through activation of CB1, but not CB2, receptors. However, in pathophysiological states, both CB1 and CB2 receptors could reduce the increase of intestinal motility induced by inflammatory stimuli. Cannabinoids also reduce gastrointestinal motility in randomized clinical trials. Overall, modulation of the gut endogenous cannabinoid system may provide a useful therapeutic target for disorders of gastrointestinal motility."

Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of MGLL leads to elevation in 2-AG in the central nervous system and corresponding reductions in arachidonic acid and eicosanoids, producing antinociceptive, anxiolytic, and antineuroinflammatory effects without inducing the full spectrum of psychoactive effects of direct cannabinoid receptor agonists. Here, we report the optimization of hexafluoroisopropyl carbamate-based irreversible inhibitors of MGLL, culminating in a highly potent, selective, and orally available, CNS-penetrant MGLL inhibitor, 28 (ABX-1431). Activity-based protein profiling experiments verify the exquisite selectivity of 28 for MGLL versus other members of the serine hydrolase class. In vivo, 28 inhibits MGLL activity in rodent brain (ED50 = 0.5-1.4 mg/kg), increases brain 2-AG concentrations, and suppresses pain behavior in the rat formalin pain model.

Further, the cannabinoid receptors are now molecularly and pharmacologically characterised and the cell processes involved in endocannabinoid transcription, synthesis, post-translational modification and protein expression are reported. Endogenous cannabinoids have been shown to have key roles in immune and pain pathways and neuro-behavioural signalling including appetite regulation. Significant recent interest has thus been shown in understanding these pathways to guide the development of agents that inhibit the natural catabolism of endogenous cannabinoids to modify pain and appetite, and to synthesise antagonists for the treatment of disease such as obesity. This research is concurrent with the renewed clinical interest in exogenous cannabinoids and their use in disease. However, the complex pharmacology and physiological effects of exogenous cannabinoids, either as individual components or in combination, as extracts or via administration of the whole plant in humans, are less well known. Yet as with all other therapeutics, including those derived from plants, knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the complete plant, the individual chemical molecules and their synthetic versions, including formulations and excipients is a standard part of drug development. This article covers the key pharmacological knowledge required to guide further exploration of the toxicity and efficacy of different cannabinoids and their formulations in blinded placebo-controlled studies."

From a Western perspective, such performative behavior can be understood principally as inducing patients' faith in the performer's supernatural healing powers and effecting positive changes through the same mechanisms attributed to the placebo response, which is defined as improvement of clinical outcome in individuals receiving inactive treatment. Here we examined the possibility of using theatrical performance tools, including stage directions and scripting, to reproducibly manipulate the style and content of a simulated doctor-patient encounter and influence the placebo response in experimental pain.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 122 healthy volunteers (18-45 years, 76 men) exposed to experimental pain (the cold pressor test) were assessed for pain threshold and tolerance before and after receiving a placebo cream from a \"doctor\" impersonated by a trained actor. The actor alternated between two distinct scripts and stage directions, i.e., performance styles created by a theater director/playwright, one emulating a standard doctor-patient encounter (scenario A) and the other emphasizing attentiveness and strong suggestion, elements also present in ritual healing (scenario B). The placebo response size was calculated as the %difference in pain threshold and tolerance after exposure relative to baseline.

As such, alternative pain treatments are increasingly desired. Although emerging research suggests that cannabinoids have therapeutic potential regarding pain, results from studies across pain populations have been inconsistent. To provide meta-analytic clarification regarding cannabis's impact on subjective pain, we identified studies that assessed drug-induced pain modulations under cannabinoid and corresponding placebo conditions. A literature search yielded 25 peer-reviewed records that underwent data extraction. Baseline and end-point data were used to compute standardized effect size estimates (Cohen's d) across cannabinoid administrations (k = 39) and placebo administrations (k = 26). Standardized effects were inverse-variance weighted and pooled across studies for meta-analytic comparison. Results revealed that cannabinoid administration produced a medium-to-large effect across included studies, Cohen's d = -0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.74, -0.43], while placebo administration produced a small-to-medium effect, Cohen's d = -0.39, 95% CI [-0.52, -0.26]. Meta-regression revealed that cannabinoids, β = -0.43, 95% CI [-0.62, -0.24], p < .05, synthetic cannabinoids, β = -0.39, 95% CI [-0.65, -0.14], p < .05, and sample size, β = 0.01, 95% CI [0.00, 0.01], p < .05, were associated with marked pain reduction. These outcomes suggest that cannabinoid-based pharmacotherapies may serve as effective replacement/adjunctive options regarding pain, however, additional research is warranted. Additionally, given demonstrated neurocognitive side effects associated with some constituent cannabinoids (i.e., THC), subsequent work may consider developing novel therapeutic agents that capitalize on cannabis's analgesic properties without producing adverse effects.

All endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair procedures were performed with the Endologix 21 F profile (outer diameter) sheath-based system. Patients were screened by computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction and independent physician review for anatomic suitability and adequate femoral artery anatomy for percutaneous access. The primary trial end point (treatment success) was defined as procedural technical success and absence of major adverse events and vascular complications at 30 days.

Methods: Participants (368 Cannabis Users; 170 Controls) completed an online survey assessing anxiety and depressive symptoms, cannabis product use, sleep, quality of life, and comorbid chronic pain. Participants that completed this baseline survey were then invited to complete additional follow-up surveys at 3-month intervals. Baseline differences between Cannabis Users and Controls were assessed using independent-samples t-tests and generalized linear mixed effects models were used to assess the impact of initiating cannabis product use, sustained use, or discontinuation of use on anxiety and depressive symptoms at follow-up. Results: Medicinal cannabis use was associated with lower self-reported depression, but not anxiety, at baseline. Medicinal cannabis users also reported superior sleep, quality of life, and less pain on average. Initiation of medicinal cannabis during the follow-up period was associated with significantly decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms, an effect that was not observed in Controls that never initiated cannabis use. Conclusions: Medicinal cannabis use may reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms in clinically anxious and depressed populations.

Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial beginning in residential settings (N=302) was used. Mood disorders were present in 33.6%, and anxiety disorders in 29.6%, with no differences among stimulant use disorder groups. Panic disorder was more frequently present with other stimulant use disorder. Those with two or more comorbid psychiatric disorders were more often female, White, had more symptoms of depression, greater propensity and risk for suicidal behavior, lower functioning in psychiatric and family domains, lower quality of life, more symptoms with stimulant abstinence and greater likelihood of marijuana dependence. Those with one or more comorbid disorders had more medical disorder burden, lower cognitive and physical functioning, greater pain, and higher rates of other drug dependence. With current comorbid psychiatric disorders, the morbidity of stimulant use disorders increases. Use of validated assessments near treatment entry, and a treatment plan targeting not only substance use and comorbid psychiatric disorders, but functional impairments, medical disorder burden and pain, may be useful."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Cannabis use results in elevation of heart rate and blood pressure immediately after use, primarily due to sympathetic nervous system stimulation and parasympathetic nervous system inhibition. These effects may precipitate cardiac dysrhythmia. The objective of our study was to analyze systematically the pertinent medical literature regarding the putative association between cannabis use and cardiac dysrhythmia.Methods: We queried PubMed, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey, and reviewed results for relevance. We graded clinical trials, observational and retrospective studies, case series and reports using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines.Results: The relevant publications identified included one Level I systematic review and meta-analysis of six human studies, 16 Level II studies with 6,942 subjects, nine Level III studies with 3,797,096 subjects and two systematic and scoping reviews with 30 cases. Cannabis-induced tachycardia was highlighted in 17 of 28 (61%) Level I-III articles followed by a generalized description of dysrhythmia in eight (29%). Specific dysrhythmias noted in the Level I-III articles included atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular block, premature ventricular contractions, premature atrial contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Other reported findings on electrocardiogram included ST segment elevation, P, and T wave changes. Only one Level III study reported a decreased risk of atrial fibrillation from cannabis use in patients hospitalized for heart failure (Odds ratio = 0.87). There were 39 case series (Level IV) and case reports (Level V) with 42 subjects. Average age was 30 ± 12 years, and only ten (24%) were female. The most common dysrhythmia mentioned in the Level IV and V articles was ventricular fibrillation (21%), followed by atrial fibrillation (19%), ventricular tachycardia (12%), third degree atrioventricular block (12%), and asystole (12%). There were four cases (10%) of symptomatic bradycardia. Notable electrocardiographic changes included ST segment elevation (29%), Brugada pattern in leads V1, V2 (14%), and right bundle branch block (12%). There were eight cases of cardiac arrest, of whom five expired.Conclusion: Cannabis use is associated with increased risk of cardiac dysrhythmia, which is rare but may be life-threatening. Clinicians and nurses should inquire about acute and chronic cannabis use in their patients presenting with tachycardia, bradycardia, dysrhythmia, chest pain, and/or unexplained syncope. Patients who use cannabis should be educated on this deleterious association, especially those with underlying cardiac disease or risk factors."

More than 2,000 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and many systematic reviews have been conducted on CIH therapies, making it difficult to easily understand what type of CIH therapy might be effective for what type of pain. Here we synthesize the strength of the evidence for four types of CIH therapies on pain: acupuncture, therapeutic massage, mindfulness techniques, and tai chi.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      We conducted searches of English-language systematic reviews and RCTs in 11 electronic databases and previously published reviews for each type of CIH.

            "abstract": "The treatment of pain, particularly neuropathic pain, is one of the therapeutic applications of cannabis and cannabinoids that is currently under investigation and that stimulates interest among clinicians and basic researchers. Animal pain models, including models of acute, antinociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, have demonstrated the antinociceptive efficacy of cannabinoids without causing serious alterations in animal behaviour. These data, together with the historic and current empiric use of cannabinoids, support the interest in the analysis of their effectiveness in treating neuropathic pain. The evaluation of controlled trials that focus on the effect of cannabinoids on neuropathic pain reveals that this class of drugs is able to significantly reduce pain perception. Nevertheless, this effect is generally weak and clinical relevance remains under evaluation. Moreover, there is a lack of controlled trials and, in particular, comparisons with other drugs generally used in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Despite the fact that further research is required to achieve a definitive assessment, current data obtained from basic research and from analysis of the available controlled trials indicate that cannabinoids can be accepted as a useful option in the treatment of neuropathic pain."

We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing PD patients to healthy controls (HCs) in their response to experimental pain stimuli. Articles were acquired through systematic searches of major databases from inception until 10/2016. Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 1292 participants (PD=739, HCs=553). Random effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD) revealed lower pain threshold (indicating hyperalgesia) in PD patients during unmedicated OFF states (SMD=0.51) which was attenuated during dopamine-medicated ON states (SMD=0.23), but unaffected by age, PD duration or PD severity. Analysis of 6 studies employing suprathreshold stimulation paradigms indicated greater pain in PD patients, just failing to reach significance (SMD=0.30, p=0.06). These findings (a) support the existence of hyperalgesia in PD, which could contribute to the onset/intensity of clinical pain, and (b) implicate dopamine deficiency as a potential underlying mechanism, which may present opportunities for the development of novel analgesic strategies."

Materials and Methods: A published Markov model comparing conventional therapies for painful diabetic neuropathy was modified to include arms for augmenting first-line, second-line (if first-line failed), or third-line (if first- and second-line failed) therapies with smoked cannabis. Microsimulation of 1,000,000 patients compared the cost (2017 U.S. dollars) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of usual care with and without adjunctive cannabis using a composite of third-party and out-of-pocket costs. Model efficacy inputs for cannabis were adapted from clinical trial data. Adverse event rates were derived from a prospective study of cannabis for chronic noncancer pain and applied to probability inputs for conventional therapies. Cannabis cost was derived from retail market pricing. Parameter uncertainty was addressed with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Adding cannabis to first-line therapy was incrementally less effective and costlier than adding cannabis to second-line and third-line therapies. Third-line adjunctive cannabis was subject to extended dominance, that is, the second-line strategy was more effective with a more favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $48,594 per QALY gained, and therefore, third-line adjunctive cannabis was not as cost-effective. At a modest willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY gained, second-line adjunctive cannabis was the strategy most likely to be cost-effective. Conclusion: As recently proposed willingness-to-pay thresholds for the United States health marketplace range from $110,000 to $300,000 per QALY, cannabis appears cost-effective when augmenting second-line treatment for painful neuropathy. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term benefit of smoked cannabis and standardization of its dosing for chronic neuropathic pain."

            "abstract": "Cannabis species have been used as medicine for thousands of years; only since the 1940s has the plant not been widely available for medical use. However, an increasing number of jurisdictions are making it possible for patients to obtain the botanical for medicinal use. For the cancer patient, cannabis has a number of potential benefits, especially in the management of symptoms. Cannabis is useful in combatting anorexia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, pain, insomnia, and depression. Cannabis might be less potent than other available antiemetics, but for some patients, it is the only agent that works, and it is the only antiemetic that also increases appetite. Inhaled cannabis is more effective than placebo in ameliorating peripheral neuropathy in a number of conditions, and it could prove useful in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. A pharmacokinetic interaction study of vaporized cannabis in patients with chronic pain on stable doses of sustained-release opioids demonstrated no clinically significant change in plasma opiates, while suggesting the possibility of synergistic analgesia. Aside from symptom management, an increasing body of in vitro and animal-model studies supports a possible direct anticancer effect of cannabinoids by way of a number of different mechanisms involving apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inhibition of metastasis. Despite an absence of clinical trials, abundant anecdotal reports that describe patients having remarkable responses to cannabis as an anticancer agent, especially when taken as a high-potency orally ingested concentrate, are circulating. Human studies should be conducted to address critical questions related to the foregoing effects."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Cannabis has been used for medical purposes across the world for centuries. As states and countries implement medical and recreational cannabis policies, increasing numbers of people are using cannabis pharmacotherapy for pain. There is a theoretical rationale for cannabis' efficacy for pain management, although the subjective pain relief from cannabis may not match objective measurements of analgesia. As more patients turn to cannabis for pain relief, there is a need for additional scientific evidence to evaluate this increase. Materials and Methods: Research for this review was performed in the PubMed/National Library of Medicine database. Discussion: Preclinical studies demonstrate a narrow therapeutic window for cannabis as pharmacotherapy for pain; the body of clinical evidence for this indication is not as extensive. A recent meta-analysis of clinical trials of cannabis and cannabinoids for pain found modest evidence supporting the use of cannabinoid pharmacotherapy for pain. Recent epidemiological studies have provided initial evidence for a possible reduction in opioid pharmacotherapy for pain as a result of increased implementation of medical cannabis regimens. Conclusion: With increased use of medical cannabis as pharmacotherapy for pain comes a need for comprehensive risk-benefit discussions that take into account cannabis' significant possible side effects. As cannabis use increases in the context of medical and recreational cannabis policies, additional research to support or refute the current evidence base is essential to attempt to answer the questions that so many healthcare professionals and patients are asking."

With the implementation of patient blood management (PBM), a preanesthesia assessment clinic to screen and treat anemia before elective surgery was institutionalized at Muenster University Hospital, Germany. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the association between treating preoperative anemic patients with intravenous iron (IVI) and (primarily) presurgical hemoglobin levels and (secondarily) use of RBCs and mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between April 1, 2014, and July 4, 2016, patients scheduled for elective surgery with a risk for RBC transfusions >10% in 2013 were screened for preoperative anemia and, if indicated, treated with IVI. Patients' data, time span between visit in the anesthesia/PBM clinic and surgery, demographic data, type of surgery, the difference of hemoglobin levels between visit and surgery, RBC transfusion, infectious-related International Classification of Disease codes during hospital stay, and 1-year survival were determined retrospectively by screening electronic data files. In addition, patients were interviewed about adverse events, health-related events, and infections via telephone 30, 90, and 365 days after visiting the anesthesia/PBM clinic.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 1101 patients were seen in the anesthesia/PBM clinic between days -28 and -1 (median [Q1-Q3], -3 days [-1, -9 days]) before elective surgery. Approximately 29% of patients presented with anemia, 46.8% of these anemic patients were treated with ferric carboxymaltose (500-1000 mg).In the primary analysis, hemoglobin levels at median were associated with a reduction between the visit in the anesthesia/PBM clinic and the surgery in all nonanemic patients on beginning of medical treatment (nonanemic patients at median -2.8 g/dL [-4, -0.9 g/dL], while anemic patients without IVI presented with median differences of -0.8 g/dL [-2, 0 g/dL] and anemic patients with IVI of 0 g/dL [-1.0, 0.5 g/dL]). Hemoglobin levels raised best at substitution 22-28 days before surgery (0.95 g/dL [-0.35, 1.18 g/dL]). Due to the selection criteria, transfusion rates were high in the cohort. Overall, there was no association between IVI treatment and the use of RBC transfusions (odds ratio for use of RBCs in anemic patients, no IVI versus IVI: 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.82). Patients treated with or without IVI presented a comparable range of International Classification of Disease codes related to infections. Telephone interviews indicated similar adverse events, health-related events, and infections. Cox regression analysis showed an association between anemia and reduced survival, regardless of IVI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      An anemia clinic within the preanesthesia assessment clinic is a feasible and effective approach to treat preoperative anemia. The IVI supplementation was safe but was associated with decreased RBC transfusions in gynecology/obstetric patients only.

Chronic pain is caused by incurable conditions or requires a long time to heal and is persistent: it includes chronic nociceptive pain, established neuropathic pain, and psychogenic pain. The therapeutic strategies for pain depend on the underlying pathological conditions: (1) For nociceptive pain, analgesics, narcotic analgesics, and nerve block are indicated. (2) For neuropathic pain, supplementary analgesics, but not analgesics, are indicated, and some narcotic analgesics are also effective: the recommended supplementary analgesics include calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). (3) For psychogenic pain, analgesics and nerve block are not indicated, except in the setting of a placebo effect: in paticular, narcotic analgesics should not be used.

A standardized herbal cannabis product (12.5% tetrahydrocannabinol) was dispensed to eligible individuals for a 1-year period; controls were individuals with chronic pain from the same clinics who were not cannabis users. The primary outcome consisted of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events. Secondary safety outcomes included pulmonary and neurocognitive function and standard hematology, biochemistry, renal, liver, and endocrine function. Secondary efficacy parameters included pain and other symptoms, mood, and quality of life. Two hundred and fifteen individuals with chronic pain were recruited to the cannabis group (141 current users and 58 ex-users) and 216 controls (chronic pain but no current cannabis use) from 7 clinics across Canada.

            "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonists provide the potential for treating chronic pain states without CNS effects associated with CB1 receptor activation. Animal models suggest that they act mainly via non-neuronal cells, possibly inhibition of inflammatory cells in the periphery or CNS, or via release of beta-endorphin; however, the clinical relevance and mechanism of analgesic action is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate colocalisation of CB2 with CB1 and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons and increased levels of CB2 receptors in human peripheral nerves after injury, particularly painful neuromas. In primary cultures of human DRG neurons, selective CB2 agonists blocked activation of inward cation currents and elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in response to capsaicin. These inhibitory effects were reversed by GW818646X a CB2 antagonist, and 8-bromo cAMP, but not by SR141716 a CB1 antagonist, or naloxone. Thus CB2 receptor agonists functionally inhibited nociceptive signalling in human primary sensory neurons via a mechanism shared with opioids, of adenylyl cyclase inhibition, but not via mu-opioid receptors. We conclude that CB2 agonists deserve imminent clinical trials for nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic chronic pain, in which capsaicin or heat-activated responses via TRPV1 may provide a clinical marker."

Sativex((R)), a cannabis derived oromucosal spray containing equal proportions of THC (partial CB(1) receptor agonist ) and cannabidiol (CBD, a non-euphoriant, anti-inflammatory analgesic with CB(1) receptor antagonist and endocannabinoid modulating effects) was approved in Canada in 2005 for treatment of central neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis, and in 2007 for intractable cancer pain. Numerous randomized clinical trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy for Sativex in central and peripheral neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer pain. An Investigational New Drug application to conduct advanced clinical trials for cancer pain was approved by the US FDA in January 2006.

            "abstract": "The therapeutic potential of medical cannabis to treat a variety of conditions is becoming increasingly recognised. Globally, a large number of countries have now legalised cannabis for medical uses and a substantial number of patients are able to access their medications. Yet in the UK, where medical cannabis was legalised in November 2018, only a handful of NHS prescriptions have been written, meaning that most patients are unable to access the medicine. Reasons for this are manyfold and include the perceived lack of clinical evidence due to the challenges of studying medical cannabis through randomised controlled trials. In order to develop the current evidence base, the importance of incorporating real-world data (RWD) to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of medical cannabis has gradually become recognised. The current paper provides a detailed outline of Project Twenty21 (T21), the UK's first medical cannabis registry, launched in August 2020. We provide the rationale for T21 and describe the methodology before reporting the characteristics of the 'first patients' enrolled in the registry. We describe the health status of all patients enrolled into the project during its first 7 months of operation and the sociodemographic characteristics and primary presenting conditions for these patients, as well as details of the medical cannabis prescribed to these individuals. By 12th March 2021, 678 people had been enrolled into T21; the majority (64%) were male and their average age was 38.7 years (range = 18-80). The most commonly reported primary conditions were chronic pain (55.6%) and anxiety disorders (32.0%) and they reported high levels of multi-morbidity, including high rates of insomnia and depression. We also present preliminary evidence from 75 patients followed up after 3 months indicating that receipt of legal, prescribed cannabis was associated with a significant increase in self-reported health, assessed using the visual analogue scale of the EQ-5D-5L (Cohen's d = .77, 95% CI = .51-1.03). Our initial findings complement reports from other large-scale databases globally, indicating that the current RWD is building up a pattern of evidence. With many clinicians demanding better and faster evidence to inform their decisions around prescribing medical cannabis, the current and future results of T21 will expand the existing evidence base on the effectiveness of cannabis-based medical products (CBMPs)."

Performance results in the PM session for treatment/control were 832.5 ± 198.7/813.3 ± 187.6 W for peak power (PP), and 497.85 ± 120.7/486.1 ± 115 W for mean power (MP). Treatment was effective in maintaining MP (p = 0.034) in the PM sessions, but there was no significant effect of treatment on PP (p = 0.193), CK (p = 0.08), pain (p = 0.12), or RPE (p = 0.45). Treatment was helpful in protecting performance, but this was apparently not due to reduced muscle soreness or damage."

            "abstract": "Endogenous opioid and cannabinoid systems are thought to act synergistically regulating antinociceptive and reward mechanisms. To further understand the human implications of the interaction between these two systems, we investigated the role of the common, functional missense variant Pro129Thr of the gene coding fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the major degrading enzyme of endocannabinoids, on psychophysical and neurotransmitter (dopaminergic, opioid) responses to pain and placebo-induced analgesia in humans. FAAH Pro129/Pro129 homozygotes, who constitute nearly half of the population, reported higher placebo analgesia and more positive affective states immediately and 24 h after placebo administration; no effects on pain report in the absence of placebo were observed. Pro129/Pro129 homozygotes also showed greater placebo-induced μ-opioid, but not D(2/3) dopaminergic, enhancements in neurotransmission in regions known involved in placebo effects. These results show that a common genetic variation affecting the function of the cannabinoid system is serving as a probe to demonstrate the involvement of cannabinoid and opioid transmitters on the formation of placebo effects."

            "title": "Pharmacology of Medical Cannabis.",
            "abstract": "The Cannabis plant has been used for many of years as a medicinal agent in the relief of pain and seizures. It contains approximately 540 natural compounds including more than 100 that have been identified as phytocannabinoids due to their shared chemical structure. The predominant psychotropic component is Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), while the major non-psychoactive ingredient is cannabidiol (CBD). These compounds have been shown to be partial agonists or antagonists at the prototypical cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. The therapeutic actions of Δ9-THC and CBD include an ability to act as analgesics, anti-emetics, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-seizure compounds and as protective agents in neurodegeneration. However, there is a lack of well-controlled, double blind, randomized clinical trials to provide clarity on the efficacy of either Δ9-THC or CBD as therapeutics. Moreover, the safety concerns regarding the unwanted side effects of Δ9-THC as a psychoactive agent preclude its widespread use in the clinic. The legalization of cannabis for medicinal purposes and for recreational use in some regions will allow for much needed research on the pharmacokinetics and pharmocology of medical cannabis. This brief review focuses on the use of cannabis as a medicinal agent in the treatment of pain, epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the paucity of information, attention is paid to the mechanisms by which medical cannabis may act to relieve pain and seizures."

            "abstract": "Calcium antagonists were introduced for the treatment of hypertension in the 1980s. Their use was subsequently expanded to additional disorders, such as angina pectoris, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Raynaud phenomenon, pulmonary hypertension, diffuse esophageal spasms, and migraine. Calcium antagonists as a group are heterogeneous and include 3 main classes--phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and dihydropyridines--that differ in their molecular structure, sites and modes of action, and effects on various other cardiovascular functions. Calcium antagonists lower blood pressure mainly through vasodilation and reduction of peripheral resistance. They maintain blood flow to vital organs, and are safe in patients with renal impairment. Unlike diuretics and beta-blockers, calcium antagonists do not impair glucose metabolism or lipid profile and may even attenuate the development of arteriosclerotic lesions. In long-term follow-up, patients treated with calcium antagonists had development of less overt diabetes mellitus than those who were treated with diuretics and beta-blockers. Moreover, calcium antagonists are able to reduce left ventricular mass and are effective in improving anginal pain. Recent prospective randomized studies attested to the beneficial effects of calcium antagonists in hypertensive patients. In comparison with placebo, calcium antagonist-based therapy reduced major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death significantly in elderly hypertensive patients and in diabetic patients. In several comparative studies in hypertensive patients, treatment with calcium antagonists was equally effective as treatment with diuretics, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. From these studies, it seems that a calcium antagonist-based regimen is superior to other regimens in preventing stroke, equivalent in preventing ischemic heart disease, and inferior in preventing congestive heart failure. Calcium antagonists are also safe and effective as first-line or add-on therapy in diabetic hypertensive patients. Heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) may have an edge over the dihydropyridines in post-myocardial infarction patients and in diabetic nephropathy. Thus, calcium antagonists may be safely used in the management of hypertension and angina pectoris."

            "abstract": "The 20% prevalence of chronic pain in the general population is a major health concern given the often profound associated impairment of daily activities, employment status, and health-related quality of life in sufferers. Resource utilization associated with chronic pain represents an enormous burden for healthcare systems. Although analgesia based on the World Health Organization's pain ladder continues to be the mainstay of chronic pain management, aside from chronic cancer pain or end-of-life care, prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids to manage chronic pain is rarely sustainable. As the endocannabinoid system is known to control pain at peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal levels, interest in medical use of cannabis is growing. A proprietary blend of cannabis plant extracts containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) as the principal cannabinoids is formulated as an oromucosal spray (USAN name: nabiximols) and standardized to ensure quality, consistency and stability. This review examines evidence for THC:CBD oromucosal spray (nabiximols) in the management of chronic pain conditions. Cumulative evidence from clinical trials and an exploratory analysis of the German Pain e-Registry suggests that add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray (nabiximols) may have a role in managing chronic neuropathic pain, although further precise clinical trials are required to draw definitive conclusions."

However, there are concerns about the stability of this clustering over different subject samples and different drug classes. The aim of this study was to test whether Bond and Lader's clustering was stable in terms of subject samples and drug effects. Alternative clustering of N_VAS was tested.Data from studies with 3 types of drugs: cannabinoid receptor agonist (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]), muscarinic antagonist (scopolamine), and benzodiazepines (midazolam and lorazepam), collected between 2005 and 2012, were used for this analysis. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to test the clustering algorithm of Bond and Lader. Consensus clustering was performed to test the stability of clustering results over samples and over different drug types. Stability analysis was performed using a three-cluster assumption, and then on other alternative assumptions.Heat maps of the consensus matrix (CM) and density plots showed instability of the three-cluster hypothesis and suggested instability over the 3 drug classes. Two- and four-cluster hypothesis were also tested. Heat maps of the CM and density plots suggested that the two-cluster assumption was superior.In summary, the two-cluster assumption leads to a provably stable outcome over samples and the 3 drug types based on the data used."

We aimed to confirm these findings in patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation using a tablet formulation of olaparib.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial evaluated olaparib tablet maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation who had received at least two lines of previous chemotherapy. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at baseline of 0-1 and histologically confirmed, relapsed, high-grade serous ovarian cancer or high-grade endometrioid cancer, including primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to olaparib (300 mg in two 150 mg tablets, twice daily) or matching placebo tablets using an interactive voice and web response system. Randomisation was stratified by response to previous platinum chemotherapy (complete vs partial) and length of platinum-free interval (6-12 months vs ≥12 months) and treatment assignment was masked for patients, those giving the interventions, data collectors, and data analysers. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival and we report the primary analysis from this ongoing study. The efficacy analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population; safety analyses included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01874353, and is ongoing and no longer recruiting patients.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between Sept 3, 2013, and Nov 21, 2014, we enrolled 295 eligible patients who were randomly assigned to receive olaparib (n=196) or placebo (n=99). One patient in the olaparib group was randomised in error and did not receive study treatment. Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was significantly longer with olaparib (19·1 months [95% CI 16·3-25·7]) than with placebo (5·5 months [5·2-5·8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·30 [95% CI 0·22-0·41], p<0·0001). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity were anaemia (38 [19%] of 195 patients in the olaparib group vs two [2%] of 99 patients in the placebo group), fatigue or asthenia (eight [4%] vs two [2%]), and neutropenia (ten [5%] vs four [4%]). Serious adverse events were experienced by 35 (18%) patients in the olaparib group and eight (8%) patients in the placebo group. The most common in the olaparib group were anaemia (seven [4%] patients), abdominal pain (three [2%] patients), and intestinal obstruction (three [2%] patients). The most common in the placebo group were constipation (two [2%] patients) and intestinal obstruction (two [2%] patients).

Although numerous websites contain health-related information, finding evidence-based programs (as demonstrated through randomized controlled trials, RCTs) can be challenging. We sought to bridge the divide between the knowledge gained from RCTs and communication of the results by conducting a global systematic review and analyzing the availability of evidence-based Internet health programs.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The study aimed to (1) discover the range of health-related topics that are addressed through Internet-delivered interventions, (2) generate a list of current websites used in the trials which demonstrate a health benefit, and (3) identify gaps in the research that may have hindered dissemination.

MEDLINE via Ovid, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched. Inclusion criteria included (1) meta-analyses of RCTs, (2) at least one Internet-delivered intervention that measured a health-related outcome, and (3) use of at least one self-guided intervention. We excluded group-based therapies. There were no language restrictions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 363 records identified through the search, 71 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. Within the 71 meta-analyses, there were 1733 studies that contained 268 unique RCTs which tested self-help interventions. On review of the 268 studies, 21.3% (57/268) had functional websites. These included evidence-based Web programs on substance abuse (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis), mental health (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], phobias, panic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD]), and on diet and physical activity. There were also evidence-based programs on insomnia, chronic pain, cardiovascular risk, and childhood health problems. These programs tended to be intensive, requiring weeks to months of engagement by the user, often including interaction, personalized and normative feedback, and self-monitoring. English was the most common language, although some were available in Spanish, French, Portuguese, Dutch, German, Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish, and Mandarin. There were several interventions with numbers needed to treat of <5; these included painACTION, Mental Health Online for panic disorders, Deprexis, Triple P Online (TPOL), and U Can POOP Too. Hyperlinks of the sites have been listed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A wide range of evidence-based Internet programs are currently available for health-related behaviors, as well as disease prevention and treatment. However, the majority of Internet-delivered health interventions found to be efficacious in RCTs do not have websites for general use.

In this study, we used the MGH Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) to measure and assess the reliability of the sensations evoked by acupuncture needle stimulation in a longitudinal clinical trial on knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was used as the clinical outcome. Thirty OA patients were randomized into one of three groups (high dose, low dose, and sham acupuncture) for 4 weeks. We found that, compared with sham acupuncture, real acupuncture (combining high and low doses) produced significant improvement in knee pain (P = .025) and function in sport (P = .049). Intraclass correlation analysis showed that patients reliably rated 11 of the 12 acupuncture sensations listed on the MASS and that heaviness was rated most consistently. Overall perceived sensation (MASS Index) (P = .014), ratings of soreness (P = .002), and aching (P = .002) differed significantly across acupuncture groups. Compared to sham acupuncture, real acupuncture reliably evoked stronger deqi sensations and led to better clinical outcomes when measured in a chronic pain population.

However, clinical guidelines do not recommend cannabis for treatment of chronic non-cancer pain due to limited and mixed evidence of effectiveness. How state medical cannabis laws affect delivery of evidence-based treatment for chronic non-cancer pain is unclear. These laws could lead to substitution of cannabis in place of clinical guideline-discordant opioid prescribing, reducing risk of opioid use disorder and overdose. Conversely, state medical cannabis laws could lead to substitution of cannabis in place of guideline-concordant treatments such as topical analgesics or physical therapy. This protocol describes a mixed-methods study examining the implementation and effects of state medical cannabis laws on treatment of chronic non-cancer pain.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate an anesthetic concept to detect a patent foramen ovale with the help of transesophageal echocardiography in anesthetized patients before neurosurgical procedures in the semi-sitting position. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed after induction of anesthesia before surgery to avoid additional physical and psychologic stress for the patients. Thirty-five neurosurgical patients scheduled for elective surgery in the semi-sitting position were examined with help of contrast transesophageal echocardiography. The data of the examined patients were analyzed with respect to efficiency, logistic efforts, and adverse events. Contrast transesophageal echocardiography was combined with a ventilation maneuver to increase right atrial pressure. A patent foramen ovale was detected in 3 of 35 patients. These patients were operated on in a supine position. Oral insertion of the echoprobe was possible in all patients without difficulties. A short-lasting hypertension was observed in 5 patients despite adequate analgesia and sedation. The average time of examination was 25 minutes. None of the patients showed paradoxical air embolism as judged by postoperative neurologic assessment. Contrast transesophageal echocardiography combined with a ventilation maneuver is an effective method in detecting a patent foramen ovale. Moreover, transesophageal echocardiography is a clinical guide to patient positioning. The method of anesthetic management presented to examine anesthetized patients immediately before surgery means less physical and psychologic stress for the patients and causes approximately a 30-minute delay of surgery."

In 20 MS patients, we measured the effects of Sativex on clinically measured spasticity and on neurophysiological and laboratory parameters that correlate with spasticity severity or with the modulation of the ECS. Sativex failed to affect spasticity and stretch reflex excitability. This compound also failed to affect the synthesis and the degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide, as well as the expression of both CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in various subpopulations of peripheral lymphocytes."

            "abstract": "Background and objectives:\n        \n      \n      The lateral and anterior approaches for proximal sciatic nerve (SN) block can be used in patients lying supine. We assume that the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (PFCN) is simultaneously blocked more often via the lateral approach than via the anterior approach, given the proximity of these 2 nerves at the injection level. However, locating the SN is difficult when using the original landmark-based lateral approach. We have introduced ultrasound guidance to alleviate the technical difficulty of the lateral approach and tested the hypothesis that an ultrasound-guided lateral approach would achieve PFCN block more often than the ultrasound-guided anterior approach for SN block.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Forty consecutive patients undergoing knee surgery were randomly allocated to receive an SN block using an ultrasound-guided lateral or anterior approach. The primary outcome was the frequency of PFCN block 30 minutes after SN block. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of SN block, nerve depth, needle depth, and time taken to perform the block. We also assessed the spread of injectate by the lateral approach in 4 cadaveric legs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The frequency of PFCN block 30 minutes after SN block was higher with the lateral approach than with the anterior approach (60% vs 15%, P = 0.008).

However, in human experimental or clinical trials, no convincing reduction of acute pain, which may be caused by a pronociceptive, ECS-triggered mechanism on the level of the spinal cord, has been demonstrated. In contrast, in chronic pain and (painful) spasticity, an increasing number of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown the efficacy of cannabinoids, which is combined with a narrow therapeutic index. Patients with unsatisfactory response to other methods of pain therapy and who were characterized by failed stress adaptation particularly benefited from treatment with cannabinoids. None of the attempts to overcome the disadvantage of the narrow therapeutic index, either by changing the route of application or by formulating balanced cannabinoid preparations, have resulted in a major breakthrough. Therefore, different methods of administration and other types of cannabinoids, such as endocannabinoid modulators, should be tested in future trials."

However, this treatment requires a large number of medical personnel, which hinders expanded use of this method. A mobile electron linear accelerator for intraoperative radiation therapy has been developed and is now commercially available. This report analyzes the applicability of this accelerator to colorectal cancer. The applicability of the mobile accelerator is analyzed based on its specifications by simulating the intraoperative radiation therapy delivered to these patients with a conventional intraoperative radiation therapy unit.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      From 1987 to 1999, 49 colorectal cancer patients underwent 54 surgical resections and received intraoperative radiation therapy to 75 sites.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean intraoperative radiation therapy dose for colorectal cancer with the conventional unit was 22 (range, 10-30) Gy. The mean electron energy level was 10 (range, 3-30) MEV. Applicator size ranged from 4 to 10 cm in diameter. The mobile accelerator can achieve a dose rate of 10 Gy/min and an applicator unit size range of 3 to 10 cm in diameter, facilitating intraoperative radiation therapy for colorectal cancer. The electron energy limitation (12 MEV at maximum) suggests that the indications for this machine are limited. In our experience, 30 percent of patients received intraoperative radiation therapy with electron energy levels exceeding 12 MEV. Of these cases, 81 percent had macroscopic residual tumor and 69 percent had pain.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      An intraoperative radiation therapy mobile accelerator can cover 72 percent of the irradiation sites covered using our conventional unit.

            "abstract": "Background: Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a complex condition that is characterized by various pain syndromes and fatigue, among other symptoms experienced. Current medical treatment of FMS involves both pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches, but often with ineffective outcomes. Medicinal cannabis has the potential to be a therapeutic option for patients with FMS due to the positive research in chronic pain management. In addition, it has been found to have fewer adverse effects compared with currently available pain medications. This literature review aims at answering whether medicinal cannabis is reported to be safe and effective for the treatment of pain and symptomology experienced by people with FMS. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on human trials utilizing cannabis in FMS. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL were used for databases search, and mesh terms were used for cannabis and FMS. The search was limited to studies conducted from 2000 to 2020. Results: From the 181 citations identified, 10 studies were included after title, abstract, and full text screening occurred. A total of 1136 of patients (intervention n = 945, control n = 108, crossover n = 83) participated in the 10 studies ranging from 9 to 383 patients (mean = 114, median = 36). Of these studies, there were three randomized controlled trials, six observational studies, and one study that compared the management of chronic pain patients with FMS patients. Cannabis was found to be safe and well tolerated in FMS. The main adverse events identified included feeling \"high,\" dizziness/vertigo, dry mouth, cough, red eyes, and drowsiness with no serious adverse events reported. Conclusions: This literature review identified that medical cannabis may be beneficial for some people with FMS. Further studies are required to confirm its efficacy, what type of cannabis is the most effective form to use, and what assessment tools need to be utilized to understand how to quantify clinical outcomes."

In addition to usual surveillance (blood pressure, heart rate and central venous pressure), more extensive haemodynamic investigations were undertaken in 20 patients using a Swan-Ganz catheter. Blood concentrations (11 cases) and CSF concentrations (2 cases for each time of measurement) were determined in the case of fentanyl. In 20 patients (10 of whom had received fentanyl and 10 morphine) there was sophisticated cardio-respiratory surveillance postoperatively. 2 - 0.05 mg/kg or morphine (404 cases), 50 mg of pethidine (10 cases) and 0.1 mg of fentanyl (10 cases) were injected postoperatively. A comparison was made of the analgesia obtained. After three types of anaesthesia: epidural with bupivacaine with intubation (10 cases), halothane with intubation (10 cases) and neuroleptanaesthesia (10 cases), an injection was given of 0.05 mg/kg of morphine, with cardiorespiratory surveillance. Results were as follows: 1 - There were no significant variations in haemodynamic parameters peroperatively, indicative of adequate analgesia. Blood concentrations of fentanyl were as follows: 3.2 +/- 2.1 ng/ml after 10 minutes, 2 +/- 1.7 ng/ml after one hour, 1.4 +/- 1 ng/ml after two hours and 0.4 +/- 0.3 ng/ml after four hours. CSF concentrations were much higher; 34 ng/ml after one hour, 30 ng/ml after two and three hours and 25 ng/ml after four hours. No cardio-respiratory depression was seen after the peroperative injection of morphine. 2- The duration of analgesia following a postoperative injection of a morphine derivative was as follows: morphine 17.3 +/- 3.9 hours, pethidine 3.5 +/- 0.5 hours, and fentanyl 5.1 +/- 0.7 hours. The epidural injection of morphine after neuroleptoanaesthesia caused respiratory depression in two of the 10 cases, with a rise in pCO2 of 0.45 and 0.52 KPa. The results are discussed and compared with those of other authors. In conclusion, the authors emphasize the advantages of this method which makes it possible to obtain with smaller doses analgesia of longer duration than following a systemic injection of morphine, whilst at the same time decreasing the side effects."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoids receive increasing interest as analgesic treatments. However, the clinical use of Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC) has progressed with justified caution, which also owes to the incomplete mechanistic understanding of its analgesic effects, in particular its interference with the processing of sensory or affective components of pain. The present placebo-controlled crossover study therefore focused on the effects of 20 mg oral THC on the connectivity between brain areas of the pain matrix following experimental stimulation of trigeminal nocisensors in 15 non-addicted healthy volunteers. A general linear model (GLM) analysis identified reduced activations in the hippocampus and the anterior insula following THC administration. However, assessment of psychophysiological interaction (PPI) revealed that the effects of THC first consisted in a weakening of the interaction between the thalamus and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). From there, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was employed to infer that THC attenuated the connections to the hippocampus and to the anterior insula, suggesting that the reduced activations in these regions are secondary to a reduction of the connectivity from somatosensory regions by THC. These findings may have consequences for the way THC effects are currently interpreted: as cannabinoids are increasingly considered in pain treatment, present results provide relevant information about how THC interferes with the affective component of pain. Specifically, the present experiment suggests that THC does not selectively affect limbic regions, but rather interferes with sensory processing which in turn reduces sensory-limbic connectivity, leading to deactivation of affective regions."

The endocannabinoid system comprises both cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands including 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), N-arachidonylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA), and enzymes that regulate the synthesis and degradation of endogenous ligands which include diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGL-α), diacylglycerol lipase beta (DAGL-β), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), α/β hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6). As the endocannabinoid system exerts considerable involvement in the regulation of homeostasis and disease, much effort has been made towards understanding endocannabinoid-related mechanisms of action at cellular, physiological, and pathological levels as well as harnessing the various components of the endocannabinoid system to produce novel therapeutics. However, drug discovery efforts within the cannabinoid field have been slower than anticipated to reach satisfactory clinical endpoints and raises an important question into the validity of developing novel ligands that therapeutically target the endocannabinoid system. To answer this, we will first examine evidence that supports the existence of an endocannabinoid system role within inflammatory diseases, neurodegeneration, pain, substance use disorders, mood disorders, as well as metabolic diseases. Next, this review will discuss recent clinical studies, within the last 5 years, of cannabinoid compounds in context to these diseases. We will also address some of the challenges and considerations within the cannabinoid field that may be important in the advancement of therapeutics into the clinic."

Research into the pathophysiology is ongoing, and findings will likely assist in identifying new therapeutic options to augment those in existence today that are still insufficient for the care of a large population of patients. Recent evidence describes the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of fibromyalgia. This study provides a systematic, thorough review of the evidence alongside a review of the seminal data regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and current treatment options. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread chronic pain, fatigue, and depressive episodes without an organic diagnosis, which may be prevalent in up to 10% of the population and carries a significant cost in healthcare utilization, morbidity, a reduced quality of life, and productivity. It is frequently associated with psychiatric comorbidities. The diagnosis is clinical and usually prolonged, and diagnostic criteria continue to evolve. Some therapies have been previously described, including neuropathic medications, milnacipran, and antidepressants. Despite some level of efficacy, only physical exercise has strong evidence to support it. Cannabis has been used historically to treat different pain conditions since ancient times. Recent advances allowed for the isolation of the active substances in cannabis and the production of cannabinoid products that are nearly devoid of psychoactive influence and provide pain relief and alleviation of other symptoms. Many of these, as well as cannabis itself, are approved for use in chronic pain conditions. Evidence supporting cannabis in chronic pain conditions is plentiful; however, in fibromyalgia, they are mostly limited. Only a handful of randomized trials exists, and their objectivity has been questioned. However, many retrospective trials and patient surveys suggest the significant alleviation of pain, improvement in sleep, and abatement of associated symptoms. Evidence supporting the use of cannabis in chronic pain and specifically in fibromyalgia is being gathered as the use of cannabis increases with current global trends. While the current evidence is still limited, emerging data do suggest a positive effect of cannabis in fibromyalgia. Cannabis use is not without risks, including psychiatric, cognitive, and developmental as well as the risks of addiction. As such, clinical judgment is warranted to weigh these risks and prescribe to patients who are more likely to benefit from this treatment. Further research is required to define appropriate patient selection and treatment regimens."

In this study, we examined if signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB) contribute to individual differences in the development of neuropathic pain-induced anhedonia. Rats were randomly subjected to spared nerved ligation (SNI) or sham surgery. The SNI rats were divided into two groups based on the results of a sucrose preference test. Rats with anhedonia-like phenotype displayed lower tissue levels of BDNF in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared with rats without anhedonia-like phenotype and sham-operated rats. In contrast, tissue levels of BDNF in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats with an anhedonia-like phenotype were higher compared with those of rats without anhedonia-like phenotype and sham-operated rats. Furthermore, tissue levels of BDNF in the hippocampus, L2-5 spinal cord, muscle, and liver from both rats with or without anhedonia-like phenotype were lower compared with those of sham-operated rats. A single injection of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (10 mg/kg; TrkB agonist), but not ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg; TrkB antagonist), ameliorated reduced sucrose preference and reduced BDNF-TrkB signaling in the mPFC in the rats with anhedonia-like phenotype.

Smears from oral brush biopsies of all visible oral lesions are an easily practicable, cheap, minimal invasive, painless and safe screening method for detection of oral precancerous lesions and squamous cell carcinomas in all stages. We conclude that DNA image cytometry is a very sensitive and highly specific, objective and reproducible adjuvant tool for identification of neoplastic cells in oral smears."

            "title": "Management of painful neuropathies.",
            "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is the most common type of pain in neuropathy. In painful polyneuropathies the pain usually has a \"glove and stocking\" distribution. The pain may be predominantly spontaneous, e.g., with a burning, pricking, or shooting character or characterized by evoked pain such as mechanical or cold allodynia. In the clinical setting, the prevention of painful neuropathies and treatment of underlying neuropathy remains inadequate and thus symptomatic treatment of the pain and related disability needs to be offered. Most randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) published in painful neuropathy have been conducted in patients with diabetes and to what extent a treatment which is found effective in painful diabetic polyneuropathy can be expected to relieve other conditions like chemotherapy- or HIV-induced neuropathy is unknown. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentin, pregabalin, and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are first drug choices. In patients with localized neuropathic pain, a topical lidocaine patch may also be considered. Second-line treatments are tramadol and other opioids. New types of treatment include botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A), high-dose capsaicin patches, and cannabinoids. Other types of anticonvulsant drugs such as lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and lacosamide have a more questionable efficacy in painful polyneuropathy but may have an effect in a subgroup of patients. Combination therapy may be considered in patients with insufficient effect from one drug. Treatment is usually a trial-and-error process and has to be individualized to the single patient, taking into account all comorbidities such as possible concomitant depression, anxiety, diseases, and drug interactions. Side-effects to antidepressants include dry mouth, nausea, constipation, orthostatic hypotension, and sedation. ECG should always be obtained prior to treatment with TCAs, which also should not be used in patients with cardiac incompensation and epilepsy. The most common side-effects of gabapentin and pregabalin are CNS-related side-effects with dizziness and somnolence. Peripheral edema, weight gain, nausea, vertigo, asthenia, dry mouth, and ataxia may also occur. Topical treatments are better tolerated due to lack of systemic side-effects but there is still limited evidence for the long-term efficacy of these drugs. With available drugs, the average pain reduction is about 20-30%, and only 20-35% of the patients will achieve at least 50% pain reduction, which stresses the need of a multidisciplinary approach to pain treatment."

            "abstract": "Cannabinoids (the active components of Cannabis sativa) and their derivatives have received renewed interest in recent years due to their diverse pharmacological activities. In particular, cannabinoids offer potential applications as anti-tumour drugs, based on the ability of some members of this class of compounds to limit cell proliferation and to induce tumour-selective cell death. Although synthetic cannabinoids may have pro-tumour effects in vivo due to their immunosuppressive properties, predominantly inhibitory effects on tumour growth and migration, angiogenesis, metastasis, and also inflammation have been described. Emerging evidence suggests that agonists of cannabinoid receptors expressed by tumour cells may offer a novel strategy to treat cancer. In this chapter we review the more recent results generating interest in the field of cannabinoids and cancer, and provide novel suggestions for the development, exploration and use of cannabinoid agonists for cancer therapy, not only as palliative but also as curative drugs."

            "abstract": "Medical cannabis is being increasingly used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases because, despite the paucity of evidence regarding its safety and efficacy, a growing number of countries are legalising its use for medical purposes in response to social pressure. Cannabinoids may be useful in the management of rheumatic disorders for two broad reasons: their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity, and their effects on pain and associated symptoms. It is interesting to note that, although a wide range of medications are available for the treatment of inflammation, including an ever-lengthening list of biological medications, the same is not true of the treatment of chronic pain, a cardinal symptom of many rheumatological disorders. The publication of systematic reviews (SR) concerning the use of cannabis-based medicines for chronic pain (with and without meta-analyses) is outpacing that of randomised controlled trials. Furthermore, narrative reviews of public institution are largely based on these SRs, which often reach different conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of cannabis-based medicines because of the lack of high-quality evidence of efficacy and the presence of indications that they may be harmful for patients. Societal safety concerns about medical cannabis (e.g. driving risks, workplace safety and pediatric intoxication) must always be borne in mind, and will probably not be addressed by clinical studies. Medical cannabis and cannabis-based medicines have often been legalised as therapeutic products by legislative bodies without going through the usual process of regulatory approval founded on the results of traditional evidence-based studies. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of using cannabis to treat rheumatic conditions."

Patients underwent two successive treatment phases (4 weeks each) and were treated with CBDV (400 mg/day) or placebo in a randomized order. A 3-week washout phase was designed to eliminate potential carry-over effects. Patients were followed up for 3 weeks after the end of the second treatment phase. The primary end point was pain intensity on an 11-point numeric rating scale, recorded in a diary. Secondary end points were additional pain medication, pain characteristics, and quality of life. We included 32 patients. The mean pain intensity under CBDV was 0.62 points higher compared with placebo (P = 0.16, 95% confidence interval -0.27 to 1.51). CBDV did not influence the amount of additional pain medication, pain characteristics, or quality of life. The incidence of adverse events was similar during both treatments. No suspected unexpected adverse reactions occurred during either treatment. CBDV was safe but failed to reduce neuropathic pain in patients with HIV. This may be explained by a lack of CB receptor activation, as indicated by preclinical experiments. Although a larger patient number might be desirable, we would not expect a change in the conclusions because the present differences are far from statistical significance. Therefore, we would currently not consider CBDV as a clinically meaningful treatment option for neuropathic pain."

            "abstract": "In a preclinical study we found fluoxetine alone to induce a serotonin-mediated, dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in the mouse hot plate assay. In the present study we evaluated the clinical implication of these findings, comparing the efficacy of fluoxetine with that of amitriptyline for musculo-skeletal pain. Forty non-depressed patients, suffering from low back pain and whiplash associated cervical pain were enrolled in a randomized, six-week, \"blind-rater\" study, comparing the analgesic effect of amitriptyline (50-75 mgs/day) with that of fluoxetine (20 mgs/day). Twenty patients were randomly assigned to the amitriptyline group, and twenty to the fluoxetine group. Visual analogue and verbal rating scales were used for the assessment of pain intensity and pain relief. Thirty-five patients concluded the study. Moderate or good relief of pain was reported by 14 of the 17 patients (82%) in the amitriptyline group, and by 14 of the 18 patients (77%) in the fluoxetine group. The difference in responses between amitriptyline and fluoxetine was not statistically significant. In our study, fluoxetine relieved low back pain and whiplash associated cervical pain with efficacy similar to that of amitriptyline, offering an alternative for patients unable to tolerate the tricyclic antidepressants' side effects."

            "abstract": "Fifty years after the discovery of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as the psychoactive component of Cannabis, we are assessing the possibility of translating this herb into clinical treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Here, a discussion on the problems associated with a potential treatment is given. From first surveys and small clinical studies in patients with IBD we have learned that Cannabis is frequently used to alleviate diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Single ingredients from Cannabis, such as THC and cannabidiol, commonly described as cannabinoids, are responsible for these effects. Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists are also termed cannabinoids, some of which, like dronabinol and nabilone, are already available with a narcotic prescription. Areas covered: Recent data on the effects of Cannabis/cannabinoids in experimental models of IBD and in clinical trials with IBD patients have been reviewed using a PubMed database search. A short background on the endocannabinoid system is also provided. Expert commentary: Cannabinoids could be helpful for certain symptoms of IBD, but there is still a lack of clinical studies to prove efficacy, tolerability and safety of cannabinoid-based medication for IBD patients, leaving medical professionals without evidence and guidelines."

            "abstract": "Painful peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of paclitaxel (PTX). The use of analgesics is an important component for management of PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy (PINP). However, currently employed analgesics have several side effects and are poorly effective. β-caryophyllene (BCP), a dietary selective CB2 agonist, has shown analgesic effect in neuropathic pain models, but its role in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain has not yet been investigated. Herein, we used the mouse model of PINP to show the therapeutic effects of BCP in this neuropathy. Male Swiss mice receiving PTX (2 mg kg-1, ip, four alternate days) were treated with BCP (25 mg kg-1, po, twice a day) either during or after PTX administration. Some groups were also pretreated with AM630 (CB2 antagonist, 3 mg kg-1, ip) or AM251 (CB1 antagonist, 1 mg kg-1, ip). Spinal cord samples were collected in different time points to perform immunohistochemical analysis. BCP attenuated the established mechanical allodynia induced by PTX (p < 0.0001) in a CB2-dependent manner. Of note, when given concomitantly with PTX, BCP was able to attenuate the development of PINP (p < 0.0001). Spinal cord immunohistochemistry revealed that preventive treatment with BCP reduced p38 MAPK and NF-κB activation, as well as the increased Iba-1 and IL-1β immunoreactivity promoted by PTX. Our findings show that BCP effectively attenuated PINP, possibly through CB2-activation in the CNS and posterior inhibition of p38 MAPK/NF-κB activation and cytokine release. Taken together, our results suggest that BCP could be used to attenuate the establishment and/or treat PINP."

Twenty-four adult patients, who were scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia, gave informed consent to participate in this study. The patients were allocated randomly into two groups: one for a dermal patch GAHPh (GAHPh group) and the other for a dermal patch without GAHPh (plain group). Approximately 0.3g of either gel with or without GAHPh, soaked in a round sponge (25mm in diameter, 1mm in thickness), was applied over the selected vein on the arm and was covered with an adhesive plastic film (Tegaderm). Pain score was graded by the number of painful spots out of the 5 tests in the treated skin area. In patients with a pain score under 1, venous cannulation was carried out without an intradermal injection of a local anesthetic and pain associated with the cannulation procedure was graded by patients on a scale of 5, where 0 = no pain, 1 = little pain, 2 = moderate pain, 3 = painful, 4 = very painful. The mean application time periods were 59.3 min for the GAHPh group and 60.3 min for the plain group. Transient local redness was observed in 8 patients after removal of the gels; 3 in the GAHPh group and 5 in the plain group. The mean pain score (1.3 +/- 1.5) in the GAHPh group, was significantly lower than that (2.5 +/- 1.7) in the plain group (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease worldwide and one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. Moreover, patients with NAFLD frequently complain of non-specific symptoms including fatigue, abdominal discomfort, as well as anxiety, and NAFLD is reported to affect patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Thus, for clarifying the total burden of NAFLD, it is crucial to assess all associated outcomes, including not only clinical and economic outcomes but also PROs. PROs are thought to reflect what is happening in one's daily life and is an important way patients and health-care professionals communicate. There are various instruments for the assessment of PROs. Recently, a NAFLD/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-specific instrument called \"Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ)-NAFLD/NASH\" has been developed. CLDQ-NAFLD/NASH comprises six domains: (i) abdominal symptoms, (ii) activity/energy, (iii) emotional health, (iv) fatigue, (v) systemic symptoms, and (vi) worry. CLDQ-NAFLD/NASH has demonstrated excellent internal consistency, face validity, content validity, and test-retest reliability. It has been sufficiently validated in two international phase 3 clinical trials. In this review, we summarize features of various instruments for assessing PROs by focusing on CLDQ-NAFLD/NASH. We also examine the validity of CLDQ-NAFLD/NASH in Japanese patients and alterations in CLDQ-NAFLD/NASH score in Japanese patients with significant hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, we discuss the utility of CLDQ-NAFLD/NASH in phase 3 clinical trials and in a real-world clinical setting."

Management varies according to the pain in question. For dysesthetic pain, drugs in use for neuropathic pain in general are recommended as first-line treatment, and emerging evidence suggests some benefit from cannabinoids and levetiracetam. Because of unique characteristics of MS-related trigeminal neuralgia, ganglion and root level neuroablative procedures are worth considering before microvascular decompression. Overall, the lack of controlled clinical trials, together with our limited understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved, form a hindrance to a systematic and rational management of MS-related pain."

The CB1R are found primarily in the brain, whereas the CB2R are expressed predominantly on immune cells (2). However, the CB2R were shown recently to be expressed on brain neurons as well and were reported to have a role in the development of conditions such as drug abuse and depression (3). The modulation of CB2R expression has been reported in astrocytic tumors, atherosclerotic and amyloid plaques, and demyelination plaques observed in multiple sclerosis (4). A variety of CB2R antagonists and agonists are commercially available, and some agonists have been shown to induce apoptosis in various tumor cell types and are used to treat pain and inflammation observed during neuropathy, cancer, multiple sclerosis, etc (5). In addition, some agonists have been used for the management of depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity, and anxiety disorders (5).\n    \n\n      \n      A few tritiated ligands have been used to investigate the CB2R under in vitro conditions; however, due to low specific activity and a lack of receptor selectivity, these radioligands are not considered entirely suitable to study CB1R and CB2R (4).

Recently, the concept of spasticity-plus syndrome (SPS) has been proposed to take into account the frequent coexistence of all these complaints in patients with MS and a common pathophysiological basis for this putative new clinical entity has been proposed. Muscle tone, sleep, bladder function, and the pain pathway are controlled by cannabinoid CB1 (CB1R) and CB2 receptors (CB2R) that are particularly enriched in the brainstem. Axons with smaller diameters are particularly susceptible to conduction block and the irritative, ephaptic, consequences of demyelination and their involvement in the demyelination process caused by MS in the brainstem might underlie the various clinical manifestations of SPS. The adoption of SPS in clinical practice could be useful to improve symptomatic treatments in a significant proportion of patients with MS, possibly limiting the adverse events produced by polypharmacotherapy."

The present study investigated the effects of administration of the cannabinoid(1) (CB(1)) receptor antagonist SR141716A into the right basolateral amygdala (BLA) on expression of conditioned fear, formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour, fear-conditioned analgesia and associated alterations in monoamine levels in discrete rat brain areas. Re-exposure to a context previously paired with footshock significantly reduced formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour. Intra-BLA administration of SR141716A did not attenuate fear-conditioned analgesia, but reduced formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour and attenuated the formalin-induced decrease in freezing and 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations in the early part of the trial. Furthermore, intra-BLA SR141716A significantly prolonged the duration of these fear-related behaviours in fear-conditioned rats not receiving formalin. Fear-conditioned analgesia was accompanied by increased homovanillic acid (HVA) : dopamine (DA) ratio and reduced serotonin (5-HT) in the cerebellum, an effect not altered by SR141716A. SR141716A-induced analgesia was accompanied by reduced DA, increased HVA : DA ratio and reduced 5-HT levels in the cerebellum, increased hippocampal HVA levels and increased 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) in the amygdaloid cortex. The SR141716A-induced prolongation of contextually induced aversive behaviour was accompanied by reduced DA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), levels in the hippocampus, and increased DA and 5-HIAA in the periaqueductal grey. These data suggest an important role for CB(1) receptors in the right BLA in mediating short-term extinction of conditioned aversive behaviour but not fear-conditioned analgesia. The results also enhance our understanding of endocannabinoid-monoamine interactions of relevance to conditioned fear and associated analgesia."

            "abstract": "Headache disorders are common, debilitating, and, in many cases, inadequately managed by existing treatments. Although clinical trials of cannabis for neuropathic pain have shown promising results, there has been limited research on its use, specifically for headache disorders. This review considers historical prescription practices, summarizes the existing reports on the use of cannabis for headache, and examines the preclinical literature exploring the role of exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids to alter headache pathophysiology. Currently, there is not enough evidence from well-designed clinical trials to support the use of cannabis for headache, but there are sufficient anecdotal and preliminary results, as well as plausible neurobiological mechanisms, to warrant properly designed clinical trials. Such trials are needed to determine short- and long-term efficacy for specific headache types, compatibility with existing treatments, optimal administration practices, as well as potential risks."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Clinical trials remain the gold standard for evaluating efficacy, but there is increasing interest in using real-world evidence (RWE) to inform health care decision making. The aims of this observational study were to describe patterns of medical cannabis use, associated changes in symptom severity over time, and to evaluate change in cannabis dose over time for pain-related symptoms. Methods: Data were collected by Strainprint™, an application that is HIPAA, PIPEDA, and PHIPA compliant. A total of 629 participants recorded data between May 2017 and August 2019. A total of 65 symptoms were grouped as Pain, Mental Health, Physical Symptoms, Seizures, Headaches/Migraines, and Other. Descriptive statistics and mixed-effects modeling were applied. Results: THC-dominant products were more frequently consumed for symptoms of pain and sleep, while CBD-dominant products were more frequently consumed for anxiety and depression. Male and female participants demonstrated significant differences in the type of cannabis they consumed. Females more frequently consumed CBD-dominant products, and males more frequently consumed balanced (THC:CBD) products. Oil use was more prominent among females, while vaping was more common among males. Product use also varied by age tertiles (<31; 31-39; >40 years). CBD-dominant products were more common among younger participants, <31 years, THC-dominant products were more common among the 31-39 years category and balanced (THC:CBD) products were common among older participants >41 years. Dosages of CBD-dominant and balanced (THC:CBD) products increased over time irrespective of symptom response. THC-dominant products demonstrated a significant relationship between dose and symptom reduction over time. Conclusions: Recognizing that RWE has important methodological limitations, we observed cannabis product preferences based on demographic characteristics, such as gender and age and the primary symptom treated such as pain and anxiety. Our study offers real-world insights into how participants use and respond to cannabis products and suggests important avenues and methodologies for future research."

Canadians have a legal framework for access to medical cannabis, which provides a unique perspective in a setting lacking robust clinical evidence. This review seeks to delineate the role of cannabis and cannabinoids in cancer pain management and offers insight into the Canadian practice.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      A cohort study using nabiximols on advanced cancer pain in patients already optimized on opioids, over 3 weeks, demonstrated improved average pain score. A large observational study of cancer patients using cannabis over 6 months demonstrated a decreased number of patients with severe pain and decreased opioid use, whereas the number of patients reporting good quality of life increased.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Good preclinical animal data and a large body of observational evidence point to the potential efficacy of cannabinoids for cancer pain management. However, there are relatively weak data pointing to clinical efficacy from clinical trial data to date. In Canada, the burgeoning cannabis industry has driven the population to embrace a medicine before clinical evidence. There remains a need for high-quality randomized controlled trials to properly assess the effectiveness and safety of medical cannabis, compared with placebo and standard treatments for cancer-related symptoms."

Calibration was poor for all 4 original models, indicated by a P value lower than 0.01 in the C and H statistics. Customization improved the accuracy of the prediction for all 4 models. However, the simplified risk scores of the Koivuranta et al model and the Apfel et al model did not show the same efficiency as those of the Sinclair et al model and the Junger et al model. This is possibly a result of having relatively few patients at high risk for PONV in combination with an information loss caused by too few dichotomous variables in the simplified scores.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The original models were not well validated in our study. An antiemetic therapy based on the results of these scores seems therefore unsatisfactory.

            "abstract": "Background and objectives:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this randomized, single blind phase IIIb study was to evaluate the efficacy of 0.5% levobupivacaine versus 0.5% bupivacaine and 0.75% ropivacaine administered as epidural anesthesia and 0.125% levobupivacaine versus 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.2% ropivacaine for postoperative analgesia. The study was designed to test the equivalence of the overall profile of levobupivacaine against bupivacaine and ropivacaine. In addition, parameters of clinical safety were assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 88 patients undergoing hip surgery at 12 German academic hospitals were randomly assigned to 3 different treatment groups. Criteria for drug evaluation were the required epidural volume and time until onset and offset of sensory and motor block, the quality of postoperative analgesia using a pain visual analogue scale and verbal rating scale, as well as the need for rescue medication based on statistical non-inferiority testing.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      With respect to onset and offset of sensory and motor blockade, 0.5% levobupivacaine, 0.5% bupivacaine and 0.75% ropivacaine showed clinically significant equivalent profiles for all primary study endpoints. However, the levobupivacaine group showed a higher demand for intraoperative anesthesia. Postoperative analgesia request and pain scales did not differ significantly between groups, but comparatively lower total drug volumes were required in the bupivacaine group. No relevant differences between the trial groups concerning safety parameters were observed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The efficacy of epidural levobupivacaine for hip surgery and postoperative analgesia is equivalent and shows a comparable clinical profile to bupivacaine and 50-60% higher concentrated ropivacaine. The results of this equivalence study confirm suggestions derived from previous comparative studies."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Adhesive capsulitis is a common disease that causes pain and reduced range of motion, but vague on the shoulder. Woman are affected fewer than men, but there is no known racial or genetic tendency. Most patients with adhesive capsulitis will improve with nonsurgical treatment. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief in patients without contraindication are first-line options. Acupuncture considered being safe and effective in reducing pain. The aim of this study was to Investigation of the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of frozen shoulder.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      In a controlled clinical trial, patients referred to the Baqiatallah clinic in 91 years with shoulder pain, frozen shoulder diagnosed based on history and physical exam, they have been enrolled. Indicators measured in the study was included the involved joint pain, range of motion and quality of life. Patients, first at baseline, one and a half months later (end of session) and then 3 months after the examination information about each individual entered in the from of questionnaires were pre-determined and data were analyzed by SPSS 17 software.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In this clinical trial study total 40 patients with frozen shoulder (20 interference with the acupuncture and 20 people control) study that patients average age 55/54. Age maximum 71 years and minimum 44 years. Acupuncture in the treatment of frozen shoulder with the results achieved in the general case acupuncture may improve shoulder motion in patients.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38) induces headache in healthy volunteers but the precise mechanisms by which PACAP38 leads to headache are unclear. We investigated the headache preventive effect of sumatriptan and ketorolac on PACAP38-induced headache in healthy volunteers. In addition, we explored contribution of vascular mechanisms to PACAP38-induced headache using high resolution magnetic resonance angiography.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-four healthy volunteers were divided in two groups (A and B) and received infusion of PACAP38 (10 picomol/kg/min) over 20 min. Group A was pretreated with intravenous sumatriptan (4 mg) or ketorolac (30 mg) 20 min before infusion of PACAP38. Group B received infusion of sumatriptan or ketorolac as post-treatment 90 min after infusion of PACAP38. In both experiments, we used a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. We recorded headache characteristics and circumference of extra-intracerebral arteries.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found no difference in AUC (0-6 h) of PACAP38-induced headache in group A, pretreated with sumatriptan or ketorolac (p = 0.297). There was no difference between sumatriptan and ketorolac in PACAP38-induced circumference change (AUCBaseline-110 min) of MMA (p = 0.227), STA (p = 0.795) and MCA (p = 0.356). In group B, post-treatment with ketorolac reduced PACAP38-headache compared to sumatriptan (p < 0.001). Post-treatment with sumatriptan significantly reduced the circumference of STA (p = 0.039) and MMA (p = 0.015) but not of MCA (p = 0.981) compared to ketorolac. In an explorative analysis, we found that pre-treatment with sumatriptan reduced PACAP38-induced headache compared to no treatment (AUC0-90min).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Post-treatment with ketorolac was more effective in attenuating PACAP38-induced headache compared to sumatriptan. Ketorolac exerted its effect without affecting PACAP38-induced arterial dilation, whereas sumatriptan post-treatment attenuated PACAP38-induced dilation of MMA and STA. Pre-treatment with sumatriptan attenuated PACAP38-induced headache without affecting PACAP38-induced arterial dilation. Our findings suggest that ketorolac and sumatriptan attenuated PACAP38-induced headache in healthy volunteers without vascular effects.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03585894).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Chronic pain is a major therapeutic problem in kidney transplant patients owing to nephrotoxicity associated with nonsteroidal antiiflammatory drugs. Benefits in chronic pain treatment with cannabidiol (CBD) have been reported. This study assesses the effect, safety, and possible drug interactions in kidney transplant patients treated with CBD for chronic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We assessed patients who asked to receive CBD for pain treatment. Doses were increased from 50 to 150 mg twice a day for 3 weeks. Creatinine, blood count, liver function, liver enzymes, and drug levels were determined every 48 hours the first week and then once a week thereafter.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We assessed 7 patients with a mean age of 64.5 years (range, 58-75 years). CBD initial dose was 100 mg/d, CBD dose reduction to 50 mg/d has been done on day 4 to patient 1 for persistent nausea. Tacrolimus dose reduction in patient 3 was undertaken on days 4, 7, and 21 owing to persisting elevated levels (even before CBD) and itching, and on day 21 in patient 5. Tacrolimus levels decreased in patient 2 but were normal in the control 1 week later. Patients on cyclosporine were stable. Adverse effects were nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, and intermittent episodes of heat. CBD dose decrease was required in 2 patients. Two patients had total pain improvement, 4 had a partial response in the first 15 days, and in 1 there was no change.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      During this follow-up, CBD was well-tolerated, and there were no severe adverse effects. Plasma levels of tacrolimus were variable. Therefore, longer follow-up is required."
