**Background:** Spasticity is a common and
poorly controlled symptom of multiple sclerosis. Our objective was to determine the
short-term effect of smoked cannabis on this
symptom.

**Methods: We conducted a placebo-controlled,**
crossover trial involving adult patients with
multiple sclerosis and spasticity. We re cruited
participants from a regional clinic or by referral from specialists. We randomly assigned
participants to either the intervention
(smoked cannabis, once daily for three days)
or control (identical placebo cigarettes, once
daily for three days). Each participant was
assessed daily before and after treatment.
After a washout interval of 11 days, participants crossed over to the op posite group. Our
primary outcome was change in spasticity as
measured by patient score on the modified
Ashworth scale. Our secondary outcomes
included patients’ perception of pain (as measured using a visual analogue scale), a timed
walk and changes in cognitive function (as
measured by patient performance on the


Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), in addition to ratings of fatigue.

**Results: Thirty-seven participants were random-**
ized at the start of the study, 30 of whom
completed the trial. Treatment with smoked
cannabis resulted in a reduction in patient
scores on the modified Ashworth scale by an
average of 2.74 points more than placebo (p <
0.0001). In addition, treatment reduced pain
scores on a visual analogue scale by an average
of 5.28 points more than placebo (p = 0.008).
Scores for the timed walk did not differ significantly between treatment and placebo (p = 0.2).
Scores on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition
Test decreased by 8.67 points more with treatment than with placebo (p = 0.003). No serious
adverse events occurred during the trial.

**Interpretation: Smoked cannabis was superior**
to placebo in symptom and pain reduction in
participants with treatment-resistant spasticity. Future studies should examine whether
different doses can result in similar beneficial
effects with less cognitive impact.


pasticity is a common and disabling
symp tom that remains a substantial problem for many patients with multiple scle
# S

rosis. Some patients have adverse effects from
conventional antispasticity medications; for others, spasticity persists despite treatment. A report
from the Institute of Medicine in the United
States concluded that the active compounds of
cannabis (marijuana) are potentially effective in
treating neurologic conditions and “should be
tested rigorously in clinical trials.”[1] There is evidence that the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and
CB2 may be involved in the control of spasticity
in multiple sclerosis[2] and that the endogenous
ligand of CB1, anandamide, is itself an effective
antispasticity agent.[3] CB1 receptors are primarily
presynaptic; their activation inhibits calcium
influx and glutamate release, and reduces neuronal excitability by activating somatic and dendritic potassium channels.[4]


**Participants**
We recruited participants from a regional multiple sclerosis clinic and by referral from specialists. Our eligibility criteria were spasticity and at
least moderate increase in tone (score ≥ 3 points
on the modified Ashworth scale[5] at the elbow,
hip or knee). Participants were allowed to continue other treatments for spasticity, with the
exception of benzodiazepines, if they had been


Although many patients with multiple sclerosis
endorse smoking cannabis as therapy, evidence
that it relieves spasticity is largely anecdotal, as
most trials focus on orally ad min istered cannabinoids. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy
of smoked cannabis versus placebo in patients
with multiple sclerosis who have treatmentresistant spasticity.


###### Methods


-----

Our study was approved by the Human Re search Protections Program at the University of
California, San Diego, the Research Advisory
Panel of California, the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the US Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute on Drug
Abuse. Our study was monitored by an independent data safety monitoring board through the
University of California Center for Medicinal
Cannabis Research.

**Study design**
We used a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled crossover design. We evaluated participants during eight visits over a period of two
weeks. Visit 1 was a screening visit during which
the participants gave their informed consent. At
this time, we took medical/medication histories,
screened participants for substance abuse (using
urine toxicology) and psychiatric disorders, and
determined spasticity using the modified Ashworth scale.[5] Participants with a positive toxicological screening result (e.g., presence of delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine and/or benzoylecgonine) were
excluded.
A second screening visit took place within
seven days of the first. At this time, we completed the expanded disability status scale, determined spasticity again using the modified Ashworth scale and conducted a battery of cognitive
tests to reduce practise effects. During this second visit, participants were given a “practise session” with a placebo cigarette, although they
were not told that it was a placebo.
Treatment began within seven days of the
second screening visit, including randomization
to placebo or smoked cannabis. Phase 1 was followed by an 11-day washout period, after which
participants crossed over to the opposite treatment group for phase 2. We assessed each
patient before and after treatment for three consecutive days during each phase. The examiner
was blind to the treatment group to which each
patient was assigned. We assessed patients using
the modified Ashworth scale, a visual analog
scale for pain, a timed walk and cognitive tests
such as the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test
(PASAT). We as sessed treatment -emergent
effects about 45 minutes after treatment. We collected urine for toxicological screening at the
beginning (baseline) of each phase.
We assessed participants at the same time of
day to regulate food, medication and time of
cannabis intake. Participants smoked either a
placebo or a cannabis cigarette, using the Foltin
uniform puff procedure (inhalation for 5 s, followed by a 10-s breath-hold and exhalation, with

**Primary outcome**
Our primary outcome was change in spasticity as
measured by patient score on the modified Ashworth scale. The modified Ashworth scale[5] is an
ordinal scale (0–5 points) ranking the intensity of
muscle tone as follows: 0, no in crease in muscle
tone; 1, slight increase manifested by a catch and
release or by minimal resistance at the end of the
range of motion when the affected part(s) flexed
or extended; 2, slight increase manifested by a
catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout
the remaining (less than half) range of motion; 3,
more marked increase through most of the range
of motion, but affected part(s) easily moved; 4,
considerable increase in tone, and passive movement is difficult; 5, affected part(s) rigid in flexion and extension. We combined ratings for both
elbows, hips and knees for a total possible score
of 30 points. We assessed participants using this
scale before and about 45 minutes after treatment
(cannabis or placebo) at each visit.
This measure has been validated and correlates with motor function.[8] Although the minimal
clinically important difference is not available in
the literature, trials using a rating scale of 0–10
for spasticity have established a threshold of
18%.[9] Given this threshold and the mean baseline score of 9 among our participants, a difference of two or more points would be considered
clinically meaningful.

**Secondary outcomes**
We assessed patients daily for pain (using a
visual analogue scale), physical performance
(using a timed walk) and cognitive function (the
PASAT). We administered these tests before and
about 45 minutes after treatment at each visit.
We assessed patients for symptoms using the


-----

patients to assess their feeling of “highness” after
treatment, according to question 1 from the Subjective Ratings of High and Sedation Questionnaire (SRHS–R), and to guess which treatment
they were receiving (placebo or cannabis).
Detailed descriptions of these measures are
available in Appendix 1 (available at www .cmaj .ca
/lookup /suppl /doi :10 .1503 /cmaj .110837 /-/DC1).

**Statistical analysis**
We calculated mean scores (and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) on the modified Ashworth scale during each visit of each phase, at
each assessment time (before and after treatment). We calculated bootstrap-based, bias corrected, accelerated CIs for extra precision
around each mean. We calculated four overall
mean scores on the modified Ashworth scale
(before and after smoking during both phases).
We compared the difference in scores before
and after smoking for each of the two phases
using paired _t tests. We then compared the_
change in this difference (after to before) in the
two phases (placebo and active) using a paired
_t test. We used the same analysis to examine_
scores on the visual analogue scale for pain,
the timed walk and the PASAT.
We analyzed secondary variables according to
the schedule of measurements. We calculated the
means and bootstrap-based CIs for patient scores
on the BSI, the PDQ, and the mFIS for each day
on which these measures were assessed (day 1
before smoking, day 3 after smok ing). We as sessed the overall differences for before and after
treatment with placebo and cannabis using a paired
_t test. We calculated the means and bootstrap-_
based CIs for the answer to question 1 of the
SRHS–R questionnaire. We used a paired t test to
compare the overall difference in “highness”
between treatment and placebo.
We performed power calculations before
the beginning of the study, and these were
reviewed and approved by an external scientific advisory board and regulatory agencies. A
priori, we identified as “clinically important”
any departure from zero in the hypothesized
direction that is greater than one standard
deviation (SD) of paired differences. We determined that a sample size of 30 would yield
better than 80% power (α = 0.05) to detect
such an effect size.


###### Results


**Study participants**
We identified 196 patients for screening (Figure 1). Of these patients, 38 completed both
screening visits, 37 were randomized, and 30

**Sensitivity analyses**
Using a worst-case scenario sensitivity analysis
(assuming that the seven patients who withdrew
would not have shown any treatment effect),
compared with placebo, smoking cannabis
reduced average scores on the modified Ashworth
scale by 2.22 points (p < 0.001), on the visual
analogue scale of pain by 4.28 points (p = 0.009)
and on the PASAT by 6.981 points (p = 0.003).
These findings suggest that dropouts had no
meaningful effect on our results.

**Safety effects**
Although smoked cannabis was generally welltolerated, patients reported more adverse
effects during the active phase than during the
placebo phase (Table 4). Withdrawals from
treatment were due to adverse events (two
patients felt uncomfortably “high”, two had
dizziness and one had fatigue), the schedule
being too demanding (one patient) and pain
unrelated to the study (one patient). Of the
patients who withdrew, three had no previous
exposure to cannabis, two had only some exposure (> 1 yr since last use) and two had been
exposed during the previous year. None of our
participants had episodes of hypertension,
hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia requiring medical intervention.


###### Interpretation


**Main findings**
We saw a beneficial effect of smoked cannabis
on treatment-resistant spasticity and pain associated with multiple sclerosis among our participants. Although generally well-tolerated by our
participants, smoking cannabis was accompanied
by acute cognitive effects.

**Comparison with other studies**
Other studies have investigated the effect of
orally administered cannabinoids on spasticity
related to multiple sclerosis, including oromucosal sprays and capsules containing cannabis
extract, with mixed results. Any reductions in
spasticity have generally only been seen on subjective ratings.[10,11] One study showed a reduction
of 1.82 points on the original Ashworth spasticity scale (baseline mean 22) compared with a
reduction of 0.23 points for placebo.[12] In a trial
of a cannabis-based oromucosal spray, Collin
and colleagues[13] found that 40% of patients selfreported a benefit of 30% or more over a period
of six weeks using a numerical rating scale of
spasticity. Changes in the scores on the Ashworth spasticity scale did not significantly differ
between participants receiving treatment and

However, smoked cannabis was associated with
acute cognitive effects among the participants of
our study, as shown by their performances on the
PASAT. The clinical significance of this result is
uncertain; de spite the transient decrease in
scores, patients were still within normal ranges
for their ages and levels of education.[24] It is
worth noting that conventional treatments such
as baclofen and tizanidine hydrochloride may
also affect cognition,[25] although published data
are scarce. Re cently, concerns have been cited
regarding the potential long-term cognitive
effects of cannabis use in patients with multiple
sclerosis.[26,27] Although these studies have had
small samples and other limitations,[28,29] the issue
warrants further attention.
