Introduction


#### a b s t r a c t

Background: Dystonia may result from reduced GABAergic transmission in the external globus pallidus
(GPe). Cannabinoid CB1 agonists enhance GABA in the GPe and may therefore reduce dystonia.
Objectives: To determine the efficacy of the cannabinoid CB1 agonist, dronabinol, in cervical dystonia
(CD).
Methods: Nine patients with CD were randomised to dronabinol (15 mg/d)/placebo in an 8-week crossover trial. Outcome measures included TWSTRS, visual analog scale of pain, global impression of change
and adverse events (AEs).
Results: There was no effect of dronabinol compared to placebo on any outcome measure (all P > 0.05,
n = 7). One subject withdrew due to AEs and one was lost to follow-up. Mild AEs were experienced by all.
Conclusions: Short–term use of dronabinol in CD has no benefit. Despite the study limitations, cannabinoids are unlikely to be useful in the treatment of dystonia.

Idiopathic cervical dystonia (CD) is the most common form of
focal dystonia [1]. To date, oral pharmacological treatments have
had limited efficacy and often poor tolerability in CD. The most
effective therapy in current use is botulinum toxin, however, repeated injections are required every 3–4 months from an experienced clinician and there are subgroups of patients who do not
respond or who may become secondary non responders due to
the development of blocking antibodies to the toxin [2]. Thus,
alternative therapeutic options are required.
The neural mechanisms underlying dystonia are not well
understood but in keeping with findings in other hyperkinetic
movement disorders, may involve underactivity of the output regions of the basal ganglia; the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and
substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) [3]. In support of this, electrophysiological recordings from patients with idiopathic dystonia
undergoing surgery have demonstrated very low firing rates in GPi
neurons [4]. A key abnormality responsible for underactivity of the
GPi may be increased inhibitory GABAergic transmission from the
external globus pallidus (GPe) [5–7]. Thus reducing GABAergic

transmission in the GPe may reduce dystonia. One method of
reducing GABAergic transmission may be via stimulation of cannabinoid receptors.
High levels of cannabinoid, CB1 receptors are found in the globus pallidus and SNR [8] and are located presynaptically on the
GABA terminals of striatal projection neurons [9,10]. Recent positron emission tomography studies have confirmed these findings
in human subjects [11]. Cannabinoids function as neuromodulators
and enhance GABA transmission in the GPe [12], possibly by reducing GABA reuptake [13], although the exact mechanism remains
unclear [14,15]. Furthermore, infusion of cannabinoids into the
rodent globus pallidus results in a decrease in activity of pallidal
neurons [16,17]. Thus, cannabinoid receptor stimulation may
reduce overactivity of the GPe and thereby reduce dystonic
symptoms.
In support of this, the synthetic cannabinoid agonist, WIN
55–212, has been shown to enhance the antidystonic effects of
benzodiazepines in a genetic rodent model of generalized dystonia

[18]. There are currently no validated primate models of idiopathic
dystonia but levodopa-induced dystonia in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) lesioned primate model of
PD may model the neural mechanisms that underlie symptoms
of idiopathic dystonia in man. In the MPTP-lesioned primate, levodopa induced dyskinesia, characterized by both dystonia and chorea, are reduced by systemic administration of the synthetic
cannabinoid receptor agonist nabilone [19].
We have previously assessed the tolerability and efficacy of a
single dose of the synthetic cannabinoid, nabilone in subjects with

focal and generalized dystonia in a double blind randomised
controlled study; this demonstrated tolerability but no significant
effect on dystonia [20]. In a similar acute dose setting, nabilone
was assessed in Parkinson’s disease patients, both off and on levodopa, with a significant improvement in levodopa-induced dyskinesia but of interest there was also an improvement in painful
limb dystonia occurring prior to treatment with levodopa – so
called ‘off-period’ dystonia in 2 subjects [21]. Therefore, we proposed to assess the benefit of another synthetic cannabinoid agonist, dronabinol, on dystonia over a 3 week treatment period.
Dronabinol has been widely used in the treatment of anorexia
and nausea in chemotherapy patients and has shown good safety
and tolerability in that population [22,23]. Due to the heterogeneity and variability in clinical severity of dystonia, we assessed dronabinol only in patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia (CD)
using a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled crossover
design.

Methods

Male and female subjects, aged 18–75 yrs, with CD were recruited from the Toronto Western Hospital movement disorders
center between January 2007 and May 2009. Exclusion criteria included secondary causes of dystonia, active or prior psychosis, history of substance abuse, use of any other cannabinoids in the
preceding month, refusal to refrain from operating heavy machinery or driving during the trial. Subjects had to be at least 4 months
since the time of their last botulinum toxin injection. The use of
other GABA mediated drugs including gabapentin, phenobarbital,
benzodiazepines, or baclofen were only allowed if patients were
on a stable dose for at least a month prior to the initiation of the
study. Any other medications that might affect dystonia remained
unchanged during the trial and no new treatments were initiated
during the trial. Subjects were required not to use marijuana or
any other cannabinoid aside from the study drug during the trial
period. Patients were randomized in a cross-over design, to placebo followed by dronabinol or vice versa by the use of computer-generated random numbers table that remained within the
hospital pharmacy until the end of the trial.
Dronabinol tablets (Marinol[�], purchased from Solvay Pharma,
Markham, ON), consisted of 2.5 mg delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol(D[9]-THC), and matching placebo tablets were produced by the
hospital pharmacy. Dronabinol/placebo was commenced at 1 tablet (2.5 mg) OD and increased every 3 days up to 3 tabs BID (maximum dose 15 mg)/d over 12 days and then maintained for 9 days.
Subjects were contacted by phone every third day to assess side effects in order to determine dose escalation. If the subject could not
tolerate a dose escalation, then the dose was reduced to the preceding level and continued down until tolerated. Subjects were required to maintain a stable dose for a minimum of 4 days prior to
each assessment. At the end of the third week, study drug was reduced to stop over 3 days followed by a 2 week washed out period
and an identical titration and maintenance treatment for the second arm. Given the 25–36 h half-life of dronabinol a 2 week
wash-out was adequate. Compliance was monitored by phone calls
for side effects and pill counts were performed at the end of each
treatment arm. The total study duration was 8 weeks. The study
was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and
was approved by the University of Toronto research ethics board.
The study was registered at clinical trials.gov (NCT00418925). All
patients gave written informed consent.
The primary outcome measure was the change in the Toronto
Western Hospital Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) part
A subscore, at the beginning and end of each 3 week treatment


ing scale used in the assessment of CD [24,25] consisting of three
parts. TWSTRS Part A measures CD motor severity (score 0–35, a
higher score indicates greater severity) and was determined from
a standardized video protocol, outlined in the TWSTRS scale, performed at each visit, and then scored post hoc by a blinded investigator who was not involved in the study visits. TWSTRS part B is a
subjective rating of CD disability related to activities of daily living
(score 0–33) and part C measures pain related to CD (score 0–20). A
second investigator assessed secondary outcomes at each study
visit including TWSTRS parts B and C, global impression scale
(GIS), a visual analog pain (VAP) scale and adverse events.

Sample size

To our knowledge, there are no prior studies estimating the
clinically meaningful change in TWSTRS subscores required to
determine sample size in clinical trials for subjects with CD. Previous studies have suggested a 9-point change in the total TWSTRS
score to be a clinically meaningful effect size [26] and a standard
deviation of difference in total TWSTRS score from baseline to be
10 [26]. Using these assumptions in a two sample, cross-over design with a two tailed P = 0.05 and a 90% power of detecting this
difference, we estimated a total sample size of 30 subjects.

Statistical analysis

Scores obtained at the beginning and end of each treatment period, with dronabinol and placebo, were compared using a nonparametric Friedman’s analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed
by post hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test for all variables analyzed. Due to the small number of subjects, GIS and adverse events
are descriptive. Significance was assigned when P < 0.05. Statistics
were computed with the SPSS 13.0 for Windows and GraphPad
Prism 5.02 software.

Results

Forty-one subjects were assessed for eligibility, but only nine
were randomized. Due to difficulties with enrollment and loss of
supply of active drug, the study was terminated after 2.5 years.
Seventeen subjects were excluded; the reason in the majority
was an inability to stop driving for the duration of the study.
Two subjects dropped out during the study (1 due to adverse
effects and 1 was lost to follow up after randomization), leaving
7 patients in the final analysis. Demographics and baseline characteristics of the cohort are presented in Table 1. All patients had received at least one prior botulinum toxin injection. Six out of 7
subjects reached the maximum 15 mg drug dose. One patient required a dose reduction to 7.5 mg in the dronabinol treatment
phase due to side-effects, including ‘wooziness’ and
‘lightheadedness’.
There was no significant effect of dronabinol compared to placebo on the primary outcome measure, TWSTRS-A (F(4.23), n = 7,
P = 0.237). In addition there was no significant effect of dronabinol

P = 0.96; TWSTRS-B, P = 0.216; TWSTRS-C P = 0.656; VAP scale
P = 0.273, all n = 7) (Table 2). Three subjects reported minimal
improvement after receiving dronabinol, one thought she was
slightly worse and three felt there was no change. After placebo,
two reported slight improvement (one also experiencing improvement after dronabinol), two reported slight worsening, and 3 no
change.
Adverse events were experienced by 8 out of 9 patients. There
were no serious adverse events. One subject withdrew from the
study during the dronabinol treatment phase due to insomnia
and a feeling of her heart racing; these symptoms resolved on discontinuing drug. All adverse events in the remaining 7 subjects occurred during the dronabinol phase of treatment and consisted of
lightheadedness, sleepiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, bitter-taste
and vertigo and were reported as mild. Two subjects on dronabinol
had a fall in systolic drop in blood pressure of more than
15 mm Hg. In one subject this was asymptomatic and the other

had the dose reduction as described above. There were no significant weight fluctuations among any of the subjects.

Discussion

The cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist, dronabinol, was ineffective in reducing CD symptoms over a 3 week treatment period. The
drug was reasonably tolerated but this study suggests that cannabinoids may not be useful in the treatment of dystonia. A prior open
label study reported that the cannabinoid, cannabidiol was effective in treating five patients with different forms of dystonia

[27]. Cannabidiol is the non-psychometric component of cannabis
sativa and the mechanism of action is poorly understood but may
involve 5-HT receptors rather than CB1 receptors thus accounting
for the proposed anxiolytic properties of the drug [28] .
There are several possible reasons why no benefit was shown in
our study; one factor being that the targeted number of patients
estimated in the power calculation (n = 30) for a clinically mean

ingful difference between treatments could not be reached. However, this number is likely to be an overestimate and much larger
than is usually required for pilot, phase IIa studies. As a hint of lack
of any positive effect, in our study no subject achieved a 9 point
(suggested to be a clinically meaningful change) or greater, difference in total TWSTRS score. In addition, the power calculations
were based on total TWSTRS scores not subscores i.e. TWSTRS-A,
B or C subscores, where smaller changes in outcome may be clinically relevant.
One potential benefit of dronabinol may have been on pain
associated with dystonia. In animal studies, cannabinoids produce
four classical cannabinomimetic effects including antinociception
(analgesia) without respiratory suppression, reduced spontaneous
activity, catalepsy and hypothermia [29]. A synthetic buccal spray
of cannabis sativa extract containing D[9]THC (2.7 mg) and cannabidiol (2.5 mg) is licensed for neuropathic pain and adjunctive analgesic treatment in advanced cancer. However, in our study, no
effect was seen even in individuals with significant pain.
One of the major obstacles to recruitment was the limitation on
driving that was required given the uncertainty about possible
sedation while on the study drug. However, sedation was only reported by 2 individuals and was mild and did not result in reduced
dose or withdrawal from the study; thus clinical trials of cannabinoids in clinical trials could be more lenient with respect to this
requirement, allowing easier recruitment. It was possible that by
only recruiting subjects for whom driving was not as issue, we
could have recruited subjects with more severe CD, and potentially
biased the outcome. However, the range of TWSTRS-A scores was
between 7 and 24, including a wide variability in baseline severity.
The number of individuals participating was too small to perform
any subgroup analysis to determine the effect of baseline severity
on response.
The relative efficacy of synthetic cannabinoids in stimulation of
cannabinoid receptors in the human basal ganglia remains uncertain and so the lack of effect in our study may have been due to
inadequate potency at CB1 receptors or dose of this formulation
or both. To ensure potency at the CB1 receptor, dronabinol was
used in this study rather than nabilone as dronabinol contains
#### D[9]-THC, a more potent cannabinoid CB1 agonist than the components of nabilone, which is a mixture of D[9] THC, cannabinol, cannabidiol and other cannabinoids [30]. Despite this, there was no
significant effect on dystonia. CB1 receptor agonists, with higher
affinity than D[9]-THC, are available in vitro, however, to date none
are available clinically [29,31].
In this study, dose ranges were based on conservative estimates
of tolerability and thus it is possible that higher doses could have
resulted in improved outcomes. However a placebo controlled case
study using D[9]-(THC) in a subject with musician’s dystonia reported improved symptoms using a lower dose of 5 mg/d [32]. Tolerability of dronabinol, 15 mg/d, in our study was good, although
most subjects did report some side-effects, particularly lightheadedness, drowsiness and anxiety. It is possible that slower titration
over a longer period may have allowed subjects to reach and tolerate higher doses. In support of this, in a single case report, a subject
with blepharospasm responded after several weeks to 25 mg daily
of dronabinol, but not to lower doses [33]. The relatively short
duration of treatment (3 weeks) was used for practical purposes
and safety concerns. However, it is likely that in treating dystonia,
a much longer time frame is required. Thus, in patients treated for
dystonia using anticholinergic drugs and those who undergo deep
brain stimulation for dystonia, improvements can be delayed by
several months, suggesting longer exposure to higher doses of cannabinoids may be necessary before conclusions can be made.
There remains much medical and public interest in the use of
cannabinoids in the treatment of chronic neurological disorders.


(cannabis sativa) to alleviate a range of medical symptoms. Several
recent studies have demonstrated potential for synthetic cannabinoids in disorders such as multiple sclerosis [34,35] and pain

[34,36]. There remain much uncertainty and controversy surrounding the short term and long term medical issues associated
with synthetic cannabinoids, as to date, most evidence of the adverse effects of cannabinoids relates to the effects of smoking cannabis sativa [37]. It is possible that oral synthetic cannabinoids will
not have the same side effects as cannabis sativa, as a recent study
with 12 months of follow up, demonstrated oral cannabinoids
were well tolerated [38]. Finally, tolerance to benefit from long
term cannabinoid use is a theoretical issue and needs clarification
with further randomized controlled trials.

Conclusions

Idiopathic dystonia remains poorly understood and inadequately treated. Cannabinoids have been suggested as a treatment
for dystonia due to potential action on CB1 receptors within the
basal ganglia. The synthetic cannabinoid, dronabinol, failed to
show any effect in 9 subjects with cervical dystonia. However,
due to difficulties with enrollment, the study was underpowered
and therefore, results must be interpreted with caution. If further
studies are attempted, a longer exposure to higher doses should
be considered.
