Abstract

Cannabinoids are known to have analgesic properties. We evaluated the effect of oro-mucosal sativex, (THC: CBD), an endocannabinoid system modulator, on pain and allodynia, in 125 patients with neuropathic pain of peripheral origin in a five-week,
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial. Patients remained on their existing stable analgesia. A self-titrating regimen was used to optimise drug administration. Sixty-three patients were randomised to receive sativex and 62 placebo. The
mean reduction in pain intensity scores (primary outcome measure) was greater in patients receiving sativex than placebo (mean
adjusted scores �1.48 points vs. �0.52 points on a 0–10 Numerical Rating Scale (p = 0.004; 95% CI: �1.59, �0.32). Improvements
in Neuropathic Pain Scale composite score (p = 0.007), sleep NRS (p = 0.001), dynamic allodynia (p = 0.042), punctate allodynia
(p = 0.021), Pain Disability Index (p = 0.003) and Patient’s Global Impression of Change (p < 0.001) were similarly greater on sativex vs. placebo. Sedative and gastrointestinal side effects were reported more commonly by patients on active medication. Of all
participants, 18% on sativex and 3% on placebo withdrew during the study. An open-label extension study showed that the initial
pain relief was maintained without dose escalation or toxicity for 52 weeks.

the first-line therapy [2]. Despite differences in their
mechanism of action, these agents appear similar in
analgesic efficacy and tolerability. There is a well-recognised need for better pain relief than is currently available. This study reports the effect of the administration

neuropathic pain. Identification of cannabinoid receptors [20] and encouraging results from preclinical and
clinical studies [15,16] and change in the political and
scientific scene in some countries, notably Canada, have
led to revived interest in cannabinoids as a therapeutic
modality. Two controlled trials on central pain associated with MS found short-term efficacy from them

[26,30], whereas two other studies in which pain was
not a primary outcome measure gave conflicting results

[33,40]. Neuropathic pain of peripheral or mixed peripheral and central origin was reported to respond to ajulemic acid, sativex or smoked cannabis; however,
treatment arms in these studies were short, between 5
and 14 days [1,6,19].
Sativex is derived from extracts of selected strains of
cannabis plants (Cannabis sativa) which produce high
and reproducible yields of the principal active cannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). It is administered as a spray for sublingual and oro-pharyngeal administration. Each
100 ll spray delivers 2.7 mg of THC and 2.5 mg of
CBD.
Cannabinoids are thought to work via two types of
receptors, CB1 and CB2. CB1 is widely distributed in
the peripheral and central nervous system, acting as a
presynaptic modulator of neurotransmitter release.
The main target for the effects of THC, CB1, occurs
at many sites critical for nociception. CB2 is also activated by THC but in normal circumstances is found in
immune cells only. However, in clinical pain the role of
the CB2 receptor may be different because following
tissue injury it is shown to be expressed in central nervous system microglia and dorsal root ganglion cells
following tissue injury [28] CBD appears to have limited affinity for either cannabinoid receptor, but in
higher doses may potentiate the effects of THC [32]
and mediate non-cannabinoid effects by activating the
TRPV1 receptor [8]. Combining the two in the same
preparation is thought to lead not only to increased
analgesic effect but may also result in antagonism of
adverse effects [27].

2. Methods

2.1. Study design

This was a 5-week multi-centre (5 centres in UK, 1 in Belgium), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel
group study. Patients were screened to determine eligibility
and completed baseline diary assessments of daily pain intensity and sleep disturbance scores in the 7–10 days prior to
first treatment assignment. After eligibility was confirmed,
patients were assigned to the next sequential randomisation
number within each centre. The randomisation schedule
had a 1:1 treatment allocation ratio with randomly permuted
blocks stratified by centre and was generated using a computer based pseudo-random number algorithm. The randomi

sation schedule was held by the sponsor with a copy in
patient-specific sealed envelopes sent to the pharmacy in each
centre. Once the patient’s eligibility was confirmed, they were
assigned to the next sequential randomisation number within
each centre. The placebo medication was identical in composition, appearance, odour and taste with the study medication
but without cannabis extract. That the smell and taste of the
cannabinoid preparation might lead to unblinding was
averted by disguising them with addition of peppermint oil
to both preparations. All medication was provided in identical amber vials, packaged and labelled by the sponsor.

2.2. Study patients

Patients had to have a current history of unilateral peripheral neuropathic pain and allodynia. Further enrolment criteria are shown in Table 1. Concomitant analgesia was
maintained at a stable dosage regimen for the duration of
the study. The decision to recruit was based on the patient’s
history. No tests for drugs of abuse potential were carried
out. Ethical approval was granted by the Local Ethics Committees of the participating centres. In one centre the
approval was conditional on patients not driving during the
trial.

2.3. Study medication and procedures

Initial dosing was under clinical supervision at the study
site. A pre-dose 100 mm ‘‘Intoxication’’ (0 = no intoxication
and 100 = extreme intoxication) Visual Analogue Scale
(VAS) was obtained and vital signs were checked. A maximum of 8 sprays were administered over 2 h with Intoxication VAS and vital signs checked at regular intervals. If,
following any dose, patients scored higher than 25 mm, or
there were clinical concerns, e.g. the patients showing dysphoria or cardiovascular changes, subsequent doses were
omitted [6,7].
After satisfactory completion of initial dosing, patients
began home dose titration and were allowed a maximum dose
of 8 sprays per 3-hour interval and a maximum of 48 sprays
per 24 h. At the next visit (after 7–10 days) titration, compliance and adverse events were reviewed, and patients advised
on how to optimise dosing for the rest of the study period.
Those patients who satisfactorily completed the trial were
offered the opportunity to participate in a common open-label
extension study of sativex.
All used and unused study medication containers were
returned at each visit to the research centre. Patients were
withdrawn from the study if there were indications of misuse,
including failure to record dosage accurately. Periodic telephone monitoring was undertaken at pre-arranged times during home dosing to check the patient’s condition and to
answer any queries. Throughout the study, allowable concomitant medications or treatments were continued to provide adequate background analgesia at a constant dose. Any
medication, other than the study medication taken during
the study, was recorded.
Patients kept a diary from the screening visit until end of
treatment in which they recorded daily their pain and sleep
scores (on the appropriate NRS), as well as adverse events
and the number of sprays used.

2.4. Testing for allodynia

Tests for allodynia were carried out at baseline and end of
study. The investigator recorded the most painful area within
the affected territory. Mechanical dynamic allodynia was
assessed by stroking the skin over the affected area five times
with a standardised brush, designed specifically for sensory
testing (Senselab Brush-05, Somedic, Horby, Sweden) at
P5 s intervals, and recording the pain severity on a 0–10 point
scale. All strokes were of the same length, minimum 2 cm.
Each dynamic allodynia score was calculated as the average
of the five strokes.
Punctate allodynia was measured using an in-house built
pressure algometer comprising a strain gauge connected to a
metal filament with a diameter of 1 mm and blunt tip at baseline and end of study. The filament was manually directed
against the skin at an angle of 90� and a steadily increasing
pressure applied until the patient verbally indicated that they
perceived pain (punctate pressure pain threshold). A contralateral mirror image site was used as control to identify any systemic effect from the trial drugs, as well as to introduce the
method to the patient before performing the test on the allodynic site. This control site was checked for evidence of local
injury, scar, rash or neurological deficit. During each session
the normal contralateral side was tested first. Once the patient
indicated that the sensation of pressure had turned into pain,
the algometer was removed and the pressure reading (in grams)
recorded. The same method was used for allodynic sites.
In addition, patients were asked to verbally rate the intensity of the pain elicited, choosing a number between 0 (no pain)
and 10 (most intense pain imaginable). The investigators were
aware of the previous punctate allodynia threshold and could
use it as guidance. Because some investigators expressed concern at using a rigid threshold as a targe for the second mea

surement, it was agreed that they could exercise discretion in
applying the force needed to reproduce approximately the
same pain as at baseline. The patients’ verbal pain score and
pressure used were recorded. Each punctate pain provocation
test was done only once during a single visit.

2.5. Outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was a change from baseline
on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of mean intensity of global
neuropathic pain, where 0 = ‘‘No Pain’’ and 10 = ‘‘Worst Possible Pain’’. Secondary measures included the composite score
calculated from the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) [10], tests
for mechanical allodynia, a four-step verbal rating scale for
sleep disturbance (see below), the Pain Disability Index
(PDI) [31], the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)
of both pain and allodynia, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) [5]. Possible cognitive decline was assessed
using the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests
(BRB-N) [7]. Information regarding the frequency of administration of the medication was recorded by the subjects in their
diary. Adverse events were collected at each clinic visit, and
haematology, clinical chemistry and ECG monitored at the
beginning and end of the study.

2.6. Statistical analysis

The sample size calculation was based on an expected SD of
1.8 for the pain intensity score, estimated from several studies
on peripheral neuropathic pain. To detect a difference between
treatment groups of 1.0 on a 0–10 (11-point) NRS with 80%
power and a 5% level of significance, 52 evaluable subjects
per group were required. A dropout rate of 15% was anticipated, bringing the total number of patients needed to 120.

T.J. Nurmikko et al. / Pain 133 (2007) 210–220 213


The primary analysis for the primary and secondary endpoints was performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The neuropathic pain intensity NRS score at baseline
was defined as the mean of all diary entries from Day �7 to
Day �1 and, for the end of treatment score, the mean of all
diary entries during the last 7 days in the study, or the last 3
days in the event of withdrawal. The NRS scores were summarised by treatment group for baseline, each week and end of
treatment. The change in NRS pain scores was compared
between treatment groups using analysis of covariance, the
model including treatment and trial centre as factors and baseline pain severity as a covariate. From this analysis the
adjusted treatment means, treatment difference and 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) for the treatment difference were
calculated.
The total scores for all questionnaires (NPS, PDI, GHQ12), as well as 0–10 NRS ratings of punctate and mechanical
allodynia, were obtained at baseline and end of the 5-week
trial. Sleep disturbance was measured by asking the subjects
to indicate the number of times they woke in previous nights
due to symptoms on a four category scale where 1 = none,


2 = once, 3 = twice, 4 = more than twice. The scores for this
‘‘Sleep Disturbance NRS’’ were obtained at baseline and
weekly thereafter until the end of trial. Statistical comparisons
were performed in the same way as the primary outcome measure. The PGIC was compared between treatments using Fisher’s Exact Test.

3. Results

A total of 141 patients were assessed for eligibility, 16
(11%) of whom failed to meet the eligibility criteria.
Sixty-three subjects were randomised to sativex and 62
to placebo (Fig. 1). At all participating centres, the randomisation led to a complete balance between treatment
allocations. Baseline demographic details for both groups
are shown in Table 2. The treatment groups were well
matched for age, duration of neuropathic pain, distribution of diagnostic pain subgroups, height, weight and
for history of previous cannabis use. The diagnosis was
based on existing clinical, imaging and neurophysiological

data. Aetiologies varied from post-infectious to traumatic, vascular and idiopathic. In nearly one-half of
patients the cause was posttraumatic and involved a single
nerve or nerve branch (focal nerve lesion) while in onefifth the lesion was at cervical, brachial or lumbosacral
plexus level or involved several nerves (peripheral neuropathy); in this group the original cause was either inflammation or diffuse trauma and remained frequently
unknown. The locations of focal nerve lesions and periph

eral neuropathics were similar across the two groups
(Table 2). The background use of concomitant analgesic
medication was high in both groups. The most frequently
reported medication was opioids, being taken by 74% of
the placebo group and 63% of the sativex group. Other frequently used background medications were tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and NSAIDs (Table 2).
Thirteen sativex patients (21%) failed to complete the
study; 11 withdrew because of side effects, 1 due to
patient non-compliance and one due to lack of efficacy.
Seven patients (11%) on placebo failed to complete the
study, 2 because of adverse effects and 5 because of lack
of effect. All randomised patients were included in the
ITT analysis. For the per-protocol (PP) analysis, there
were 47 patients on sativex and 56 on placebo. Protocol
violations were due to failure to meet the stringent time
window set for the final visits (12 patients on sativex, 2
on placebo), use of prohibited medication (6 on sativex,
two of whom also failed to meet the final visit time window, and 2 on placebo) or violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria (0 on sativex, 2 on placebo). One patient in
each group had their data censored because of use of
prohibited medication after Day 26.

3.1. Primary outcome measure

At baseline, the mean intensity of reported pain
scores (SD) on NRS was in the severe range with no difference between the sativex and placebo groups 7.3 (1.4)
and 7.2 (1.5), respectively (Table 2). At the end of treatment, the sativex group demonstrated an adjusted mean
change in NRS score of �1.48 points (a 22% reduction)
while the change for the placebo group was �0.52 points
(an 8% reduction) (Fig. 2). The estimated treatment

3.2. Secondary outcome measures **Week**


All questionnaire-based measures of pain and painrelated co-morbidity improved significantly more in
patients randomised to sativex than placebo (Table 3).
NPS composite score in the sativex group decreased significantly more than in the placebo group. Sleep disturbance
also decreased early on and improvement was maintained
until the end of the study (Fig. 3). Of the seven functional
areas assessed in the PDI, only sexual activity failed to
show a substantial improvement on sativex (Table 3).

3.3. Allodynia

3.3.1. Dynamic mechanical allodynia
All patients recruited into the study showed dynamic
allodynia. There was no difference in detected mean
(SD) allodynia pain scores between the two groups at
baseline (5.4 (2.7) vs. 5.0 (3.4)). At the end of treatment,
the mean reduction of dynamic allodynia was 20% in the
sativex group, and 5% in the placebo group, with an estimated mean treatment difference of �0.82 (p = 0.042;
95% CI: �1.6, �0.03)) in favour of sativex. NNT for
30% reduction in the allodynia score was 9.2 and for
50% reduction 7.5.

3.3.2. Punctate allodynia
At baseline, all randomised patients except one on
sativex showed punctate allodynia with clearly reduced
thresholds in the affected area vs. contralateral control

(mean (SD) difference between the contralateral site
and allodynic site: 127 (78) g). The severity of the allodynia within the affected area was comparable between
both sativex and placebo groups for pressure needed
to elicit pain (68.8 (47.7) g vs. 83.0 (77.4) g) and for
the level of pain generated by the stimulus itself (7.3
(1.7) vs. 7.4 (2.1)). At the end of study, there was no evidence of a change in the punctate pain threshold at the
contralateral control site, irrespective of whether the
patients were on sativex or placebo (treatment difference
11.1 g in favour of placebo; p = 0.3). At the allodynic
site, the placebo group reported unchanged punctate
pain pressure thresholds at end of study (83.0 (77.4) g
vs. 85.8 (68.9) g) with no change in pain levels (7.4
(2.1) and 7.2 (2.2)). In the sativex group, the threshold
levels increased from 68.8 (47.7) g to 86.2 (73.2) g but
not significantly compared to the placebo group
(p = 0.14). Despite this increase of applied punctate
pressure there was a notable decrease in the allodynia
pain scores (baseline: 7.3 (1.7) vs. end of treatment: 6.2
(2.6)). The estimated treatment difference of �0.87 was
in favour of sativex (p = 0.021; 95% CI: �1.62, �0.13),
giving an NNT (30%) of 5.9 and NNT (50%) of 13.4.
Inspection of punctate allodynia data revealed that in
some cases the pressure applied with the algometer to
the allodynic site had changed considerably between

pre-treatment and post-treatment. When a sensitivity
analysis was carried out in patients in whom the investigators applied a similar degree of force (<5% greater) to
the allodynic area on the second testing occasion (44
patients on sativex and 45 on placebo), there was a significantly larger reduction of allodynia pain in the sativex group than the placebo group leading to a
treatment difference of �0.94 (p = 0.046; 95% CI:
�1.85, �0.02) in line with the ITT analysis.
When all subjects were analysed together, there was a
strong correlation between the intensity of punctate
allodynia, dynamic allodynia and spontaneous pain at
baseline and end of study, with similar strong correlations between the three parameters for change in scores
(punctate allodynia vs. dynamic allodynia, r = 0.526,
p < 0.001; punctate allodynia vs. pain r = 0.369;
p < 0.001; dynamic allodynia vs. pain, r = 0.436,
p < 0.001). Inspection of sativex and placebo groups
separately showed that similar significant correlations
were present, except for change in dynamic allodynia
in the placebo group (r = 0.065, p = 0.61).
Results of the secondary efficacy end-points are summarised in Table 3. Thirty-two (51.6%) patients taking
sativex compared to 12 (19.3%) taking placebo considered their primary condition to be very much, much or
minimally improved (p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test).
The odds ratio for achieving a better response on sativex
than placebo, calculated from a logistic regression of the
data, was 3.55 (95% CI: �7.61, �1.72) in favour of sativex. There was no difference between groups in the
GHQ-12 score.

3.4. Dosing pattern

The mean (SD) number of sprays taken during the
first week of dose titration for sativex and placebo was
7.3 (3.5) and 10.9 (3.9), respectively. From the second
week onwards, the dose frequency remained stable in


both treatment groups, with no tendency to increasing
dose over the duration of the study. The number of
sprays used daily in the placebo group was higher than
in the sativex group (Table 4). Over the study period,
patients randomised to sativex used a mean (SD) of
10.9 (6.8) sprays daily compared with 19.0 (8.3) by
patients on placebo.

3.5. Adverse events and withdrawals

Fifty-seven (91%) patients in the sativex group experienced at least one adverse event (AE) during the course
of the study compared with 48 (77%) patients in the placebo group. The most frequent AEs were central nervous system related or gastrointestinal. Most were
observed at onset of treatment, and in the majority
described as mild. However, 6 (10%) patients on sativex
reported several gastrointestinal AEs (nausea, vomiting
diarrhoea, constipation) with none on placebo reporting
the same. Severe symptoms suggesting involvement of
the nervous system were reported with sativex in 7
(11%) and placebo 5 (8%) cases. All reported gastrointestinal AEs combined irrespective of their severity were
more common in the sativex group (31/63 (49%) than in
the placebo group (20/62 (32%), p = 0.003, Fisher’s
exact test), whereas the nervous system AEs (33/63 vs.
23/62, p > 0.10) were not. One case of severe psychiatric
AE was recorded on both groups (with sativex, emotional stress associated with paranoid thinking and with
placebo, confusion) and 6 further mild-to-moderate
ones in the sativex group as opposed to 3 in the placebo
group; these were mainly mood related. AEs seen in 3 or
more subjects are shown in Table 5 for all AEs and for
those considered possibly related to treatment.
In the sativex group, 11 (18%) patients withdrew due
to an AE compared with 2 (3%) in the placebo group.
There was one transient ischaemic attack in the sativex
group rated as a serious adverse event (SAE) and

considered unrelated to study treatment. Oral discomfort, other than dryness of mouth, occurred in 8 (13%)
patients taking sativex and 11 (18%) taking placebo
and was usually reported as mild. One patient on sativex
had transient mucosal ulcerations but leukoplakia was
not observed. No significant haematological or biochemical abnormalities were encountered in laboratory
parameters.
The Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological
Tests (BRB-N) was given to 85 patients (43 randomised
to sativex and 42 to placebo). No difference was seen
between groups assessed for cognitive function with this
method at the beginning and end of treatment (Table 6).
Intoxication scores (SD) remained low throughout
the study, peaking after the self-titration week at 8.0
(15.4) for sativex and 3.0 (7.9) for placebo on a 0–100
scale, respectively. Five patients on sativex and 2
patients on placebo scored more than 40/100 during
the maintenance period.

3.6. Long-term use of sativex

At the end of their 5-week trial period, each patient
was offered the chance to enter an open-label extension
study. Of the 125 subjects eligible, a total 89 (71%) of the
patients accepted the offer. They subsequently underwent re-titration of sativex from zero, in a way identical


to that used in the randomisation phase. Patients were
reviewed initially at 4 weeks thereafter every 8 weeks.
The duration of participation in the extension trial
ranged from 1 to 871 days. By study closure, 56 (63%)
patients had been withdrawn; 18 patients due to adverse
effects, 16 due to lack of efficacy, 15 due to withdrawal of
consent, 7 for other reasons. The mean (SD) duration of
the participation of withdrawn patients was 135 (147)
days. An LOCF analysis involving 76 patients carried
out at 52 weeks demonstrated a mean decrease of pain
NRS from the baseline of 7.3 (1.4) to 5.9 (2.4), i.e., similar
to that seen in the randomised trial. The daily number of
sprays did not increase appreciably during this period (N
(SD) 10.2 (6.0) at the end of the re-titration vs. 12.2 (7.6)
at 52 weeks). Two episodes of serious adverse effects were
reported (urticaria with eyelid oedema and an event of
somnolence, dysarthria and weakness) both leading to
withdrawal of the patient in question from the study.

4. Discussion

This study demonstrates that sativex is effective in the
relief of peripheral neuropathic pain when given in addition to existing medication. Greater than 30% improvement in pain intensity, generally considered as clinically
meaningful [9], was reported by 26% of subjects receiving sativex, compared with 15% of patients taking

placebo. At recruitment, all our patients were either
non-responders to several conventional neuropathic
analgesics, or were in severe pain despite taking appropriate therapy. Considering the refractory nature of
their pain, and that patients remained on their existing
analgesia, the improvement of the ongoing pain in those
on the active drug is encouraging. Further evidence for
the efficacy of sativex comes from improvement in
mechanical dynamic and punctate allodynia pain, sleep
and disability demonstrated in this study. Reduction in
systematically measured mechanical allodynia is not
commonly reported in controlled trials on neuropathic
pain [17] and usually only seen in single dose studies
or following other than oral administration, and failure
is common. [3,21,23,29,34–36]. Because to date there are
no reliable data converting reduction in allodynia scores
to clinically meaningful improvement, the NNT values
presented should be interpreted with caution.
In comparison with pain relief reported from other
cannabis-related clinical trials, sativex in our group of
patients demonstrated a greater difference over placebo
(0.96, 95% CI �1.59, �0.32) than in patients with plexus
avulsion (treatment difference �0.58, 95% CI �0.98,
�0.18) but somewhat less than in patients with central
pain due to MS (�1.25; 95% CI �2.11, 0.39) [6,26].
The treatment difference reported for dronabinol in
MS patients deprived of concomitant analgesic medication was 0.6 (95% CI �1.8, 0) while that for smoked cannabis in painful HIV neuropathy was approximately the
same as in the present study (as extrapolated from the
reported median 18% treatment difference in pain relief
from mean baseline scores of 53 and 54/100) [1,30]. Differences in patient populations, numbers of withdrawals, concomitant medications, trial designs and trial
durations probably explain a great deal of these varying
results. Interestingly, the two other cannabinoid trials in
which evoked pain was assessed, albeit in a limited fashion, also report some benefit in line with the present
study [1,30].
Our reason for maintaining existing analgesia was
based on both ethical and clinical considerations. A
number of treatments that have shown efficacy in
peripheral neuropathic pain are in widespread use in
accordance with existing guidelines [2]. Depriving a
patient from such therapies during a placebo-controlled
trial could not be ethically justified. Clinical practice is
also moving toward combination therapies due to the
realisation that in chronic neuropathic pain multiple
mechanisms are the norm [12,39].
The lack of GHQ-12 to show any change during the
present study is in line with virtually all other cannabinoid trials in which the psychosocial domain was
explored, irrespective of the measure used (GHQ-30,

[40]; GHQ-28, [33]; SF-36, [30]; GHQ-12, [6]; HADS,

[26]; POMS, [1]). GHQ-12 is a well-validated measure
of anxiety, depression and social dysfunction [37] and


shows adequate sensitivity to change in longitudinal
studies in manifest depression [11]. The role of the
endocannabinoid system in the regulation of anxiety
and mood disorders still remains unclear, and both
CB1 agonists and antagonists have been shown to possess either anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects as well as
variable effects on mood [38]. It is possible that
GHQ-12 cannot detect modest changes in a population
such as ours scoring just above the mean of the general
population [24]. Alternatively, the above paradoxical
effects of THC, or the ability of CBD to block some
of the psychomimetic effects of THC, may explain
the lack of change in this measure.
The self-titration schedule used in this study was chosen for several reasons. Previous studies [6,26] indicated
that individual subjects have a variable threshold to the
known pharmacodynamic effects of sativex. A self-titration regimen permitted individual patients to optimise
their dose on the basis of their own efficacy and tolerability response. Both experimental and human volunteer
studies suggest that tolerance to some of the side effects
of cannabis occurs within days of its repeated administration [14,18,22]. A self-titration regimen allows for this
to occur, further optimising the therapeutic response.
There appears to be substantial between-patient variability in the pharmacokinetics of THC and other cannabinoids [13,14] and in such circumstances the
implementation of a fixed-dose regimen is likely to yield
suboptimal results.
The mean number of sprays taken daily by the sativex
group remained stable during the course of the study
despite patients having the freedom to determine their
own dosing, indicating that tolerance did not develop at
least over the 4-week stable treatment period of this study.
The dose titration regimen used was usually successful in
providing the optimal therapeutic level for individual
patients. This conclusion is endorsed by the observation
that those patients who took part in the open-label extension study did not increase the number of daily sprays
during the first 52 weeks of open-label treatment while
apparently maintaining the initial analgesic effect.
While the therapeutic effects of cannabis have often
been attributed to THC, the second major constituent
of the trial medication, CBD has been shown to have
effects which may be additive to those of THC in pain
relief in animal models, and also to have the potential
to ameliorate some of the psychoactive effects of THC

[27]. This interaction between the two components
may permit subjects to tolerate mean daily doses of
more than 27 mg THC. This dose is in excess of those
used in other controlled studies of THC, and may
account for the observed efficacy [14].
The adverse events reported by the patients were
mostly gastrointestinal, central nervous system related
or topical. While reported gastrointestinal AEs were
more common in the sativex group, central nervous sys

tem AEs were not; and, importantly, objective measurement of psychomotor performance did not vary across
the two groups. In general, the number of patients who
withdrew is similar to those reported in well-known large
trials of other drugs used in neuropathic pain [4,25]. That
PCIG scores favoured sativex over placebo suggests that
subjective pain relief, reduced disability and improved
sleep overrode the negative impact of AEs.
There was no formal assessment of whether unblinding might have taken place. The psychotrophic effects
of cannabis are well known to the public, and 20% of
the participants in the present trial had previous exposure to cannabis. A post-hoc analysis found that previous use of cannabis was not predictive of the change
in mean pain scores. Classical psychotrophic effects of
cannabis were reported by relatively few patients. The
intoxication scores were marginally higher in the sativex
group, and psychometric tests (BRB-N) remained
unchanged during the trial. It is therefore unlikely that
a significant number of those on sativex would have correctly guessed they were on active medication unless
they deliberately overdosed. From returned trial medication it was concluded that such practice did not take place.
Patients taking placebo may have concluded that they
were taking inactive substance, given that they used a relatively high number of sprays. However, the majority of
patients took less than the highest allowable dosage. Also,
only 5 (8%) of the placebo group withdrew for lack of efficacy, suggesting that no significant unblinding took place.
We conclude that the results from this study indicate
that sativex has a positive broad spectrum therapeutic
effect in neuropathic pain, when used in addition to existing analgesic medication. The emergence of a highly standardised,uniformpreparationofTHC:CBDshouldallow
for further studies which better define the role for cannabinoids in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes.
