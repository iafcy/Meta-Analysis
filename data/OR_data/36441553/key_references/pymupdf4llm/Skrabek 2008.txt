##### Abstract: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the
**benefit of nabilone in pain management and quality of life improvement in 40 patients with**
**fibromyalgia. After a baseline assessment, subjects were titrated up on nabilone, from 0.5 mg PO at**
**bedtime to 1 mg BID over 4 weeks or received a corresponding placebo. At the 2- and 4-week visits,**
**the primary outcome measure, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and the secondary outcome**
**measures, number of tender points, the average tender point pain threshold, and the Fibromyalgia**
**Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), were evaluated. After a 4-week washout period, subjects returned for**
**reassessment of the outcome measures. There were no significant differences in population demo-**
**graphics between groups at baseline. There were significant decreases in the VAS (�2.04, P < .02), FIQ**
**(�12.07, P < .02), and anxiety (�1.67, P < .02) in the nabilone treated group at 4 weeks. There were**
**no significant improvements in the placebo group. The treatment group experienced more side**
**effects per person at 2 and 4 weeks (1.58, P < .02 and 1.54, P < .05), respectively. Nabilone appears**
**to be a beneficial, well-tolerated treatment option for fibromyalgia patients, with significant benefits**
**in pain relief and functional improvement.**
##### Perspective: To our knowledge, this is the first randomized, controlled trial to assess the benefit of
**_nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, on pain reduction and quality of life improvement in patients with_**
**_fibromyalgia. As nabilone improved symptoms and was well-tolerated, it may be a useful adjunct for_**

ibromyalgia is a syndrome of unknown etiology,
characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.[38] It affects 2% to 4%

# F

of the general population[35,36,37] and is 4 to 7 times more
common in women, with symptoms usually arising between 20 and 55 years of age.[15]

The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, established in
1990 by the American College of Rheumatology, includes widespread pain for at least 3 months and point
tenderness with 4 kg of pressure at 11 or more of 18
characteristic tender points.[38] These criteria allow for the

differentiation of fibromyalgia from other chronic musculoskeletal pain with a sensitivity and specificity of almost 85%.[16]

Patients with fibromyalgia have lower pain thresholds
to both mechanical and thermal insults, give higher pain
ratings, and experience an altered temporal summation
to painful stimuli.[16] The sensitization of pain perception
that is present in these patients can occur both peripherally and centrally after tissue damage but may also be
present in patients with no obvious tissue damage.[20]

Sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of patients with
fibromyalgia, as activity of both unmyelinated C fibers
and A-� fibers is increased[14,21]; however, it is unknown
whether sensitization is due to increased pain fiber facilitation, or decreased inhibition.[20]

Given the lack of understanding in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia, it is not surprising that until recently, with the approval of pregabalin, no medical treatment had been specifically approved by the United States
Food and Drug Administration for its management.[13]

There is also evidence that tricyclic antidepressants, cardiovascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy and patient

education are effective in reducing the pain experienced
by fibromyalgia patients.[16] A recent case series of 4 patients has suggested the possible benefit of nabilone, a
synthetic cannabinoid, in the treatment of fibromyalgia,
however more studies are required.[18]

Two types of cannabinoid receptors have been isolated:
CB1 and CB2. The CB1 receptor is found predominantly
in the central and peripheral nervous system,[25] whereas
CB2 receptors are found principally in the immune system.[27] Endogenous cannabinoids have been isolated
that interact with these receptors.[10] CB1 agonists have
been shown to have an analgesic effect in acute and
chronic pain models.[10] The CB1 agonists act at many sites
along pain transmission pathways including activation of
peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal CB1 receptors, each
independently decreasing nociception.[10]

The endocannabinoid system shares several similarities
with the opioid system.[9] CB1 and opioid receptors are
both found in similar areas of the nervous system involved in pain control, including the periaqueductal gray
matter, rostral ventromedial medulla, and the spinal
cord.[29] Besides the similarities with the opioid system,
cannabinoids have also been shown to inhibit prostaglandin E-2 synthesis,[8] reduce platelet aggregation,[31]

and have an anti-inflammatory effect twice as great as
hydrocortisone and 20 times that of aspirin.[12]

Nabilone is 1 of 2 orally administered cannabinoids
available in Canada and is currently approved for the
management of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy. Research into oral cannabinoid use in the management of chronic and neuropathic pain has been encouraging.[18,32] As no treatment has been specifically
approved for management of fibromyalgia, further research into treatment strategies is important. To date, no
randomized, controlled trials have been conducted to
assess the efficacy of a synthetic cannabinoid on pain and
quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia.
Our hypothesis was that nabilone will significantly reduce the pain and improve quality of life in fibromyalgia
patients compared with placebo, as evidenced by significant improvements in visual analog scale pain scores
(VAS), number of tender points, average tender point
pain threshold, and scores on the Fibromyalgia Impact
Questionnaire (FIQ).

### Materials and Methods

#### Setting
The study was conducted in the Outpatient Musculoskeletal Clinic at the Rehabilitation Hospital, Health Sciences Centre (HSC), Department of Physical Medicine
and Rehabilitation, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada,
from April 2006 to November 2006. Patients were recruited from the musculoskeletal practices of attending
Physiatrists and Rheumatologists at the Rehabilitation
Hospital.

#### Inclusion Criteria
Inclusion criteria for the study included the subject
h ll f h l ( )


criteria for the classification of fibromyalgia[38]; patients
between 18 and 70 years of age; having continued pain
despite the use of other oral medications; and no previous use of oral cannabinoids for pain management.

#### Exclusion Criteria
Subjects were excluded from participating in the study
if their pain was better explained by a diagnosis other
than fibromyalgia; for abnormalities on routine baseline
blood work including electrolytes, urea and creatinine, a
complete blood count, and liver function tests; heart disease; schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder; severe
liver dysfunction; history of untreated nonpsychotic
emotional disorders; cognitive impairment; major illness
in another organ system; pregnancy; nursing mothers; a
history of drug dependency; or a known sensitivity to
marijuana or other cannabinoid agents.

#### Protocol
Subjects met the eligibility criteria through a structured interview process, and participants provided informed consent. HSC Research ethics board, HSC Impact
Committee and Health Canada approval was obtained
prior to proceeding with the study.
Subjects were randomly assigned by the HSC pharmacy
into treatment and control groups, each consisting of 20
participants (Fig 1). The examining physicians and the
subjects were blinded to the randomization process. All
of the study medication was provided by Valeant Canada
Limited (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and was identical to
placebo. Subjects in both groups were seen at baseline,
after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of treatment and after a
4-week washout period. Subjects in the treatment group
received 0.5 mg nabilone PO at bedtime for a 1-week
period, with instructions to increase to 0.5 mg BID after 7
days. At the 2-week visit, subjects were evaluated for the
presence of side effects and drug tolerance, and if they
consented to continue, had the prescription increased to
nabilone 0.5 mg PO in the morning and 1 mg PO at
bedtime, with instructions to increase to 1 mg BID after 7
days. Subjects in the control group received a corresponding placebo. Subjects were assessed for the safety
and efficacy of their prescription based on the outcome
measures at the 2-, 4-, and 8-week follow-up visits. Subjects were asked to continue any current treatment for
fibromyalgia, including breakthrough pain medications,
but not to begin any new therapies.

#### Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was a 10 cm VAS for
pain. The secondary outcome measures included the
number of positive tender points; the average tender
point pain threshold; and the subject’s score on the FIQ.
At each visit, subjects were asked to rate their current
level of pain on the 10 cm VAS, (0 � no pain; 10 � worst
pain imaginable), a valid and reliable scale for rating
pain intensity.[26] Subjects then filled out the FIQ, which is
a validated, self-administered test, scored out of 100,

anxiety, sleep, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well-being in
patients with fibromyalgia.[7,23] The higher the score on
the FIQ, the greater the impact of fibromyalgia on the
subject’s quality of life.[7] Subjects were then assessed for
the number of positive tender points by digital palpation
over the 18 characteristic tender point sites in the ACR
criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia,[38] which has
been previously shown to have both good intrarater and
interrater reliability.[33] The subjects were asked to identify if a given point was painful as slow steady digital
pressure was applied. The same evaluation of the tender
points was then repeated with a hand-held Fischer algometer. This test has also demonstrated good interrater and test-retest reliability.[33] Pressure was applied over
each tender point at a rate of 1 kilogram per square
centimeter per second, and subjects were asked to identify the moment the pressure became painful. The pain
threshold at each of the 18 tender points was recorded
and an average tender point pain threshold for each visit
was calculated. During each visit, any reported side effects as well as weight, blood pressure, and heart rate
were recorded.

#### Statistical Analysis
Based on the previous case series investigating
nabilone use in fibromyalgia,[18] we calculated that 16
patients would be necessary in each group to detect a
change of 2 cm on the 10 cm VAS, using an � of �0.05
d f ll f d


to have 20 subjects in each group start the study. Statistical analysis was conducted, and we considered P � .05
to be statistically significant for all of our outcome measures. The mean and standard deviation was calculated
for each outcome measure at each visit and a Student’s
_t test was performed to compare the change in the mean_
from baseline within and between groups.

### Results

Forty-four subjects were screened to participate in the
study between April and November of 2006. Four subjects did not meet the entrance requirements for the
study. Reasons for their exclusion included a history of
multiple medical problems (n � 1); subjects did not like
the stigma associated with the use of cannabinoids (n �
2); and previous oral cannabinoid use (n � 1).
The remaining 40 subjects were randomly assigned by
the HSC pharmacy into either the nabilone or placebo
group (Fig 1). The examining physicians and patients
were blinded to the randomization process. The baseline
demographic data and baseline outcome measures are
presented for both groups (Table 1). No significant differences in baseline demographic data or primary and
secondary outcome measures were present. The percentage of subjects employed and the use of opioid medications for pain were not significantly different between
the 2 groups.

from the placebo group dropped out of the study before
its completion. All of the subjects who withdrew from
the study did so at or before the first follow-up visit. In
the control group, one subject discontinued the medication after 4 days because of headaches; the other withdrew at the first follow-up visit, after 2 weeks, although
no side effects or reason for dropping out was stated. Of
the subjects in the treatment group, 3 withdrew before
the first follow-up visit. Two of these subjects did not
state a reason for withdrawal and listed no side effects,
whereas the other subject experienced dizziness, disorientation, and nausea. The remaining 2 subjects in the
treatment group to withdraw did so at the first follow-up visit, after 2 weeks. One subject stated poor coordination, dizziness, headache, and nausea as the reasons for withdrawing from the study, whereas the other
experienced drowsiness and fatigue. All patients in the
treatment group that continued with the study achieved
a nabilone dose of 1 mg BID.
There was a significant increase in the weight of subjects treated with nabilone for 2 weeks, (1.13 kg, P � .01).

This effect, however, was transient, as there was no significant difference in weight change observed between
the 2 groups during the 4-week and 8-week visits.
When compared with baseline, at the 2-, 4-, and
8-week visits, no statistically significant differences were
observed in any of the outcome measures in the placebo
group.
There were no statistically significant differences from
baseline in the outcome measures in the nabilone
treated subjects, at a dose of 0.5 mg BID, after 2 weeks of
treatment. However, at the 4-week follow-up visit, at a
nabilone dose of 1 mg BID, statistically significant improvements were seen in the VAS, FIQ, and FIQ anxiety
scale. The VAS scores for pain decreased from baseline at
4 weeks (�2.04, P � .02) (Fig 2). Fibromyalgia Impact
Questionnaire scores also significantly decreased (�12.07,
_P �_ .02) (Fig 3). The 10-point anxiety scale within the FIQ
was the final outcome to be statistically improved from
baseline after 4 weeks of treatment (�1.67, P � .02) (Fig 4).

the depression and fatigue scales on the FIQ were not
significantly different from baseline values.
Comparing the treatment and placebo groups at 2
weeks of treatment, no significant differences were seen
in VAS, number of tender points, tender point pain
threshold, or FIQ. Of the 3 separately analyzed questions
in the FIQ concerning anxiety, depression, and fatigue,
only anxiety was significantly less at the 2-week visit in
the nabilone group. The score on the 10-point scale for
anxiety decreased in the treatment group at a nabilone
dose of 0.5 mg BID (�1.92, P � .025).
At the 4-week visit, statistically significant differences
between the treatment and placebo groups were also
present. The change from baseline in visual analogue
scale pain scores (�1.43, P � .05) (Fig 5), FIQ scores
(�10.76, P � .01) (Fig 6), and the FIQ anxiety scale (�2.20,
_P �_ .01) (Fig 7) all showed significant improvement when
compared with the placebo group.


No significant differences were seen between the
treatment and placebo groups after the 4-week washout
period at the 8-week visit.
Side effects were more common in the nabilonetreated subjects compared with placebo controls at both
2 and 4 weeks of treatment, (1.58, P � .02 and 1.54, P �
.05), respectively. The frequency of the most common
side effects for both groups is listed in Table 2. The most
common side effects reported by subjects in the nabilone
group include drowsiness (7/15), dry mouth (5/15), vertigo (4/15), and ataxia (3/15). No serious adverse events
occurred during the study.

benefits of the synthetic cannabinoid nabilone on pain
reduction and quality of life improvement in patients

with fibromyalgia. Significant reductions in VAS score for
pain, FIQ score, and FIQ anxiety score were seen in the
treatment group at the 4-week visit. These significant
reductions are found both when comparing the treatment group with their baseline values and when comparing the change from baseline to the placebo group at
4 weeks. None of the study participants achieved a total
remission of their fibromyalgia symptoms.


Although improvements in VAS and FIQ scores were
present after 4 weeks of treatment, there was no significant change in the number of tender points or tender
point pain threshold, which is supported by other studies.[2,23]

Subjects in the placebo group did not obtain any significant benefit in the outcome measures at any time
during the study. After a 4-week washout period, out

come measures were not significantly different from
baseline in both groups. Nabilone does not appear to
have any lasting benefit in subjects when treatment is
discontinued.
Comparing the baseline FIQ scores in our study to some
recent studies that used the FIQ, our subjects scored on
average 12 to 22 points higher,[2,5,30] indicating their
quality of life was more severely affected by fibromyalgia.[23] As our recruitment practices were similar, the reason for the disparity in the baseline FIQ scores and its
effect on our results is unclear.
The significant drop in the VAS (�2.04, P � .02) in our
treatment group was similar to those of other drug trials,
which ranged from 1.2 to 2.2.[2,5,17] Our finding of a significant drop in the FIQ score (�12.07, P � .02) was also
similar to other drug trials whose drop in FIQ score
ranged from 5.53 to 15.8.[2,3,5,17,30] Despite the poorer


baseline quality of life of our subjects, they still managed
a significant improvement in FIQ scores on par with other
studies. This suggests that nabilone is an effective treatment even for those with severe cases of fibromyalgia
with marked functional impairment.
Although statistically significant reductions in VAS
score for pain, FIQ score, and FIQ anxiety score were
observed in this study, the question remains whether
these findings are clinically significant? With the current lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of
fibromyalgia, and options in its medical management,[13] the statistically significant benefits obtained
in this study are promising and require consideration
as an adjunct to the current medical management of
fibromyalgia.
The analgesic benefits of cannabinoids in the treatment of acute and chronic pain have already been estab

lished,[10] so their benefit in fibromyalgia patients is not
surprising. Whether this benefit is secondary to a clinical
endocannabinoid deficiency in fibromyalgia patients as
has been suggested[28] or the synergistic relationship with
endogenous opioids,[27] it is clear from previous studies
that cannabinoids act at many sites along pain transmission pathways.
Other known actions of cannabinoids including inhibition of prostaglandin E-2 synthesis,[8] its anti-inflammatory effect,[12] experimental increases in �-endorphins,[34]

and the regulation of substance P and enkephalin mRNA
levels in the basal ganglia[22] could all contribute to less
pain experienced in the nabilone-treated patients.
Anxiety on the FIQ was also decreased in the treatment
group at the 4-week visit, which is not exclusive to our
study. A trial assessing the effects of tramadol and acetaminophen on patients with fibromyalgia found similar
improvements in VAS, FIQ, and anxiety, without significant improvements in depression or fatigue.[5] Although part of the benefit obtained in pain reduction
and quality-of-life improvement in these patients may
be secondary to reduced anxiety, other studies have
not shown a change in anxiety despite significant functional improvements.[30] Further studies with validated
scales for anxiety need to be conducted to explore this
issue.
Nabilone was generally well tolerated by participants
throughout the study. This is reassuring, as it is well
known that patients with fibromyalgia are sensitive to
most medications and have difficulty tolerating medication side effects.[15] Although there were significantly
more side effects per person in the treatment group at 2
and 4 weeks (1.58, P � .02 and 1.54, P � .05), respectively,
no serious adverse effects were seen in the nabilonetreated subjects during the study. Three-quarters of the
subjects in the treatment group tolerated the medication well and completed the study. Those who withdrew
from the study did so at or before the first follow-up visit
at 2 weeks. The reported side effects of nabilone were
generally mild, and nabilone did not appear to have adverse interactions with any of the concomitant medications patients were taking, including antidepressants,
muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories,
and opioids. This supports the findings from the previously conducted case series with nabilone and fibromyalgia patients.[18] Slowing the titration of the medication in longer studies may further reduce treatment
side effects.
When prescribing nabilone, cost must be taken into
consideration. Participants using nabilone at the dose we
found to be effective in the study should expect to pay
over four thousand dollars for a year’s supply of the medication in Canada. Patients must weigh these costs
against the potential benefits of pain reduction and improved quality of life. As the medication’s cost may be
prohibitive to some patients, nabilone probably would
not be the first line therapy prescribed to patients with
fibromyalgia but should be considered if other treath b ff


The current study is not without its limitations. Participants in both groups were allowed to continue any
treatments for pain, with the use of nabilone as an adjunctive therapy. Despite the benefit in pain and anxiety
reduction and quality of life improvement in the treatment group, it cannot be definitively concluded that the
benefit was not a result of the combination of therapies.
We thought that allowing both groups to continue their
ongoing pain therapies controlled for this variable, and
as fibromyalgia patients using complementary therapies
ranges in studies from 60 to 90 percent,[4] the use of
nabilone as an adjunct is clinically relevant. Future studies could be done using nabilone as a single agent to
determine its effect on pain and quality of life alone.
Given the fluctuating nature of fibromyalgia symptoms,[15] our study was limited by its short duration and
limited number of visits. To control for the fluctuating
nature of fibromyalgia symptoms a pain journal could be
given to subjects; however, this requires more effort on
their behalf and may lead to decreased adherence to the
protocol.
Subjects were only trialed on nabilone for a total of 4
weeks, of which only the last week of treatment was at 1
mg BID. The long-term effect of nabilone in alleviating
pain and improving quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia cannot be determined based on the short duration of the study. As this study was the first randomized,
controlled trial to assess the benefits of nabilone in subjects with fibromyalgia, it was reasonable to conduct this
study for a shorter duration. Now that our study has
shown significant improvements for fibromyalgia patients, future studies should involve a longer duration of
the treatment, at a stable dose.
Although anxiety, depression, and fatigue were assessed in this study with single questions on the FIQ,
these single questions are not validated scales for the
respective symptoms. As the outcome measures in our
study focused on pain and quality of life, the VAS for
pain and FIQ were the scales used to assess them. Reports
exist for[19,24] and against[1] the incidence of depression
and anxiety being higher in the fibromyalgia population, and this area is still up for debate. Chronic fatigue
syndrome is associated with fibromyalgia,[6] and it has
been reported that patients with fibromyalgia have less
restorative sleep.[11] Future studies to evaluate the effect
of nabilone on anxiety, depression, and fatigue in patients with fibromyalgia should use validated scales for
each.
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate the benefit of nabilone on
pain and quality of life in subjects with fibromyalgia. The
significant reductions in VAS, FIQ, and anxiety seen in the
treatment group, coupled with minimal side effects, suggest that nabilone may be a beneficial, well-tolerated,
treatment option in patients with fibromyalgia. Future
studies are still necessary to assess the long-term benefit
of nabilone on pain and quality of life, and secondary
