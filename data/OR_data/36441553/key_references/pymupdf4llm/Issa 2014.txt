### Abstract

**Background—Many cannabinoid medications are approved in North America or in Phase III**
trials, such as Dronabinol, Nabilone, or Nabiximols. Little is known about their subjective
psychoactive effects when used for pain management. We hypothesized that when used for pain,
dronabinol has psychoactive effects in a dose response relationship, whose peak effects are
comparable to smoking marijuana.


**Methods—With IRB approval and written consent, this was a randomized controlled trial of**
single dose placebo, 10 or 20 mg dronabinol in 30 chronic non-cancer pain patients taking opioids
and not using marijuana. Hourly, for 8 hours during 3 monitored sessions, subjects completed the
Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI). Comparison sample was the ARCI ratings in a
study population with no pain (N=20), monitored every 30 minutes after smoking a 1.99% THC
(low) and a 3.51% (high strength) marijuana cigarette.

**Results—The 10 and 20 mg dronabinol doses had significantly elevated scores on 4/5 subscales**
vs. placebo over time (p<.05). Average daily morphine use, total pain relief (TOTPAR), age,
gender, and baseline pain level were not significant covariates. ARCI peak effects at 2 hours were
similar to peak effects of smoked marijuana at 30 minutes (p=.80, 10 mg=low, 20 mg=high
strength).


**Conclusions—In pain patients, oral dronabinol has similar psychoactive effects to smoking**
marijuana. This risk must be considered in any decision to prescribe cannabinoid medications for
pain.

### INTRODUCTION

The psychoactive properties of cannabis have been recognized since early time and today, it
remains the most widely used illicit drug globally[1]. Despite the possible stigma and legal
issues associated with its use, Cannabis sativa has been widely used as a herbal remedy over
the centuries for the treatment of various conditions such as migraine, spasticity, nausea and
vomiting as well as a magnitude of other disorders[2]. The search for the active ingredients of
the plant led to the first identification of its main psychoactive ingredient, δ-9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)[3], and the subsequent development of cannabinoid medications.


Several cannabinoid medications are currently FDA approved in the United States or in
phase III trials, such as Dronabinol, Nabilone, or Nabiximols. Research into their effects
continues to be a field of increasing interest, particularly with regard to their use in a variety
of therapeutic areas. Dronabinol is an oral synthetic stereoisomer of THC, and is currently
approved as an appetite stimulant in patients with HIV/AIDS and as a treatment for
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients who failed to respond adequately to
conventional antiemetic treatments[4]. However, it has been widely studied for a number of
other conditions including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, and
disturbed behavior in Alzheimer’s disease and Tourette syndrome[5].

Another area of study is the use of cannabinoid medications for the treatment of persistent
intractable pain. With the discovery of the endocannabinoid system and its involvement with
analgesia, recent interest has emerged regarding the pain-modulating effects of cannabinoids
and the potential of their synergistic analgesic effect with opioids for pain management[6–12].
However, such research did not address the existing controversy about the psychoactive
effects of medicinal cannabinoids when used for pain management, and whether such effects
differ from those of the whole plant marijuana.


The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the subjective psychoactive effects of
oral dronabinol in chronic pain patients on stable doses of opioids, and compare such effects
with placebo and smoked marijuana. The Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI),
which is considered a well validated and reliable measure to assess the subjective effects of
certain classes of psychoactive drugs[13], was used as the primary outcome measure for this
study. We hypothesized that when used for pain, dronabinol has psychoactive effects in a
dose response relationship, whose peak effects are comparable to smoking marijuana.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS


**Trial Design**


The oral dronabinol study was a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
crossover trial with three drug administration sessions conducted at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital in the United States. The comparison sample study cohort with smoked marijuana

**Participants**


was a four-visit, randomized-dosing trial conducted separately at McLean Hospital. The
dronabinol cohort permitted quantitative determinations of the subjective psychoactive
effects, while the smoked marijuana cohort allowed for additional qualitative comparisons.

The studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital and McLean Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. All subjects
provided written informed consent before any study-related procedures were performed and
were all compensated for their participation in the studies.


Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the oral dronabinol sample, which has
previously been reported in depth in the publication of the analgesic data[10]. Thirty chronic
non-cancer pain participants on opioid therapy were recruited through Brigham and
Women’s Hospital. Subjects ranged in age from 21 to 67 years (median age, 43.5 ± 11.8),
53% were female and the majority self-identified as Caucasian (96.7%). Most subjects
(66.7%) reported chronic pain more than 5 years, and low back pain (66.7%) was the most
prevalent. The mean morphine equivalent dose per day was 68.1 (ranging from 7.5 to 228.0
mg). Baseline pain intensity was 6.9/10 (± 1.3). Nineteen participants (63.3%) reported
using marijuana in the past, 8 of whom within the past year. All participants were required
to abstain from use for 1 month before and during enrollment. Subjects were also required to
have stable opioid analgesic dose for more than 6 months, and report pain of at least 4 on a
0–10 numeric rating scale. They were asked to reschedule their visit if their average pain
over the past 24 hours was less than 4/10, assessed on the morning of the anticipated
treatment.

One hundred and sixty subjects were screened via telephone, and 47 subjects met
preliminary inclusion criteria and presented for a baseline visit. Of these subjects, 30 met
qualification and were randomized to receive the study drug. Twenty-nine subjects
completed the study and one subject dropped out due to reported inability to concentrate
(Fig. 1). Exclusion criteria included: pain of cancer origin; opioid dosing more frequently
than every 8 hours; use of transdermal patch or intrathecal opioids (since it would be
difficult to titrate their opioid dose during the trial); significant depression and/or anxiety
symptoms (scores more than 11 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); current
substance abuse by self-report and psychosocial history, and any involvement in active
litigation, compensation or disability issues.


The comparison cohort consisted of twenty healthy participants with no pain who ranged in
age from 19 to 30 years old (mean age, 21.7 ± 3). Ninety-five percent were Caucasian,
reported using marijuana 1.6 ± 0.97 times per week, smoked 15.3 ± 4.2 tobacco cigarettes
per day, and drank 9 ± 5.6 alcoholic drinks per week. They all showed normal physical
examination, electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory tests before enrollment. They were
all current tobacco smokers (average of 10–20 cigarettes daily), had no history of drug or
alcohol dependence, and no diagnosis of any psychiatric disorders[14].

**Interventions**

The aim of this study was to compare the profile of acute effects on subjective measures of
dronabinol at two doses (10 and 20mg capsules) with placebo in patients with chronic pain
and smoked marijuana (1.99% and 3.51% Δ[9] THC) in those without chronic pain.


At the baseline visit for those with chronic pain, enrollment criteria were verified, informed
consent was obtained, a history and physical examination were completed and baseline
questionnaires about the subjects’ pain, function, and mood were administered. During the
three treatment sessions, each subject received identically appearing placebo, 10mg or 20mg
dronabinol capsules in 1 of 6 randomly allocated sequences. The randomization scheme was
generated by the Investigational Drug Service (IDS) hospital pharmacy, and both study
personnel and participants were blinded until all subjects had completed the study. The 3
treatment sessions were separated by a minimum of three days between each visit. On
arrival, subjects were asked to complete the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI)
questionnaire and answer questions about their pain and satisfaction levels. These
questionnaires were subsequently administered every hour for 8 hours. A symptom checklist
was administered at the initial and final visits to assess the occurrence of side effects. At the
completion of each treatment session, subjects were asked to evaluate the blinding process
and record their overall satisfaction with the treatment.


**Primary Outcome Measure**

The primary outcome measure of the study was the Addiction Research Center Inventory
(ARCI). The ARCI is a true/false 49-item well-known, self rated, well validated and reliable
measure that can be used to assess the subjective effects of certain classes of psychoactive
drugs[13]. Elevated scores on its 5 subscales highly correlate with significant psychoactive
effects that may potentially increase the likelihood that a substance will be abused in a
vulnerable population: the Morphine-Benzedrine Group (MBG, a measure of euphoria and
is considered as the hallmark subjective effect of abused drugs), the Benzedrine Group (BG,
a measure of stimulant effects relating to intellectual efficacy and energy), the PentobarbitalChlorpromazine-Alcohol Group (PCAG, a measure of apathetic sedation), the
Amphetamine Scale (A, a measure of amphetamine-like stimulant effects), and the Lysergic
Acid Diethylamide (LSD-specific group, a measure of somatic discomfort and dysphoria).
Participants were administered the ARCI via paper and pencil every hour in the dronabinol
group, and electronically using a keypad every 30 min in the smoked marijuana group.


**Study Procedures**

A comparison sample of those with no pain who smoked marijuana was chosen to
contextualize the findings regarding the psychoactive effects of dronabinol in patients with
chronic pain. In other words, it was used to illustrate how the effects of dronabinol might
compare to smoked cannabis, on a qualitative level primarily. This was a posthoc
comparison, and thus would not be able to conclusively determine if there were significant
differences between groups. As such, despite the statistical limitations in directly comparing
cohorts, it was hypothesized that the comparison group would demonstrate similar
psychoactive effects to those with chronic pain taking dronabinol. Study procedures in both
cohorts were quite similar, and all data was collected in a monitored laboratory environment

at individual sessions over the same period of time in two hospitals of the Partners
Healthcare System (Brigham and Women’s and McLean Hospitals). The comparison sample
was a healthy study population with no pain (n=20), monitored every 30 minutes with the
ARCI for 3 hours after smoking a 1.99% THC (low strength) and a 3.51% THC (high
strength) marijuana cigarette in random order, at different study sessions. Smoking sessions
lasted for 15 min each through a water-cooled inhaler device, and participants were
monitored continuously for the next 3 hours after smoking. The study visits were separated
by a minimum of 3 days between each visit. Participants were required to abstain from all
illicit drugs and alcohol for 72 and 24 hours, respectively, prior to the study. They could not
smoke tobacco or have any caffeine from midnight prior to each study day. Breath samples
to check for alcohol and carbon monoxide, as well as urine samples and blood samples (to
test for THC and its metabolites, nicotine, cotinine) were collected when subjects arrived to
the laboratory. Urine drug tests had to be negative for drugs of abuse excluding THC
metabolites, or else study visit was re-scheduled. If the urine test was positive for THC
metabolites, one of the blood samples was tested for the presence of THC and its
metabolites to determine if there has been use within the past 72 hours. For more specific
details on the experimental design of the comparison study, including the marijuana
challenge session, see Penetar et al.[14]


**Statistical analysis**

All data were analyzed with SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Services, v 13.0;
Chicago, IL). A repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess
hourly and peak subjective responses on the ARCI scales as a primary measurement of
dronabinol subjective effects. This was supplemented by an ANOVA comparison between
cohorts and doses at the time of peak psychoactive effects. This was determined by the
highest mean of five ARCI subscale scores in both cohorts (t= 2 hours for the dronabinol
group and t= 30 minutes for the smoked cannabis group). Tukey corrections were used for
multiple dose comparisons within each ARCI subscale for the ANCOVA and peak effects
analyses, since each subscale measures a separate construct. Potential covariates that were
included in a sensitivity analysis were: age, gender, race, location, type and duration of pain,
average morphine equivalent dose and duration of opioid treatment, baseline pain level,
baseline HADS score, previous marijuana use and total pain relief reported over the course
of the 8 hour sessions in the chronic pain group (TOTPAR). Statistical significance was set
at p ≤ 0.05.


### RESULTS

**Dronabinol versus Placebo comparisons**


A repeated measures analysis found that the 10 and 20mg dronabinol doses resulted in
significant changes, relative to placebo, on four of the five ARCI subscales over time (Fig.
2). Relative to placebo, dronabinol significantly increased Morphine-Benzedrine Group
(MBG) [Drug effect: F = 5.5, p<0.05], Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group
(PCAG) [Drug effect: F = 8.0, p<0.01], and Amphetamine (A) [Drug effect: F = 3.3,
p<0.05] scores, and decreased Benzedrine Group (BG) [Drug effect: F= 3.1, p<0.05] scores.
There were no significant differences between the 10 mg vs. 20 mg doses. The overall

trends, however, suggest that the 20 mg dose was associated with the greatest psychoactive
effects. Benzedrine Group (BG) scores after dronabinol dose were lowest at 2 hours as
compared to placebo, indicating a worsening of intellectual energy. For the other subscales,
peak effects of the 2 doses of dronabinol vs. placebo were also found at 2 hours (P<.05 for
MBG, PCAG, A, BG, and LSD). The effects of dose on Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)
scores were non-significant over time (p>0.05), but the 10 and 20 mg doses were
significantly greater than placebo at 2 hours.

In the sensitivity analysis, for each of the three treatment conditions (placebo, dronabinol 10
and 20mg) average daily morphine use equivalents, total pain relief (TOTPAR), age, gender,
previous marijuana use, and baseline pain level did not show any significant correlations
with ARCI effects on any subscale. In a repeated measures ANCOVA analysis, these factors
were not significant univariate predictors of ARCI subscale scores; there was no significant
interaction with dose; nor did they significantly alter the F value of dose as a primary
predictor of outcome (Fig. 3). In particular, there was no significant relationship between the
level of reported pain relief (TOTPAR) and ARCI subscale scores in correlational or
ANCOVA analyses, indicating that dronabinol analgesia was reported by the subjects as a
phenomenon distinct from its psychoactive effects.


**Dronabinol versus Marijuana smoking comparisons**

Peak psychoactive effects of smoked cannabis were found at 30 minutes after completing
the inhaling procedure. For three of the ARCI subscale scores, there were significant
differences between the peak psychoactive effects of oral dronabinol (10 or 20 mg at 2
hours) and smoked marijuana (low and high dose at 30 minutes) as compared to placebo
(Fig. 4). Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group (PCAG) [Drug effect: F = 5.4,
p<0.05] and Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) [Drug effect: F = 3.3, p<0.05] scores were
significantly increased and Benzedrine Group (BG) [Drug effect: F = 3.5, p<0.05] score was
significantly decreased in comparison to oral placebo. However, Morphine-Benzedrine
Group (MBG) and Amphetamine (A) score differences were not statistically significant
(p>0.05).


Peak psychoactive effects of dronabinol 10 and 20 mg at 2 hours were similar to peak
effects of low and high strength smoked marijuana at 30 min in all five ARCI subscale
scores, and there were no statistically significant differences between them (p>.45, Figure
4). Overall, as reported by the subjects on the ARCI, the subjective experiences of taking
oral dronabinol or smoking marijuana do not appear to be significantly different than each
other.


### DISCUSSION

This study attempted to assess the subjective psychoactive effects of the cannabinoid
medication, dronabinol, when used in combination with stable opioid dosage for pain
management, as compared to placebo and smoked marijuana. Results of the study showed
that the subjective effects of 10 and 20mg dronabinol were consistently and significantly
greater than placebo on most ARCI subscales, and were equivalent to the psychoactive
effects of smoking marijuana, although, as expected, it took longer to reach the same peak

effects (2 hours with oral dronabinol as compared to 30 minutes with smoked marijuana).
These findings imply that in our laboratory environment, dronabinol caused a “high” similar
to smoking marijuana when used for pain management. However, this does not necessarily
mean that dronabinol has the same abuse liability as marijuana, and other risk factors for
addiction should also be considered before concluding that such a risk exists. For instance,
the ARCI does not assess drug likability, which is also an important indicator of drug abuse
potential.

In addition, the results of previous studies assessing the subjective effects and likelihood for
abuse and diversion of dronabinol have differed according to the study setting. Several
laboratory studies have shown that the subjective effects of smoked marijuana and oral
cannabinoids are highly similar in subjects who are regular users of marijuana and do not
have a diagnosis of chronic pain[15–19]. And yet, Phase IV drug surveillance observational
clinical studies done primarily in patients with cancer or HIV/AIDS have reported a low
abuse potential of such medications. Moreover, a review by Calhoun et al.[20] found no
evidence of abuse or diversion for dronabinol. The authors noted that marijuana users do not
value the psychoactive effects of dronabinol because of its slow and gradual onset of action,
weak reinforcing effect and dysphoric feeling. Similar conclusions were also reached with
other cannabinoid medications, such as nabilone and nabiximols, with cases of abuse or
diversion being rare and only occurring in a very small proportion of recipients[21,22]. It is
important to recognize the distinct differences between these laboratory and clinical data
since they should be interpreted independently. Our study bridges these gaps to some extent.
The present study focuses on the subjective effects of dronabinol in a laboratory-based,
randomized, double blinded, multiple dose, crossover trial in a specific patient population
with pain, i.e. patients with non-cancer pain taking prescription opioids. Our results
demonstrate that the subjective effects of dronabinol in a laboratory setting are comparable
to smoking marijuana, which potentially applies to other oral cannabinoid medications as
well in this environment. These laboratory findings may or may not translate clinically to an
increased likelihood of dronabinol abuse and/or diversion in this vulnerable patient
population (which requires further study).


Aside from these considerations, a special aspect in the case of prescribing cannabinoids for
chronic pain is the expectation of long-term use and the possible combination with opioid
therapy which may very well increase the abuse liability of both drugs due to their
potentially additive addictive properties. In addition, evidence from the National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) suggests that the use of marijuana, especially at a young
age, can potentially lead to the future use of other illicit substances[23]. In our study, although
subjects were carefully screened prior to enrollment, THC was found in 4 of the serum
samples of chronic pain subjects prior to receiving placebo, which suggests possible illicit
use of marijuana by some subjects. Therefore, since substance use disorders are already
highly prevalent in the chronic pain population[24–26], potential candidates for cannabinoid
therapy should be closely selected, educated about, and monitored[27,28].

Another important finding in the study was the insignificant relationship between the level
of total reported pain relief (TOTPAR) and ARCI subscale scores. This indicates that the
psychoactive properties of dronabinol are independent of its synergistic analgesic effects

with opioids (reported previously)[10]. It was believed from early studies that THC could only
produce analgesia at doses that were high enough to cause other behavioral side effects.
Noyes et al. compared single doses of placebo and 5,10,15 and 20 mg of THC in ten cancer
pain subjects and found significant analgesia with the higher doses, but at the expense of
significant sedation and mental clouding[29]. The first evidence that the antinociceptive
effects of THC could be separated from its adverse behavioral effects was presented in 1994,
when Smith and colleagues demonstrated that a kappa opioid receptor antagonist, norbinaltorphimine (norBNI), blocked only the antinociceptive effect of THC in rodents
without altering other pharmacological or behavioral effects[30]. Our study in humans
illustrates this phenomenon of separate analgesic and psychoactive properties of
cannabinoids in a clinical pain patient population. One could argue that the psychoactive
effects of dronabinol were amplified by concomitant oral opioid usage in our pain cohort;
however, baseline assessment of the study subjects did not reveal any patient reports of
significant sedation, confusion, impairment, or other cognitive effects of opioids.
Nevertheless, this is a potential confounder to generalizing that dronabinol has significant
psychoactive effects comparable to smoking marijuana.

There are a number of additional limitations worth mentioning in the design of this study.
First, the number of subjects in each group was limited, and the dronabinol cohort consisted
of a heterogeneous sample on various doses of opioids. Although this may reflect a typical
clinical pain population, future studies with less variability in opioid type and dosage and
longer follow-up period are needed. Second, the comparison information was collected
historically from a previous study that utilized the same primary outcome measure, and thus,
between-study variations may have affected our findings. As noted in the methods, we
recognize the statistical limitations in directly comparing the dronabinol and smoked
marijuana groups. But these comparisons are still useful qualitatively to illustrate that the
psychoactive effects of dronabinol are clinically meaningful. We cannot conclude that the
effects of dronabinol and smoked cannabis are equivalent. In addition, only one measure
(namely, the ARCI) was used to compare the acute dose-effects of oral dronabinol with
smoked marijuana which is not sufficient to give definitive data on a drug’s abuse potential.
Thus, additional data from physiological, psychomotor and cognitive measures should be
collected in future studies to better understand the psychoactive effects and abuse liability of
oral dronabinol. Also, urine drug testing was not performed prior to testing in the dronabinol
group. We only assessed possible concurrent drug use with self-report which is a possible
confounder to our results. Finally, we did not have an additional comparison group of
chronic pain patients who were not taking opioids for pain, as opioids may share several of
the subjective and psychoactive effects noted with cannabinoids[31].


Despite these limitations, the results of this preliminary study suggest that in chronic pain
patients on opioid therapy, dronabinol has similar psychoactive effects to smoking
marijuana. This warrants further large-scale observational studies to assess a potential abuse
and/or diversion risk. The subjective psychoactive effects of cannabinoids should be
considered in any decision to prescribe these medications for chronic non-cancer pain.
Moreover, our findings have implications for the analgesic development of all medicinal
cannabinoids, and indicate that these safety issues should be carefully scrutinized in drug

development. We were also able to determine that the psychoactive effects of dronabinol are
distinct from their analgesic effects.
