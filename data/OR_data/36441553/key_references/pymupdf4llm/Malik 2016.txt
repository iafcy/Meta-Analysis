SUMMARY. Noncardiac chest pain is associated with poor quality of life and high care expenditure. The majority of noncardiac chest pain is either gastresophageal reflux disease related or due to esophageal motility disorders, and the rest are considered functional chest pain (FCP) due to central and peripheral hypersensitivity.
Current treatment of FCP improves 40–50% of patients. Cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2) modulate
release of neurotransmitters; CB1 is located in the esophageal epithelium and reduces excitatory enteric transmission and potentially could reduce esophageal hypersensitivity. We performed a prospective study to evaluate its
effects on pain threshold, frequency, and intensity in FCP. Subjects with FCP received dronabinol (5 mg, twice
daily; n 5 7; average age, 44 years; mean body mass index, 26.7) or placebo (n 5 6; average age, 42 years; mean
body mass index, 25.9) for 28 days (4 weeks). Chest pain, general health, and anxiety/depression questionnaires
were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Subjects underwent an esophageal balloon distention test prior to treatment and on last day of the study. Dronabinol increased pain thresholds significantly (3.0 vs. 1.0; P 5 0.03) and
reduced pain intensity and odynophagia compared to placebo (0.18 vs. 0.01 and 0.12 vs. 0.01, respectively,
P 5 0.04). Depression and anxiety scores did not differ between the groups at baseline or after treatment. No
significant adverse effects were observed. In this novel study, dronabinol increased pain threshold and reduced
frequency and intensity of pain in FCP. Further, large scale studies are needed to substantiate these findings.

KEY WORDS: cannabinoid receptors, dronabinol, functional chest pain.


INTRODUCTION

Noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) is recurring angina-like
substernal chest pain of noncardiac origin. The prevalence varies from 20 to 40%, with an estimated incidence of 200,000 new cases annually.[1,2] Approximately

60% of NCCP are gastresophageal reflux disease
(GERD) related and the rest are nonGERD related due
to esophageal motility disorders and hypersensitivity.[3]

Rome III criteria for functional chest pain (FCP) include:
burning retrosternal discomfort or pain, absence of
GERD, and histopathology-based esophageal
motility disorders for the past 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis.[4]

Several hypersensitivity mechanisms include enhanced
cerebral processing of visceral sensory input, abnormal
mechano-physical properties, sustained longitudinal
muscle contractions, altered autonomic activity, psychological abnormalities, and increased mucosal mast cells.[5]

Treatment of functional NCCP has focused on relieving visceral hypersensitivity through pain modulators,
such as tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRI�s).[6–9] In our clinic, the main
TCA�s used were Imipramine, and main SSRI�s Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI's) were
Sertraline, and venlafaxine. In addition, theophylline
inhibits adenosine-induced angina-like chest pain


-----

and adenosine-induced pain in other regions of the
body, and increases pain thresholds in patients
with FCP.[10] Our clinical experience with theophylline showed 70% immediate results that diminish
with time in over 50% of patients. Currently, only
40–50% of patients respond to all treatment modalities and there is a large unmet therapeutic need.
The marijuana plant Cannabis sativa is one of the
most commonly used illicit drugs today with over 16
million users in the United States.[11] The plant contains
at least 80 different diverse chemical compounds that
act on cannabinoid receptors located on cells that
repress neurotransmitter release in the brain. Cannabinoid receptors are present throughout the GI tract,
including in the esophagus, liver, pancreas, stomach,
and the small and large intestines.[12–15] The Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and Cannabinoid receptor 2
(CB2) are found on macrophages, plasma cells, enteric
neurons, nerve fibers, and terminals throughout the
enteric nervous system.[14–19] CB1 is also present on epithelial cells including in the esophagus and expressed
mainly in the central and peripheral nervous system
while CB2 are present on immune cells.[13–15,18,20] Activation of CB1 inhibits peristaltic reflex, slows down
gastrointestinal and colonic transit and may play a role
in symptom improvement in the GI tract.[21]

Visceral pain is a diffuse type of pain, which is often
difficult to localize and usually accompanied by referred
pain. It results from activation of nociceptors located in
the thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic viscera. Cannabinoid
receptor agonists inhibit gastric emptying and intestinal
motility.[19] CB1 is present in sites of neuronal circuitry
involved in the transmission of visceral pain, which suggests that it plays a role in the control of GI perception.[22]

Experimental data indicate a visceral antinociceptive
action of cannabinoid receptor agonists.[23]

Several rat model studies have shown the relevance
of CB1 and CB2 agonists in the modulation of pain
and hypersensitivity.[15,24–26] Few clinical studies have
been done in humans to evaluate the role of cannabinoids in visceral pain.
The delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-THC) Dronabinol is a synthetic cannabinoid agonist of both CB1
and CB2, and currently marketed as an appetite stimulant and antiemetic. Use of cannabinoids has been limited due to its side effects. However, most of these side
effects are seen with the higher doses of the drug
(>40 mg/day).[27–32]

Thus far, the effect of dronabinol on esophageal sensation has not been described. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the effects of dronabinol on pain threshold, frequency, and intensity in patients diagnosedwith NCCP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients with unexplained NCCP referred to our tertiary care center were recruited to the study. Subjects


were included if they fulfilled diagnostic criteria for
FCP of presumed esophageal origin according to
Rome III. All patients underwent cardiac evaluation
that excluded a cardiac source for chest pain, and in
many instances, after various empirical therapies
including PPI�s, TCA, and SSRI had proved to be ineffective for at least 3 months. Patients aged 18–75 years
were included if they fulfilled diagnostic criteria of at
least two weekly episodes of chest pain for the last 3
months, a normal cardiac evaluation (Stress
test 6 normal coronary angiogram), normal chest Xray, upper GI endoscopy with normal esophageal
biopsies, high resolution esophageal manometry, and a
normal 24-hour pH impedance study (% fraction time
of pH < 4.0 was <4.5). All patients had to have evidence of esophageal hypersensitivity with an abnormal
esophageal balloon distention test (EBDT). Patients
were excluded if they had: (i) history of requiring narcotics, other pain medications; (ii) substance abuse;
(iii) Barrett�s esophagus or peptic stricture; and (iv) significant physical or psychiatric comorbidity. All
patients signed a written informed consent approved
by the University of Iowa Human Subjects Institutional Review Board. All authors had access to the
study data and reviewed and approved the final
manuscript.
A total of 19 patients with FCP and esophageal
hypersensitivity, as demonstrated by EBDT (described
below), were invited to enroll. The study consisted of a
baseline screening period, and a 4-week treatment
period. During the baseline period, all patients were
asked to maintain a daily chest pain diary for 2 weeks,
in which they recorded the number of chest pain episodes, its severity (4-point Likert-like scale: 0 5 absent,
1 5 mild, 2 5 moderate, and 3 5 severe), and duration
(minutes). On day 1, prior to randomization, patients
completed Short Form-36 (SF-36), and Beck anxiety
and depression inventories. Placebo capsules were
matched accordingly to resemble dronabinol capsules.
Subsequently, patients were randomized by the providing pharmacist based on 1:1 ratio to receive oral capsules of 5 mg dronabinol or placebo twice daily (Bid) for
4 weeks. Patients were contacted every 3 days by the
research coordinators (ART, JAV) that verified medication compliance. In addition, patients were seen on
day 14 in our clinic to return their empty bottle, get a
refill and complete the Beck anxiety and depression
inventories.
At day 28, patients underwent an EBDT, and
completed questionnaires: (i) chest pain symptom
questionnaire; (ii) Short Form-36 (SF-36); and
(iii) Beck anxiety and depression inventories.33–36

Esophageal balloon distention test—Impedance
planimetry

EBDT is a validated technique for examining sensory
and biomechanical properties of the esophagus.[34,37]


-----

The sensing system comprises of a flexible plastic
probe, 6 mm in diameter, with four ring electrodes and
a 4.5-cm long latex balloon that is attached to a leveling container. By raising or lowering the height of the
leveling container, a dilute electrolyte solution (0.018%
NaCl) is infused into the balloon to achieve its inflation or deflation. The probe also contains three water
perfusion side holes for measuring intraluminal pressures. All subjects came for the study after an overnight
fast. Oropharyngeal anesthesia was achieved with a
local spray of tetracaine (pontocaine[V]R, Hospira, Lake
Forest, IL). The lubricated probe was passed through
the mouth until the tip was located 55 cm from the
teeth. The subject was asked to lie supine on a bed that
is tilted, so that the head side was raised by 308. The
catheter was gradually withdrawn until the balloon lay
across 10 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter and
was adhered to that position. All measurements were
performed at this level. After a rest period of 10
minutes, the balloon pressure was zeroed to the resting
esophageal pressure. Next, by raising the leveling container in steps of 5 cm H2O, the balloon pressure was
increased up to 65 cm H2O or maximum tolerable
pressure. After a 3-minute rest period, each inflation
was maintained for 3–5 minutes and subjects scored
their sensory responses on a Likert scale: 0 5 no sensation, 1 5 first sensation of fullness or distension,
2 5 mild discomfort (tolerable), 3 5 pain, 4 5 severe
pain.[38,39] Baseline normal values were based on the
classical previous studies.[34,39] All EBDT�s were performed by a physician (SH) who was blinded to patient
treatment.

Beck anxiety and depression inventories

The Beck Anxiety Inventory is a validated form of
measuring anxiety separately from depression by
assessing 21 somatic, affective, and cognitive symptoms that are associated with anxiety but not with
depression. These symptoms are organized in a checklist and are given a rating, from 0 to 4, that corresponds with the amount the symptom bothered the
patient. The sum of all the ratings is then calculated to
find the class of anxiety. A score of 0–21 designates
very low anxiety, 22–35 moderate anxiety, and a score
greater than 36 indicates a potential cause for concern.
The Beck Depression Inventory is a validated form
of measuring depression through the evaluation of 21
declarative statements linked to the indices of depression. The statements are numbered, with higher values
representing a closer link to disturbances in mood
related to depression. The sum of the values is calculated and then categorized as follows: 1–10 is consistent with normal ups and downs, 11–16 signifies mild
mood disturbance, 17–20 borderline clinical depression, 21–30 moderate depression, 31–40 severe depression, and a score of over 40 indicates extreme
depression.[35,36]


Chest pain symptom questionnaire

This validated questionnaire evaluates frequency of
chest pain episodes, duration (1–3), intensity (1–3),
and painful swallowing (1–3). It measures the overall
changes in intensity and duration of the chest pain,
abdominal pain, heartburn, and nausea through the
study period.

Short Form-36 (SF-36)

A general health-related quality of life questionnaire
that examines eight domains: Physical Functioning,
Role Functioning Physical, Role Functioning Emotional, Mental Health, Vitality, Bodily Pain, General
Health, and Social Functioning.

Statistics

Based on a previous study of theophylline for NCCP,
we assumed a potential dropout rate of 20% and
needed to enroll a total of 18 subjects for our study.[10]

A sample size of n 5 7 subjects per arm was used for
this study. With this sample size, the comparison of
Poisson rates for frequency of chest pain episodes was
able to detect at the 0.05 significance level least a 35%
reduction with dronabinol relative to control with 0.85
power. The data for age and biomechanical properties
are expressed as mean 6 SD. Esophageal sensory perception data are expressed as median. The differences
in sensory data before and after dronabinol or placebo,
and within groups, were analyzed and compared using
the paired Student�s t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and
Wilcoxon signed-rank test when appropriate. The data
for the mean number of days with chest pain and the
number of chest pain episodes were compared between
the two phases, dronabinol and placebo, using a negative binomial regression analysis. The Somer�s D(R|C)
Daily Trent Tests was used to analyze the daily chest
pain score questionairres.[40]

RESULTS

Nineteen patients were enrolled in the study, and thirteen completed (11 female, 2 males mean age 43 years,
range 29–63) (Table 1). Baseline BAI, BDI, daily chest
pain scores, and SF 36 scores are described with no significant difference between placebo and dronabinol
groups noted (Table 1). Ten patients received dronabinol 5 mg BID and nine received placebo BID (Fig. 1).
Pain intensity and odynophagia frequency were significantly decreased after 28 days of dronabinol treatment (P 5 0.04) with a tendency for decreased
frequency of chest pain episodes (P 5 0.06) (Table 2).
On EBDT, patients treated with dronabinol showed
a significantly lower pain perception at inflation levels
of 15 and 20 CM/H2O compared to baseline (1 vs. 3,
1.8 vs. 3, P 5 0.03, 0.05, respectively) (Fig. 2) and compared to placebo (1 vs. 2.5, P 5 0.04). In addition,

patients in the dronabinol group from baseline to posttreatment (5–9.28, P 5 0.09) but this was not seen in
the placebo group (5–2.5, P 5 0.27). No significant difference was seen when assessing maximum pain tolerance when comparing pretreatment to post-treatment
in either group.
No significant differences were noted in the BAI, or
the BDI when comparing pretreatment and posttreatment in either group as well as between the two
groups. In addition, no significant difference on any of
the eight domains was seen on the general quality of life
questionnaire (SF 36) (Table 2). Pain intensity and odynophagia frequency were significantly decreased after
28 days of treatment (P 5 0.04) with a tendency for
decreased frequency of chest pain episodes (P 5 0.06)
(Table 3). Three patients in each group dropped out of
the study due to noncompliance, and other issues. No
major adverse events were reported, and minor adverse
events were noted in both groups. None withdrew due
to side effects of the drug. Two patients in the dronabinol group noted transient headache, fatigue, and one
noted transient loose stools. In addition, two patients
in the placebo group reported transient nausea and
loose stools. All symptoms resolved while on treatment
and did not necessitate stopping medication.

DISCUSSION

Our study demonstrated that dronabinol decreased
pain perception in patients with NCCP at different
sequential balloon inflations. In addition, patients
treated with dronabinol had an improvement in pain
intensity and odynophagia frequency, as well as a trend
toward improvement in chest pain episodes. However,
there was no significant change in symptoms such as
nausea and vomiting, regurgitation, or quality of life
during the study period.
As CB1 receptors are also present on epithelial cells
including esophagus, these findings are in direct corroboration with experimental data indicating avisceral
antinociceptive action of cannabinoid receptor agonists.[23] In addition, CB1 receptors have been located in
brain areas involved in the triggering of TLESRs as
well as in the nodose ganglion from which vagal afferents emanate.[41]

Beaumont et al. reported that 10 and 20 mg of D9THC given to healthy volunteers on three occasions a
week apart, significantly reduced the number of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations with a
nonsignificant reduction of acid reflux episodes in the
first postprandial hour and normalization after 3
hours.[42] In addition, Basal LES pressure decreased
after 45 minutes and normalized after 100 minutes.[42]

The authors hypothesized that the fading effect could


be due to insufficient serum levels of D9-THC in the
second and third postprandial hours. Significant side
effects were observed with 20 mg dosage.[42] While our
study did not focus on the effect of dronabinol on
esophageal motility, we think it is important to
acknowledge the current trend in the literature.
Thus far, there are no other studies evaluating the
effect of D9-THC on esophageal motility and impedance planimetry. The aforementioned study was a conceptual single dose given on three occasions a week
apart.[42] In our 28 continuous day study, both groups
did not report any significant change in symptoms
such as nausea and vomiting or regurgitation during
or after the study. It is our assumption that dronabinol
did not affect esophageal motility. However, further
studies are clearly required.
There is limited and conflicting data regarding the
effects of the cannabinoid on GI motility in healthy
human subjects. McCallum et al. showed that D9THC (10 mg) administered 1 hour before a meal,
delayed gastric emptying of a radiolabeled solid meal
in nine male and four female healthy subjects, who
were experienced cannabis users.[43]

In contrast, Bateman found that gastric emptying of
liquid, measured by real time ultrasound, was unaffected by D9-THC (0.5 and 1 mg i.v.) in seven fasted
cannabis-naive male volunteers.[44]

Esfandyari et al. reported an overall retardation of
gastric emptying with dronabinol that was more

pronounced in females than in males with an increase
in fasting gastric volumes among the later. No significant treatment differences were detected for gastric volumes, small bowel, and colonic transit.[45]

Klooker et al. examined the effects of dronabinol at
doses of 5 and 10 mg compared to placebo on rectal
sensitivity in 10 IBS patients and 12 healthy volunteers,
and did not find altered rectal perception to distension
compared to placebo. In addition, dronabinol
increased awareness of the surrounding, lightheadedness and sleepiness with the highest dose of
10 mg, whereas no side effects where reported on placebo. The authors concluded that although D9-THC
was not beneficial for the treatment of visceral rectal
perception, the results might be hampered due to the
higher anxiety levels (heart rate) in the dronabinol
group compared to placebo group.[46]

In another study, a single dose of dronabinol (2.5
and 5 mg) decreased fasting colonic motility and
increased colonic compliance compared to placebo
selectively in patients with IBS-D or IBS-A. The single
dose (2.5 and 5 mg) did not affect colorectal distention
pain scores, nor cause significant central effects.[42]

Esfandyari et al. demonstrated that a single dose of
dronabinol 7.5 mg relaxes the colon and reduces postprandial colonic motility and tone. The authors concluded that increase in sensation ratings to distension
in the presence of relaxation of the colon suggests central modulation of perception.[47] However, it had no
effect on intestinal or colonic transit, and the authors
hypothesized that this is possibly due to rapid
metabolism.
Cannabinoids are distributed throughout the body
and are highly lipid-soluble and accumulate in fatty tissue. The release of cannabinoids from fatty tissue is
responsible for the prolonged terminal elimination
half-life of up to 36 hours.[48] Hence, the effect of the
dronabinol may have been different in the previous
studies if given for a longer period of time, as was done
in our study. Undoubtedly, this area needs to be further explored in large scale studies.
Dronabinol decreased odynophagia frequency in
our cohort. Habitual rapid food intake that may lead
to ineffective esophageal motility disorder has been
implicated as a cause of odynophagia.[49] Interestingly,
our cohort did not demonstrate ineffective peristalsis,
nor report any habitual change during the study.


Based on symptom diary analysis, dronabinol significantly shortened the duration of pain as well as induce
a trend toward a decrease in the pain frequency. However, no significant effect on quality of life was
observed. We believe that the duration of the study (28
days) was insufficient to evaluate a substantial effect
on quality of life, and based on safety data of previous
studies that reported significant side effects with dosage of �20 mg, we decided to limit our daily dosage to
10 mg/day.[42]

Previous epidemiological studies have found that the
life time probability of developing cannabis dependence was 8% for those on a daily use.[50] Although our
study protocol was 5 mg twice a day, it is our belief
that due to the biphasic half-life elimination it would
be feasible to initiate a twice to three times a week protocol that will decrease the addiction potential of the
drug and we are currently evaluating a triweekly (three
times aweek) protocol.
We believe that the safety demonstrated with 10 mg
D9-THC daily should encourage further exploring this
treatment.
Our study is not without limitations. Due to our strict
inclusion criteria, our cohort was small, in addition to
the fact that the PI relocated to another institute. However, due to the statistical significance seen in this small
cohort, we believe that the study would serve as a basic
reference for future large scale studies (as we are doing
now). It is our belief that due to under power type II statistical error, only a tendency for decreased frequency of
chest pain episodes (P 5 0.06) (Table 3) was seen, and
the frequency would be significantly lower in a larger
study cohort. In addition, due to the novelty of this
treatment for nonGERD related NCCP, we did not
compare dronabinol to any of the current treatments,
and believe that such future studies are warranted.
In summary, our pilot study demonstrates that dronabinol improves initial esophageal pain sensation,
esophageal pain sensation, improves odynophagia frequency, and decreases intensity of chest pain episodes
in non-GERD related NCCP. In addition, there is also
a trend toward decreasing frequency of chest pain episodes. Thus far, it is unclear which subtype of NCCP
will benefit the most form dronabinol. It is postulated
that D9-THC will be effective among all types of
NCCP with decreased pain threshold including
GERD, and in particular PPI resistant GERD

symptoms that are likely due to proximal reflux in a
hypersensitive esophagus.
We think it should be evaluated as an additional therapy to the current GERD treatment armamentarium.
Additional large scale studies are needed to further
classify its role in the treatment of NCCP and to evaluate its side effects when compared to marijuana.
