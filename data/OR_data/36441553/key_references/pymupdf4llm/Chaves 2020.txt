Abstract

Objective. To determine the benefit of a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-rich cannabis oil on symptoms and quality of life
of fibromyalgia patients. Methods. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted for
eight weeks to determine the benefit of a THC-rich cannabis oil (24.44 mg/mL of THC and 0.51 mg/mL of cannabidiol

[CBD]) on symptoms and quality of life of 17 women with fibromyalgia, residents of a neighborhood with a low socioeconomic profile and a high incidence of violence in the city of Florianopolis, Brazil. The initial dose was one drop
(�1.22 mg of THC and 0.02 mg of CBD) a day with subsequent increases according to symptoms. The Fibromyalgia
Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was applied at pre- and postintervention moments and in five visits over eight weeks.
Results. There were no significant differences on baseline FIQ score between groups. However, after the intervention,
the cannabis group presented a significant decrease in FIQ score in comparison with the placebo group (P ¼ 0.005) and
in comparison with cannabis group baseline score. (P < 0.001). Analyzing isolated items on the FIQ, the cannabis group
presented significant improvement on the “feel good,” “pain,” “do work,” and “fatigue” scores. The placebo group
presented significant improvement on the “depression” score after intervention. There were no intolerable adverse
effects. Conclusions. Phytocannabinoids can be a low-cost and well-tolerated therapy to reduce symptoms and increase
the quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia. Future studies are still needed to assess long-term benefits, and studies
with different varieties of cannabinoids associated with a washout period must be done to enhance our knowledge of
cannabis action in this health condition.

### Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is one of the most common chronic pain
syndromes, characterized by musculoskeletal pain, extreme
fatigue, and sleep and/or mood disorders. It may have a
great physical and psychological impact on patients’ lives,
preventing work and daily activities. The pathophysiology is
mostly unknown, and FM’s etiology involves environmental
and genetic factors [1]. The disease affects more women


than men, and the Brazilian Rheumatology Association calculates its prevalence in the Brazilian population at about
3%, mostly in women between 30 and 55years old [2].
Treatment of the condition is based on symptom relief; nevertheless, modest results are obtained with current medications; however, the adverse effects of drugs
often hinder patient adherence. In general, poor wellbeing and quality of life are common [3].

The cannabis plant has been used in pain treatment
for centuries; in the last decades, however, its use has
been withdrawn from traditional medicine due to legal
prohibitions [4]. Scientific studies on the plant’s therapeutic effects have been produced over the last 50 years,
and in 2017 the National Academy of Science,
Engineering and Medicine concluded, after article
reviews, that cannabis use for pain treatment is supported by well-controlled clinical trials, with substantial
evidence of its effects in the treatment of chronic pain in
adults [5]. Presently, many countries have been reformulating their laws recognizing the medicinal character of
this plant.
Cannabis flowers contain over 100 types of phytocannabinoids, chemical compounds that interact with the
cannabinoid receptors present in our bodies. The most
prevalent and better known are tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is found in greater
quantity in drug-type cannabis chemovars and is responsible for its popular psychoactive effects: euphoria, lightheadedness, and coordination and recent memory
impairment. Beneficial effects are seen on pain control,
nausea, anxiety, insomnia, anorexia, and spasticity. CBD
presents anti-epileptic, analgesic, anxiolytic, and sedative
effects with fewer psychoactive effects. Both phytocannabinoids have anti-inflammatory effects, which seems to
be greater when both THC and CBD act together [6].
There are two well-characterized endocannabinoid
receptors on animals: CB1 and CB2; CB1 is mostly found
in the central nervous system, while CB2 is found in
many tissues and organs, especially those with immunerelated activities [3]. There is also growing evidence that
support the existence of additional receptors for cannabinoids (non-CB1/CB2). This set of receptors, along with
endocannabinoid substances (2-arachidonoylglycerol and
anandamide) and the associated biochemical apparatus,
composes the endocannabinoid system [4]. This system
has multiple functions that keep balance in our bodies,
including pain and stress modulation, suggesting that its
manipulation may be a potential therapeutic focus in FM
care.
Considering the far-reaching damage caused by FM
and the effect it can have on individuals, their families,
communities, and the public health system, it seems necessary to study alternative, low-cost, and well-tolerated
therapies that help patients to regain their well-being and
quality of life. The present study aims to evaluate the impact that cannabis oil—a THC-rich whole plant extract—
can have on symptoms and quality of life of individuals
afflicted by FM.

### Methods

Study Design
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial performed with patients of a community Health


Center in Florianopolis, Brazil. Data were collected from
September to November of 2019.

Participants
Users of Monte Cristo Health Center with fibromyalgia
or chronic spread pain were recruited by family health
teams to participate. Twenty people attended a preevaluation meeting with the researcher and signed a written informed consent form that enabled access to their
medical records. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia was confirmed at this meeting using American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) 2010 criteria [7, 8]. Inclusion criteria were FM diagnosis (ACR 2010 criteria), age over
18 years, presence of moderate to severe symptoms (presenting functional limitation in everyday activities) despite therapies in use, at least one medical or nursing
consultation at the Health Center in the last year.
Exclusion criteria were decompensated organic comorbidities and/or risk of psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia, psychosis, severe personality disorder, current
suicidal ideation), another well-defined cause of chronic
pain, current pregnancy/lactation, moderate or severe
cognitive impairment, and history of cannabinoid
sensitivity.

Randomization and Masking
Participants were randomly assigned through a computer
randomization program to two groups, cannabis or placebo, with the help of an external collaborator. This
same person was not involved in the rest of the trial and
kept allocation information in sealed opaque envelopes
until the end of the intervention. The cannabis group received a 30-mL green glass dropper bottle containing
cannabis oil (olive oil extraction) of the White Widow [9]
variety, at a 24.44-mg/mL concentration of THC and
0.51 mg/mL of CBD—at a proportion of �48/1 THC/
CBD, among small quantities of other cannabinoids such
as cannabigerol, tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabinol, and
cannabicromen. The material was not analyzed for terpenoid profile, although the chosen variety of cannabis is recognized for its terpenoids: myrcene, caryophyllene, and
pinene [9]. The product—not standardized—was provided
in partnership with the Brazilian Association of Medical
Cannabis Patients (AMAþME). The placebo group received an identical bottle with olive oil inside. Edible
brown dye was used to soften differences between liquids.
Participants were informed about the possibility of being
placed into the placebo group. They were evaluated during
the study with prescheduled individual appointments to reduce information exchange at the Monte Cristo Health
Center. The main researcher made all the evaluations while
blinded. Data analysis was conducted after the end of the
intervention


-----

Procedures and Outcome
The initial dose in both groups was one drop (�1.2 mg of
THC and 0.02 mg of CBD) a day sublingually.
Participants in both groups were seen at baseline and every 10 days for eight weeks, and dose increases respected
the maximum of one drop for each evaluation moment.
At each visit, patients filled out the Fibromyalgia Impact
Questionnaire (FIQ), a validated self-administered test
that evaluates physical function, work status, well-being,
and associated physical and mental symptoms in FM
patients [10]. The FIQ is composed of 10 items
(“physical function,” “feel good,” “work missed,” “job
ability,” “pain,” “fatigue,” “morning tiredness,”
“stiffness,” “anxiety,” and “depression”), each with a
maximum possible score of 10. Total scores range from 0
to 100, and higher scores mean greater impact on a
patient’s quality of life [11]. Clinical and adverse effects
were also assessed during each visit to determine change
or maintenance of therapy dosage.

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean and SD. Analysis of repeated
measures was elected to compare mean values in the
questionnaire on five visits during the intervention,
excluding pre- and postintervention measures. The
Mauchly test was used to verify the sphericity of the data
(P ¼ 0.593 for the cannabis group and P ¼ 0.439 for the
placebo group). Comparison of mean values between
groups pre-intervention was verified using the MannWhitney test. The Wilcoxon rank test was chosen to

verify differences in mean values pre- and postintervention for each group separately. Data were analyzed using
IBM SPSS, version 20.0, with P values <0.05 considered
significant.

### Results

Twenty people attended the first meeting after family
health team recruitment on September 27, 2019. One
person did not meet criteria for fibromyalgia diagnosis,
and another was excluded due to psychiatric risk.
Eighteen people were found to be eligible for participation. Two days after the pre-intervention meeting, one
participant from the cannabis group dropped out, reporting inability to attend most intervention evaluations.
Seventeen participants finished the study (eight in the
cannabis group and nine in the placebo group), which occurred between September 27 and November 25 of 2019
(Figure 1).
The mean age was 51.9 years, and all participants
were women (100%) residents of a neighborhood with a
low socioeconomic profile and a high incidence of violence in the city of Florianopolis, Brazil. Participants in
the cannabis group had previously used antidepressants
(62.5%), opioids (25%), and benzodiazepines (12.5%).
In the placebo group, the rates of the same class of medications use were 67%, 33%, and 11%, respectively.
Patients self-medicated with mild analgesics and antiinflammatory pills whenever necessary in both groups.


-----

Participants started intervention with one drop a day
(�1.2 mg of THC and 0.02 mg of CBD), and doses could
be increased throughout evaluations, which occurred every 10 days. The mean dose at postintervention evaluation was 3.6 drops of cannabis oil (�4.4 mg of THC and
0.08 mg of CBD) in the cannabis group and 4.3 drops of
olive oil in the placebo group. The effects reported by the
cannabis group were somnolence (87.5%), dizziness
(25%), mouth dryness (25%), improved mood (25%),
and improved libido (12.5%). One participant (11%) in
the placebo group related somnolence during the
12 hours after product intake. Change in sleep pattern
was considered a positive effect in the cannabis group,
given that most participants suffered from insomnia or
nonrestorative sleep. There was no follow-up loss by unpleasant adverse effects.
Pre-intervention, there were no significant differences
between groups on FIQ mean scores. However, after
eight weeks, the cannabis group presented a statistically

Pre-intervention


lower total score on the FIQ compared with the placebo
group (P ¼ 0.005). Analyzing isolated items of the FIQ, it
was observed during the pre-intervention evaluation that
there was a difference between groups only on the
“physical impairment” item, with greater values in the
cannabis group (greater impairment). After intervention,
statistical differences were observed in mean values on
the “feel good,” “do work,” and “pain” items. These
results indicated lower values for the cannabis group in
comparison with the placebo group (Table 1).
Comparing pre- and postintervention FIQ mean scores in
each group, the cannabis group presented a statistically significant reduction, going from 75.5 to 30.5 points
(P < 0.001). At the same time, the placebo group maintained its score (P ¼ 0.07). Furthermore, in an isolated analysis of FIQ items, the cannabis group presented a reduction
in mean values on the “feel good,” “pain,” and “fatigue”
items. The placebo group presented a reduction in mean values on the “depression” item (Table 2).

(Table 3).

### Discussion

In the present study, we investigated the impact of a
THC-rich cannabis oil on quality of life and symptoms of
people with fibromyalgia, residents of the same neighborhood in the city of Florianopolis, Brazil. After eight
weeks of trial, a statistically significant reduction in FIQ
score was observed in the cannabis group (P < 0.001).
The cannabis group also presented a statistically significant reduction in FIQ score compared with the placebo
group (P ¼ 0.005).
The baseline score on the FIQ in our study is considered high in comparison with other studies, indicating
greater impact on the quality of life of these women [12–
14]. We believe that the low socioeconomic level and
high incidence of violence in their community may have
potentialized this phenomenon. In this context, our findings suggest that phytocannabinoids are effective in treating people with FM, including those with severe
symptoms


The reduction in FIQ score in the cannabis group is
similar to findings from other studies with allopathic
therapy [12–17]. In the present study, however, we observed an extremely significant reduction on FIQ
(P < 0.001) with cannabis oil, while allopathic therapy
studies presented more modest reductions on FIQ and/or
greater incidence of intolerable adverse effects, leading to
considerable rates of participant dropout.
The oil used in this research was an integral extract of
cannabis with a higher content of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) than CBD (cannabidiol). This choice was based
on the fact that THC is one of the most studied phytocannabinoids, with therapeutic potential already demonstrated in chronic and oncologic pain treatment,
intractable pruritus, nausea, anorexia, and mood swings
related to chemotherapy. Additionally, German researchers evaluated the analgesic effects of THC administered
orally in nine patients with FM over a period of three
months, using daily doses of 2.5–15 mg of THC without
other analgesic medications. All participants who finished the study reported pain reduction, both in daily
symptom records and after experimentally induced pain
sessions [18]. A synthetic cannabinoid that mimics THC
(Nabilone) also demonstrated pain reduction and improvement in quality of life in people with FM in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 40
participants [17]. A recent experimental randomized
study with chronic pain patients demonstrated analgesic
efficacy of inhaled pharmaceutical-grade cannabis varieties containing THC in the evoked pressure pain model,
when compared to placebo [19].
The mean dose used in this study was 3.6 drops a day
(�4.4 mg of THC and 0.08 mg of CBD) in the cannabis
group, and adverse events were attenuated over time. We
suggest starting treatment with low doses of THC (�1
mg), with subsequent increases according to clinical response, in order to achieve good results with the lowest
dose required. Due to the short intervention time (eight
weeks), participants were not instructed to cease or reduce other medications used in FM treatment; there was,
though, spontaneous reduction of antidepressant (three
patients) and benzodiazepine medication (one patient) in
the cannabis group during intervention, a finding already
associated with cannabis use in the literature [1].
One main complaint of patients with FM is chronic
widespread pain, and some of them suffer from concomitant symptoms, such as fatigue, morning stiffness, mood,
and sleep disturbance [7]. During the intervention, the
impact of the intervention on quality of life in the cannabis group participants was evident, resulting in reports of
well-being and more energy for activities of daily living.
Pain attacks were also reduced, albeit subjectively, in frequency and intensity. These results were expected due
the therapeutic effects of cannabis already demonstrated
in other trials [3, 5, 18].
Our analysis of FIQ isolated items confirmed clinical
evidence Statistically significant improvements on the


-----

“feel good,” “do work,” and “pain” items in the cannabis group were found upon analysis between groups, and
an additional improvement on the “fatigue” item was
found in this same group compared with its baseline
value. Findings on pain reduction are already established

[1, 3, 5, 17, 18], although the main cause of this benefit
remains unclear, as cannabinoids act at many sites along
pain transmission pathways [17].
The significant improvement on the “feel good” item
in the cannabis group was extremely motivating to us,
considering that this item had the greatest score of the
FIQ items in both groups pre-intervention, and after intervention, it became the lowest score on FIQ items in
the cannabis group but maintained its value in the placebo group. Also, we can extrapolate the importance of
this subjective feeling of well-being according to the
World Health Organization definition of health: a state
of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and
not merely the absence of disease or infirmity [20].
Findings of improvement on the “fatigue” and “do
work” scores also support our belief in the potential of
cannabis to enhance quality of life in FM patients.
The reduction in “depression” score in the placebo
group after the intervention made us question the effectiveness of this scale to evaluate mood impairment (anxiety and depression), as these single items of the
questionnaire are not validated scales for respective
symptoms [17]. We believe that significant and rare insight into one’s personal psychological state is necessary
to assess these topics, so we also suggest that validated
scales are probably more suitable for the assessment of
psychological symptoms [17].
Finally, the significant difference in FIQ scores between visit 1 and visit 4 in the cannabis group led us to
question the time needed for cannabis therapy to demonstrate significant effects, considering that significant differences were maintained at the final evaluation
(postintervention). Although visit 5 did not demonstrate
a significant reduction in comparison with visit 1, we observed that the standard deviation at this fifth visit was
greater than others. The fluctuating character of FM
symptoms, with exacerbation periods, in addition to a
greater susceptibility in terms of environmental disturbances (remembering that the participants lived in a community with a high incidence of violence), may
contribute to this isolated fact.
We consider important to understand FM as a pain
syndrome with multiple etiologies (central sensitization,
altered stress response, pro-inflammatory state, abnormal activity of neurotransmitters, small-fiber peripheral
neuropathy, genetic predisposition), where cannabis can
act in different ways. Cannabinoids reduce pain and
other pathophysiological and physiological processes
through varied mechanisms involving its receptors in the
organisms. The endocannabinoid system consists of cannabinoid receptors (mostly known as CB1 and CB2), the
endocannabinoid substances and their biosynthetic and


catabolic enzymes. It is active in the central nervous system and in the peripheral nervous system, modulating
pain on the spinal, supraspinal, and peripheral levels;
endocannabinoids substances—anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol—are produced on demand in these systems to contain hyperalgesia, allodynia, and
inflammatory states. There is also good evidence that
cannabinoid receptors play a role in the modulation of
neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and
others [3, 18, 21, 22].
Some studies suggest that pathological conditions in
pain modulation such as fibromyalgia, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome, among others, may be, at least in
part, related to the deregulation of the endocannabinoid
system. In this context, manipulation of the endocannabinoid system, which is associated with the immunomodulatory effect of cannabinoids, strengthens the role of
these compounds as promising therapeutic agents [21,
23].
Despite the significant findings of this medical residency’s final work, there are limitations to acknowledge:
small sample size, short intervention period, participants
maintained other FM treatments, cannabis oil and the
placebo product did not have the same color (brown vs
light brown, respectively) and were not masked for taste
differences, and participants were individually evaluated
by the main researcher during all intervention periods—
although both were blinded.

### Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled
trial to demonstrate the benefit of cannabis oil—a THCrich whole plant extract—on symptoms and on quality of
life of people with fibromyalgia. We conclude that phytocannabinoids can be a low-cost and well-tolerated therapy for symptom relief and quality of life improvement
in these patients, and we suggest that this therapy could
be included as an herbal medicine option for the treatment of this condition in the Brazilian public health
system.
Larger and longer studies, accessing integral extracts
of cannabis with varied concentrations between phytocannabinoids and including a washout period, must be
done to enhance our knowledge about cannabis action in
fibromyalgia.
