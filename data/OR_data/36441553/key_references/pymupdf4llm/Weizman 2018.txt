## Abstract

Objective
To characterize the functional brain changes involved in δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
modulation of chronic neuropathic pain.

Methods
Fifteen patients with chronic radicular neuropathic pain participated in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial employing a counterbalanced, within-subjects design. Pain
assessments and functional resting state brain scans were performed at baseline and after
sublingual THC administration. We examined functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC) and pain-related network dynamics using graph theory measures.

Results
THC significantly reduced patients’ pain compared to placebo. THC-induced analgesia was
correlated with a reduction in functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) and the sensorimotor cortex. Moreover, the degree of reduction was predictive of the
response to THC. Graph theory analyses of local measures demonstrated reduction in network
connectivity in areas involved in pain processing, and specifically in the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC), which were correlated with individual pain reduction.

Conclusion
These results suggest that the ACC and DLPFC, 2 major cognitive-emotional modulation
areas, and their connections to somatosensory areas, are functionally involved in the analgesic
effect of THC in chronic pain. This effect may therefore be mediated through induction of
functional disconnection between regulatory high-order affective regions and the sensorimotor
cortex. Moreover, baseline functional connectivity between these brain areas may serve as
a predictor for the extent of pain relief induced by THC.

The possible therapeutic role of cannabis and of its main
psychoactive substance, δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is
a subject of intense interest in Western medicine. Currently,
the most prevalent medical use of cannabis is for the treatment of chronic pain.[1] Increasing evidence shows that cannabis may be safe and effective for refractory chronic pain.[2,3]

Nevertheless, the brain mechanism underlining this analgesic
effect remains unknown.

A recent functional neuroimaging study found that THC
reduced acute experimentally induced pain in healthy
participants, and its analgesic effect was correlated with
reduced activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).[4]

This result is compatible with the fact that the ACC has
been shown to be densely populated with cannabinoid-1
receptors,[5] which are agonistically activated by THC. Interestingly, cannabinoid receptors in the ACC were found
to have decreased binding capability in an animal model of
chronic neuropathic pain.[6] These findings suggest the ACC
may have a substantial contribution to cannabinoid analgesia in clinical pain states.

As the neural underpinnings of cannabis-induced analgesia in
chronic pain remain poorly understood, we assessed the effect
of a single dose of THC vs placebo on chronic pain by
evaluating subjective pain ratings and resting-state brain
connectivity of the ACC using fMRI. To that aim, we devised
a double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced withinsubjects study in patients with chronic neuropathic lower limb
radicular pain. We hypothesized that THC will have an analgesic effect on patients’ pain ratings and that this effect will
correlate with functional changes in the ACC.

## Methods

Patients
Seventeen patients with chronic lumbar radicular pain completed the study (27–40 years old; mean age 33.3 ± 3.9; all
male). Women were excluded due to evidence that
menstruation-related hormonal fluctuations may alter pain
sensitivity.[7] The inclusion criterion was established neuropathic lower limb radicular pain for over 6 months, with
medium to high chronic pain (over 40 on a 100-point visual
analog scale [VAS]) with no other known comorbidities.
Participants’ demographic and clinical data, as well as detailed
inclusion and exclusion criteria data, are available in table e-1

Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents
Seventeen participants gave written informed consent approved by the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center institutional
[review board (Clinical Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov/](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02560545)
[show/NCT02560545). Patients were recruited from The](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02560545)
Institute of Pain Medicine at Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical
Center. Two participants were excluded because on second
examination they did not fulfill the inclusion criteria.

Study procedure
Patients participated in a counterbalanced manner in 2
meetings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial. In each meeting, patients received THC oil or placebo oil
sublingually (0.2 mg/kg, average THC dosage = 15.4 ± 2.2
mg; Panaxia Pharmaceutical Industries, Lod, Israel). Randomization was done by a dedicated physician using a sealed
[envelope website (sealedenvelope.com/). Nine patients re-](https://www.sealedenvelope.com/)
ceived THC in the first meeting and placebo in the second
meeting, whereas 6 patients received the reverse treatment
order. The experimental design is depicted in figure 1.

In each session, patients underwent baseline clinical evaluation
composed of pain rating on a 0–100 VAS, anxiety questionnaire
(State-Trait Anxiety Inventory–State [STAI-S]), and heart rate
(HR) and blood pressure (BP) measurements (Nexfin
BMEYE, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Subsequently, patients
underwent an fMRI scan composed of a non-task resting state,
after which they received the treatment (THC/placebo). The
resting state scan lasted 6 minutes and patients were instructed
to keep their eyes closed, rest, and relax, but not to fall sleep.
One hour post drug administration, the same procedure was
repeated. The second fMRI scan was thus preformed about 2
hours post drug administration, in accordance with THC
sublingual absorption showing maximal plasma concentrations
usually after 2 to 3 hours.[8] The meetings were separated by at
least a week in order to enable a washout period of the possible
THC treatment (average weeks interval = 2.9 ± 3.3).

fMRI data acquisition
fMRI data were acquired with a 3T MRI scanner (Magnetom
Prisma, Siemens, Munich, Germany), with a 20-channel head
coil, located at the Wohl Institute for Advanced Imaging at the
Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Functional scans were perf d h - h d h l ( l

Data analysis

Behavioral and physiologic measurements
Statistical analyses for behavioral and physiologic evaluations
were performed using STATISTICA 10 (TIBCO Software
Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Within-subjects repeated measures
analysis of variance was employed to ascertain significant interaction and simple main effects between the treatment
(THC, placebo) and the state (pre, post) for VAS, STAI-S,
and cardiovascular measures (HR and BP). For each participant, in each treatment condition, pain reduction was determined as the delta between the VAS score postintervention
and the VAS score preintervention. These VAS subtraction
values were used in subsequent analyses as indication for
individual improvement in pain, that is, the more negative the
values, the higher the improvement in pain.

fMRI data analysis

Preprocessing and functional connectivity analysis
Functional analyses were performed using Statistical Para
( ) f (fil l k/ /


[software/spm12/) and the Functional Connectivity toolbox[9]](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/)

[(nitrc.org/projects/conn). Preprocessing included the fol-](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn)
lowing; first 18 seconds of the functional data were discarded
to allow steady-state magnetization. Functional images were
slice-time corrected, realigned to the middle scan, motioncorrected, and normalized according to standard Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Spatial smoothing was
performed using a 6-mm full width at half maximum Gaussian
kernel. In order to reduce noise, functional volumes were
bandpass filtered at 0.008–0.15 and component-based
method (CompCor) was used for noise signals such
as white matter, CSF, and movement artifact that were taken
as confounders. In addition, images that were regarded as
movement outliers were regressed out. Outliers were detected
[using the ART toolbox (nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/)](http://nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/)
and defined as volumes with a movement greater than 2 mm
or signal intensity changes greater than 9 SD.

Functional connectivity was performed using a seed-based analysis looking for temporal correlations of the resting-state blood
oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) signal time series between
theACCastheseedregionandtherestofthebrain.Theregionof
interest (ROI) was defined using the ACC peak coordinates from
an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of chronic
neuropathic pain.[10] The coordinates were converted from
Talairach space to MNI space using Lancaster Transform, and
a 3-mm radius sphere was generated (MNI coordinates 2, 30, 29).

For each participant, first-level correlation maps were produced
b h d l f h d d

time course and the time course of all other voxels. Correlation
coefficients were converted to normally distributed z scores
using the Fisher transformation to allow second-level general
linear model analyses.

To examine pain decrease–related changes in connectivity,
first-level connectivity maps for each participant, at each state
(pre, post), were entered into a whole-brain regression analysis with pain decrease as a covariate. The states were contrasted (post > pre) in order to examine the change in the
treatment state (post) compared to baseline state (pre). In
this analysis, reported clusters survived a height threshold of
uncorrected p < 0.001 and an extent threshold of false discovery rate (FDR)–corrected p < 0.05 at the cluster level.

Anatomical allocation of the connectivity maps was done in
reference to probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps using the
SPM Anatomy Toolbox.[11] Activations were assigned to the
most probable histologic area.

Graph theory analysis
Graph theory analysis was performed for9regions extracted from
an ALE meta-analysis of chronic neuropathic pain[10]: operculum
(secondary somatosensory cortex [SII]), insula, thalamus, putamen, ACC, middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The amygdala was added to these
regions as a central hub of emotion processing and as it has also
been shown to have an important role in persistent and chronic
pain states,[12] and in particular in our patient cohort. In addition, it
has been shown to be involved in cannabinoid analgesia in
humans.[4] Left and right amygdala clusters were extracted from
Neurosynth term-based meta-analyses of chronic pain. In total,
11 ROI were included. Presentation of all ROI data is available in
[figure e-2 (doi.org/10.5061/dryad.df6qd5n).](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.df6qd5n)

For each participant, the BOLD time course was extracted from
each ROI and correlation coefficients between its time course
and the time course of all other ROIs were computed. The ROIto-ROI correlation matrix was then thresholded to construct
a binary matrix where existing connections were assigned a value
of 1, while the absence of a functional connection between
network nodes was designated by a value of 0.

The unweighted ROI-to-ROI correlation matrices were thresholded with cost value (K). Cost is a measure of the proportion of
connections for each ROI in relation to all connections in the
network. A cost threshold allows for roughly the same number of
connections across participants by varying the correlation
threshold for each participant to achieve the fixed cost threshold.

Observing a range of network costs values between 0 < K < 0.5
over global and local efficiency networks, compared with the
same measures estimated in a random graph and a regular lattice, can be an indication for small world network properties,[13]

where global efficiency is greater than that of a lattice graph and

[10.5061/dryad.df6qd5n); therefore it was chosen as a threshold.](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.df6qd5n)

The following measures for integration (global efficiency) and
segregation (local efficiency and clustering coefficient) of the
network were examined: global efficiency was calculated as the
average of the inverse of the shortest path length between each
ROI and all other ROIs. The shortest path length is defined as
the fewest number of connections must be traversed to go from
one ROI to another. Thus, a network with high global efficiency
would be one in which nodes are highly integrated so the path
between nodes is consistently short. Local efficiency was calculated as the average global efficiency between only ROIs
neighboring a given ROI. Clustering coefficient is the proportion
of connected ROIs neighboring a given ROI. Altogether, local
efficiency and clustering coefficient measures the extent to which
ROIs are part of a local cluster. Within-subjects repeatedmeasures analysis of variance was used to compute network
measures interaction effects between the treatment (THC, placebo) and state (pre, post). Regression analysis was used to
examine network change posttreatment (post > pre) covariation
with pain decrease posttreatment (post-pre). These analyses
were corrected for FDR of p < 0.05.

qualified investigator.

## Results

Behavioral results
As hypothesized, compared with placebo, THC significantly
reduced the subjective perceived ongoing pain rated with the
VAS score prior to and immediately after fMRI scanning,
about 2 hours following drug administration (interaction effect F1,14 = 5.9, p < 0.05, simple effect p < 0.005, THC postpre = 18.8 ± 5.6, placebo post-pre = 8.7 ± 5.5; figure 2).

The anxiety and the cardiovascular measures did not change
significantly post THC administration compared to placebo.

Functional connectivity results
In order to test the association between the analgesic effect of
THC and functional changes in ACC, patients’ pain ratings
were used as a covariate in the seed-to-whole-brain functional
connectivity regression analysis. ACC ROI was used as the
seed and the change in functional connectivity was examined
by the contrast between the pre and post THC administration
resting state scans (pre < post). We found a reduction in
functional connectivity between the ACC and the sensorimotor cortex that covaried with the reduction in the subjective pain ratings after THC treatment (figure 3). Three
clusters within the sensorimotor cortex were found: the right
and left secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) and the right
motor cortex (Ml) (right SII [areas OP4, OP1: MNI coordinates 64, −16, 20; 121 voxels, T(13) = 8.92, cluster p-FDR =

T(13) = 7.22, cluster p-FDR = 0.0081]. The MNI coordinates
of local maxima for each region are reported).

The relation between the reduction in the functional connectivity and the reduction in pain ratings was represented by β
coefficient of 0.01. Crucially, there was no relation between the
change in pain ratings and the ACC seed-to-whole-brain
functional connectivity change in the placebo condition. To
further examine the different components of the association
observed following THC administration, a post hoc analysis of
the functional connectivity brain state pre-THC treatment was
tested for correlation with the pain ratings of the pre-THC
treatment, as well as with the improvement in pain ratings postTHC treatment (post-pre). There was no correlation between
pre-THC treatment ACC functional connectivity and pain
ratings (figure 4A). Contrarily, pre-THC treatment ACC
functional connectivity with right, left SII, and M1 correlated
with the improvement in pain scores following THC administration (Pearson r = 0.679, p < 0.01, Pearson r = 0.66, p < 0.01,
and Pearson r = 0.8, p < 0.005. respectively, figure 4B).

Graph theory results
The results showing functional connectivity changes within
areas that are considered parts of the so-called chronic pain
network[10] prompted us to further examine functional changes
among all chronic pain network components using graph
theory measures.

A significant change in global efficiency was found for the

Local efficiency and clustering coefficient measure the extent to which a given ROI is part of a local network. Both
measures showed reduction in the whole network (local
efficiency network: T13 = 2.33, p = 0.018, clustering coefficient network: T13 = 2.72, p = 0.0087, figure 6), as well as
in the right DLPFC cluster, which covaried with the reduction in pain scores after THC administration (local
efficiency of DLPFC: T10 = 3.31, p-FDR = 0.0435, clustering coefficient DLPFC: T10 = 3.34, p-FDR = 0.0037,
figure 6). Placebo administration did not show such
association.

## Discussion

The purpose of this study was to explore the poorly understood neural correlates of cannabis-induced analgesia in
chronic pain. To this aim, we employed fMRI during singledose THC vs placebo administration in a cohort of patients
with well-documented chronic neuropathic pain and examined its clinical and brain effects.

THC resulted in significant analgesia compared with placebo,
in line with previous studies indicating the analgesic properties of THC in chronic pain, and specifically neuropathic
pain.[2,3,15] The present study critically adds to existing clinical
literature, as this has not yet been convincingly shown to our
knowledge in chronic radicular pain, an extremely common
neuropathic pain state, using a double-blind randomized design. In line with our hypothesis, the extent of individual pain
relief was associated with reduced ACC–sensorimotor cortex
functional connectivity.

Pain is a complex multimodal subjective experience, encompassing sensory and emotional domains. A traditional view
divides the ascending nociceptive information into parallel
pathways, in which the ACC is part of the “medial” stream,
involved in processing affective aspects of pain, whereas the
somatosensory cortex is considered part of the “lateral”
stream, involved in the sensory aspects of pain processing.[16]

Nevertheless, it is clear that these 2 pathways are heavily
interconnected, and are thought to eventually converge at the
ACC.[17] The ACC and SII are anatomically connected and
both are main cortical targets of the spinothalamic system,
a major pathway of peripheral nociceptive information.[18] The
ACC and the primary motor cortex have strong anatomical
connections as well.[19]

The fact that our results associate pain relief with ACC–
sensorimotor cortex functional connectivity reduction suggests
that THC may alleviate subjectively experienced pain by disrupting the synchrony and integration between these pain
processing 2 pathways. Functional connectivity reduction between sensorimotor and affective pain-related areas was also

experimental pain in healthy participants,[4] supporting our
suggestion of THC cognitive–affective integration interference.

Accordingly, different treatments for chronic pain aim to
modulate the ACC. Cingulotomy has long been used for refractory chronic pain, where analgesia is characterized by altered emotional responses to pain.[20] Real-time fMRI
neurofeedback targeting the ACC reduced patients’ spontaneous pain,[21] and deep brain stimulation targeting the ACC
similarly relieves the affective component of pain.[22] Furthermore, both invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation of the

pain,[23] and this effect has been suggested to stem from interfering with the activity of the ACC.[24] Taken together, this
evidence supports the notion that lesioning and modulation
of the ACC affects pain perception.

Interestingly, our results also demonstrate that pretreatment
functional connectivity between the ACC and the sensorimotor cortex positively correlated with the improvement in
pain scores induced by THC, that is to say, the higher the
positive functional connectivity at baseline, the more benefit
was gained from THC administration. It has been shown

correlated with clinical pain ratings.[25] Our results suggest that
this regional functional connectivity may also serve to predict
the extent of pain relief induced with THC.

Further investigation of the brain effects of cannabis focused on
the well-characterized set of regions often referred to as the
chronic pain network.[26] We used graph theory measures to test
for changes in integration measured by global efficiency and
segregation measured by local efficiency and clustering coefficient of the network. This analysis first revealed global efficiency changes in the MCC cluster post THC treatment
compared to placebo, signifying reduced integration between
the cluster and the rest of the network post THC treatment.
While this cluster is slightly posterior to the seed region ROI in
the ACC used in the previous analysis, both are part of the
anterior MCC (aMCC) subdivision, according to a recent
proposed division of the ACC into anterior and mid cingulate

b d h l d 27 h fi d


implicates the aMCC as the component that has functionally
changed in comparison to the other regions, and showed less
connectivity to the other pain-related regions, as has been
shown in 2 different analyses. Our results echo previous findings of reduced activityof the same cingulatesubdivision during
THC analgesia seen in experimental pain induced in healthy
participants,[4] and further emphasize the role of the aMCC in
the disintegration of multilevel pain processing that delineates
THC-induced analgesia in clinical chronic pain.

In addition, we found local efficiency and clustering coefficient
decreases in the right DLPFC cluster and in the whole network,
which covaried with pain reduction. These measures show that,
on average, the whole network has become locally less connected, and in particular, the right DLPFC is less connected to
it. Resting functional connectivity of the cortical network
consisting of pain-related areas has been shown to increase in

the network modulation as expressed by the reduction in local
connectivity measures of this network observed after THC in
this cohort of patients may represent a trend towards normalization of the network connectivity.

The DLPFC has been shown to be involved in the
cognitive–affective aspects of processing painful stimuli, and
was proposed to exert active control on pain perception by
top-down modulation.[29] Accumulating evidence suggests that
DLPFC may also have a role in recovery from chronic pain. It
has been shown to have thinner gray matter in chronic back
pain patients, which reverses following successful surgical
treatment.[30] Similarly, the DLPFC presented altered functional connectivity with various brain areas, including sensorimotor regions,[31] which normalized following alleviation of
pain. In addition, patients who transition from acute back pain
to chronic back pain show less negative functional connectivity between the insula and DLPFC.[32] Moreover, DLPFC
stimulation has an analgesic effect on chronic pain, and it has
been shown that this stimulation induces functional connectivity changes between the medial thalamus and sensoryaffective cortices.[33] Our results further corroborate the
involvement of this region in pain modulation and specifically
suggest its involvement in THC-mediated analgesia in

h l l


Importantly, the aMCC and the DLPFC, the 2 main areas that
we found changed their connectivity indices after THC administration, have substantial anatomical reciprocal connections,
strong positive resting-state functional connectivness,[34] and both
have been suggested as major components of supraspinal pain
modulation in a top-down manner.[26,29,35]

Limitations
Women were excluded from this study due to concern regarding menstruation-induced fluctuations in pain sensitivity.
In addition, larger scale studies should examine whether these
results are reproduced. Moreover, future investigations
should include other chronic conditions to better understand
whether our results represent a pervasive neuronal mechanism of cannabis effects on chronic pain or are unique to
neuropathic pain states. Finally, it should be emphasized that
the cannabis plant contains a multitude of cannabinoids beyond THC, of which special attention has been directed to
cannabidiol. Such compounds may play important roles in
observed variability of the clinical properties of the plant; for
example, the observation that in cancer pain, the combination
of THC:cannabidiol may be superior to THC alone.[36] Future
studies studying the differential brain-based effects of different
cannabinoids or cannabinoid compositions may thus prove of

In this study, cannabis analgesia was associated with reduced
ACC–sensorimotor cortex functional connectivity and reduced
connectivity between the DLPFC and chronic pain network. In
addition, pretreatment functional connectivity predicted the
extent of pain relief. These results suggest that THC analgesia
in chronic pain is mediated through brain areas underlying
affective processing of pain, as well as supraspinal pain modulation, potentially addressing an imbalance in pain processing
dynamics that occurs in chronic pain states.
