#### Abstract

**Background: Chronic neuropathic pain affects 1%–2% of the**
adult population and is often refractory to standard pharmacologic treatment. Patients with chronic pain have reported
using smoked cannabis to relieve pain, improve sleep and
improve mood.

**Methods: Adults with post-traumatic or postsurgical neuro-**
pathic pain were randomly assigned to receive cannabis at
four potencies (0%, 2.5%, 6% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol) over four 14-day periods in a crossover trial. Participants
inhaled a single 25-mg dose through a pipe three times daily
for the first five days in each cycle, followed by a nine-day
washout period. Daily average pain intensity was measured
using an 11-point numeric rating scale. We recorded effects
on mood, sleep and quality of life, as well as adverse events.

**Results: We recruited 23 participants (mean age 45.4 [stan-**
dard deviation 12.3] years, 12 women [52%]), of whom 21
completed the trial. The average daily pain intensity, measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale, was lower on the
prespecified primary contrast of 9.4% v. 0% tetrahydrocannabinol (5.4 v. 6.1, respectively; difference = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02–1.4). Preparations with intermediate
potency yielded intermediate but nonsignificant degrees of
relief. Participants receiving 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol
reported improved ability to fall asleep (easier, p = 0.001;
faster, p < 0.001; more drowsy, p = 0.003) and improved quality of sleep (less wakefulness, p = 0.01) relative to 0% tetrahydrocannabinol. We found no differences in mood or quality
of life. The most common drug-related adverse events during
the period when participants received 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol were headache, dry eyes, burning sensation in
areas of neuropathic pain, dizziness, numbness and cough.

**Conclusion: A single inhalation of 25 mg of 9.4% tetrahy-**
drocannabinol herbal cannabis three times daily for five
days reduced the intensity of pain, improved sleep and
was well tolerated. Further long-term safety and efficacy
studies are indicated. (International Standard Randomised
Controlled Trial Register no. ISRCTN68314063)


_Cannabis sativa has been used to treat pain since the third_
millennium BC.[5] An endogenous pain-processing system has
been identified, mediated by endogenous cannabinoid ligands
acting on specific cannabinoid receptors.[6] These findings,
coupled with anecdotal evidence of the analgesic effects of
smoked cannabis,[7] support a reconsideration of cannabinoid
agents as analgesics.
Oral cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and nabilone have, alone and in combination, shown efficacy in central[8,9] and peripheral[10] neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis[11] and fibromyalgia.[12]
The analgesic effects of smoked cannabis remain controversial, although it is used by 10%–15% of patients with
chronic noncancer pain[13] and multiple sclerosis.[14] Clinical trials are needed to evaluate these effects, given that the risks
and benefits of inhaled cannabinoids may differ from oral
agents. To date, three small clinical trials of the analgesic
efficacy of smoked cannabis have been reported.[15–17] All studies were conducted in residential laboratories, and participants smoked multiple doses of the drug at each time point.
No study adequately reported data related to adverse events.
We conducted a clinical trial using a standardized single-dose
delivery system to explore further the safety and efficacy of
smoked cannabis in outpatients with chronic neuropathic pain.


###### Methods


hronic neuropathic pain has a prevalence of 1%–2%,[1]
and treatment options are limited.[2] Pharmacotherapy
includes anticonvulsants, antidepressants, opioids and

# C

local anesthetics,[3,4] but responses vary and side effects limit
compliance.


**Participants**
The study was approved by the McGill University Health
Centre Research Ethics Committee, and all participants gave
written informed consent. Participants were recruited at the
McGill University Health Centre.
Those eligible were men and women aged 18 years or older
with neuropathic pain of at least three months in duration
caused by trauma or surgery, with allodynia or hyperalgesia,

and with an average weekly pain intensity score greater than 4
on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Participants had a stable
analgesic regimen and reported not having used cannabis during the year before the study (Appendix 1, available at www
.cmaj .ca /cgi /content /full /cmaj .091414 /DC1). Potential participants had to have normal liver function (defined as aspartate
aminogransferase less than three times normal), normal renal
function (defined as a serum creatinine level < 133 µmol/L),
normal hematocrit (> 38%) and a negative result on β human
chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test (if applicable). Women
of child-bearing potential consented to use adequate contraception during the study and for three months afterward.
Exclusion criteria were pain due to cancer or nociceptive
causes, presence of significant cardiac or pulmonary disease,
current substance abuse or dependence (including abuse of or
dependence on cannabis), history of psychotic disorder, current suicidal ideation, pregnancy or breastfeeding, participation in another clinical trial within 30 days of enrolment in
our trial, and ongoing insurance claims.

**Study design**
We used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fourperiod crossover design. Each period was 14 days in duration,
beginning with five days on the study drug followed by a nineday washout period. Eligible participants were randomized to a
sequence of treatment periods based on a Latin square design.
Cannabis was obtained from Prairie Plant Systems Inc.
(Saskatoon, Sask.) and the United States National Institute of
Drug Abuse. Prairie Plant Systems Inc. blended cannabis
flowers and leaves to prepare three different potencies of
active drug (2.5%, 6.0% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol). The
US National Institute of Drug Abuse used ethanolic extraction of cannabinoids to prepare the 0% tetrahydrocannabinol
product. Intermediate doses (2.5% and 6.0% tetrahydrocannabinol) were used to increase the likelihood of successful
blinding. Doses of 25 mg (± 1 mg) were prepared in opaque
gelatin capsules by the study pharmacist. A panel of nine
independent personnel examined the appearance of the four
cannabis preparations and found no association between estimated and true potency (data not shown).
Cannabis doses were delivered as single smoked inhalations using a titanium pipe (RayDiaTor, Mori Designs,
Auburn, WA, USA). The first dose of each period was selfadministered under observation in a ventilated room. For dose
delivery, one capsule of the assigned potency was opened and
the cannabis tipped into the bowl of the pipe. Participants
were instructed to inhale for five seconds while the cannabis
was lit, hold the smoke in their lungs for ten seconds, and
then exhale. The beginning of inhalation was recorded as the
onset of the exposure. Subsequent doses were self-administered in the same manner three times daily at home for the
first five days of each period.
Routine medications were continued throughout the trial.
Use of breakthrough analgesia (acetaminophen) was allowed.

**Study protocol**
The study nurse explained the study to each participant,
sought signed informed consent, obtained a medical history


and performed a chart review. The study physician conducted
a physical examination. Urinary drug screening was performed. Participants were contacted by telephone on three
occasions during the first five days of the screening phase to
calculate a baseline average pain score. A psychological evaluation was conducted by a clinical psychologist.
On the first day of each period, participants were followed
for three hours. Vital signs and ratings of pain, “high,” relaxation, stress, happiness and heart rate were recorded, and
blood was collected for tetrahydrocannabinol assays. On days
one and five of each study period, blood was collected for
hematologic and biochemical analyses. At the end of their first
visit, participants were given four labelled containers for urine
collection and 13 cannabis doses for the five days of treatment.
During the first five days of each period, participants were
contacted daily by telephone to administer questionnaires on
pain intensity, sleep, medication and adverse effects. Participants collected early morning urine samples daily. They
returned on day five to return the urine samples, to undergo
urinary and blood tests, and to complete questionnaires on
pain quality, mood, quality of life and assessments of
potency. At the end of the study, participants completed final
adverse event reports and potency assessments. Participants
were advised not to drive a vehicle or operate heavy machinery while under the influence of the study drug.

**Outcome measures**
Outcome measures were selected following published recommendations for clinical trials of chronic pain.[18] Pain intensity
was measured using an 11-item numeric rating scale, with
“no pain” and “worst pain possible” as anchors. The numeric
rating scale was administered once daily for present, worst,
least and average pain intensity during the previous 24 hours.
As per protocol, the average pain intensity score over the five
days on study drug constituted the primary outcome. Acute
effects on pain intensity were measured using a 100-mm
visual analogue scale. Pain quality was assessed using the
McGill Pain Questionnaire.[19] Sleep was assessed using the
Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire.[20] The short-form Profile of Mood States was used to examine mood effects.[21]
Quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D health outcome
instrument.[22] The items “high,” “relaxed,” “stressed,” and
“happy” were measured using a 100-mm visual analogue
scale (0 = not at all, 10 = extremely).[23–25] Potency assessments
were conducted by asking participants on the fifth day of each
period to guess which potency they had received. At the end
of the trial, participants were asked to guess the order in
which they received the treatments. Standard assays for
plasma tetrahydrocannabinol assays were used (Appendix 1).

**Statistical analysis**
Our primary hypothesis was that smoked cannabis containing
9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol is superior to 0% tetrahydrocannabinol in reducing average pain intensity. The comparison of within-patient average weekly pain intensity when
assigned 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol cannabis compared with
placebo was the contrast of primary interest. A sample size of
32 patients was targeted assuming a within-patient difference


-----

of 10 mm[26] in the primary outcome between active and
placebo drug, on a 100 mm scale, with a standard deviation of
20 mm, and with 80% power and 5% significance.
A generalized linear model including drug, period and firstorder carryover effects was fitted. If the carryover effect or
period effect was not significant, then a reduced model was
refitted. Nine-five per cent confidence intervals were generated. Significance tests were performed at a 5% level. An
identical procedure to that described above for the primary
outcome was performed to assess the secondary outcomes,
including the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Leeds Sleep
Evaluation Questionnaire, the Profile of Mood States, and EQ5D. Statistical procedures for day one assessments and EQ-5D
analyses are shown in Appendix 1. Data from all randomized
participants were included in all safety and efficacy analyses.
All reported adverse events were classified according to
severity, seriousness and relationship to the study drug. An
independent data-monitoring committee monitored the safetyrelated aspects of the trial.

**Regulatory considerations**
In conducting the study, we followed the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.[27] The trial was registered with the
International Standard for Randomised Controlled Trials Register (ISRCTN683140063).

###### Results

**Participants**
We screened 116 potential participants over a 30-month
period (August 2003 to January 2006), of whom 93 were ineligible. Twenty-three participants underwent random assignment to treatment, of whom 21 completed all four cycles.
Two participants withdrew within the first five days of the
study; one (who was receiving placebo at the time) withdrew
because of a positive result on urinary screening for cannabinoid and the other (who was receiving 6% tetrahydrocannabinol at the time) because of increased pain (Figure 1). Demographic and baseline pain characteristics of participants are
shown in Table 1.

**Primary outcome**
We found no evidence of significant carryover or period
effects for any outcome. The average daily pain intensity was
significantly lower on 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol cannabis
(5.4) than on 0% tetrahydrocannabinol (6.1) (p = 0.023; difference = 0.7, 95% CI 0.02–1.4). All pairwise differences
between groups are shown with 95% CIs in Table 2. The average daily pain scores for each level of tetrahydrocannabinol,
along with other secondary outcomes, are shown in Table 2.

**Secondary outcomes**
There was a trend toward improvement in all outcomes with
increasing tetrahydrocannabinol content (Table 3). Participants using 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol cannabis reported significantly more drowsiness and reported getting to sleep more

group compared with placebo on the EQ-5D subscale
(p < 0.05). No significant differences were noted on the Profile of Mood States. No difference in the “high,” “happy,”
“relaxed” or “stressed” scores on the visual analogue scale
were observed between tetrahydrocannabinol potencies.
A total of 248 mild and six moderate adverse events (fall,[2]
increased pain,[1] numbness,[1] drowsiness[1] and pneumonia[1]) were
reported during the trial (Table 4). No serious or unexpected
adverse events were reported. The total number of adverse
events and the number of participants reporting at least one
adverse event increased with tetrahydrocannabinol potency.
The most frequent drug-related adverse events reported in the
group receiving 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol were headache,
dry eyes, burning sensation, dizziness, numbness and cough.
Feeling “high” and euphoria were reported once in each of the
2.5%, 6% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol periods. No significant changes in vital signs, heart-rate variability, hematological, biochemistry or renal function blood tests were detected.
On day five of the first cycle, 1 of 5 participants (20%)
assigned to placebo correctly identified this assignment, while 9
of the 16 participants (56%) who received placebo during later
cycles did so. Of the 5 participants administered 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol in their first cycle, none correctly identified this
assignment, while 10 of 16 patients (63%) did so during later
cycles. At the end of the trial, 16 (76%) of the participants were
able to correctly identify the 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol period
and 13 (62%) were able to identify the 0% tetrahydrocannabinol
period, whereas the 6% tetrahydrocannabinol period was identified by 8 participants (38%) and the 2.5% period by 7 (33%).
Compliance with the study was excellent, and all dispensed capsules were returned. With the exception of one
participant who withdrew from the study, there were no positive urine tetrahydrocannabinol tests during the 0% tetrahydrocannabinol period or on any day one before exposure
(Appendix 1).
Plasma tetrahydrocannabinol assays revealed dose–response
pharmacokinetics (Figure 2) and confirmed that participants
did not use cannabis during placebo phases (Appendix 1).
Pharmacy dispensing was satisfactory. No legal issues
arose during the study and there were no reports or allegations of diversion of the study drug.

physicians, and we made a concerted effort to collect data on
adverse events and describe short-term physiologic effects.
The frequency of adverse events increased with tetrahydrocannabinol potency. Psychoactive effects did not result in participants withdrawing from the study. Euphoria or “high” was
reported on only three occasions throughout the trial. There
was no evidence of euphoria during the three hours following
the first dose of each cycle regardless of tetrahydrocannabinol
potency, possibly because plasma levels (mean 45 ng/mL) did
not reach levels found with recreational users (> 100 ng/mL).[31]
