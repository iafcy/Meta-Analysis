Abstract

The objective was to investigate the effectiveness of cannabis-based medicines for treatment of chronic pain associated with brachial
plexus root avulsion. This condition is an excellent human model of central neuropathic pain as it represents an unusually homogenous group
in terms of anatomical location of injury, pain descriptions and patient demographics. Forty-eight patients with at least one avulsed root and
baseline pain score of four or more on an 11-point ordinate scale participated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three period
crossover study. All patients had intractable symptoms regardless of current analgesic therapy. Patients entered a baseline period of 2 weeks,
followed by three, 2-week treatment periods during each of which they received one of three oromucosal spray preparations. These were
placebo and two whole plant extracts of Cannabis sativa L.: GW-1000-02 (Sativex[w]), containing D[9]tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):cannabidiol
(CBD) in an approximate 1:1 ratio and GW-2000-02, containing primarily THC. The primary outcome measure was the mean pain severity
score during the last 7 days of treatment. Secondary outcome measures included pain related quality of life assessments. The primary
outcome measure failed to fall by the two points defined in our hypothesis. However, both this measure and measures of sleep showed
statistically significant improvements. The study medications were generally well tolerated with the majority of adverse events, including
intoxication type reactions, being mild to moderate in severity and resolving spontaneously. Studies of longer duration in neuropathic pain
are required to confirm a clinically relevant, improvement in the treatment of this condition.

1. Introduction

Avulsion of nerve rootlets from the spinal cord following
traction injuries to the brachial plexus frequently produces a
highly characteristic pain syndrome. Constant, spontaneous
crushing and burning pain is felt in the distal part of the
anaesthetic limb and is often accompanied by shooting
pain (Frazier and Skillern, 1911; Parry, 1980). It is not
uncommon for the pain to persist for many years making
this a difficult condition to treat. Options include empirical

drug therapy, nerve transfer surgery and dorsal root entry
zone (DREZ) lesions. There is a small body of evidence to
support surgical intervention (Berman et al., 1998; Samii
et al., 2001; Thomas and Kitchen, 1994). However, the
published evidence on drug treatment is essentially
anecdotal.
Many of our patients have given spontaneous reports
regarding the efficacy of ‘street’ cannabis in treating the
pain from brachial plexus avulsion. These have been in
cases where the use of a wide range of anticonvulsants,
opiates and tricyclic antidepressants have had only partial
or no success. These reports led us to try nabilone on a
number of occasions. This synthetic THC analogue is
licensed in the United Kingdom as an antiemetic during

chemotherapy. Unfortunately its use has been limited by
problems with availability and more particularly a
perception that psychotropic side effects were more
common at analgesic levels than was the case with
cannabis (Hirst et al., 1998). Whole plant extracts of
Cannabis sativa L. contain a complex mixture of natural
cannabinoids and other chemical compounds. These may
interact to provide a superior therapeutic profile over
single synthetic entities. It was therefore a logical step for
us to test newly available pharmaceutical grade cannabis
based medicines in patients with this condition. An
additional reason for choosing this population of patients
is that they are an unusually homogenous group in terms
of anatomical location of injury, pain descriptions and
demographics. They therefore represent an excellent
human model of central neuropathic pain.
The main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis extract is
D[9]tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This is an agonist at the
CB1 receptor, which is found at many sites within the
central nervous system (Pertwee, 2001). Some of its
unwanted side effects may be modulated by another
naturally occurring cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD)
(McPartland and Russo, 2001). In this study we tested two
whole plant extracts of Cannabis sativa L.; one with an
approximate 1:1 ratio of THC:CBD, coded as GW-1000-02
(Sativex[w]) and a THC extract, coded as GW-2000-02. The
extracts were used in an oromucosal spray containing
27 mg/ml THC and 25 mg/ml CBD and tested against
an inactive placebo. Our primary question was whether
GW-1000-02 reduced chronic pain, with GW-2000-02
assessed as a secondary objective. In addition to further
pain related questionnaires, secondary questions also aimed
to review improvement in overall quality of life. Patients
report that they cope better with their pain during work or
other activities that provide distractions whereas periods of
relaxation and sleep are more problematic.

2. Methods

2.1. Subjects

Study participants were recruited between December
2001 and July 2002 from patients treated at the Royal
National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) in Stanmore. This
is the UK national referral centre for patients with brachial
plexus injury. Most patients had previously been treated by
the Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit at the RNOH and had also
attended the pain clinic.
Men and women aged 18 years or more, with at least one
avulsed brachial plexus root and with the injury occurring
R
18 months previously were included. Patients who scored
four or above on a zero to 10 eleven point ordinal pain
severity scale at Visits 1 and 2 and had a pattern of pain that
in the investigator’s opinion had been stable over the
previous 4 weeks were eligible. No analgesics were


prohibited; all permitted concurrent medication had to
have been stable during the previous 4 weeks and was to
remain stable during the study. Patients were required
to stop any cannabis or cannabinoid use at least 7 days prior
to entry into the study.
Patients with a history of any of the following were
ineligible: schizophrenia, other psychotic illness or significant psychiatric illness, other than depression associated
with chronic illness; serious cardiovascular disease; significant renal or hepatic impairment; epilepsy or convulsions;
significant history of substance abuse; known adverse
reaction to cannabis or the product excipients; surgery
within 2 months (6 months for nerve repair). Female
patients who were pregnant, lactating or at risk of pregnancy
were also excluded. Concurrent use of levodopa, sildenafil
and fentanyl during the study was not permitted due to the
theoretical inhibition of selected cytochrome P450 isoforms
by CBD. For similar reasons the dose of amitriptyline was
restricted to a maximum of 75 mg per day.
Patients were not allowed to drive within 4 h of a dose of
the study drug or if they felt intoxicated in any way (see
Discussion).
The local ethics committee at RNOH approved the study.
The study was conducted according to the International
Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice
guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki with respect to
informed consent.

2.2. Study design and treatment

This was a single centre, double-blind, randomised,
placebo-controlled, three period crossover study. All
patients self-administered GW-1000-02, GW-2000-02 and
placebo, with each medication given for a minimum of
14 days with the visit window allowing flexibility in clinic
appointment timing up to a maximum of 20 days. Patients
were randomly allocated by a computer generated list to the
six possible sequences of receiving the three study
medications. Although the treatment sequence was blinded,
sealed code break envelopes, one for each patient, containing information on the treatment sequence were available if
necessary. Blinding was maintained throughout the study.
After the initial contact, patients attended for their first
visit. During this visit patients gave consent and underwent
a full eligibility screen including physical examination, vital
signs, and a battery of baseline assessments as described in
Section 2.3. Patients recorded their baseline symptoms in a
daily diary then returned for a second visit, 7–24 days later,
for randomisation and dose introduction. Patients were
instructed on how to self-medicate and were monitored in
clinic over 4 h, on the dosing day at the start of each period,
while they took up to four initial doses. Patients returned for
their next visit 2 weeks later for end of period assessments
and to receive the next medication. This process was
repeated at a fourth visit, 2 weeks later. Two weeks after
this, patients attended for a fifth and final visit that included

2.3.2. Secondary measures
At each clinic visit, patients recorded a pain review score
on a BS-11 scale. On this scale patients recorded the
severity of their pain over the previous 7 days.
Sleep quality was measured using a BS-11 scale from
zero ‘Best Imaginable’ to 10 ‘Worst Imaginable’. Sleep
disturbance (number of times woken due to pain) was
measured using a four point categorical scale of none, once,
twice, more than twice. Both these measures were recorded
daily in the patient diaries. Patients also recorded the
number of medication sprays taken during each 24-h period.

2.3.1. Primary measure
The primary measure of efficacy was a standard eleven
point ordinal pain severity scale ranging from zero ‘Best
Imaginable’ to 10 ‘Worst Imaginable’, recorded in the daily
diary. This was recorded as an eleven point Box Scale
(BS-11) where patients ticked one of a row of boxes above
the numbers 0–10 (Jensen et al., 1986, 1989). Baseline was
taken as the average of these scores for the last 7 days before
dosing. The on-treatment scores were the average of the last
7 days of each of the 2-week treatment periods, to minimise
carry over effects from the previous period. Based on
previously published work, it was assumed a priori that a
difference of at least two points in the BS-11 pain score
between the active and placebo phases would represent a G
clinically significant change (Farrar et al., 2001). Fig. 2. Mean ( SE) number of sprays taken per day.

and had on treatment study data collected for at least 3 days
from a treatment period. Any patients who received at least
one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis
population.
No washout period was used between the three treatment
periods. Any carry over effect was unlikely to be for greater
than 2–3 days so the first week of titration for each period
would be sufficient to counteract any carry over with
efficacy comparisons being made by averaging the variables
over the last 7 days of treatment. By 24 h post-dose the
plasma level of the major efficacy constituents of GW-100002 is usually at or below the lower limit of quantification.
In trials conducted to date using GW-1000-02, the putative
effective half-lives of CBD, THC and 11-hydroxy THC
(the main metabolite of THC) have been calculated to be in
the order of 100, 85 and 130 min, respectively (Guy, 2003).
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare
each cannabis based medicine to placebo. The model
included factors for patient, treatment and period. The
significance of the overall treatment effect was assessed
using the F-test from the ANOVA. The model used was as

Twenty two (45.8%) had previously used cannabis medicinally and 29 (60.4%) had used it recreationally. The pattern
of injury, operative repair and time since last surgical
intervention are shown in Table 1. Of the 45 completing
patients, 36 (80%) entered the open label extension study,
using GW-1000-02.
Patients were taking a variety of analgesic medication
concurrently throughout the study, this is shown in Table 2.
Forty patients (83%) were taking at least one concomitant
medication, of these, eight patients were taking only one
medication, 12 patients were taking two, four taking three,
nine taking four medications and seven were taking five or
more. Some patients may have failed previously tried
analgesics.

analysis period is presented in Fig. 2.

3.3. Withdrawals

Of the 48 patients randomised three withdrew before
completing the study. One patient experienced nausea and
vomiting during placebo administration, another withdrew due to an episode of feeling faint whilst taking
GW-1000-02, the last patient withdrew due to feelings of
anxiety and paranoia, experienced whilst taking placebo

1. Data were therefore available for 48 patients who received
placebo, 46 who received GW-1000-02 and 47 who received
GW-2000-02.

3.4. Statistical issues

The appropriateness of the protocol specified statistical
model was investigated by an inspection of the fitted
residuals and no statistical issues were apparent. In addition,
it is noted that neither the mean pain score nor the pain
review score recorded at clinic visits provided any evidence
of a treatment by period interaction effect. See discussion of
carryover effects in Section 2.4.

3.5. Primary outcome measure

The difference in the mean diary BS-11 pain score
between both study medications and placebo was statistically
significant but did not reach the a priori assumed level
for clinical significance of two boxes; GW-1000-02
K K
compared with placebo equalled a reduction of 0.58 boxes
(PZ0.005, 95% CI: 0.98, 0.18 boxes) and GW-2000-02
K K
compared with placebo gave a reduction of 0.64 boxes
(PZ0.002, 95% CI: 1.03, 0.24 boxes). Fig. 3 shows the
mean daily pain score by day and Fig. 4 shows the mean daily
pain scores during each period.

3.6. Secondary outcome measures

Table 3 shows the mean scores, P-values, and confidence
intervals (given as the difference from placebo) for the
secondary outcome measures. The sleep quality and sleep
disturbance scores are the daily means over the last 7 days of

each treatment period. The SF-MPQ scores, pain review
BS-11 scores, PDI and GHQ-12 were recorded at the start of
the study and the end of each treatment period. The present
pain intensity (PPI) section of the SF-MPQ questionnaire
was not analysed.

3.7. Numbers needed to treat

The numbers needed to treat (NNT) have been calculated
according to the method described by Walter (2001). The
NNTs for the diary BS-11 pain score are shown in Table 4
for threshold reductions in pain scores of one and two points
as well as 30 and 50% against placebo (primary measure).
Table 5 presents the same data for sleep quality.
Using a 30% decrease as the threshold for clinical
relevance of pain relief the equivalent NNTs would be 9.0
(GW-1000-02) and 7.7 (GW-2000-02), respectively. At the
50% response level only one patient in the GW-2000-02
treatment group was classed as a responder (NNT 46) and
none in GW-1000-02 group.

3.8. Tolerability and adverse events

The study medication was well tolerated by all patients
with no serious AEs occurring throughout the study.
There were more AEs experienced during the active
medication periods than during the placebo period.
However, the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in
severity and resolved spontaneously. Intoxication VAS
(100 mm) scores at the end of each dosing period were
1 mm for placebo, 5.9 mm for GW-1000-02 and 9.7 mm for
GW-2000-02. Table 6 provides a summary of the number of
patients experiencing the five most common treatment
emergent, treatment related AEs by preferred term.

AEs that may indicate intoxication include: dizziness,

nausea and lethargy. The incidence of these, based upon
the treatment emergent, all causality AEs, does not differ
greatly across the three treatment groups. Euphoric mood
and feeling drunk were not experienced by the placebo
group, dizziness was the most frequently experienced AE,
see Table 6, with also the largest difference in incidence
when either of the active medications is compared with
placebo.

4. Discussion

This is the first randomised controlled trial of any drug
used to treat pain resulting from brachial plexus avulsion
injury.
When treatment with study medications was compared to
placebo the primary outcome measure (BS-11 pain severity
score) failed to fall by the two points defined in our
hypothesis. However, both this measure and measures of
sleep showed statistically significant improvements. All
patients remained on their existing medications throughout
the study therefore this modest benefit is in addition to that
provided by existing medications.
The lack of change in the PDI may reflect the patients’
underlying physical disability, which was not affected by
the study medication.
A number of factors may have acted to confound the
reliability of the results. The most problematic of these was
the difficulty of guaranteeing full blinding although efforts
were made to ensure that this was maintained. Many
patients had previous experience of cannabis. Side effects
suggestive of mild intoxication were more common in the
active treatment phases when compared to placebo.
Dysgeusia (bad taste) was also more common with active
treatment. If patients associated these effects with receiving
active drug this could have biased the study towards a
positive outcome.
Patients were selected from the pain clinic and also by
searching patient notes for mention of significant pain. Such
a method may introduce bias although it is not clear whether
any other selection method would have been better.
Patients continued to receive their regular analgesics
throughout the study. As cannabis based medicines are


likely to be used as adjunctive therapy we wanted the study
design to reflect this. This may have reduced the measurable
analgesic effect although conversely there is the possibility
of synergistic effects with opiates (Lynch and Clark, 2003).
Another reason for allowing patients to continue their
regular analgesics was to improve the recruitment rate.
We chose a self-titration dosing schedule for several
reasons. Data from human volunteer studies showed a high
inter-subject variability in the bioavailability of GW-100002. Patients from previous studies had, due to symptom
relief and tolerability, required the full range of dose,
between 1 and 48 sprays per day (Notcutt et al., 2004; Wade
et al., 2003). Self-titration also enabled patients, most of
who were working and driving, to achieve their individual
optimum therapeutic dose by balancing any analgesia
against possible side effects and allowing them to vary the
dose depending on their levels of pain, activity and to fit in
with their lifestyle.
The sample size was sufficient to show a statistically
significant change in the primary outcome measure. A larger
sample and longer duration of treatment, would be required
to comment more meaningfully on the true size of this effect
(Moore et al., 1998). The extension study should provide
this information in due course.
An important aspect of this study is the homogeneity of
the study population. All injuries occurred at anatomically
similar sites and pain descriptions were similar. The
consistency of brachial plexus pain has been well described
before (Bruxelle et al., 1988; Parry, 1980). It would be
simplistic to suggest that the underlying mechanism of pain
is the same in all patients following brachial plexus
avulsion. There is much variation in the precise anatomical
location of injury both in relation to the proximity of each
avulsion to the spinal cord and the combination of nerve
roots affected. There is evidence to suggest, however, that
segmental deafferentation of the dorsal horn may be an
important mechanism in the production of pain following
avulsion injury. Both burst and continuous spontaneous
firing of dorsal horn neurones have been reported following
experimental avulsion injuries in the cat (Ovelmen-Levitt,
1988). Similar patterns of activity have also been recorded
in man following spinal cord injury (Loeser et al., 1968). It
has been suggested that such patterns of neuronal activity
correlates with both the continuous and paroxysmal patterns
of pain seen following avulsion injuries although this was
not confirmed in a recent study (Guenot et al., 2003).
Can these proposed mechanisms be used to inform
effective treatment? Neurosurgical treatment using the
DREZ lesion was originally developed in the 1970s and
continues to be used (Nashold and Ostdahl, 1979; Samii
et al., 2001; Thomas and Kitchen, 1994). DREZ is an
effective long-term treatment for brachial plexus avulsion
pain producing long-term significant pain reduction in about
two-thirds of patients. This strongly suggests that the dorsal
horn is a significant site of ongoing pain generation
following avulsion. Unfortunately DREZ is associated

with a significant rate of neurological complications limiting the use of this technique to only the most severe and
refractory cases.
Surgical repair of avulsion injuries by nerve transfer has
also been reported to lead to amelioration of pain (Berman
et al., 1998). If this is a true causal relationship, the
mechanisms are unclear.
Pharmacological treatment still remains the first line
treatment for avulsion pain. In the absence of specific
randomised trials this is based on their use in other
neuropathic pain syndromes. Anticonvulsants, tricyclic
antidepressants and opiates are the main drug groups used.
The use of tricyclic antidepressants has frequently been
limited by side effects that are unacceptable to this active
group of patients. There is anecdotal evidence that opiates
are only partially effective in a significant proportion of
these patients (Berman et al., 1998).
Like the opioid system, the cannabinoids modulate pain
processing at multiple sites within the central nervous
system (Rice, 2001). Cannabinoids produce analgesia
independently of opiates. Cannabinoid analgesia is well
established in animal models of neuropathic pain (Bridges
et al., 2001; Fox et al., 2001; Hamann and di Vadi, 1999;
Herzberg et al., 1997; Mao et al., 2000). However, evidence
for cannabinoid analgesia in man is limited. A recent
systematic review revealed only two single subject case
reports specifically looking at neuropathic pain (Campbell
et al., 2001; Holdcroft et al., 1997; Maurer et al., 1990).
Randomised controlled studies are only now starting to
appear. The recently published CAMS study did show
improvements in pain in multiple sclerosis with oral
cannabis extract and also oral synthetic D[9]-THC when
compared to placebo (Zajicek et al., 2003).
Like this study, a recent study of the effect of cannabis
based medicines on neurogenic symptoms showed
improved sleep quality (Wade et al., 2003). This may
therefore prove a useful alternative to amitriptyline. It
would be worthwhile to conduct studies comparing these
two agents.
The adverse effects of smoked cannabis have been
studied closely (Joy et al., 1999). When used recreationally
cannabis does appear to have some potential for dependence (Ashton, 1999). There is also a consensus opinion
that established mental illness may be aggravated by
cannabis (Patton et al., 2002). For this reason, patients
with a history of significant mental illness were excluded
from this study. Heavy, regular recreational cannabis
smoking at a young age in vulnerable subjects may be
associated with an increased risk of subsequently developing schizophrenia (Arseneault et al., 2002; Zammit
et al., 2002), but this remains a controversial issue. In
assessing potential risk to medicinal subjects, it should
also be borne in mind that the aim of the recreational user
is to achieve intoxication, whereas, as seen in this study
the aim of the medicinal user is to avoid it. No medication
can be considered risk free. However, in the controlled


setting there is no evidence that cannabis based medicine
is less safe than other analgesic drugs.
Eighty percent of the patients considered the study drugs
of sufficient benefit to warrant continuing into the extension
study. This puts into context the clinical relevance of the
modest drop in pain scores in a condition that is long lasting,
difficult to treat and that has already proven refractory to our
standard methods of treatment by both nerve repair and oral
analgesics. The presented NNTs might be useful for
clinicians to determine whether this drug would have a
role in their practice. However, this must be set against the
lack of consistency in outcome measures in central pain
drug trials and consequently the difficulty in comparing
NNTs across studies (Finnerup et al., 2002).
Further longer term studies of cannabis based medicines
in central neuropathic pain are now required to demonstrate
a clinically relevant, improvement in the treatment of this
condition.
