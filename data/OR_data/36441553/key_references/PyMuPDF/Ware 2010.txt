hronic neuropathic pain has a prevalence of 1%–2%,1
and treatment options are limited.2 Pharmacotherapy
includes anticonvulsants, antidepressants, opioids and
local anesthetics,3,4 but responses vary and side effects limit
compliance.
Cannabis sativa has been used to treat pain since the third
millennium BC.5 An endogenous pain-processing system has
been identified, mediated by endogenous cannabinoid ligands
acting on specific cannabinoid receptors.6 These findings,
coupled with anecdotal evidence of the analgesic effects of
smoked cannabis,7 support a reconsideration of cannabinoid
agents as analgesics.
Oral cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabid-
iol and nabilone have, alone and in combination, shown effi-
cacy in central8,9 and peripheral10 neuropathic pain, rheuma-
toid arthritis11 and fibromyalgia.12
The analgesic effects of smoked cannabis remain contro-
versial, although it is used by 10%–15% of patients with
chronic noncancer pain13 and multiple sclerosis.14 Clinical tri-
als are needed to evaluate these effects, given that the risks
and benefits of inhaled cannabinoids may differ from oral
agents. To date, three small clinical trials of the analgesic
efficacy of smoked cannabis have been reported.15–17 All stud-
ies were conducted in residential laboratories, and partici-
pants smoked multiple doses of the drug at each time point.
No study adequately reported data related to adverse events.
We conducted a clinical trial using a standardized single-dose
delivery system to explore further the safety and efficacy of
smoked cannabis in outpatients with chronic neuropathic pain.
Methods
Participants
The study was approved by the McGill University Health
Centre Research Ethics Committee, and all participants gave
written informed consent. Participants were recruited at the
McGill University Health Centre.
Those eligible were men and women aged 18 years or older
with neuropathic pain of at least three months in duration
caused by trauma or surgery, with allodynia or hyperalgesia,

Background: Chronic neuropathic pain affects 1%–2% of the
adult population and is often refractory to standard pharma-
cologic treatment. Patients with chronic pain have reported
using smoked cannabis to relieve pain, improve sleep and
improve mood.
Methods: Adults with post-traumatic or postsurgical neuro-
pathic pain were randomly assigned to receive cannabis at
four potencies (0%, 2.5%, 6% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabi-
nol) over four 14-day periods in a crossover trial. Participants
inhaled a single 25-mg dose through a pipe three times daily
for the first five days in each cycle, followed by a nine-day
washout period. Daily average pain intensity was measured
using an 11-point numeric rating scale. We recorded effects
on mood, sleep and quality of life, as well as adverse events.
Results: We recruited 23 participants (mean age 45.4 [stan-
dard deviation 12.3] years, 12 women [52%]), of whom 21
completed the trial. The average daily pain intensity, mea-
sured on the 11-point numeric rating scale, was lower on the
prespecified primary contrast of 9.4% v. 0% tetrahydro-
cannabinol (5.4 v. 6.1, respectively; difference = 0.7, 95% con-
fidence interval [CI] 0.02–1.4). Preparations with intermediate
potency yielded intermediate but nonsignificant degrees of
relief. Participants receiving 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol
reported improved ability to fall asleep (easier, p = 0.001;
faster, p < 0.001; more drowsy, p = 0.003) and improved qual-
ity of sleep (less wakefulness, p = 0.01) relative to 0% tetrahy-
drocannabinol. We found no differences in mood or quality
of life. The most common drug-related adverse events during
the period when participants received 9.4% tetrahydro-
cannabinol were headache, dry eyes, burning sensation in
areas of neuropathic pain, dizziness, numbness and cough.
Conclusion: A single inhalation of 25 mg of 9.4% tetrahy-
drocannabinol herbal cannabis three times daily for five
days reduced the intensity of pain, improved sleep and
was well tolerated. Further long-term safety and efficacy
studies are indicated. (International Standard Randomised
Controlled Trial Register no. ISRCTN68314063)

and with an average weekly pain intensity score greater than 4
on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Participants had a stable
analgesic regimen and reported not having used cannabis dur-
ing the year before the study (Appendix 1, available at www
.cmaj .ca /cgi /content /full /cmaj .091414 /DC1). Potential partici-
pants had to have normal liver function (defined as aspartate
aminogransferase less than three times normal), normal renal
function (defined as a serum creatinine level < 133 µmol/L),
normal hematocrit (> 38%) and a negative result on β human
chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test (if applicable). Women
of child-bearing potential consented to use adequate contra-
ception during the study and for three months afterward.
Exclusion criteria were pain due to cancer or nociceptive
causes, presence of significant cardiac or pulmonary disease,
current substance abuse or dependence (including abuse of or
dependence on cannabis), history of psychotic disorder, cur-
rent suicidal ideation, pregnancy or breastfeeding, participa-
tion in another clinical trial within 30 days of enrolment in
our trial, and ongoing insurance claims.
Study design
We used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-
period crossover design. Each period was 14 days in duration,
beginning with five days on the study drug followed by a nine-
day washout period. Eligible participants were randomized to a
sequence of treatment periods based on a Latin square design.
Cannabis was obtained from Prairie Plant Systems Inc.
(Saskatoon, Sask.) and the United States National Institute of
Drug Abuse. Prairie Plant Systems Inc. blended cannabis
flowers and leaves to prepare three different potencies of
active drug (2.5%, 6.0% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol). The
US National Institute of Drug Abuse used ethanolic extrac-
tion of cannabinoids to prepare the 0% tetrahydrocannabinol
product. Intermediate doses (2.5% and 6.0% tetrahydro-
cannabinol) were used to increase the likelihood of successful
blinding. Doses of 25 mg (± 1 mg) were prepared in opaque
gelatin capsules by the study pharmacist. A panel of nine
independent personnel examined the appearance of the four
cannabis preparations and found no association between esti-
mated and true potency (data not shown).
Cannabis doses were delivered as single smoked inhala-
tions using a titanium pipe (RayDiaTor, Mori Designs,
Auburn, WA, USA). The first dose of each period was self-
administered under observation in a ventilated room. For dose
delivery, one capsule of the assigned potency was opened and
the cannabis tipped into the bowl of the pipe. Participants
were instructed to inhale for five seconds while the cannabis
was lit, hold the smoke in their lungs for ten seconds, and
then exhale. The beginning of inhalation was recorded as the
onset of the exposure. Subsequent doses were self-adminis-
tered in the same manner three times daily at home for the
first five days of each period.
Routine medications were continued throughout the trial.
Use of breakthrough analgesia (acetaminophen) was allowed.
Study protocol
The study nurse explained the study to each participant,
sought signed informed consent, obtained a medical history
and performed a chart review. The study physician conducted
a physical examination. Urinary drug screening was per-
formed. Participants were contacted by telephone on three
occasions during the first five days of the screening phase to
calculate a baseline average pain score. A psychological eval-
uation was conducted by a clinical psychologist.
On the first day of each period, participants were followed
for three hours. Vital signs and ratings of pain, “high,” relax-
ation, stress, happiness and heart rate were recorded, and
blood was collected for tetrahydrocannabinol assays. On days
one and five of each study period, blood was collected for
hematologic and biochemical analyses. At the end of their first
visit, participants were given four labelled containers for urine
collection and 13 cannabis doses for the five days of treatment.
During the first five days of each period, participants were
contacted daily by telephone to administer questionnaires on
pain intensity, sleep, medication and adverse effects. Partici-
pants collected early morning urine samples daily. They
returned on day five to return the urine samples, to undergo
urinary and blood tests, and to complete questionnaires on
pain quality, mood, quality of life and assessments of
potency. At the end of the study, participants completed final
adverse event reports and potency assessments. Participants
were advised not to drive a vehicle or operate heavy machin-
ery while under the influence of the study drug.
Outcome measures
Outcome measures were selected following published recom-
mendations for clinical trials of chronic pain.18 Pain intensity
was measured using an 11-item numeric rating scale, with
“no pain” and “worst pain possible” as anchors. The numeric
rating scale was administered once daily for present, worst,
least and average pain intensity during the previous 24 hours.
As per protocol, the average pain intensity score over the five
days on study drug constituted the primary outcome. Acute
effects on pain intensity were measured using a 100-mm
visual analogue scale. Pain quality was assessed using the
McGill Pain Questionnaire.19 Sleep was assessed using the
Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire.20 The short-form Pro-
file of Mood States was used to examine mood effects.21
Quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D health outcome
instrument.22 The items “high,” “relaxed,” “stressed,” and
“happy” were measured using a 100-mm visual analogue
scale (0 = not at all, 10 = extremely).23–25 Potency assessments
were conducted by asking participants on the fifth day of each
period to guess which potency they had received. At the end
of the trial, participants were asked to guess the order in
which they received the treatments. Standard assays for
plasma tetrahydrocannabinol assays were used (Appendix 1).
Statistical analysis
Our primary hypothesis was that smoked cannabis containing
9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol is superior to 0% tetrahydro-
cannabinol in reducing average pain intensity. The compari-
son of within-patient average weekly pain intensity when
assigned 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol cannabis compared with
placebo was the contrast of primary interest. A sample size of
32 patients was targeted assuming a within-patient difference

of 10 mm26 in the primary outcome between active and
placebo drug, on a 100 mm scale, with a standard deviation of
20 mm, and with 80% power and 5% significance.
A generalized linear model including drug, period and first-
order carryover effects was fitted. If the carryover effect or
period effect was not significant, then a reduced model was
refitted. Nine-five per cent confidence intervals were gener-
ated. Significance tests were performed at a 5% level. An
identical procedure to that described above for the primary
outcome was performed to assess the secondary outcomes,
including the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Leeds Sleep
Evaluation Questionnaire, the Profile of Mood States, and EQ-
5D. Statistical procedures for day one assessments and EQ-5D
analyses are shown in Appendix 1. Data from all randomized
participants were included in all safety and efficacy analyses.
All reported adverse events were classified according to
severity, seriousness and relationship to the study drug. An
independent data-monitoring committee monitored the safety-
related aspects of the trial.
Regulatory considerations
In conducting the study, we followed the Good Clinical Prac-
tice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisa-
tion of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharma-
ceuticals for Human Use.27 The trial was registered with the
International Standard for Randomised Controlled Trials Reg-
ister (ISRCTN683140063).
Results
Participants
We screened 116 potential participants over a 30-month
period (August 2003 to January 2006), of whom 93 were inel-
igible. Twenty-three participants underwent random assign-
ment to treatment, of whom 21 completed all four cycles.
Two participants withdrew within the first five days of the
study; one (who was receiving placebo at the time) withdrew
because of a positive result on urinary screening for cannabi-
noid and the other (who was receiving 6% tetrahydrocannabi-
nol at the time) because of increased pain (Figure 1). Demo-
graphic and baseline pain characteristics of participants are
shown in Table 1.
Primary outcome
We found no evidence of significant carryover or period
effects for any outcome. The average daily pain intensity was
significantly lower on 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol cannabis
(5.4) than on 0% tetrahydrocannabinol (6.1) (p = 0.023; differ-
ence = 0.7, 95% CI 0.02–1.4). All pairwise differences
between groups are shown with 95% CIs in Table 2. The aver-
age daily pain scores for each level of tetrahydrocannabinol,
along with other secondary outcomes, are shown in Table 2.
Secondary outcomes
There was a trend toward improvement in all outcomes with
increasing tetrahydrocannabinol content (Table 3). Partici-
pants using 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol cannabis reported sig-
nificantly more drowsiness and reported getting to sleep more
easily, faster and with fewer periods of wakefulness com-
pared with those using placebo (p < 0.05). Anxiety and
depression were improved in the 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol

group compared with placebo on the EQ-5D subscale
(p < 0.05). No significant differences were noted on the Pro-
file of Mood States. No difference in the “high,” “happy,”
“relaxed” or “stressed” scores on the visual analogue scale
were observed between tetrahydrocannabinol potencies.
A total of 248 mild and six moderate adverse events (fall,2
increased pain,1 numbness,1 drowsiness1 and pneumonia1) were
reported during the trial (Table 4). No serious or unexpected
adverse events were reported. The total number of adverse
events and the number of participants reporting at least one
adverse event increased with tetrahydrocannabinol potency.
The most frequent drug-related adverse events reported in the
group receiving 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol were headache,
dry eyes, burning sensation, dizziness, numbness and cough.
Feeling “high” and euphoria were reported once in each of the
2.5%, 6% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol periods. No signifi-
cant changes in vital signs, heart-rate variability, hematologi-
cal, biochemistry or renal function blood tests were detected.
On day five of the first cycle, 1 of 5 participants (20%)
assigned to placebo correctly identified this assignment, while 9
of the 16 participants (56%) who received placebo during later
cycles did so. Of the 5 participants administered 9.4% tetrahy-
drocannabinol in their first cycle, none correctly identified this
assignment, while 10 of 16 patients (63%) did so during later
cycles. At the end of the trial, 16 (76%) of the participants were
able to correctly identify the 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol period
and 13 (62%) were able to identify the 0% tetrahydrocannabinol
period, whereas the 6% tetrahydrocannabinol period was identi-
fied by 8 participants (38%) and the 2.5% period by 7 (33%).
Compliance with the study was excellent, and all dis-
pensed capsules were returned. With the exception of one
participant who withdrew from the study, there were no posi-
tive urine tetrahydrocannabinol tests during the 0% tetrahy-
drocannabinol period or on any day one before exposure
(Appendix 1).
Plasma tetrahydrocannabinol assays revealed dose–response
pharmacokinetics (Figure 2) and confirmed that participants
did not use cannabis during placebo phases (Appendix 1).
Pharmacy dispensing was satisfactory. No legal issues
arose during the study and there were no reports or allega-
tions of diversion of the study drug.
Discussion
We found that 25 mg herbal cannabis with 9.4% tetrahydro-
cannabinol, administered as a single smoked inhalation three

times daily for five days, significantly reduced average pain
intensity compared with a 0% tetrahydrocannabinol cannabis
placebo in adult participants with chronic post-traumatic or
postsurgical neuropathic pain. We found significant improve-
ments in measures of sleep quality and anxiety. We have
shown the feasibility of a single-dose delivery method for
smoked cannabis, and that blinding participants to treatment
allocation is possible using this method.
The mean reduction in pain (0.7) from 6.1 to 5.4
on a 10-cm scale that we detected in this study is
modest when compared with that from other drugs
for chronic neuropathic pain, such as gabapentin
(1.2) and pregabalin (1.3).28,29 However, our study
involved participants with refractory pain for which
conventional therapies had failed, and this charac-
teristic may have limited the potential for findings
of a larger pain reduction.
The effects of cannabinoids on sleep are recog-
nized.7,9 The consistent trend toward improvement
in all other outcomes for 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol
compared with placebo in our trial suggests that the
reported effects on pain, mood and sleep may have
been part of an overall improvement in many
aspects of patients’ conditions.
Limitations and strengths
There were several limitations to this trial. The
number of participants recruited was smaller than
planned, owing to delays in obtaining licences,
approvals and the study drug, and to restrictive cri-
teria for eligibility. Most of our participants had
prior experience with cannabis, which had been an early
ethics requirement; none was using cannabis at the time of
enrolment and they were not “experienced” users, so that the
lessons learned would be applicable to naive users of medical
cannabis. The use of small, fixed doses with a short trial dura-
tion may have reduced the effect size. We used a low dose to
minimize exposure to smoke and to reduce psychoactive
effects. Previous work has shown that a single dose of 0.4
mg/kg can be inhaled in a single lungful from a pipe,24,30
which for a 70-kg person approximates to 25 mg per dose.
The frequency of dosing was based on a duration of action of
inhaled tetrahydrocannabinol of two to three hours31 and was
administered three times daily. We used a fixed dosing sched-
ule because the study was too short to allow dose titration and
we wanted the tetrahydrocannabinol potency to be the only
difference between cycles. Finally, the highest tetrahydro-
cannabinol-content cannabis (9.4%) legally available at the
time of the study was used. Additional studies with higher
potencies and flexible dosing strategies are needed to explore
dose–response effects.
With respect to our analysis, we are aware of issues sur-
rounding the use of early tests for carryover effects. However,
examination of pain scores during the washout period showed
that the washout was adequate (data not shown), and there-
fore we believe our approach was appropriate.
Our trial had several important strengths, including a cred-
ible placebo, good compliance and good safety reporting.
Finding a suitable placebo for smoked cannabis is not a trivial
issue. During protocol reviews, it was stated that participants
smoking cannabis would immediately know, based on the
acute psychoactive effects, whether they had received active
drug; however, our results do not support this view. Instead,
our data suggest that short-term placebo-controlled trials of
smoked cannabis are feasible.
The safety of smoked cannabis is a concern for patients and

physicians, and we made a concerted effort to collect data on
adverse events and describe short-term physiologic effects.
The frequency of adverse events increased with tetrahydro-
cannabinol potency. Psychoactive effects did not result in par-
ticipants withdrawing from the study. Euphoria or “high” was
reported on only three occasions throughout the trial. There
was no evidence of euphoria during the three hours following
the first dose of each cycle regardless of tetrahydrocannabinol
potency, possibly because plasma levels (mean 45 ng/mL) did
not reach levels found with recreational users (> 100 ng/mL).31
Conclusion
Our results support the claim that smoked cannabis reduces
pain, improves mood and helps sleep. We believe that our
trial provides a methodological approach that may be consid-
ered for further research. Clinical studies using inhaled deliv-
ery systems, such as vaporizers,32,33 are needed.
