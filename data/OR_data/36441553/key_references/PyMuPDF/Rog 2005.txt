Randomized, controlled trial of cannabis-
based medicine in central pain in
multiple sclerosis

Abstract—Background: Central pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) is common and often refractory to treatment. Methods:
We conducted a single-center, 5-week (1-week run-in, 4-week treatment), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group trial in 66 patients with MS and central pain states (59 dysesthetic, seven painful spasms) of a whole-plant
cannabis-based medicine (CBM), containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol (THC:CBD) delivered via an oromu-
cosal spray, as adjunctive analgesic treatment. Each spray delivered 2.7 mg of THC and 2.5 of CBD, and patients could
gradually self-titrate to a maximum of 48 sprays in 24 hours. Results: Sixty-four patients (97%) completed the trial, 34
received CBM. In week 4, the mean number of daily sprays taken of CBM (n  32) was 9.6 (range 2 to 25, SD  6.0) and
of placebo (n  31) was 19.1 (range 1 to 47, SD  12.9). Pain and sleep disturbance were recorded daily on an 11-point
numerical rating scale. CBM was superior to placebo in reducing the mean intensity of pain (CBM mean change 2.7, 95%
CI: 3.4 to 2.0, placebo –1.4 95% CI: 2.0 to 0.8, comparison between groups, p  0.005) and sleep disturbance (CBM
mean change –2.5, 95% CI: 3.4 to 1.7, placebo –0.8, 95% CI: 1.5 to 0.1, comparison between groups, p  0.003).
CBM was generally well tolerated, although more patients on CBM than placebo reported dizziness, dry mouth, and
somnolence. Cognitive side effects were limited to long-term memory storage. Conclusions: Cannabis-based medicine is
effective in reducing pain and sleep disturbance in patients with multiple sclerosis related central neuropathic pain and is
mostly well tolerated.

Central pain, i.e., pain initiated or caused by a pri-
mary lesion or dysfunction of the CNS,1 is estimated
to occur in between 17% and 52% of people with
multiple sclerosis (MS).2 As many as 32% of patients
with MS regard pain among their most severe symp-
toms,3 confirming it as a “frequent, disabling and
inadequately managed symptom.”4 The most com-
mon form of central pain in MS is nonparoxysmal
extremity pain, which shows large interindividual
variation and may manifest with several, typically
dysesthetic, qualities such as burning, aching, prick-
ing, stabbing, or squeezing.2 Painful extremity
spasms have also been classed as central pain.5
In the past decade, cannabinoids and the endocan-
nabinoid system have come under intense scrutiny
following the discovery of CB1 and CB2 receptors
and development of specific cannabinoid receptor ag-
onist and antagonist ligands.6 The rationale for per-
forming a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of
cannabis-based medicine (CBM) in MS-related neu-
ropathic pain is based on encouraging results using
cannabinoid receptor agonists in relieving symptoms
of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis7 and pre-
liminary studies demonstrating modest positive ef-
fects
of
a
synthetic
cannabinoid
analogue
on
neuropathic pain of mixed etiologies and of whole
plant–derived CBM on neurogenic symptoms, in-
cluding pain, in patients with MS.8,9 A systematic
review of trials of cannabinoids in pain management
concluded that cannabinoids may relieve neuro-
pathic pain, but some authors have questioned the
appropriateness of trials of cannabinoids using oral

of their long half-lives.10,11
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of
oromucosal CBM in central pain associated with MS.
CBM is derived from cannabis plant chemovars, de-
veloped to produce high and reproducible yields of
specified cannabinoids and formulated to produce a
CBM. Oromucosal administration is efficient and
convenient in achieving accurate self-titration to
overcome the wide variability of interindividual re-
sponse known to occur with cannabis and cannabi-
noids. The study preparation contained a mixture of
two principal ingredients of cannabis (delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and cannabidiol [CBD])
in approximately a 1:1 ratio, with small amounts
(10%) of other cannabis-based compounds, deliv-
ered via an oromucosal spray. We sought to compare
the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CBM THC:
CBD with placebo in relieving central neuropathic
pain in patients with MS.
Methods.
Adult patients with central neuropathic pain syn-
dromes due to MS were invited to participate in this 5-week,
four-visit, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study conducted at the Walton Centre Clinical Trials Unit,
Liverpool, U.K. Patients were identified predominantly from a
previous study validating the Neuropathic Pain Scale12 (NPS) in
MS central pain13 and also from the regional MS clinic or by
specialist referral. After written informed consent, eligible pa-
tients with MS diagnosed at least 6 months previously (Poser
criteria14) were included. Central pain for which a nociceptive
cause appeared unlikely was required to be of at least 3 months’
duration and expected to remain otherwise stable during the
study. As there is no gold standard for central pain, the diagnosis
was made based on pain description and clinical examination that
had to be compatible with a central mechanism and by exclusion.2
Patients with dysesthetic pain perceived as an unpleasant abnor-
mal sensation spontaneously occurring or evoked and often de-
scribed using terms such as burning, aching, pricking, stabbing,
and squeezing,2 which is the most common form of chronic neuro-
pathic pain associated with MS, were included as were those with
painful tonic spasms. Those with chronic visceral pain, headache,
spasticity-associated aching pain, secondary entrapment syn-
dromes, or acute MS-related pains, e.g., optic neuritis or positive
Lhermitte sign alone, were not included. Patients with dysesthetic
pain described it predominantly in their legs and feet. Patients
were excluded if their sensations were not subjectively deemed
painful or if they had spasticity or painless spasms alone or an-
other noncentral pain mechanism was considered more likely, e.g.,
musculoskeletal pain from postural changes or peripheral neuro-
pathic pain from nerve entrapment. Patients taking amitriptyline
or other tricyclic antidepressants were required to reduce to or
maintain a maximum dose of 75 mg/day. A stable neuropathic
pain medication regimen was maintained during the 2 weeks im-
mediately before screening and throughout the study. Changes in
medications or procedures expected to affect central MS pain were
prohibited.
No cannabinoid use (cannabis, Marinol, or Nabilone) at least 7
days before screening or during the study was permitted. Patients
consented to their details being notified to the British Home Office
and agreed not to travel outside the United Kingdom or donate
blood during the study.
Patients were ineligible if they had a history of major psychiat-
ric disorder other than depression associated with their underly-
ing condition; severe concomitant illness, seizures, history or
suspicion of substance abuse; concomitant severe nonneuropathic
pain or the presence of illness such as diabetes mellitus that could
cause peripheral neuropathic pain; or scheduled procedures re-
quiring general anesthesia during the study. Patients were also
excluded if they were pregnant, lactating, taking levodopa therapy
within 7 days of study entry or had known or suspected hypersen-
sitivity to cannabinoids.
The Local Research Ethics Committee approved the study and
stipulated that patients should not drive during the study. Partic-
ipants underwent assessment including calculation of Expanded
Disability Status Scale15 (EDSS) score. Patients localized their
pains using a body map. A pain history and bedside examination
was undertaken to establish whether the pain or pains were likely
to be of central origin, based on their location, quality or qualities,
and associated sensory abnormalities such as hypoesthesia, allo-
dynia, and hyperpathia. The patients’ most troublesome central
neuropathic pain was thus identified, and they then estimated at
what time of day this was expected to be at its maximum severity.
An 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS-11) (in which 0  no
pain and 10  worst possible pain) was completed daily for the
identified pain at the identified time for the 7- to 10-day baseline
screening period and throughout the study. A daily NRS-11 scale
recording sleep disturbance due to neuropathic pain rating (in
which 0  did not disrupt sleep and 10  completely disrupts unable
to sleep due to pain) was also completed. The NPS was completed at
the same time as the pain NRS-11 for three consecutive days in both
the run-in week and the final week of treatment.
The following items were examined before first dosing and at
study completion or withdrawal: cognitive function (Brief Repeat-
able Battery of Neuropsychological Tests16), mood (Hospital Anxi-
ety and Depression Scale17 [HADS]), and MS-related disability
(Guy’s Neurological Disability Scale18). At the end of the study, a
Patient’s Global Impression of Change19 (PGIC), a 7-point rating
scale of a patient’s overall change in status since commencing
study medication, was applied.
Patients were randomized using a predetermined randomiza-
tion code drawn up by a statistician who remained unknown to
study personnel throughout the duration of the trial. Treatment
allocation was made using randomized permuted blocks of four
(two active drug, two placebo), with treatments sequentially as-
signed to either a whole-plant CBM (CBM  GW 1000-02, Sa-
tivex) containing THC:CBD delivered via oromucosal spray or
placebo. Each spray delivered 2.7 mg of THC and 2.5 mg of CBD
or placebo. Placebo was designed to match the appearance, smell,
and taste of the active formulation but contained no active compo-
nents, in ethanol:propylene glycol (50:50) excipient. To facilitate
blinding, patients completed pain and sleep assessments at home,
the physician examined patients, gave dosing advice, and assessed
them for adverse events (AEs); trials nurses completed all other
secondary outcome assessments; and a trials pharmacist dis-
pensed the study medication. The identity of study medication
assigned to patients, to which all study personnel remained
blinded, was contained in individually sealed envelopes retained
in the hospital 24-hour pharmacy and with the sponsor’s Pharma-
covigilance Department.
Sample size calculation.
No large-scale, RCTs of MS central
pain treatments existed to provide data for power calculations.
From peripheral neuropathic pain studies of gabapentin,19,20 the
SD for the change from baseline in the NRS-11 pain score was 2.1.
For a difference of 1.75 on the NRS between the two treatment
groups and a significance level of 5% (two sided), a sample size of
54 patients ensures a power of 85% in a balanced design. Assum-
ing withdrawals or serious protocol violations of around 15%, ap-
proximately 64 patients were to be randomized (32 patients in
each treatment group).
Study timetable and dosing.
On the first day of treatment, up
to four sprays were delivered in 2 hours and any signs of intoxica-
tion observed over 4 hours by the investigator and recorded by the
patient on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) (0  no intoxi-
cation and 100  extreme intoxication). If the patient scored 25
mm on a predose VAS or the investigator had concerns, a dose
could be omitted. Patients who satisfactorily completed initial dos-
ing were given written instructions to begin home dose titration
the following day. No specific target dose was set, and the patients
were advised to increase the number of sprays stepwise on consec-
utive days up to 48 sprays (THC 129.6 mg:CBD 120 mg) in 24
hours. For safety reasons, the patients were advised to take no
more than eight sprays (THC 21.6 mg:CBD 20 mg) within any
3-hour interval and refrain from up-titrating the daily dose by
more than 50% from the previous day. If intoxication was experi-
enced, patients were advised to reduce or omit a dose. If a maxi-

mum tolerated dose was thus established, it was only exceeded
with caution.
During telephone follow-up, patients were advised to optimize
dosing when suboptimal benefit had been achieved. Those pa-
tients who satisfactorily completed the trial were offered the op-
portunity to participate in an open-label extension study, which
will be reported separately.
Data analysis.
The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was
used for all efficacy analyses and was defined as all patients who
entered the study, were randomized, received at least one dose of
study medication, and had on-treatment efficacy data. For all
efficacy scores including pain NRS-11 as the primary endpoint,
the change in scores from baseline to end of treatment (completion
or withdrawal) was compared between treatment groups using
analysis of covariance with the baseline score as covariate. For the
NRS-11 scales, the mean score of the 7 days before the first dose
was given served as baseline and the mean score of the last 7 (3 in
the event of withdrawal) days before the final intake of test med-
ication was used as final score. For the NPS, the average of the
three replications in the run-in week served as the baseline score
and in the final week of treatment as the final score. The PGIC
was analyzed by comparing the proportions of patients rating
themselves as “much” or “very much improved” using Fisher’s
exact test. Additionally, the PGIC in the two treatment groups
were compared using the cumulative logit model with treatment
group as the only independent variable. The heart rates during
the first dosing were modeled by a linear mixed model with fixed
effects for treatment group means and slopes and individual pa-
tient random effects for means and slopes. For all binary variables
apart from the dichotomized PGIC, we used 2 tests. All CIs for
proportions or differences of proportions are approximate CIs. No
adjustments for multiple testing were carried out. All analyses
were performed using SAS version 8.2.
Results.
Study population.
Recruitment from the re-
gional MS clinic and referrals from consultant neurologists
and pain specialists took place between March and July
2002, and patients attended the Trials Unit on four occa-
sions over 5 weeks. Eighty-five patients were screened, of
whom 66 were randomized (fig 1), 34 to CBM and 32 to
placebo; 64 patients (96.9%) completed the study. Two
women patients withdrew, both on CBM. One developed
an AE of agitation with tachycardia and hypertension after
four sprays, which settled with conservative management
within 3 hours. She declined further study medication and
withdrew 7 days later without completing further scores.
The second patient developed paranoid ideation and was
withdrawn from study medication at the investigator’s dis-
cretion in the second treatment week but subsequently
completed all study diaries and assessments. Two patients
violated the protocol, one patient’s concomitant pain medi-
cation changed in the run in period, and another patient
commenced interferon treatment 3 days after commencing
the study. Both patients were in the active treatment
group and were included in the ITT analysis.
Of the 66 patients randomized, nine had primary pro-
gressive, 33 secondary progressive, 23 relapsing remitting
and one benign MS. The treatment groups were well bal-
anced in terms of gender, age, duration of MS since diag-
nosis, and baseline NRS-11 pain score (table 1). At
baseline, the NPS items Intense, Unpleasant, and Deep
were experienced by more than 80% of patients with mean
severities of greater than four of ten. Conversely, less than
25% of patients experienced Cold and Itchy components
with a similar magnitude and about 45% of patients did
not experience these pain qualities at all.
Forty-three patients (65%) required support to walk or
were wheelchair bound. Patients were taking a mean of
about two other medications for pain, spasms, or spastic-
ity. Forty-seven percent of patients had previous experi-
ence
of
using
cannabis
medicinally
and
16.7%
recreationally. Only four patients randomized to CBM and
eight to placebo had taken cannabis within 3 months of
study entry. The proportion of patients with any previous
exposure to cannabis was not different between CBM and
placebo (CBM 15/34, placebo 21/32; CBM-placebo 0.22,
95% CI: 0.45 to 0.02, p  0.08). The mean number of
daily sprays taken in week 4 was 9.6 of CBM (n  32)
(range 2 to 25, SD  6.1), equivalent to 25.9 mg THC:24
mg CBD and 19.1 of placebo (n  31) (range 1 to 47, SD 
12.9) (CBM-placebo –9.5, 95% CI: 14.6 to 4.4, p 
0.0004).
Efficacy measures.
NRS-11 and NPS total pain scores.
Significant mean reductions favoring CBM were found for
the primary outcome NRS-11 of pain and the secondary
outcome NPS (table 2 and figures 2 and 3). Of the total 65
patients included in the ITT analysis, 59 (89%) had dyses-
thetic pain and seven (11%) had painful spasms. Post hoc
analysis demonstrated that the seven patients with pain-
ful spasms had higher baseline NRS-11 pain intensities
than the patients with dysesthetic pain (dysesthetic pain
6.3 [SE  1.6]; painful spasms 7.3 [SE  1.5]; difference in
means  1.3, 95% CI: 0.1 to 2.6, p  0.04) and that the
changes from baseline to week 4 tended to be greater in

patients with painful spasms. In the patients with dyses-
thetic pain, the mean changes were 2.4 (SD  1.5, n 
30) for CBM and 1.3 (SD  1.7, n  28) for placebo,
whereas these changes were 5.7 (SD  3.5, n  3) and
2.1 (SD  1.6, n  4) in the patients with spasm. In an
analysis including only the patients with dysesthetic pain,
the NRS-11 pain treatment effect was 1.1 (SE  0.4, p 
0.012). An interaction between treatment and type of pain
was not found on a 5% level (p  0.07).
Post hoc analysis of individual NPS items demonstrated
treatment effects for all 10 items in favor of CBM that
reach significance for Intense (treatment effect estimate
–1.31, 95% CI: 2.21 to 0.40, p  0.0054), Dull (treat-
ment effect estimate –1.04, 95% CI: 2.05 to 0.03, p 
0.0433) and Sensitive (treatment effect estimate –1.01,
95% CI: 2.02 to 0.01, p  0.0484).
Pain-related sleep disturbance.
The reductions in pain
were reflected in similar reductions in mean daily pain-
related sleep disturbance with a mean treatment differ-
ence favoring CBM (table 2, figure 4).
PGIC.
The proportion of patients rating themselves as
“much” or “very much improved” in the CBM group (9/
34) was not greater than those receiving placebo (4/32)
(treatment difference 14% points, 95% CI: 4.8 to 32.7,
p  0.218). No patient felt “much worse” or “very much
worse” (see table E-1 on the Neurology Web site at www.
neurology.org). On the 7-point PGIC, those treated with
CBM were 3.9 times more likely to rate themselves in any

improved category than those receiving placebo (95% CI:
1.51 to 10.09, p  0.005).
AEs.
Thirty patients (88.2%) on CBM developed at
least one AE, compared with 22 patients (68.8%) on pla-
cebo (CBM-placebo 0.19, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.39, p  0.053).
Common AEs are summarized in table 3; in addition, con-
fusion, crying, low mood, disorientation, paranoia, halluci-
nation, and logorrhea all occurred once in the CBM group.
Fifty-three percent of the patients in the CBM group expe-
rienced dizziness at least once compared to 16% in the
placebo group (CBM-placebo 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.58,
p  0.002). Some of the psychiatric AEs occurred in the same
patient. No serious AEs, i.e., fatal, life-threatening, or result-
ing in persistent or major disability/incapacity or prolonging
hospitalization, occurred. However, two women patients in
the CBM arm experienced AEs severe enough to warrant
trial withdrawal (see “Study Population” section).
No significant changes were seen in either group in
blood pressure, weight, temperature, hematology, or blood
chemistry. During the first dosing, there was an increase
in mean heart rate in 1 hour in the cannabis-based medi-
cine group by 3.2 beats per minute (95% CI: 2.3 to 4.1)
compared with a mean of 1.6 beats per minute (95% CI: 0.8
to 2.5) in the placebo group, p  0.016.
Neuropsychological outcomes.
No significant differ-
ences between mean changes on each treatment were
found in the 10/36 Spatial Recall Test, Symbol Digit Mo-
dalities Test, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, or Word
Generation List between treatment groups on neuropsy-
chological testing. In the long-term component of the Selec-
tive Reminding Test (SRT), a difference was found because
of a mean improvement in the placebo group (n  32) of
5.7 (95% CI: 19 to 26) not matched in the CBM group
(n  33) of –0.9 (95% CI: 20 to 23) mean treatment
difference 6.95 (95% CI: 12.12 to 1.77), p  0.009 (see
table E-2).
Other secondary outcomes.
No differences between
mean changes on each treatment were found between
treatment groups in the other secondary measures of
HADS anxiety and depression and Guy’s Neurological Dis-
ability Scale (see table E-3).
Discussion.
This randomized, placebo-controlled
trial demonstrates a beneficial effect of CBM both in
the relief of central pain associated with MS and
pain-related sleep disturbance. Although our study’s
inclusion criteria allowed for any type of MS-related

central pain of greater than 3 months’ duration, the
predominance of dysesthetic extremity pain in this
study (59 patients [89%]) is in agreement with previ-
ous series.2,5 The definition of and conditions encom-
passing “neuropathic” pain remain controversial.22
No universally accepted validated clinical diagnostic
criteria for neuropathic pain exist,22 and assessment
of patients based on clinical examination and bed-
side tests to decide what is and what is not neuro-
pathic is difficult, even for experts.23
Some authors view spasm-related pain in MS as
being neuropathic,5 whereas others do not.21 A cross-
over trial of dronabinol in MS central pain specifi-
cally excluded patients with spasm-related pain.21
Painful spasms in MS feature sudden-onset, either
unilateral or bilateral, dystonic posturing with a ste-
reotyped pattern in the same patient. They are
thought to be caused by “a transversely spreading
ephaptic activation of axons within a partially demy-
elinated lesion.”24,25 No study to date has linked pain-
ful spasms to dysfunction in either the motor or
somatosensory system exclusively, and whether
there is any advantage in separating the two for
therapeutic purposes is uncertain. Although patients
with MS and painful spasm must have a CNS lesion,
the key question is whether the pain is generated
primarily in the spasmodic muscles or the CNS. In
this study, patients with painful spasms responded
similarly to those with predominantly dysesthetic
pain, suggesting that dichotomizing patients based
on putative differences in central mechanisms of the
two groups may be superfluous.
Patients in our study were taking, on average, two
other medications, with limited efficacy given base-
line NRS-11 pain scores of 6.5. Therefore, as adjunc-
tive analgesic treatment, CBM had a significant
treatment effect of 1.25, in the NRS-11, in excess of
the 0.6 achieved by oral dronabinol in an MS study
in which concomitant analgesia was restricted to
paracetamol21 and comparable to treatment effects of
approximately 0.9 and 1.25 to 1.45 in RCTs of pe-
ripheral neuropathic pain using tramadol and pre-
gabalin.26,27 The treatment difference for the NRS-11
did not reach that for which the study was powered,
although this calculation was based on peripheral
neuropathic pain studies.19,20 A meta-analysis of
more than 2,700 patients with various painful condi-
tions suggested approximately a 30% or 2-point
NRS-11 score reduction in pain as being clinically
significant28 but notably did not include patients
with central neuropathic pain, in which “relatively
small decreases in pain intensity are often highly
valued by the patients.”2

In our study, the numbers needed to treat29 to
achieve a 50% reduction in central pain in at least
one patient was 3.7 (95% CI: 2.2 to 13.0), similar to
that obtained in the dronabinol trial of 3.5 (95% CI:
1.9 to 24.8).21 Numbers needed to harm29 (NNH) is
calculated as 1/risk difference, and for the probabili-
ties of at least one AE, this is 1/0.19  5.13. Specifi-
cally, for CBM to cause dizziness, the NNH was
1/0.37  2.68. Current options for treating central
pain conditions remain limited and are based mostly
on the use of CNS drugs with known problems of
tolerability.30,31 CBM was well tolerated overall, de-
spite a population including 25 of 34 patients (73.5%)
in the treatment group requiring some walking aid
and eight (24%) being wheelchair bound.
A systematic review identified that, until 2001,
RCTs of cannabinoids were largely confined to
single-dose trials.10 In this trial, patients could ti-
trate to a maximum of THC 130 mg:CBD 120 mg.
The mean dose achieved of 25.9 mg THC, and partic-
ularly 24 mg CBD, is in excess of that used in other
cannabinoid RCTs.21,32,33 CBD is thought to modulate
the effects of THC and also to have analgesic proper-
ties of its own. These factors may contribute to the
positive outcomes in this trial. To place these reduc-
tions in patient’s pain in context, a quality-of-life
instrument would have been beneficial, however,
with a relatively short 3-week fixed treatment pe-
riod. This was omitted from our study; however, an
odds ratio of 3.9 favoring an improved global impres-
sion of change with CBM, without a corresponding
significant change in mood, suggests that patients
felt a benefit from reduction in pain, sleep improve-
ment, or both and contrasts with a previous RCT
using orally administered THC and whole-plant can-
nabis extract, which significantly reduced PGIC.32
The Cannabinoids in Multiple Sclerosis (CAMS) trial
using orally administered cannabinoid capsule for-
mulations identified no objective change in Ashworth
scores but did note subjective improvements in pain
and sleep, which concurs with our results, as well as
in spasms and spasticity.33
In our study, the NPS 10-item total responsive-
ness also shows a significant treatment difference
favoring CBM of 6.58 on a 100-point scale, demon-
strating convergence with the traditionally accepted
NRS-11 outcome. Post hoc analysis demonstrated
significant treatment effects favoring CBM in the
Intense, Dull, and Sensitive NPS items, suggesting
that further studies should examine whether more
sophisticated methods of analyzing the NPS are
required.
Although unusual in neuropathic pain trials, some
RCTs involving cannabinoids have included a ques-
tion to formally assess the degree of blinding and
demonstrated an element of unblinding in patients
receiving cannabinoids.32,33 Our study did not include
a blinding question. However, despite a number of
our patients having previous exposure to cannabis,
our placebo group experienced both a large reduction
in pain and number of AEs, suggesting a degree of
blinding was preserved.
CBM does not appear to have significant effects on
MS-related disability, mood, or on four of the five
neuropsychological outcomes measured. No correc-
tions for multiple comparisons were applied to sec-
ondary outcomes. The significant treatment effect-
favoring placebo in the long-term storage component
of the SRT, perhaps reflects a learning effect not
matched in the CBM group. Analyses of the consis-
tent long-term retrieval score and delayed recall at
11 minutes were not defined a priori for analysis in
our study. The neuropsychological outcomes of
chronic (10.2 to 24 years) recreational marijuana us-
ers and general population controls have been com-
pared.34 On the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test,
a significantly less steep learning curve and gener-
ally recall of fewer words were observed in long-term
(mean 24 years) users of cannabis than in short-term
(mean 10.2 years) users or controls. Long-term users
also recalled fewer words than short-term users or
controls. The preliminary results of the psychological
substudy of the CAMS trial found a significant re-
duction in the Californian Adult Verbal Learning
Test in those receiving cannabis extracts compared
with placebo.35 These results require further analysis
and incorporation of psychological outcomes in fu-
ture cannabinoid trials.
