Objectives: To determine whether plant-derived cannabis medicinal extracts
(CME) can alleviate neurogenic symptoms unresponsive to standard
treatment, and to quantify adverse effects.
Design: A consecutive series of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
single-patient cross-over trials with two-week treatment periods.
Setting: Patients attended as outpatients, but took the CME at home.
Subjects: Twenty-four patients with multiple sclerosis (18), spinal cord injury
(4), brachial plexus damage (1), and limb amputation due to neurobromatosis
(1).
Intervention: Whole-plant extracts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
cannabidiol (CBD), 1:1 CBD:THC, or matched placebo were self-administered
by sublingual spray at doses determined by titration against symptom relief or
unwanted effects within the range of 2.5–120 mg/24 hours.
Measures used: Patients recorded symptom, well-being and intoxication
scores on a daily basis using visual analogue scales. At the end of each
two-week period an observer rated severity and frequency of symptoms on
numerical rating scales, administered standard measures of disability (Barthel
Index), mood and cognition, and recorded adverse events.
Results: Pain relief associated with both THC and CBD was signicantly
superior to placebo. Impaired bladder control, muscle spasms and spasticity
were improved by CME in some patients with these symptoms. Three
patients had transient hypotension and intoxication with rapid initial dosing of
THC-containing CME.
Conclusions: Cannabis medicinal extracts can improve neurogenic symptoms
unresponsive to standard treatments. Unwanted effects are predictable and
generally well tolerated. Larger scale studies are warranted to conrm these
ndings.

This exploratory trial was designed as a pilot
for future large-scale cohort studies. It set out to
explore the practicalities of patient self-titration,
to identify a satisfactory pattern of dosing, to
establish whether neurogenic symptoms could be
alleviated by sublingual CME, and to identify
potential adverse effects. Its design was limited
by various legal considerations relating to the
medical use of CME within the UK at the time.
Methods
The sample was drawn from local neurological
rehabilitation 
outpatient 
clinics, 
individual
patients who had heard of the project locally, and
a database of patients who had contacted GW
Pharmaceuticals to register their interest in tak-
ing part in research. Eligible patients had to have
a neurological diagnosis and to be able to iden-
tify troublesome symptoms which were stable
and unresponsive to standard treatments. The
most predominant of these were neuropathic
pain, spasticity, muscle spasms, impaired bladder
control and tremor. Patients were excluded if
they had a history of: drug or alcohol abuse, seri-
ous psychiatric illness (excluding depression asso-
ciated with the neurological condition), serious
cardiovascular disease or active epilepsy. The
study was approved by the local research ethics
committee.
After giving full informed consent to partici-
pate, each patient was screened for suitability and
up to ve target symptoms identied. Those
patients taking other supplies of cannabis were
asked to stop for four weeks before entry, and
not to take any during the study. Assessments
were conducted at baseline and then at the end
of each two-week study period. The overall study
ow of patients is shown in Figure 1.
The following measures were used. Subjects
kept a daily diary in which they scored their tar-
get symptoms by means of visual analogue scales
(VAS) at the same time each day. They also used
VAS to provide a daily record of subjective
intoxication, alertness, appetite, happiness, relax-
ation, optimism, energy, general well-being, sleep
and feeling refreshed.
At each two-weekly assessment visit, the sub-
jects completed the Short Orientation-Memory-
Introduction
Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other
cannabinoids have been shown1 to ameliorate
both tremor and spasticity in a well-validated ani-
mal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). There are
many anecdotal reports2,3 that cannabis can
relieve some of the troublesome symptoms of MS
and spinal cord injury. Open or single-blind
observations in a small number of patients have
given some support to these reports.4–6 Two small
placebo-controlled studies7,8 indicated that THC
in doses between 5 and 10mg orally was signi-
cantly superior to placebo in relieving spasticity
with minimal adverse effects, and Martyn et al.9
reported that nabilone relieved muscle spasms
and nocturia better than placebo in a study of a
single case. Recent scientic reviews in the UK10
and the USA11
have renewed interest in
cannabis-derived medicines, but there are also
dissenting voices12 and studies suggesting cau-
tion.13 In this context, and given the legal and
social arguments 
that 
continue, 
systematic
research into the risks and benets that may be
associated with cannabis-derived medicines is
required.
Recently, standardized whole-plant cannabis
medicinal extracts (CME) have become available
for clinical research. This is important because
many components of the plant other than THC
may have therapeutic potential or synergistic
activity.14
These 
include 
nonpsychoactive
cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD), as well
as various terpenoids and avonoids. CBD is of
particular interest because of its potent antioxi-
dant and anti-inammatory properties, along
with the possibility that it may modulate
unwanted THC effects.14 Selective breeding, a
computer-controlled growing environment, and
rigorous analytic procedures during extraction
can be used to ensure the purity and stability of
these extracts.15
Choice of delivery system
remains critical to the successful clinical applica-
tion of CME. Smoking is inappropriate for a
pharmaceutical product, and bioavailability from
the gastrointestinal tract is unpredictable. The
sublingual route has been selected because it
lends itself to self-titration by the patient 
and provides a satisfactory pharmacokinetic 
prole.16

After the rst two-week period using open-
label known THC:CBD, the patient entered an
eight-week double-blind study phase with four
two-week stages using THC:CBD, or CBD alone,
or THC alone, or placebo. Randomization was
achieved using Williams’ squares, and vials for
each two-week period were allocated and coded
before despatch to the investigators. The patient
was then given a supply of vials to use over each
two-week period. Initially, for ethical reasons,
patients were allowed a supply of open-label
THC:CBD as ‘rescue’ medication during the
cross-over trial but were encouraged to use it as
sparingly as possible. Results from the subgroup
of patients who used zero or negligible amounts
of rescue medication were subjected to separate
statistical analysis.
At the end of the double-blind cross-over
study, patients were allowed to continue on
active medication as part of a long-term safety
and tolerability study if they chose to do so.
Since the rst week of each treatment period
was spent titrating up to optimal dosing patterns
and may have been compromised by carry-over
effects, daily VAS scores were averaged for days
8–14 in each period for comparison between peri-
ods. Data collected at each assessment point were
analysed in their entirety. Treatments during the
double-blind periods were compared using analy-
sis of variance with patient, period and treatment
as factors. Least square means for each treatment
and the difference in least square means between
each active treatment and placebo were calcu-
lated. In addition, comparisons were made
between baseline and placebo using paired 
t-tests. A two-sided signicance level of 5% was
used to determine statistical signicance. 
Results
Twenty-four patients were enrolled into the
study, and three of these withdrew during the
open label THC:CBD period. One could not get
benet without intoxication, one had a vasovagal
episode during rst clinic dosing, and one devel-
oped a sublingual burning sensation.
Data from
one other patient could not be included because,
owing to marked sensitivity to the psychoactive
effects of THC, she did not complete all treat-
Concentration (SOMC) test,17 the Barthel Activ-
ities of Daily Living Index,18 the Rivermead
Mobility Index,19 and the General Health Ques-
tionnaire 28.20 The following measures were
taken when applicable: Ashworth scale for spas-
ticity21; Nine Hole Peg Test of manual dexterity22;
10-metre timed walk; numerical rating scales of
fatigue, pain, spasticity, bladder urgency and uri-
nary incontinence, and frequency of muscle
spasms and nocturia.
The test articles were whole-plant extracts of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-rich CME),
cannabidiol (CBD-rich CME) and a 1:1 prepara-
tion of the two (THC:CBD). These were pre-
sented in a pump-action sublingual spray that
delivered 2.5 mg THC and/or CBD at each actu-
ation. The maximum permitted dose of each
CME was 120 mg / 24 hours. The placebo spray
contained inert plant material and solvent only.
All preparations incorporated a peppermint
avour to disguise the taste of CME. Patients
continued to take all previously prescribed med-
ication but were asked not to take any other
cannabis during the study.
Following a drug-free run-in period and base-
line assessments, the rst period of dosing was
with open label THC:CBD in order to familiar-
ize the subject with procedures and ensure they
could tolerate a CME. First dosing for each treat-
ment period took place in clinic under nursing
and medical supervision, and was followed by a
two-week period of home dosing. The initial
clinic regime permitted up to eight sprays (20 mg
of THC and/or CBD) to be administered over a
period of 70 minutes. This sometimes resulted in
marked intoxication, so from subject 8 onwards
the maximum clinic dose was reduced to four
sprays over 2 hours. Patient 14 became intoxi-
cated after four sprays, so for subsequent patients
initial dosing was further reduced to two sprays
over 2 hours. All patients were closely monitored
for 4 hours after the start of dosing.
On leaving the clinic patients were instructed
to increase their dose cautiously over the rst
week of each period, monitoring benet and
adverse effects, until an optimal dose was
obtained. The timing of each spray was recorded
in the daily diary. Research nurses main-
tained regular telephone contact to check on the
patient’s well-being and ability to use the spray.

ment periods. Half the sample reported having
used cannabis for medicinal purposes on at least
one occasion in the past, but none had done so
within the previous six months. Twenty patients
(10 males) completed the study, of whom 14 had
multiple sclerosis (MS), four had spinal cord
injury, one had a brachial plexus lesion and a
neuropathy, and one had an amputation with
pain in the phantom limb. Average age of the
sample was 48 years, and distribution of target
symptoms was as follows: pain = 13; muscle
spasms = 17; spasticity = 9; impaired bladder con-
trol = 11; tremor = 8. Twelve patients used zero
or negligible amounts of rescue medication. Data
were analysed for the whole sample, and sepa-
rately for the rescue-free group. This analysis
revealed a very similar pattern of responses to
outcome measures between the two groups.
Plasma samples conrmed that sublingual CME
were reliably absorbed.
In Tables 1–3, gures in bold indicate scores in
the randomized periods that are statistically dif-
ferent from placebo. Table 1 shows the mean
diary VAS scores for the whole sample. In com-
parison with placebo, CBD CME signicantly
improved pain, THC CME signicantly improved
pain, muscle spasm, spasticity and appetite, and
THC:CBD signicantly improved muscle spasm
and sleep. All three CME produced improve-
ments in other parameters in comparison with
placebo that did not reach statistical signicance.
Table 2 shows the results from the two-weekly
assessments in the whole sample. In comparison
with placebo all three CME produced signicant
improvements in ratings of spasticity, and both
THC CME and THC:CBD signicantly reduced
the frequency of muscle spasms. THC CME
reduced SOMC more than the other extracts.
Table 3 shows the doses of test article and res-
cue medication in each period for the whole sam-
ple and rescue-free subgroup, and self-ratings of
intoxication. Use of rescue medication did not
differ signicantly across treatment groups. Level
of intoxication was highest following THC CME.
In the rescue-free group, average daily intake of
sprays was 30% higher in the placebo period than
in the active periods.
Individual patients also reported benets with
other symptoms such as co-ordination, bladder
and bowel control, and visual acuity but these
were not studied systematically.

iting effect in several patients, and was the pri-
mary reason for withdrawal in three cases. How-
ever, with careful self-titration most patients
were able to achieve useful symptom relief at a
subintoxication dose. Soreness from the alcohol
solvent was noted in a few patients and caused
one to withdraw.
No patients were suspected of abusing CME,
and most used doses that were much less than the
periods took rescue medication (THC:CBD).
Four subjects reported soreness or numbness of
the mouth or throat.
Discussion
This preliminary study demonstrates that CME
can alleviate previously intractable neurologically
based symptoms, including pain, spasms and
spasticity in some patients. Intoxication seemed
to be primarily associated with THC CME but
even here was usually of tolerable intensity.
CBD CME appeared to have analgesic and
anti-spasticity properties in its own right. These
ndings, which require independent conrma-
tion, are potentially important because CBD is
nonpsychoactive and has a relatively benign
adverse event prole. 
Early experience with rapid initial dosing with
THC:CBD indicated the need for more gradual
introduction to CME. When over-dosing did take
place supportive measures were all that were
required. Patients disliked intoxication and
wished to avoid it, in contrast to recreational
users. During self-titration this was the dose-lim-
Clinical messages
 Cannabis medicinal extracts (CME) may
alleviate neurogenic spasticity, muscles
spasms and bladder dysfunction in some
patients.
 CME may also help reduce poor sleep and
poor appetite.
 Side-effects of sublingual cannabis medi-
cinal extracts included hypotension when
administered too quickly, and intoxication
occasionally.
 Further research on CME is warranted.

In conclusion, this preliminary investigation
suggests that sublingual CME may be an effec-
tive treatment for resistant symptoms associated
with neurological diseases including pain, muscle
spasms and spasticity, impaired bladder control,
reduced appetite and poor sleep. Larger scale
studies to conrm these ndings and further
explore the utility of CME are now required.

administered by family members or paid carers

The study had methodological limitations as a
consequence of the need to adopt a cautious
design, primarily to protect patients but also to
satisfy regulatory authorities. It was felt neces-
sary to demonstrate patients’ ability to tolerate a
cannabis derivative by exposing them to a two-
week period on open-label THC:CBD before
embarking on the double-blind study. Initially,
access to THC:CBD as ‘rescue medication’ dur-
ing the randomized crossover was allowed to
allay potential loss of benet when moving from
active to inactive medication. After experience
with 13 patients it was felt that rescue medication
was not required ethically or in practice. This
decision was endorsed by the research ethics
committee. However, although patients had prior
experience of active medication, they did not use
much rescue medication suggesting that they
were truly unaware of what drug was being given.
The patients were heterogeneous both in terms
of underlying diagnosis and in terms of the main
troublesome symptoms. A large number of mea-
sures were used, many of them visual analogue
scales or numerical rating scales. The analysis
involved a large number of statistical compar-
isons. Consequently it is possible that some sta-
tistically signicant results arose through chance.
However, the positive ndings are internally con-
sistent and in keeping with existing evidence
from basic science and anecdotal patient reports.
The emergent side-effect prole was consistent
with expectations for cannabis-based medicines.
A third potential area of concern is the great
variability in dose used. This obviously might
reduce the likelihood of detecting an effect, but
conversely it allows the patient to titrate to an
effective dose without side-effects. Dose titration
is common when using symptomatic treatments
such as this.
A nal area of concern is that patients may
have self-selected as being particularly responsive
to cannabis. The main purpose of this study was
to determine if there was any evidence of a ben-
ecial response, and so this was not of great con-
cern. However it should be noted that only half
had any previous experience of cannabis, and
also that most drug interventions probably only
