Abstract
We have evaluated the efﬁcacy of d-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (d-9-THC), the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, in postoperative
pain. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose trial, we investigated 40 women undergoing elective abdominal
hysterectomy. Randomization took place when postoperative patient-controlled analgesia was discontinued on the second postoperative day.
When patients requested further analgesia, they received a single, identical capsule of either oral d-9-THC 5 mg ðn ¼ 20Þ or placebo ðn ¼ 20Þ
in a double-blind fashion. The primary outcome measure was summed pain intensity difference (SPID) at 6 h after administration of study
medication derived from visual analogue pain scores on movement and at rest. Secondary outcome measures were time to rescue medication
and adverse effects of study medication. Mean (SD) VAS pain scores before medication in the placebo and d-9-THC groups were 6.3(2.6)
and 6.4(1.3) cm on movement, and 3.2(1.9) and 3.3(0.9) on rest, respectively. There were no signiﬁcant differences in mean (95% conﬁdence
interval of the difference) SPID at 6 h between the groups [placebo 7.9, d-9-THC 4.3(21.8 to 9.0) cm h on movement; placebo 8.8, d-9-THC
4.9(20.2 to 8.1) cm h at rest] and time to rescue analgesia [placebo 217, d-9-THC 163(222 to 130) min]. Increased awareness of
surroundings was reported more frequently in patients receiving d-9-THC (40 vs 5%, P ¼ 0:04). There were no other signiﬁcant differences
with respect to adverse events. This study demonstrates no evidence of an analgesic effect of orally administered d-9-THC 5 mg in
postoperative pain in humans.

1. Introduction
There is signiﬁcant evidence that cannabinoids have
antinociceptive properties in animals (Martin and Lichtman,
1998) and the role of cannabinoid receptors in the
modulation of pain has been described (Meng et al.,
1998). Anecdotal accounts of the beneﬁts of cannabinoids
in the treatment of pain in humans are reported frequently
(Hirst et al., 1998; Holdcroft et al., 1997; Ravenscroft et al.,
2000; Voth and Schwartz, 1997; Ware et al., 2003). For
example, in a population of 209 chronic non-cancer pain
patients attending a pain management unit in Canada,
15% conﬁrmed that they had used cannabis for pain relief
(Ware et al., 2003).
However, the evidence-base for the use of cannabinoids
for pain relief is yet to be established. A recent qualitative
systematic review described the paucity of good quality data
from controlled clinical trials in this area (Campbell et al.,
2001).
d-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (d-9-THC) is the main
psychoactive constituent of cannabis (Ashton, 1999; Hirst
et al., 1998; Kirk and De Wit, 1999) and is licensed in some
countries as an anti-emetic for chemotherapy and an
appetite stimulant in HIV (Voth and Schwartz, 1997). We
report the ﬁrst randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled study investigating the analgesic efﬁcacy of orally
administered d-9-THC in postoperative pain.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
With local Ethics Committee approval and written
informed patient consent, patients (American Society of
Anesthesiologists classiﬁcation I or II) scheduled for
elective total abdominal hysterectomy were recruited on
admission to the Leicester Royal Inﬁrmary and Leicester
General Hospital, UK. Patients with a history of drug or
alcohol abuse, previous cannabis use and past or present
psychiatric illness were excluded.
2.2. Design
General anesthesia was standardized. Induction was
with propofol 1–2 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg to
facilitate endotracheal intubation and positive pressure
ventilation. Anesthesia was maintained with isoﬂurane
(1–2 MAC) in a 50% nitrous oxide–oxygen mixture and
morphine 0.1–0.2 mg/kg. Patient-controlled analgesia
(PCA) using morphine (bolus dose 1 mg, lockout-time
5 min) was provided for the ﬁrst 24 postoperative hours in
all patients.
Randomization took place when PCA was discontinued
on the second postoperative day and the patient requested
further analgesia. Patients were randomized to receive a
single, identical capsule of either oral d-9-THC 5 mg or
placebo in a double-blind fashion. Identical capsules were
prepared by the hospital pharmacy in coded tablet bottles
using a randomization table. Patients were consented before
anesthesia but were not randomized and investigated if they
were unable to tolerate oral ﬂuids or were complaining of
nausea or vomiting.
2.3. Measures
Pain was recorded hourly for 6 h and then at 8 and
24 h using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) on
movement (sitting forward and coughing) and at rest. The
primary outcome measure of this study was the sum of the
pain intensity differences (SPID) on movement and at rest
over a 6-h period. A secondary outcome measure was
time to request for rescue analgesia (oral codeine 30 mg).
Patients were able to ask for this at any time during the
study.
At each time point and at 24 h after study medication,
patients were asked to volunteer the nature and severity of
any adverse events. They were then asked if they
experienced any of the following speciﬁc symptoms:
increased awareness of surroundings, drowsiness, dry
mouth, dizziness, confusion, blurred or double vision,
palpitations, sense of well-being, change of mood, slurred
speech, difﬁculty with memory, hallucinations, headache,
tremor and muscle twitching.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Data were tested for normality with the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test and compared using Student’s t-test,
MANOVA for repeated measures and Fisher’s-exact test,
as appropriate. For calculation of the SPID, if a patient
requested escape analgesia before the end of the 6-h study
period, subsequent pain intensity difference (PID) scores
were set to zero. This is a recognized technique for handling
such data (Curtis et al., 1999). We used two sets of data to
power the study. In a previous study performed in our
hospital investigating a similar group of patients receiving
morphine PCA after abdominal hysterectomy, the standard
deviation of VAS pain scores was 2.2 cm (Ali et al., 1998).
Taking a 2 cm reduction in VAS as clinically signiﬁcant, 20
patients were required in each group for a ¼ 0:05 and
b ¼ 0:2: Also, using data from a study (Curtis et al., 1999)
which utilized the same postoperative pain model (pain after
hysterectomy) to measure the efﬁcacy of oral analgesics, our
sample size would be able to detect a difference in mean PID
of 15 mm (a ¼ 0:05; b ¼ 0:2).
3. Results
3.1. Demographic variables
Fifty patients were consented for the study, 10 were not
randomized because they did not fulﬁll the inclusion criteria
at time of request for analgesia after PCA (four vaginal
hysterectomy, two laparoscopic assisted procedure, two
withdrawal of consent, one inability to tolerate oral ﬂuids,
one inadvertent administration of supplementary analgesia).
No patient withdrew from the study after randomization.
The groups were well matched for age, weight and pain
scores before administration of study medication (Table 1).
3.2. Pain measures
After study medication, there were no differences in
mean VAS pain scores (Table 2) or PID scores on
movement and at rest (Fig. 1). Data for 8 and 24 h are not
shown because the majority of patients received escape
analgesia by 8 h (85% placebo, 100% d-9-THC). There
were no differences in mean SPID at 6 h or time to rescue
analgesia (Table 3).

3.3. Side-effects
There was a signiﬁcant increase in the incidence of
increased awareness of surroundings in the d-9-THC group
(40 vs 5%, P , 0:05) but no differences in other adverse
events (Table 4).
4. Discussion
We have shown no signiﬁcant effect of oral d-9-THC
5 mg on accumulative VAS pain scores over 6 h in patients
with postoperative pain. The conﬁdence intervals of the
differences show that we are unlikely to have missed an
important clinically signiﬁcant analgesic effect of d-9-THC.
The limit of the 95% conﬁdence interval of the SPID on
movement over 6 h in favor of d-9-THC was 1.8 cm, an
average of 0.3 cm/h. Indeed, there was a non-signiﬁcant
tendency for less pain in the placebo group. Mean (SD) VAS
pain scores on movement before administration of study
medication (placebo 6.3(2.6) cm; d-9-THC 6.4(1.3) cm)
were sufﬁcient to ensure adequate sensitivity of the study.
In 1975, it was suggested that 10 mg of d-9-THC may
have analgesic effects in patients with advanced cancer but
the study was poorly controlled and relatively insensitive
(Noyes et al., 1975). At this dose, 70% of patients reported
sedation, 32% mental clouding, 29% ataxia and 29%
‘disconnected thought’. This high incidence of adverse
events and the fact that the recommended starting dose of
d-9-THC for appetite stimulation is 2.5 mg bd (Beal et al.,
1995), led us to choose a dose of 5 mg for our study. In a case
report of a patient with abdominal pain associated with
familial Mediterranean fever, a higher dose was used but
the patient was already obtaining pain relief by smoking

cannabis and was receiving regular morphine (Holdcroft
et al., 1997).
We did not measure blood concentrations of d-9-THC.
However, there is little reason to suspect that it was not
absorbed, as only patients who could tolerate oral ﬂuids and
those who were not suffering from nausea and/or vomiting
were recruited. Furthermore, studies of this design have
been able to show signiﬁcant analgesic effects of other drugs
administered orally under identical circumstances (Curtis
et al., 1999). After oral administration of d-9-THC, the onset
of action is usually within 0.5–1 h with a duration of effect
of 4–6 h. Therefore, our study period of 6 h should have
been able to detect any analgesic effect. A recognized
adverse effect of cannabinoids use is an increased awareness
of surroundings (Adams and Martin, 1996) and this was
reported by 40% of our patients who received d-9-THC
(placebo 5%).
In conclusion, we have shown that oral d-9-THC 5 mg
was ineffective for postoperative pain in the conditions of
our study. Further investigation of a larger dose or repeated
administration may be warranted, but this has been
associated with a high incidence of side-effects (Noyes
et al., 1975). Data on the effect of other cannabinoids for
postoperative pain are lacking.
