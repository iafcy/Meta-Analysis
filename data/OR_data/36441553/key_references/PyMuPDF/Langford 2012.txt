Abstract
Central neuropathic pain (CNP) occurs in many
multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The provision of adequate
pain relief to these patients can very difﬁcult. Here we
report the ﬁrst phase III placebo-controlled study of the
efﬁcacy of the endocannabinoid system modulator delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD) oromuco-
sal spray (USAN name, nabiximols; Sativex, GW Phar-
maceuticals, Salisbury,Wiltshire, UK), to alleviate CNP.
Patients who had failed to gain adequate analgesia from
existing medication were treated with THC/CBD spray or
placebo as an add-on treatment, in a double-blind manner,
for 14 weeks to investigate the efﬁcacy of the medication in
MS-induced neuropathic pain. This parallel-group phase of
the study was then followed by an 18-week randomized-
withdrawal study (14-week open-label treatment period
plus a double-blind 4-week randomized-withdrawal phase)
to investigate time to treatment failure and show mainte-
nance of efﬁcacy. A total of 339 patients were randomized
to phase A (167 received THC/CBD spray and 172 received
placebo). Of those who completed phase A, 58 entered the
randomized-withdrawal phase. The primary endpoint of
responder analysis at the 30 % level at week 14 of phase A
of the study was not met, with 50 % of patients on THC/
CBD spray classed as responders at the 30 % level com-
pared to 45 % of patients on placebo (p = 0.234). How-
ever, an interim analysis at week 10 showed a statistically
signiﬁcant treatment difference in favor of THC/CBD spray
at this time point (p = 0.046). During the randomized-
withdrawal phase, the primary endpoint of time to treatment
failure was statistically signiﬁcant in favor of THC/CBD
spray, with 57 % of patients receiving placebo failing
treatment versus 24 % of patients from the THC/CBD spray
group (p = 0.04). The mean change from baseline in Pain
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (p = 0.028) and sleep
quality NRS (p = 0.015) scores, both secondary endpoints
in phase B, were also statistically signiﬁcant compared to
placebo, with estimated treatment differences of -0.79 and
0.99 points, respectively, in favor of THC/CBD spray
treatment. The results of the current investigation were
equivocal, with conﬂicting ﬁndings in the two phases of the
study. While there were a large proportion of responders to
THC/CBD spray treatment during the phase A double-blind
period, the primary endpoint was not met due to a similarly
large number of placebo responders. In contrast, there was a
marked effect in phase B of the study, with an increased
Sativex, a THC/CBD oromucosal spray, does not have an INN.
Nabiximols is the US Adopted Name (USAN).

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive inﬂammatory
disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by
axonal demyelination. Thought to be autoimmune in ori-
gin, MS results in dysfunction of the CNS, causing a range
of symptoms including spasticity, spasms, fatigue, bladder
dysfunction and pain. With an estimated prevalence of
50–120 per 100,000, it is the most common cause of
neurological disability among young adults in the United
Kingdom (UK) [1, 2].
Central neuropathic pain (CNP) caused by a lesion or
dysfunction of the CNS is a common symptom of MS,
affecting between 17 and 52 % of MS patients [3–9]. This
type of pain can be difﬁcult to treat, with current treatment
regimens including tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids,
and carbamazepine [10–12], causing side effects that may be
problematic. A class of compounds called cannabinoids have
been shown to have therapeutic effects in animal models of
CNP via interactions with speciﬁc cannabinoid receptors
(CBRs) [13]. Endogenously released cannabinoids, such as
anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, act via these CBRs,
designated CB1 and CB2 [14]. CB1 receptors are found pre-
dominantly at nerve terminals where they mediate inhibition
of neurotransmitter release. CB2 receptors are expressed
mainly by immune cells, the functions of which include the
modulation of cytokine release and of immune cell migration
both within and outside the CNS [15]. CB1 and CB2 receptors
are targeted by agonists produced in mammalian tissues, and
this system of receptors and endocannabinoids together
constitute the endocannabinoid system. Cannabinoids may
also demonstrate activity at other receptors including the
orphan G protein-coupled receptor 55, transient receptor
potential vannilloid-1 and adenosine receptors [16–18].
Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD)
spray is derived from extracts of the plant Cannabis sativa
L., and is an endocannabinoid system modulator. It con-
tains THC and CBD in an approximate 1:1 ratio, and was
recently approved for use in several European countries for
treating spasticity in MS patients [19].
A recent study in central MS pain using THC/CBD
spray showed a beneﬁcial effect over placebo [20]. During
phase II and III studies, THC/CBD spray was found to have
analgesic properties that were effective in relieving neu-
ropathic pain. These studies also suggested that the medi-
cation was well tolerated and could also improve sleep and
quality of life. A 2-year, open-label follow-up study
showed continued effectiveness with THC/CBD spray, and
no evidence of tolerance was seen in the 28 patients who
completed the study [21]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of
THC/CBD spray, dronabinol (synthetic THC) and CBD in
neuropathic and MS-related pain revealed statistically
signiﬁcant pain relief in these studies [22].
This study assessed the efﬁcacy of THC/CBD spray on
CNP due to MS, as well as evaluating the effect of the
medication on sleep quality, quality of life, and patients
perception of CNP after 14 weeks of treatment (phase A,
double-blind). Phase B of the study (randomized-with-
drawal) investigated the maintenance of efﬁcacy after long-
term treatment with THC/CBD spray in the indication of
CNP in MS, and assessed the absence or occurrence of
withdrawal symptoms.
Methods
The study was conducted in two phases and took place in
33 study sites (UK, 12; Czech Republic, seven; Canada,
ﬁve; Spain, ﬁve and France, four). It was approved by the
relevant independent review board/ethics committee in
each of the countries, and was conducted in accordance
with good clinical practice guidelines.
Phase A was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-con-
trolled, 14-week treatment phase to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
THC/CBD spray in the treatment of CNP in MS patients in
addition to existing treatment regimens. A 1-week baseline
period allowing for dosing optimization preceded the
14-week treatment phase. Response was assessed using a
validated self-reported 0–10 point numerical rating scale
(NRS), where mean daily CNP due to MS was scored.
Phase B was a 14-week open-plan treatment phase con-
sisting of a 2-week re-titration period and 12-week stable
dose phase with THC/CBD spray, with an additional
4-week
randomized-withdrawal
phase,
where
patients
received either THC/CBD spray or placebo in a double-
blind manner. The maintenance of efﬁcacy with long-term
treatment with THC/CBD spray was investigated, and the
frequency and severity of withdrawal symptoms assessed.
Randomization
Randomization occurred using a pre-determined computer-
generated randomization code in which treatment alloca-
tion was stratiﬁed by center, and used randomly permuted
blocks of variable sizes. Separate randomization schemes,
using the same strategy, were produced for each part of the
J Neurol (2013) 260:984–997

123

study. Patients, investigators, and those assessing the data
were therefore blinded to the patients’ treatment allocation.
Main inclusion and exclusion criteria
Main study entry inclusion criteria
Eligible subjects were to have CNP due to MS, of at least
3 months duration. Subjects were also to have a sum score
of at least 24 on a pain 0–10 point NRS on the last 6 days
during the baseline period. In addition, their analgesic
regimen was to be stable for at least 2 weeks preceding the
study entry day.
Phase B (randomized-withdrawal)
French and Czech patients who had completed phase A of
the study were invited to take part in phase B. Patients were
required to have received an average of three or more
sprays of THC/CBD per day in the 7 days prior to com-
pletion of phase A, shown tolerability to the study medi-
cation,
and
maintained
a
stable
treatment
regimen
throughout the study for all neuropathic pain medications.
Main exclusion criteria
Patients with severe pain from other concomitant condi-
tions were excluded. This included pain of a nociceptive,
musculoskeletal (including spasms), peripheral neuropathic
or psychogenic origin, or due to trigeminal neuralgia.
Patients were also excluded if they had other pain that was
not of a central neuropathic origin thought by the investi-
gator to be of a nature or severity to interfere with the
patient’s assessment of neuropathic pain due to MS.
Patients with a history of signiﬁcant psychiatric (other than
depression associated with their underlying condition),
renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or convulsive disorders, or
with a sensitivity to cannabis or cannabinoids, were also
excluded. Participants who had experienced an adverse
event (AE) in phase A were also excluded from phase B.
Treatment groups and doses
A pump-action oromucosal spray delivered the study
medication. Each 100-ll actuation of active medication
delivered 2.7 mg of THC and 2.5 mg of CBD to the oral
mucosa. Placebo delivered the excipient plus colorants.
Patients were restricted to a maximum of 12 sprays per
24-h period. During the baseline period, patients self-
titrated, titrating upwards via a pre-deﬁned escalation
scheme to reach their optimal dose depending on efﬁcacy,
tolerability, and maximum permitted dose. To escalate the
dose to a maximum of 12 daily sprays during the phase B
re-titration period, patients were instructed to administer
one spray on days 1 and 2, two sprays on days 3 and 4,
three sprays on day 5, four on day 6, ﬁve on day 7 and so
on until reaching the maximum dose of 12 daily sprays on
day 14. Re-titration took place as it was assumed that a
number of patients who received placebo in phase A would
embark on active treatment in phase B. Since phase A of
the study was still blinded, all patients underwent re-titra-
tion in phase B.
Study endpoints
Efﬁcacy endpoints
The primary efﬁcacy endpoint for phase A was the response
to treatment, deﬁned as an improvement of 30 % or more in
patient’s mean pain NRS score from baseline to the last
week of treatment in phase A. In phase B, it was time to
treatment failure during the randomized-withdrawal period.
Secondary efﬁcacy endpoints for both phases included
the Brief Pain Inventory—Short Form, Subject Global
Impression of Change, and sleep quality assessments.
Safety endpoints
In both phases, the incidences of AEs were assessed.
Statistical methods
Sample size
A previous 4-week GW study in patients with CNP due to
MS resulted in 37.5 and 51.5 % of placebo and THC/CBD
spray patients, respectively, achieving a 30 % reduction
(improvement) in mean pain NRS scores; representing an
odds ratio of 1.71 for responding with THC/CBD spray
compared with placebo. Given the longer duration of this
study, it was assumed that the odds ratio achieved would be
1.90, leading to an anticipated responder rate of 53.3 %
with THC/CBD spray, assuming the placebo responder rate
did not change. Therefore, to obtain a 30 % response with
THC/CBD spray compared with placebo, a total of 312
patients (156 in each group) were required in order to
detect, with 80 % power at the a = 0.05 level, a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant difference between the treatment groups. It
was estimated that between 60 and 80 patients would be
eligible to enroll in phase B of the study. However, there
was no formal intended sample size for phase B.
Phase A
The baseline CNP NRS value was the average of the
7 days scores in baseline week one, with the variable for
986
J Neurol (2013) 260:984–997
123

analysis being the change in pain NRS scores from baseline
to end of treatment (average of ﬁnal 7 days scores). The
primary analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat
(ITT) population and a two-sided signiﬁcance test was used
in all comparisons at the 5 % level of signiﬁcance and a
95 % conﬁdence interval (CI) was presented for the dif-
ference between baseline and endpoint.
Phase B
Time to treatment failure was analyzed using Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis methodology and proportional odds
modeling, with randomized treatment as a factor. Second-
ary efﬁcacy variables for both studies were analyzed using
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
Results
A summary of breakdown of patients enrolled in phases
A and B of the study are shown in Fig. 1a, b, respec-
tively, and respective study population demographics are
displayed in Table 1A, B. The demographics between the
two study groups were similar with a mean duration of MS
in excess of 11 years, and neuropathic pain in excess of
5 years. During phase A, patients receiving placebo
administered an average of 11.1 (SD = 4.6) daily sprays
compared to 8.8 (SD = 3.87) sprays in the THC/CBD
group. In the open-label stage of phase B, patients took an
average of 6.7 (SD = 2.48) daily sprays. During random-
ized-withdrawal the active treatment group administered
on average 7.3 (SD = 2.42) sprays daily compared with
8
(SD = 2.72)
daily
sprays
by
the
placebo
group
(Table 1A, B).
Concomitant medication
Paracetamol was provided for rescue analgesic use during
both study phases. The majority of patients in both phases
were receiving this and other concomitant analgesic med-
ications (details presented in Table 2). As would be
expected in this group of patients, most were taking med-
ication other than analgesics during the course of the study
(92 % phase A; 93 % phase B).

Primary analysis: responder analysis
Phase A
The number of responders at the 30 % improvement level in
mean pain NRS score in the last week of treatment totaled
50 % in the THC/CBD spray group compared to 45 % in
the placebo group (odds ratio 1.31 [95 % CI: 0.84–2.04
points]: p = 0.234) (Fig. 2). At week 10 of the study, there
was a signiﬁcant treatment difference in favor of THC/CBD
spray (odds ratio 1.61 [95 % CI: 1.01–2.57]: p = 0.046)
(Fig. 2). At the end of treatment, the mean reduction in pain
0–10 NRS score for THC/CBD spray treatment was -1.93
points (from a baseline score of 6.55 ± 1.35–4.54 ± 2.24)
compared to -1.76 points (from a baseline score of
6.61 ± 1.29–4.73 ± 2.26) for the placebo group, an esti-
mated treatment difference of 0.17 points in favor of THC/
CBD spray, which did not reach statistical signiﬁcance
(95 % CI: -0.62 to 0.29 points; p = 0.47) (Fig. 3).
Phase B
A marked increase in the time to treatment failure was
observed in the active treatment group in phase B, with
only 24 % of patients failing treatment with THC/CBD
spray compared to 57 % from the placebo group, which
reached statistical signiﬁcance (logrank test for equality of
curves p = 0.04) (Fig. 4). The hazard ratio (0.374) for time

with the 90 % CI excluding unity, suggesting a real dif-
ference
between
treatments
(90 %
CI:
0.155–0.902;

Secondary endpoints
Phase A
None of the secondary efﬁcacy endpoints demonstrated a
statistically signiﬁcantly treatment difference in favor of
THC/CBD spray (Table 3A).
Phase B
During phase B, the change in mean pain NRS score at the
end of the treatment gave an estimated treatment difference
of -0.79 points in favor of THC/CBD spray, a statistically
signiﬁcant difference in pain (90 % CI: -1.37 to -0.21
points; p = 0.028) (Table 3B).
During randomized-withdrawal, a signiﬁcant difference
in the sleep quality NRS score in favor of THC/CBD spray
was observed, the results of which are summarized in
Table 3B. All other secondary endpoints from phase B
showed a treatment difference in favor of THC/CBD spray,

Safety and tolerability
All AEs experienced by patients in phase A and B are
displayed in Table 4A, B, respectively. During phase A, a
total of 27 patients (8 %), 15 (9 %) in the THC/CBD spray
group and 12 (7 %) in the placebo group, stopped study
medication due to AEs. Of these, eight patients (2 %) (ﬁve
[3 %] in the THC/CBD spray group and three [1 %] in the
placebo group), permanently stopped study medication due
to severe AEs and 18 (5 %) (12 in the THC/CBD spray arm
and six in the placebo arm) were considered to be treatment-
related. The majority of AEs leading to permanent cessation
of study medication were within the nervous system dis-
orders and gastrointestinal disorders system organ classes
(SOCs). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the number
of patients that ceased study medication between the two
arms of the study but there were twice the number of
treatment-related AEs amongst patients ceasing study
medication from the THC/CBD spray group than from the
placebo group (Table 4A). Thirty-ﬁve patients (10 %) in
phase A experienced a severe treatment-emergent AE, 21
(13 %) in the THC/CBD spray group and 14 (8 %) in the
placebo group. AEs with severe intensity were observed
most often in the nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal
system disorders, and psychiatric system disorders SOCs.
Overall, the difference in the incidence of severe events
between the two treatment arms was small and insigniﬁcant.
In the nervous system disorders SOC, there were twice as
many patients with severe events in the THC/CBD spray
group than in the placebo. In the psychiatric SOC, there
were equal proportions of patients with severe events in the
active and placebo study medication arms. No patient
experienced a severe event on more than two occasions.

During the post-randomization part of phase B, the AE
proﬁle was similar between groups (Table 4B). The most
common AEs in the THC/CBD spray group were dizziness,
fatigue, somnolence, vertigo, and nausea. There were
reports of three serious adverse events (SAE) during the
course of this study. One patient (5 %) receiving THC/CBD
spray experienced serious disorientation, and two patients,
one (5 %) receiving THC/CBD spray and the other (5 %)
receiving placebo experienced the SAE of suicidal ideation.
Six patients (10 %) stopped their study medication perma-
nently because of AEs in the open-label part of phase B.
During this phase, four patients (11 %) had treatment-
related events and all had previously been receiving placebo
prior to entering phase B of the study. In the randomized-
withdrawal phase of the study, only one patient on placebo
ceased to participate in the study permanently as a result of
a severe SAE of accidental injury. The SAE was considered
unrelated to the placebo medication.
Discussion
The results of phase A of this study failed to show a sig-
niﬁcant difference between THC/CBD spray and placebo
in the primary and in the majority of secondary efﬁcacy
endpoints. However, the results from a phase A interme-
diate time point analyses and phase B of the study dem-
onstrate evidence of the efﬁcacy of THC/CBD spray with
both the primary and certain secondary endpoints showing
a signiﬁcant difference in favor of THC/CBD spray. These
apparently paradoxical results make the interpretation of
this study difﬁcult.
The overall response of patients in phase A was good,
both to active and placebo medication. In published studies
of THC/CBD spray in neuropathic pain to date, this is the
largest placebo effect described by a substantial margin
[20–24]. At week 10 of this 14-week study, the proportion
of patients in the THC/CBD spray group who achieved at
least a 30 % improvement from baseline in mean pain NRS
score was signiﬁcantly greater than on placebo, reﬂecting
the fact that new placebo responses occurred in the ﬁnal
weeks of treatment, while the effect with THC/CBD spray
remained steady. Consistent with two previously reported
GW studies, the placebo response appears to be related to
dosing design, whereby patients were able to self-admin-
ister the oral spray at will, up to a maximum permitted daily
dose. This was originally intended to reﬂect as far as pos-
sible the ‘‘real-world’’ use of THC/CBD spray, whereby
patients initially experiment with dosing to ﬁnd their opti-
mum dose level and which, once established, is usually
maintained
thereafter.
However,
the
consequence
of
allowing patients to determine their own dose was that those
on placebo took signiﬁcantly more doses than those on the
THC/CBD spray, potentially confounding the comparison
between treatment groups. Placebo group patients who
titrated
to
the
maximum
dose
had
disproportionate
improvements in pain scores, and a number of these patients
reached the maximum permitted dose as the study period
was drawing to a close. Self-titration combined with a
subjective endpoint seems therefore to have signiﬁcantly
impacted the placebo response. Other recent studies also
report high placebo response rates, and rates appear to be
growing in clinical research in general [25, 26].
In an attempt to identify any subgroup of patients who
may have been responsible for this ﬁnding in phase A of
the study, we carried out a number of unplanned, post hoc
analyses. As might be predicted from the observation that
patients on placebo took a greater number of daily sprays,
when the groups were balanced for daily sprays, the THC/
CBD spray group showed greater separation from placebo
(data not shown). There was no notable difference in the
response rates according to gender, MS subtype, or indi-
vidual neuropathic pain type, but patients with a short
history of neuropathic pain (less than 4 years) appeared to
respond better than those with a long history of pain. These
analyses, being post hoc and unplanned, cannot change the

conclusion that phase A of this study failed to show a
signiﬁcant difference between THC/CBD spray and pla-
cebo, but they may help to inform the design of future
studies. The subgroup analyses suggest that patients with a
long history of refractory pain may be less likely to
respond—a conclusion that may seem intuitive, but is
supported by the post hoc analyses of phase A of this study.
In contrast to phase A, patients in phase B were
instructed to remain on a stable daily dose of study medi-
cation. In this case, THC/CBD spray demonstrated an
analgesic effect, with time to withdrawal being signiﬁ-
cantly longer in the THC/CBD spray treatment group.
Thus, it is important to ensure that patients in placebo-
controlled studies take a balanced number of daily doses of
study medication in relation to the active treatment, which
is something to consider in the design of future studies.
The primary efﬁcacy endpoint of time to treatment
failure in phase B was in favor of the THC/CBD spray,
with signiﬁcantly more patients from the placebo group
failing treatment compared with patients randomized to the
THC/CBD spray. Moreover, the results of all other
symptom-related endpoints showed that THC/CBD spray
patients maintained or improved their response whilst the
symptoms of those who switched from THC/CBD spray to
placebo worsened in the 4 weeks following cessation of
active treatment.

edge that patients with severe pain, especially if previously

treated, may not respond to new therapies. Considering that
the average duration of pain in this study was in excess of
5 years, and many patients had failed to respond ade-
quately to previous medications, the patients investigated
here represented an especially resistant treatment group
[27]. The fact that more than half of the patients who
received THC/CBD spray in phase A experienced at least a
30 % reduction in pain is, therefore, encouraging; however,
the large placebo response somewhat confounds this ﬁnd-
ing. It is also reassuring that patients receiving THC/CBD
spray reported an analgesic effect in phase B of this study.
As well as the demonstrated placebo effect, the con-
ventional parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized
study design used in phase A could also have impacted the
ﬁndings from this study. This approach only provides
information about the average response to treatment, and
includes results for subjects who do not respond to treat-
ment. In a population with a high proportion of nonre-
sponders,
such
as
may
occur
in
chronic
refractory
neuropathic pain, it may simply be the case that any gen-
uine differences between drug and placebo are masked by
the high rate of nonresponders. If this happens, the results
may not tell us much about the effectiveness of the medi-
cine in a clinical setting, where patients who fail to respond
would not usually continue treatment. In 2008, McQuay
et al. [28] concluded that the enriched enrolment random-
ized-withdrawal (EERW) design, rather than the conven-
tional design, is potentially valuable in addressing this
question, and should be considered especially in the study
of chronic pain to avoid the false conclusion of lack of
efﬁcacy. Phase B of this study incorporated an EERW
design and the efﬁcacy ﬁndings were statistically signiﬁ-
cant in favor of THC/CBD spray. The randomized-with-
drawal from THC/CBD spray precipitated a worsening in
the majority of the outcome measures, while maintenance
of effect of THC/CBD spray was demonstrated. The results
from phase B support the proposal that the efﬁcacy of
THC/CBD spray is maintained in long-term use.
In terms of safety, it was found that the THC/CBD spray
was generally well tolerated in this study, with the majority
of AEs considered to be mild to moderate in severity.
Three patients in the THC/CBD spray arm and two in the
placebo arm experienced a treatment-related SAE. The
majority of AEs had resolved by the end of the study.
There was no evidence of a withdrawal syndrome in those
patients who stopped THC/CBD spray, despite a prolonged
period on the medicine.
In summary, we found that in this treatment-resistant
population, the THC/CBD spray showed a high response
rate, statistically different to placebo at week 10 but not at
the week 14 primary endpoint in phase A. Randomized-
withdrawal from THC/CBD spray precipitated a signiﬁcant
deterioration in pain scores in the placebo group, while
maintenance of effect with THC/CBD spray was demon-
strated both for the primary outcome measure of time to
treatment failure, and for the key pain-related secondary
measures of sleep and mean pain scores. We conclude that
this study has provided further results useful for deter-
mining the efﬁcacy of THC/CBD spray in the treatment of
CNP due to MS. The results support previously published
proposals that an EERW study design may be of particular
value in identifying clinically relevant responses in this
patient population, and suggest that future studies may
beneﬁt from the incorporation of a balanced dosing regi-
men between the different arms of the study.
