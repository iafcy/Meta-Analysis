ABSTRACT 
 
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most abundant 
cannabinoid from the plant Cannabis sativa. There is only equivocal evidence that 
THC has analgesic effects. We performed a phase 2 controlled trial to evaluate the 
analgesic efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of an oral tablet 
containing purified THC in patients with chronic abdominal pain. 
 
METHODS: Sixty-five patients with chronic abdominal pain for 3 months or more 
(numeric rating scale scores of 3 or more) after surgery or due to chronic pancreatitis 
were randomly assigned to groups given the THC tablet or identical matching 
placebos for 50–52 days. Subjects in the THC group were given the tablet first in a 
step-up phase (3 mg, 3 times daily for 5 days and then 5 mg, 3 times daily for 5 days) 
followed by a stable dose phase (8 mg, 3 times daily until day 50–52). Preceding and 
during the entire study period, patients were asked to continue taking their 
medications (including analgesics) according prescription. Patients reported any 
additional pain medications in a diary. Efficacy and safety assessments were 
conducted preceding medication intake (day 1), after 15 days, and at 50–52 days. 
Plasma samples were collected on study days 1, 15, and 50–52; mean plasma 
concentration curves of THC and 11-OH-THC were plotted. The primary endpoint 
was pain relief, measured by a visual analogue scale of the mean pain (VAS mean 
scores), based on information from patient diaries. Secondary endpoints included 
pain and quality of life (determined from patient questionnaires), pharmacokinetics, 
and safety.

RESULTS: At days 50–52, VAS mean scores did not differ significantly between the 
THC and placebo groups (F(1, 46) =.016; P=.901). Between the start and end of the 
study, VAS mean scores decreased by 1.6 points (40%) in the THC group compared 
to 1.9 points (37%) in the placebo group. No differences were observed in secondary 
outcomes. Oral THC was generally well absorbed. Seven patients in the THC group 
stopped taking the tablets due to adverse events, compared with 2 patients in the 
placebo group. All (possibly) related adverse events were mild or moderate.  
 
CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2 study, we found no difference between a THC tablet 
and a placebo tablet in reducing pain measures in patients with chronic abdominal 
pain. THC, administered 3 times daily, was safe and well tolerated during a 50–52 
day treatment period.

INTRODUCTION 
1 
Chronic abdominal pain remains a major clinical challenge. Two typical chronic 
2 
abdominal pain etiologies of visceral origin are chronic pancreatitis (CP) and 
3 
postsurgical pain (PSP). Approximately 80–90% of CP patients suffer from chronic 
4 
abdominal pain during the course of their illness.1, 2 Incidences of painful post 
5 
abdominal surgery adhesion development vary in literature from 45 to 90%.3-5 Intra-
6 
abdominal adhesions are believed to be the most likely cause of PSP.4 CP and PSP 
7 
are both associated with an increased responsiveness of nociceptive pathways in the 
8 
central nervous system, termed central sensitization.6-8 Central sensitization 
9 
produces pain hypersensitivity by changing the sensory response in the central 
10 
nervous system, and is associated with the development and maintenance of chronic 
11 
pain.7 Because central sensitization alters the properties of neurons in the central 
12 
nervous system, the pain is frequently no longer reliably coupled to the presence of 
13 
particular peripheral stimuli. Therefore, pharmacologic treatment options that produce 
14 
analgesia by targeting these changes in the central nervous system are required.8 
15 
 
16 
The introduction of cannabinoids offers an interesting alternative for chronic pain 
17 
management. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the principal psychoactive 
18 
compound of the Cannabis sativa plant,9 and interacts with two cannabinoid 
19 
receptors, termed CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are predominantly found in the brain 
20 
and spinal cord, while CB2 receptors are located primarily in the periphery, including 
21 
the immune system.10 CB1 receptors are also highly expressed in regions critical for 
22 
emotion processing including the amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate 
23 
cortex.11 Brain activity within this emotion-related circuitry was found to be increased 
24 
in patients with chronic pain.12, 13 Hence, it was suggested that cannabinoids may 
25

modulate pain perception by disturbing the connectivity within this circuit. This was 
1 
demonstrated by Lee et al., who observed that THC reduced the functional 
2 
connectivity between the amygdala and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) 
3 
during pain processing.14 Further research indicated that THC does not selectively 
4 
affect these limbic regions, but rather interferes with sensory processing, which in 
5 
turn reduces sensory-limbic connectivity, leading to deactivation of affective 
6 
regions.15 Thus it may be expected that THC interferes, although not selectively, with 
7 
the affective components of pain. 
8 
 
9 
The majority of clinical trials on the efficacy of THC for pain treatment has been 
10 
focused on cancer related pain, central neuropathic pain syndromes, and acute pain 
11 
conditions.16-18 We aimed to investigate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of 
12 
a novel cannabinoid-based product, an oral tablet containing purified natural THC, in 
13 
patients with chronic abdominal pain.

METHODS 
1 
Study design 
2 
This phase II study used an equally randomized (allocation ratio 1:1), double-blind, 
3 
placebo-controlled, parallel design. The study initially started as two clinical trials in 
4 
(1) patients with painful CP and (2) patients with chronic abdominal PSP. Integration 
5 
into one study was necessary due to a disappointing recruitment rate. Initial trials 
6 
used identical study designs, treatment schemes and outcome parameters. 
7 
Integration was supported by an independent statistician, who reviewed blinded 
8 
interim data. The medical ethical committee approved both initial studies as well as 
9 
the protocol amendment concerning study integration prior to study closure. The 
10 
study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and in 
11 
accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines of Good 
12 
Clinical Practice. All subjects provided oral and written consent before conduct of any 
13 
protocol-related procedures. All authors had access to the study data and had 
14 
reviewed and approved the final manuscript. Clinicaltrials.gov identification numbers 
15 
NCT01562483 and NCT01551511. 
16 
 
17 
Study population 
18 
Adult patients (age >18 years) suffering from abdominal pain developed after a 
19 
surgical procedure or resulting from chronic pancreatitis were eligible for 
20 
participation, if they had persistent or intermittent abdominal pain (on a daily basis for 
21 
at least 3 months) severe enough for medical treatment (average NRS ≥ 3).19 Key 
22 
exclusion criteria were: daily cannabis use in past three years; history of 
23 
hypersensitivity to THC; serious painful conditions other than PSP or CP; significant 
24 
medical disorder or concomitant medication that may interfere with the study or may

1 
history; affected sensory input such as diabetic neuropathy; BMI >36.0 kg/m2; 
2 
significant exacerbation in illness within two weeks; positive urine drug screen or 
3

4 
laboratory results; pregnant or breastfeeding females; intending to conceive a child; 
5 
or participation in another investigational drug study within 90 days before study 
6 
entry. Preceding and during the entire study period, patients were asked to take their 
7 
co-medication, including analgesics, according prescription. Patients reported 
8 
additional pain medication (taken as needed) in a diary. The study was executed at 
9 
the Radboud university medical center, the Netherlands. Patients were recruited by 
10 
their physician or via advertisements. 
11 
 
12 
Randomization and study treatment 
13 
Tablets with standardized ∆9-THC content (Namisol®, Echo Pharmaceuticals, 
14 
Weesp, the Netherlands) or identical matching placebos were administered orally 
15 
during a 50-52 days add-on treatment. The study treatment consisted of two phases 
16 
(supplementary figure 1): a step-up phase (day 1-5: 3 mg TID; day 6-10: 5 mg TID), 
17 
and a stable dose phase (day 11-52: 8 mg TID). It was permitted to taper the dosage 
18 
to 5 mg TID, when 8 mg was not tolerated. Independent pharmacists dispensed 
19 
either active or placebo tablets according to a computer-generated randomization list 
20 
stratified for opioid and non-opioid users using separate lists. Treatment allocation 
21 
was strictly concealed from participants, investigators, and all other study personnel 
22 
involved in the study until end of study and database lock.

Primary efficacy outcome 
8 
The primary endpoint was change in pain intensity at the end of study treatment 
9 
versus baseline of THC compared with placebo. A visual analogue scale was used in 
10 
order to quantify the mean (VASmean), minimal (VASmin) and maximal (VASmax) pain 
11 
intensity in a daily diary, starting five days preceding first medication intake until the 
12 
end of study treatment. The boundaries of these 10 cm lines were 0 for no pain and 
13 
10 for unbearable pain.  
14 
 
15 
Statistics primary outcome 
16 
VASmean pain was analyzed by an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) of the VASmean 
17 
at day 50-52 (last day of diary) between placebo and THC that incorporates VASmean 
18 
at baseline (mean day -5 to -1 pre-treatment) as covariate in the analyses. Possible 
19 
moderating variables such as subpopulation (pancreatitis/postsurgical) and opiate 
20 
user (y/n) were evaluated by observing potential interactions and post hoc subgroup 
21 
analyses.

RESULTS 
1 
A total of 69 patients were assessed for eligibility during screening, of whom 65 were 
2 
included and randomized (figure 1). Sixty-two patients started study medication, of 
3 
whom 21 (8 CP/ 13 PSP) patients in the THC arm and 29 (15 CP/ 14 PSP) patients 
4 
in the placebo arm were included in the modified intention to treat efficacy analysis. 
5 
For the safety analysis, 30 (12 CP/ 18 PSP) patients were included in the THC arm 
6 
and 32 (15 CP/ 17 PSP) patients in the placebo arm. Eligible patients were recruited 
7 
from October 2012 to July 2014, and stopped due to poor recruitment. 
8 
 
9 
Efficacy 
10 
For patients in the efficacy analyses, mean (SD) VASmean pain scores at baseline 
11 
were 4.0 (1.9) and 5.2 (1.8) for THC and placebo respectively, and for patients in the 
12 
safety analysis, including drop-outs, 4.3 (1.9) and 5.2 (1.9) points respectively. 
13 
VASmean pain scores during THC and placebo treatment are shown in figure 2. 
14 
Primary efficacy analysis of the average VAS pain at the last day of diary did not 
15 
reveal significant difference between THC and placebo treatment (95% CI of diff [-
16 
1.31, 1.16], F(1, 46) =.016, p =.901). Mean VAS pain scores were reduced on 
17 
average of 1.6 points (40%) in the THC arm compared to 1.9 points (37%) in the 
18 
placebo arm. Parallel results were observed for minimal and maximal reported VAS 
19 
pain. Subgroup analyses of CP (95% CI of diff [-2.23, 1.78], F(1, 19) =.056, p =.816) 
20 
and PSP (95% CI of diff [-1.87, 1.70], F(1, 24) =.010, p=.922) patients revealed 
21 
similar results and did not affect these outcomes as covariate. VAS pain outcomes 
22 
are presented in table 2.

No statistically significant differences were observed in pain related questionnaires 
1 
such as the patient global impression of change, pain catastrophizing or pain related 
2 
anxiety. Measures of depression and generalized anxiety, quality of life, treatment 
3 
satisfaction did also not change after THC treatment compared with placebo. For the 
4 
domain pain of the SF-36 a trend was observed in favor of THC (F(1, 47) =4.023; p 
5 
=.051). Additionally, no differences were observed in subjective feelings 
6 
corresponding to alertness, mood and calmness nor for psychedelic effects including 
7 
difficulties in controlling thoughts, feeling high and feeling drowsy for THC compared 
8 
with placebo.  
9 
No statistically significant differences between THC and placebo were observed for 
10 
appetite level. Subjects in the THC group gained on average 0.8 kg in weight and 
11 
patients in the placebo group lost on average 0.4 kg during study treatment (NS (F(1, 
12 
47) =1.711; p =.197)). Balance disturbances were shown in several individuals, but 
13 
did not statistically increase during THC treatment compared with placebo.  
14 
 
15 
Pharmacokinetics 
16 
PK samples on day 50-52 time-locked after medication intake were analysed for 19 
17 
(8 CP/ 11 PSP) subjects resulting in 14 PK profiles of 8 mg and 5 PK profiles of 5mg 
18 
THC. Mean THC plasma concentration curves of THC and 11-OH-THC were plotted 
19 
(supplementary figure 2). Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics at an individual patient 
20 
level revealed that some patients demonstrate a relatively late tmax accompanied with 
21 
a relatively low Cmax , which cannot be observed in the plasma concentration curves. 
22 
Table 3 summarizes the calculated PK parameters of THC and 11-OH-THC. The tmax 
23 
of THC was 1.4 hours in patients on 8mg TID compared with 1.8 hours in patients on 
24 
5mg TID Namisol® regimen, and the t1/2term was 3.1 hour and 3.3 hour respectively.

Mean (± SD) trough levels for THC were 0.70 (± .59) ng/mL on day 15 and 0.57 (± 
1 
.32) ng/mL on day 50-52. One patient demonstrated predose concentration levels 
2 
below the lower limit of quantification on day 15.  
3 
 
4 
Safety 
5 
Seven patients administering THC discontinued study treatment due to AEs 
6 
compared with 2 patients in the placebo group. These patients did not tolerate a 
7 
dosage of 5 mg TID THC and withdrew due to mild to moderate AEs. Another 5 
8 
patients in the THC arm, compared with 2 patients in the placebo arm, tapered their 
9 
dosage to 5 mg TID. 
10 
A summary of (possibly) related AEs are presented in table 4. Five patients 
11 
experienced serious AEs during the study treatment that were all considered not to 
12 
be related to the study drug. Further AEs were mild or moderate. All subjects fully 
13 
recovered from AEs. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs, ECG 
14 
parameters, or safety laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, and 
15 
urinalysis). 
16 
 
17 
Treatment compliance   
18 
A mean (± SD) of 97% (± 4%) of all placebo study medication was taken correctly 
19 
compared with 98% (± 2%) in the THC treatment arm. There were no patients with a 
20 
poor compliance (<75%), as measured by the amount of medication returned to the 
21 
hospital after the treatment period. One subject appeared to be not compliant 
22 
according PK predose levels on day 15, but demonstrated regular trough levels on 
23 
day 50.

DISCUSSION 
1 
This is the first exploratory study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, pharmacokinetics 
2 
and tolerability of THC, 1) using an oral tablet with improved bioavailability and 
3 
optimal blinding potential, 2) in patients with chronic abdominal pain, 3) during a 
4 
relatively long-lasting treatment period of 50 days.  
5 
Contrary to our hypothesis, THC did not show a beneficial effect on chronic 
6 
abdominal pain compared with placebo. Similar results were observed for minimal 
7 
and maximal reported VAS pain, indicating that THC does not affect background pain 
8 
or pain peaks. It should be mentioned that, despite the randomization procedure, 
9 
patients in the THC group demonstrated pain of 1.2 points lower intensity at baseline 
10 
than patients in the placebo group. In addition to the primary outcome, several 
11 
questionnaires were used to evaluate a wide range of secondary efficacy outcomes 
12 
during and after the THC treatment period. No differences were observed in pain 
13 
related questionnaires or measures of depression and anxiety, quality of life and 
14 
treatment satisfaction. 
15 
 
16 
There are many reasons why clinical trials may fail to demonstrate analgesic efficacy 
17 
on the primary endpoint. In first instance this could be related to insufficient analgesic 
18 
potency of the investigational drug, but it may also be related to 1) an impaired 
19 
bioavailability, 2) a large placebo response, 3) indirect analgesic effects, or 4) an 
20 
inadequate study design. 
21 
The absorption of orally administrated drugs might be affected particularly in patients 
22 
with gastrointestinal deficits.20 In the present study, mean plasma concentration 
23 
curves of patients on both 5 mg as well as 8 mg TID treatment regimen demonstrate 
24 
that THC was generally well absorbed and further metabolized into 11-OH-THC. The 
25 

MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Page 14 / 25 
 
tmax of THC was 1.4 hour in patients on 8mg TID compared with 1.8 hour in patients 
1 
on 5mg TID THC regimen. This delay in absorption in patients on 5mg TID THC was 
2 
accompanied with an enhanced t1/2term duration, which overall resulted in comparable 
3 
AUC0-tau between the two treatment regimens. It should be mentioned that the PK 
4 
sampling until 6 hours postdose was too short for two patients on 5mg TID THC in 
5 
order to obtain all elimination parameters. So these parameters are probably an 
6 
underestimation. However, the reliable pharmacokinetic profiles observed in our 
7 
study population do not explain the lack of observed efficacy. 
8 
 
9 
A large placebo response of 37% pain reduction was observed in current study, 
10 
which is common in chronic visceral pain studies. A meta-analysis including 8.364 
11 
patients with irritable bowel syndrome allocated to placebo observed a pooled 
12 
placebo response of 37.5%.21 However, a previous RCT of our study group also 
13 
observed a high reduction of average pain score by 24% in the placebo arm, but this 
14 
did not prevent proof of superiority of pregabalin over placebo using a very similar 
15 
study design in patients with CP.22 Underlying mechanisms of the placebo effect can 
16 
be derived from psychological and neurobiological viewpoints. Two well supported 
17 
mechanisms from a psychological point of view are expectancy and conditioning.23 
18 
Factors that influence the magnitude of the placebo response in RCTs include type of 
19 
active medication, randomization ratio, and the number of planned face-to-face visits, 
20 
thereby supporting the expectancy hypothesis.24 High expectations toward treatment 
21 
efficacy of THC might have contributed to the substantial placebo response as 
22 
observed in the present study.

The lack of observed analgesic efficacy can also be considered from a mechanistic 
1 
point of view. Two major mechanisms are currently proposed to underlie chronic pain 
2 
and its development: 1) sensitization of nociceptive processing (central sensitization/ 
3 
hyperalgesia), and 2) alterations in central cognitive and autonomic processing.8, 13 
4 
Consequently, the focus of treatment options for chronic pain has been shifting away 
5 
from targeting the anatomical site to targeting changes in the peripheral and central 
6 
nervous system. The anti-hyperalgesic potential of THC is not clearly demonstrated 
7 
in human and should be further evaluated using measurements such as quantitative 
8 
sensory testing or EEG.  
9 
Patients with persistent pain demonstrated increased brain activity in areas 
10 
considered to mediate emotion including the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, the 
11 
medial prefrontal cortex, and parts of the amygdala.13 Thus, the representation of 
12 
pain in the brain shifts over time to areas implicated in cognitive function, particularly 
13 
emotion.25 The frontal-limbic distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the brain 
14 
suggests that cannabis may preferentially target the affective qualities of pain. A 
15 
study conducted by Lee et al. demonstrated that dronabinol reduced the reported 
16 
unpleasantness, but not the intensity of ongoing pain and hyperalgesia.14 This 
17 
suggests a shift in central nervous system function from nociceptive to cognitive, 
18 
affective and autonomic sensitization in patients moving from acute to chronic pain. 
19 
Therefore, an agent targeting particular brain areas related to the cognitive emotional 
20 
feature of chronic pain, such as THC, might be efficacious in our chronic pain 
21 
population, but might be better measured using affective outcomes of pain.

23 
In general, THC was well tolerated resulting in only mild to moderate (possibly) 
24 
related adverse events, which were similar to previous studies in CP patients and

healthy volunteers.26, 27 The considerable number of AEs reported in the placebo 
1 
group as well as the withdrawal of patients because of AEs, despite being in the 
2 
placebo arm, indicate that AEs were partly determined by nonpharmacological 
3 
effects.28, 29 This so called nocebo effect induces negative effects due to negative 
4 
expectations. Cannabis is a generally well known product, particularly as recreational 
5 
drug to induce desired psychotropic effects such as euphoria, relaxation, and 
6 
perceptual alterations. Therefore, it is plausible that patients in this study were 
7 
influenced by expectations, which may have influenced the occurrence of AEs. 
8 
 
9 
A major limitation of the present study is the small sample size, which is insufficiently 
10 
large to allow subgroup analyses. However, considering the confidence intervals of 
11 
the effect, it is doubtful that an increased sample size would have been resulted in 
12 
significant differences. 
13 
Furthermore, the present study comprises a heterogeneous patient population 
14 
regarding etiology and anatomical site of the pain. However, all patients suffered 
15 
from chronic abdominal pain, which is associated with central sensitization and 
16 
alterations in central cognitive and autonomic processing.8, 13 The presence of central 
17 
sensitization in chronic pain patients supports the choice of treatments that reduce 
18 
pain by normalizing hyperexcitable central neural activity, which makes the initial pain 
19 
etiology or peripheral stimulus and past or currently received pain treatments less 
20 
important. These variables and other patient characteristics might have contributed to 
21 
inter-individual differences in treatment effects – while on the other hand enhancing 
22 
the generalizability of the study.  
23 
Additionally, it should be mentioned that most patients already had received different 
24 
pain treatments including analgesics, which failed to provide a satisfactory level of

pain relief. Thus, this study included a selection of patients who did not respond to 
1 
registered analgesics with a proven efficacy. 
2 
 
3 
In summary, we conclude that THC treatment showed acceptable safety and 
4 
tolerability profiles during a 50-52 day add-on treatment period, but did not 
5 
significantly reduce pain scores or secondary efficacy outcomes in patients with 
6 
chronic abdominal pain compared to placebo. Further research should evaluate the 
7 
the effects of THC on secondary and tertiary central pain processing.

After 
baseline 
measurements, 
patients 
administrated 3 mg TID THC or placebo from day 1 to 5. On day 5, tolerability was 
evaluated. The dosage of day 6 to 10 was increased to 5 mg TID or, when not 
tolerated, the patient was withdrawn. On day 10, the tolerability was evaluated again. 
From day 11 to 15, the dosage was further increased to 8 mg TID. This dosage could 
be tapered to 5 mg TID, when 8 mg appeared to induce unacceptable adverse 
events (dotted arrows). At day 15 the tolerability was evaluated again. If tolerable, 
patients proceeded with 8 mg TID, but if not, the dosage was reduced to 5 mg TID. 
Grey filled arrows represent decision points I en II: increased dosage or withdrawal. 
Black filled arrow represents decision point III: continue 8 mg TID, taper to 5 mg TID, 
or withdrawal. Dotted line represents the permitted dose adjustment of minimal 5 mg 
TID.

Supplementary material 1: Methods  
 
Study procedures 
Potential participating patients were screened for eligibility within 7-35 days prior to 
start of study treatment (visit 1). Screening included demographics, medical history, 
concomitant medication, smoking habits, physical examination, 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), standard laboratory blood tests (hematology, biochemistry, 
virology) and urine screening tests (urinalysis, drug screening and pregnancy test). 
Furthermore, all patients received a diary to report pain scores, add-on analgesics 
and adverse events. 
Study days were carried out at the clinical research center of the Radboudumc, 
where each patient stayed in a separate quiet room.  
 
Secondary efficacy outcomes 
Pain related questionnaires included the patient global impression of change (PGIC)1 
evaluated on day 15 and 50-52, pain catastrophizing scale (PCS)2, 3 evaluated on 
day 1, 15 and 50-52, and pain anxiety symptom scale (PASS)4 evaluated on day 1 
and 50-52. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)5, and quality of life 
questionnaire (RAND SF-36)6 were filled out at day 1 and 50-52. Treatment 
satisfaction (TSQM v. II)7 and the patient appetite level (AppLe) were evaluated at 
the last study visit. The AppLe was a modification of the PGIC to evaluate any 
change in appetite in the last week and compared to before the study period.  
Drug effects on alertness, mood, and calmness were explored using the Bond & 
Lader questionnaire, and potential subjective psychotomimetic (psychedelic) effects 
were evaluated using the Bowdle questionnaire.8, 9 Both questionnaires were filled

out on day 1, 4-5, 9-10, 15, and 50-52. 
Left-right (roll) and anterior-posterior (pitch) postural movements were measured 
using a gyroscope-based measurement system (SwayStar™, Balance International 
Innovations GmbH, Switzerland), which was attached to the waist of the patient. 
Patients stood, without shoes, as still as possible in a standardized base of support 
with their arms hanging at both sides of their body. Body sway was measured for one 
minute with eyes open, one minute with eyes closed and for 30 seconds with eyes 
open standing on one leg of preference. Patients were asked to fixate at one point 
during the tasks with eyes open. The computerized measures used for analysis 
reflect the total angular area and 90% range roll and pitch excursion in degrees from 
the centre of gravity. 
 
Safety and Tolerability 
Safety and tolerability were evaluated using spontaneously reported adverse events 
(AEs) and measurements of vital functions, ECG and laboratory tests. AEs were 
recorded in a daily diary, at study visits and phone calls up to 2 weeks after study 
drug discontinuation. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at screening and 
on both study days. ECG, hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis were 
performed at screening and at the end of the study.  
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma concentrations of THC and its active metabolite 11-OH-THC were 
determined predose on day 1, 15 and 50-52 to confirm a baseline state, determine 
trough levels and test the compliance. The PK sampling on day 50-52 was extended 
with 7 additional samples time-locked after medication intake at 0:30, 1:00, 2:00,

3:00, 4:00, 5:00, and 5:55 hours postdose. Blood samples were collected in 4ml 
EDTA tubes and immediately after collection wrapped in aluminum foil and kept on 
ice. Samples were centrifuged within 30 minutes at 2000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. 
The handling of THC samples was done avoiding direct light. The separated plasma 
was divided into primary and backup samples, and stored at –80°C until bioanalysis. 
Bioanalysis (Analytisch Biochemisch Laboratorium b.v., Assen, the Netherlands) was 
performed using a validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assay method according to good laboratory practice 
procedures. The lower limit of quantification for THC and 11-OH-THC was 0.100 ng 
ml−1.  
 
Statistical analysis 
The primary outcome of this study was change in pain intensity, measured by the 
VASmean in a daily diary, between THC and placebo treatment. VASmean pain was 
analyzed by an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) of the VASmean at day 50-52 (last 
day of diary) between placebo and THC that incorporates VASmean at baseline (mean 
day -5 to -1 pre-treatment) as covariate in the analyses. Possible moderating 
variables such as subpopulation (pancreatitis/postsurgical) and opiate user (y/n) were 
evaluated by observing potential interactions and post hoc subgroup analyses. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes were analyzed in a similar manner. All participants who 
received the study medication for at least 36 days were included in the efficacy 
analyses according to the intention to treat principle. Dropouts before day 36 were 
replaced and data of dropouts were excluded from further analyses for efficacy. 
Safety analyses was performed on all randomized subjects who received at least one 
dose of THC or placebo.

For statistical analysis SPSS software for Windows v.20 was used. All statistical tests 
were performed two-tailed, and the limit for statistical significance was set at P<0.05. 
The initial study in CP patients was powered (α = 0.05, power = 0.80) to detect a 
decrease of at least 1.0 VASmean pain in the THC group compared with placebo, 
resulting in 34 patients per group. Variances in pain scores were extrapolated from a 
similar study with pregabalin.10 No information was available to estimate the SD in 
the initial PSP study, therefore, same numbers were adopted for this study. Input 
variances for the integrated study were considered to be too unreliable to conduct a 
sample size calculation. Therefore, no sample size calculation was performed for this 
early phase 2 clinical trial.  
Non-compartmental analysis to determine plasma PK parameters of the active 
compounds, THC and 11-OH-THC, was performed using the WinNonlin modeling 
and analysis software (version 2.1 a; Pharsight Inc., Apex, NC). The maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax), the time to reach Cmax (Tmax),  and the AUC from 0 up to 
the last measurement (AUC0–last, using the linear log trapezoidal rule) were calculated 
from the individual plasma concentration-versus-time profiles. The terminal half-life 
(t1/2 term) was calculated only if there were two or more points (excluding Cmax) in the 
elimination phase of the plasma concentration–time curve with r2 > 0.80. For that 
reason, one patient was excluded from this part of the analysis for THC and two 
patients for 11-OH-THC. Subsequently, the areas under the plasma concentration 
curves extrapolated to the end of the dosing period (AUCtau) were calculated using 
the linear log trapezoidal rule and extrapolation to 8 hours.
