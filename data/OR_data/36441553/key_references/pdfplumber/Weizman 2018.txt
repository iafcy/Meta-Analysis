Abstract
Objective
To characterize the functional brain changes involved in δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
modulationofchronicneuropathicpain.
Methods
Fifteenpatientswithchronicradicularneuropathicpainparticipatedinarandomized,double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial employing a counterbalanced, within-subjects design. Pain
assessments and functional resting state brain scans were performed at baseline and after
sublingualTHCadministration.Weexaminedfunctionalconnectivityoftheanteriorcingulate
cortex(ACC)andpain-relatednetworkdynamicsusinggraphtheorymeasures.
Results
THC significantly reduced patients’ pain compared to placebo. THC-induced analgesia was
correlated with a reduction in functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC)andthesensorimotorcortex.Moreover,thedegreeofreductionwaspredictiveofthe
responsetoTHC.Graphtheoryanalysesoflocalmeasuresdemonstratedreductioninnetwork
connectivityinareasinvolvedinpainprocessing,andspecificallyinthedorsolateralprefrontal
cortex(DLPFC),whichwerecorrelatedwithindividualpainreduction.
Conclusion
These results suggest that the ACC and DLPFC, 2 major cognitive-emotional modulation
areas,andtheirconnectionstosomatosensoryareas,arefunctionallyinvolvedintheanalgesic
effect of THC in chronic pain. This effect may therefore be mediated through induction of
functionaldisconnectionbetweenregulatoryhigh-orderaffectiveregionsandthesensorimotor
cortex. Moreover, baseline functional connectivity between these brain areas may serve as
apredictorfortheextentofpainreliefinducedbyTHC.
