patients to assess their feeling of “highness” after
treatment, according to question 1 from the Sub-
jective Ratings of High and Sedation Question-
naire (SRHS–R), and to guess which treatment
they were receiving (placebo or cannabis).
Detailed descriptions of these measures are
available in Appendix 1 (available at www .cmaj .ca
/lookup /suppl /doi :10 .1503 /cmaj .110837 /-/DC1).
Statistical analysis
We calculated mean scores (and 95% confi-
dence intervals [CIs]) on the modified Ash-
worth scale during each visit of each phase, at
each assessment time (before and after treat-
ment). We calculated bootstrap-based, bias -
corrected, accelerated CIs for extra precision
around each mean. We calculated four overall
mean scores on the modified Ashworth scale
(before and after smoking during both phases).
We compared the difference in scores before
and after smoking for each of the two phases
using paired t tests. We then compared the
change in this difference (after to before) in the
two phases (placebo and active) using a paired
t test. We used the same analysis to examine
scores on the visual analogue scale for pain,
the timed walk and the PASAT.
We analyzed secondary variables according to
the schedule of measurements. We calculated the
means and bootstrap-based CIs for patient scores
on the BSI, the PDQ, and the mFIS for each day
on which these measures were assessed (day 1
before smoking, day 3 after smok ing). We as -
sessed the overall differences for before and after
treatment with placebo and cannabis using a paired
t test. We calculated the means and bootstrap-
based CIs for the answer to question 1 of the
SRHS–R questionnaire. We used a paired ttest to
compare the overall difference in “highness”
between treatment and placebo.
We performed power calculations before
the beginning of the study, and these were
reviewed and approved by an external scien-
tific advisory board and regulatory agencies. A
priori, we identified as “clinically important”
any departure from zero in the hypothesized
direction that is greater than one standard
deviation (SD) of paired differences. We deter-
mined that a sample size of 30 would yield
better than 80% power (α= 0.05) to detect
such an effect size.

Research
Sensitivity analyses
Using a worst-case scenario sensitivity analysis
(assuming that the seven patients who withdrew
would not have shown any treatment effect), compared with placebo, smoking cannabis
reduced average scores on the modified Ashworth
scale by 2.22 points (p < 0.001), on the visual
analogue scale of pain by 4.28 points (p= 0.009)
and on the PASAT by 6.981 points (p = 0.003).
These findings suggest that dropouts had no
meaningful effect on our results.
Safety effects
Although smoked cannabis was generally well-
tolerated, patients reported more adverse
effects during the active phase than during the
placebo phase (Table 4). Withdrawals from
treatment were due to adverse events (two
patients felt uncomfortably “high”, two had
dizziness and one had fatigue), the schedule
being too demanding (one patient) and pain
unrelated to the study (one patient). Of the
patients who withdrew, three had no previous
exposure to cannabis, two had only some expo-
sure (> 1 yr since last use) and two had been
exposed during the previous year. None of our
participants had episodes of hypertension,
hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia requir-
ing medical intervention.
Interpretation
Main findings
We saw a beneficial effect of smoked cannabis
on treatment-resistant spasticity and pain associ-
ated with multiple sclerosis among our partici-
pants. Although generally well-tolerated by our
participants, smoking cannabis was accompanied
by acute cognitive effects.
Comparison with other studies
Other studies have investigated the effect of
orally administered cannabinoids on spasticity
related to multiple sclerosis, including oromu-
cosal sprays and capsules containing cannabis
extract, with mixed results. Any reductions in
spasticity have generally only been seen on sub-
jective ratings.10,11One study showed a reduction
of 1.82 points on the original Ashworth spastic-
ity scale (baseline mean 22) compared with a
reduction of 0.23 points for placebo.12 In a trial
of a cannabis-based oromucosal spray, Collin
and colleagues13found that 40% of patients self-
reported a benefit of 30% or more over a period
of six weeks using a numerical rating scale of spasticity. Changes in the scores on the Ash- worth spasticity scale did not significantly differ
between participants receiving treatment and
