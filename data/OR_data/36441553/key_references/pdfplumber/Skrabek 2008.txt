Abstract: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the
benefit of nabilone in pain management and quality of life improvement in 40 patients with
fibromyalgia.Afterabaselineassessment,subjectsweretitrateduponnabilone,from0.5mgPOat
bedtimeto1mgBIDover4weeksorreceivedacorrespondingplacebo.Atthe2-and4-weekvisits,
the primary outcome measure, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and the secondary outcome
measures, number of tender points, the average tender point pain threshold, and the Fibromyalgia
Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), were evaluated. After a 4-week washout period, subjects returned for
reassessment of the outcome measures. There were no significant differences in population demo-
