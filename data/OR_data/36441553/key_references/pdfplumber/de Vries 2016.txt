ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most abundant
cannabinoid from the plant Cannabis sativa. There is only equivocal evidence that
T
THC has analgesic effects. We performed a phase 2 controlled trial to evaluate the
P
analgesic efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of an oral tablet
I
R
containing purified THC in patients with chronic abdominal pain.
C
S
METHODS: Sixty-five patients with chronic abdominal pain for 3 months or more
U
(numeric rating scale scores of 3 or more) after surgery or due to chronic pancreatitis
N
were randomly assigned to groups given the THC tablet or identical matching
A
placebos for 50–52 days. Subjects in the THC group were given the tablet first in a
M
step-up phase (3 mg, 3 times daily for 5 days and then 5 mg, 3 times daily for 5 days)
D
followed by a stable dose phase (8 mg, 3 times daily until day 50–52). Preceding and
E
during the entire study period, patients were asked to continue taking their
T
medications (including analgesics) according prescription. Patients reported any
P
additional pain medications in a diary. Efficacy and safety assessments were
E
conducted preceding medication intake (day 1), after 15 days, and at 50–52 days.
C
Plasma samples were collected on study days 1, 15, and 50–52; mean plasma
C
concentration curves of THC and 11-OH-THC were plotted. The primary endpoint
A
was pain relief, measured by a visual analogue scale of the mean pain (VAS mean
scores), based on information from patient diaries. Secondary endpoints included
pain and quality of life (determined from patient questionnaires), pharmacokinetics,
and safety.

RESULTS: At days 50–52, VAS mean scores did not differ significantly between the
THC and placebo groups (F(1, 46) =.016; P=.901). Between the start and end of the
study, VAS mean scores decreased by 1.6 points (40%) in the THC group compared
to 1.9 points (37%) in the placebo group. No differences were observed in secondary
T
outcomes. Oral THC was generally well absorbed. Seven patients in the THC group
P
stopped taking the tablets due to adverse events, compared with 2 patients in the
I
R
placebo group. All (possibly) related adverse events were mild or moderate.

CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2 study, we found no difference between a THC tablet
U
and a placebo tablet in reducing pain measures in patients with chronic abdominal
N
pain. THC, administered 3 times daily, was safe and well tolerated during a 50–52
A
day treatment period.

1 INTRODUCTION
2 Chronic abdominal pain remains a major clinical challenge. Two typical chronic
3 abdominal pain etiologies of visceral origin are chronic pancreatitis (CP) and
4 postsurgical pain (PSP). Approximately 80–90% of CP patients suffer from chronic
T
5 abdominal pain during the course of their illness.1, 2 Incidences of painful post
P
6 abdominal surgery adhesion development vary in literature from 45 to 90%.3-5 Intra-
I
7 abdominal adhesions are believed to be the most likely cause of PSR P.4 CP and PSP
C
8 are both associated with an increased responsiveness of nociceptive pathways in the
9 central nervous system, termed central sensitization.6-8 CenS tral sensitization
U
10 produces pain hypersensitivity by changing the sensory response in the central
N
11 nervous system, and is associated with the development and maintenance of chronic
A
12 pain.7 Because central sensitization alters the properties of neurons in the central
M
13 nervous system, the pain is frequently no longer reliably coupled to the presence of
D
14 particular peripheral stimuli. Therefore, pharmacologic treatment options that produce
15 analgesia by targeting these changE es in the central nervous system are required.8
T
16
P
17 The introduction of cannabinoids offers an interesting alternative for chronic pain
E
18 management. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the principal psychoactive
C
19 compound of the Cannabis sativa plant,9 and interacts with two cannabinoid
C
20 receptors, termed CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are predominantly found in the brain
A
21 and spinal cord, while CB2 receptors are located primarily in the periphery, including
22 the immune system.10 CB1 receptors are also highly expressed in regions critical for
23 emotion processing including the amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate
24 cortex.11 Brain activity within this emotion-related circuitry was found to be increased
25 in patients with chronic pain.12, 13 Hence, it was suggested that cannabinoids may
Page 5 / 25
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
1 modulate pain perception by disturbing the connectivity within this circuit. This was
2 demonstrated by Lee et al., who observed that THC reduced the functional
3 connectivity between the amygdala and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1)
4 during pain processing.14 Further research indicated that THC does not selectively
T
5 affect these limbic regions, but rather interferes with sensory processing, which in
P
6 turn reduces sensory-limbic connectivity, leading to deactivation of affective
I
7 regions.15 Thus it may be expected that THC interferes, although noR t selectively, with
C

2 Study design
3 This phase II study used an equally randomized (allocation ratio 1:1), double-blind,
4 placebo-controlled, parallel design. The study initially started as two clinical trials in
T
5 (1) patients with painful CP and (2) patients with chronic abdominal PSP. Integration
P
6 into one study was necessary due to a disappointing recruitment rate. Initial trials
I
R

C
8 Integration was supported by an independent statistician, who reviewed blinded
S
9 interim data. The medical ethical committee approved both initial studies as well as
U
10 the protocol amendment concerning study integration prior to study closure. The
N
11 study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and in
A
12 accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines of Good

1 DISCUSSION
2 This is the first exploratory study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, pharmacokinetics
3 and tolerability of THC, 1) using an oral tablet with improved bioavailability and
4 optimal blinding potential, 2) in patients with chronic abdominal pain, 3) during a
T
5 relatively long-lasting treatment period of 50 days.
P
6 Contrary to our hypothesis, THC did not show a beneficial effect on chronic
I
R
7 abdominal pain compared with placebo. Similar results were observed for minimal
C
8 and maximal reported VAS pain, indicating that THC does not affect background pain
S
9 or pain peaks. It should be mentioned that, despite the randomization procedure,
U
10 patients in the THC group demonstrated pain of 1.2 points lower intensity at baseline
N
11 than patients in the placebo group. In addition to the primary outcome, several
A
12 questionnaires were used to evaluate a wide range of secondary efficacy outcomes
M
13 during and after the THC treatment period. No differences were observed in pain
D
14 related questionnaires or measures of depression and anxiety, quality of life and
E
15 treatment satisfaction.
T
16
P
17 There are many reasons why clinical trials may fail to demonstrate analgesic efficacy
E
18 on the primary endpoint. In first instance this could be related to insufficient analgesic
C
19 potency of the investigational drug, but it may also be related to 1) an impaired
C
20 bioavailability, 2) a large placebo response, 3) indirect analgesic effects, or 4) an
A
21 inadequate study design.
22 The absorption of orally administrated drugs might be affected particularly in patients
23 with gastrointestinal deficits.20 In the present study, mean plasma concentration
24 curves of patients on both 5 mg as well as 8 mg TID treatment regimen demonstrate
25 that THC was generally well absorbed and further metabolized into 11-OH-THC. The
Page 13 / 25
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
1 t of THC was 1.4 hour in patients on 8mg TID compared with 1.8 hour in patients
max
2 on 5mg TID THC regimen. This delay in absorption in patients on 5mg TID THC was
3 accompanied with an enhanced t duration, which overall resulted in comparable
1/2term
4 AUC between the two treatment regimens. It should be mentioned that the PK
0-tau
T
5 sampling until 6 hours postdose was too short for two patients on 5mg TID THC in
P
6 order to obtain all elimination parameters. So these parameters are probably an
I
R
7 underestimation. However, the reliable pharmacokinetic profiles observed in our
C
8 study population do not explain the lack of observed efficacy.

10 A large placebo response of 37% pain reduction was observed in current study,
N
11 which is common in chronic visceral pain studies. A meta-analysis including 8.364

M
13 placebo response of 37.5%.21 However, a previous RCT of our study group also

14 observed a high reduction of average pain score by 24% in the placebo arm, but this
E
15 did not prevent proof of superiority of pregabalin over placebo using a very similar
T
16 study design in patients with CP.22 Underlying mechanisms of the placebo effect can
P
17 be derived from psychological and neurobiological viewpoints. Two well supported
E
18 mechanisms from a psychological point of view are expectancy and conditioning.23
C
19 Factors that influence the magnitude of the placebo response in RCTs include type of
C
20 active medication, randomization ratio, and the number of planned face-to-face visits,
A
21 thereby supporting the expectancy hypothesis.24 High expectations toward treatment
22 efficacy of THC might have contributed to the substantial placebo response as
23 observed in the present study.

1 The lack of observed analgesic efficacy can also be considered from a mechanistic
2 point of view. Two major mechanisms are currently proposed to underlie chronic pain
3 and its development: 1) sensitization of nociceptive processing (central sensitization/
4 hyperalgesia), and 2) alterations in central cognitive and autonomic processing.8, 13
T
5 Consequently, the focus of treatment options for chronic pain has been shifting away
P
6 from targeting the anatomical site to targeting changes in the peripheral and central
I
R
7 nervous system. The anti-hyperalgesic potential of THC is not clearly demonstrated
C
8 in human and should be further evaluated using measurements such as quantitative
S
9 sensory testing or EEG.
U
10 Patients with persistent pain demonstrated increased brain activity in areas
N
11 considered to mediate emotion including the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, the
A
12 medial prefrontal cortex, and parts of the amygdala.13 Thus, the representation of
M
13 pain in the brain shifts over time to areas implicated in cognitive function, particularly
14 emotion.25 The frontal-limbic distribuD tion of cannabinoid receptors in the brain
E
15 suggests that cannabis may preferentially target the affective qualities of pain. A
T
16 study conducted by Lee et al. demonstrated that dronabinol reduced the reported
P
17 unpleasantness, but not the intensity of ongoing pain and hyperalgesia.14 This
E
18 suggests a shift in central nervous system function from nociceptive to cognitive,
C
19 affective and autonomic sensitization in patients moving from acute to chronic pain.
C
20 Therefore, an agent targeting particular brain areas related to the cognitive emotional
A
21 feature of chronic pain, such as THC, might be efficacious in our chronic pain
22 population, but might be better measured using affective outcomes of pain.

24 In general, THC was well tolerated resulting in only mild to moderate (possibly)
25 related adverse events, which were similar to previous studies in CP patients and

1 healthy volunteers.26, 27 The considerable number of AEs reported in the placebo
2 group as well as the withdrawal of patients because of AEs, despite being in the
3 placebo arm, indicate that AEs were partly determined by nonpharmacological
4 effects.28, 29 This so called nocebo effect induces negative effects due to negative
T
5 expectations. Cannabis is a generally well known product, particularly as recreational
P
6 drug to induce desired psychotropic effects such as euphoria, relaxation, and
I
R
7 perceptual alterations. Therefore, it is plausible that patients in this study were
C
8 influenced by expectations, which may have influenced the occurrence of AEs.
S
9
U
10 A major limitation of the present study is the small sample size, which is insufficiently
N
11 large to allow subgroup analyses. However, considering the confidence intervals of
A
12 the effect, it is doubtful that an increased sample size would have been resulted in
M
13 significant differences.
D
14 Furthermore, the present study comprises a heterogeneous patient population
E
15 regarding etiology and anatomical site of the pain. However, all patients suffered
T
16 from chronic abdominal pain, which is associated with central sensitization and
P
17 alterations in central cognitive and autonomic processing.8, 13 The presence of central
E
18 sensitization in chronic pain patients supports the choice of treatments that reduce
C
19 pain by normalizing hyperexcitable central neural activity, which makes the initial pain
C
20 etiology or peripheral stimulus and past or currently received pain treatments less
A
21 important. These variables and other patient characteristics might have contributed to
22 inter-individual differences in treatment effects – while on the other hand enhancing

Supplementary material 1: Methods
Study procedures
Potential participating patients were screened for eligibility within 7-35 days prior to
T
start of study treatment (visit 1). Screening included demographics, medical history,
P
concomitant medication, smoking habits, physical examination, 12-lead
I
R
electrocardiogram (ECG), standard laboratory blood tests (hematology, biochemistry,
C
virology) and urine screening tests (urinalysis, drug screening and pregnancy test).
S
Furthermore, all patients received a diary to report pain scores, add-on analgesics
U
and adverse events.
N
Study days were carried out at the clinical research center of the Radboudumc,
A
where each patient stayed in a separate quiet room.
M
D
Secondary efficacy outcomes
Pain related questionnaires includeE d the patient global impression of change (PGIC)1
T
evaluated on day 15 and 50-52, pain catastrophizing scale (PCS)2, 3 evaluated on
P
day 1, 15 and 50-52, and pain anxiety symptom scale (PASS)4 evaluated on day 1
E
and 50-52. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)5, and quality of life
C
questionnaire (RAND SF-36)6 were filled out at day 1 and 50-52. Treatment
C
satisfaction (TSQM v. II)7 and the patient appetite level (AppLe) were evaluated at
A
the last study visit. The AppLe was a modification of the PGIC to evaluate any
change in appetite in the last week and compared to before the study period.
Drug effects on alertness, mood, and calmness were explored using the Bond &
Lader questionnaire, and potential subjective psychotomimetic (psychedelic) effects
were evaluated using the Bowdle questionnaire.8, 9 Both questionnaires were filled
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
out on day 1, 4-5, 9-10, 15, and 50-52.
Left-right (roll) and anterior-posterior (pitch) postural movements were measured
using a gyroscope-based measurement system (SwayStar™, Balance International
Innovations GmbH, Switzerland), which was attached to the waist of the patient.
T
Patients stood, without shoes, as still as possible in a standardized base of support
P
with their arms hanging at both sides of their body. Body sway was measured for one
I
R
minute with eyes open, one minute with eyes closed and for 30 seconds with eyes
C
open standing on one leg of preference. Patients were asked to fixate at one point

Safety and Tolerability
D
Safety and tolerability were evaluated using spontaneously reported adverse events
E

T
recorded in a daily diary, at study visits and phone calls up to 2 weeks after study

Pharmacokinetics
Plasma concentrations of THC and its active metabolite 11-OH-THC were
determined predose on day 1, 15 and 50-52 to confirm a baseline state, determine
trough levels and test the compliance. The PK sampling on day 50-52 was extended
with 7 additional samples time-locked after medication intake at 0:30, 1:00, 2:00,
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
3:00, 4:00, 5:00, and 5:55 hours postdose. Blood samples were collected in 4ml
EDTA tubes and immediately after collection wrapped in aluminum foil and kept on
ice. Samples were centrifuged within 30 minutes at 2000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
The handling of THC samples was done avoiding direct light. The separated plasma
T
was divided into primary and backup samples, and stored at –80°C until bioanalysis.
P
Bioanalysis (Analytisch Biochemisch Laboratorium b.v., Assen, the Netherlands) was
I
R
performed using a validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass
C
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assay method according to good laboratory practice
S
procedures. The lower limit of quantification for THC and 11-OH-THC was 0.100 ng
U
ml−1.
N
A
Statistical analysis
M
The primary outcome of this study was change in pain intensity, measured by the
D
VAS in a daily diary, between THC and placebo treatment. VAS pain was
mean mean
E
analyzed by an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) of the VAS at day 50-52 (last
mean
T
day of diary) between placebo and THC that incorporates VAS at baseline (mean
mean
P
day -5 to -1 pre-treatment) as covariate in the analyses. Possible moderating
E
variables such as subpopulation (pancreatitis/postsurgical) and opiate user (y/n) were
C
evaluated by observing potential interactions and post hoc subgroup analyses.
C
Secondary efficacy outcomes were analyzed in a similar manner. All participants who
A
received the study medication for at least 36 days were included in the efficacy
analyses according to the intention to treat principle. Dropouts before day 36 were
replaced and data of dropouts were excluded from further analyses for efficacy.
Safety analyses was performed on all randomized subjects who received at least one
dose of THC or placebo.
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
For statistical analysis SPSS software for Windows v.20 was used. All statistical tests
were performed two-tailed, and the limit for statistical significance was set at P<0.05.
The initial study in CP patients was powered (α = 0.05, power = 0.80) to detect a
decrease of at least 1.0 VAS pain in the THC group compared with placebo,
mean
T
resulting in 34 patients per group. Variances in pain scores were extrapolated from a
P
similar study with pregabalin.10 No information was available to estimate the SD in
I
R
the initial PSP study, therefore, same numbers were adopted for this study. Input
C
variances for the integrated study were considered to be too unreliable to conduct a
S
sample size calculation. Therefore, no sample size calculation was performed for this
U
early phase 2 clinical trial.
N
Non-compartmental analysis to determine plasma PK parameters of the active
A
compounds, THC and 11-OH-THC, was performed using the WinNonlin modeling
M
and analysis software (version 2.1 a; Pharsight Inc., Apex, NC). The maximum

plasma concentration (C ), the time to reach C (T ), and the AUC from 0 up to
max max max
E
the last measurement (AUC , using the linear log trapezoidal rule) were calculated
0–last

from the individual plasma concentration-versus-time profiles. The terminal half-life
P
(t ) was calculated only if there were two or more points (excluding C ) in the
1/2 term max
E
elimination phase of the plasma concentration–time curve with r2 > 0.80. For that
C
reason, one patient was excluded from this part of the analysis for THC and two
C
patients for 11-OH-THC. Subsequently, the areas under the plasma concentration

curves extrapolated to the end of the dosing period (AUC ) were calculated using
tau
the linear log trapezoidal rule and extrapolation to 8 hours.
