Abstract
A randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled crossover study was conducted in 16 patients
with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy to assess the short-term efficacy and tolerability of
inhaled cannabis. In a cross-over design, each participant was exposed to a single dosing session
of placebo, low (1% tetrahydrocannabinol, THC), medium (4% THC), or high (7% THC) doses of
cannabis. Baseline spontaneous pain, evoked pain and cognitive testing were performed. Subjects
were then administered aerosolized cannabis or placebo and the pain intensity and subjective
highness score was measured at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes and then every 30 minutes for an
additional 3 hours. Cognitive testing was performed at 5 and 30 minutes and then every 30
minutes for an additional 3 hours. The primary analysis compared differences in spontaneous pain
over time between doses using linear mixed effects models. There was a significant difference in
spontaneous pain scores between doses (p<0.001). Specific significant comparisons were placebo
versus low, medium, high dose (p = 0.031, 0.04 and <0.001 respectively) and high versus low,
medium (both p<0.001). There was a significant effect of the high dose on foam brush and von
Frey evoked pain (both p<0.001). There was a significant negative effect (impaired performance)
of the high dose on two of the three neuropsychological tests (Paced Auditory Serial Addition
Test, Trail Making Test B.
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) appears to be increasing so that it
now effects an estimated 366 million individuals worldwide.[1] DPN occurs in
approximately 50% of patients with diabetes with about 15% being painful.[2, 3]. DPN can
present in several forms ranging from mononeuropathy to distal polyneuropathy. Patients
often complain of pain and hyperalgesia in their feet, usually worse at night. Other

symptoms include numbness, paresthesia, sensitivity to touch, unsteadiness and weakness.
[4] Multiple studies have demonstrated the adverse impact and high healthcare costs of DPN
with one study showing a 1.5-4 times higher expense than for postherpetic neuralgia.[5-7]
There are currently 2 FDA approved medications for the treatment of diabetic peripheral
neuropathy. Many patients do not achieve satisfactory relief with current treatments., which
suggests there is a need for research into additional therapeutic approaches to treat this
condition.[8]
Preclinical studies show that a major cannabinoid receptor, CB1, is expressed in regions
involved in dorsal root ganglion [9], dorsal horn of the spinal cord [10], periaquaductal grey
and raphe nucleus [11, 12] and forebrain. [13] In addition, animal models of nerve injury
have demonstrated an upregulation of cannabinoid receptors, suggesting a possible role of
the cannabinoids in the treatment of neuropathic pain. [14-16] The cannabinoids have been
shown to be effective in a number of animal models of neuropathic pain including diabetic
neuropathy [17, 18] and chronic nerve constriction.[19, 20] Although 4 recent studies on the
effect of inhaled cannabis on neuropathic pain have been promising, none have focused
specifically on painful DPN.[21-24]
In a randomized, short-term, placebo controlled, four-period cross-over study we studied the
effects of low, medium, and high-dose inhaled vaporized cannabis on the pain and
hyperalgesia of DPN. Our hypothesis was that cannabis would result in a dose-dependent
reduction in spontaneous and evoked pain with a concomitant dose-dependent effect on
cognitive function.
METHODS
A randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled crossover study was conducted in sixteen
patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy to assess the short-term efficacy and
tolerability of inhaled cannabis. Subjects participated in four sessions, separated by 2 weeks,
where they were exposed to placebo, or to low (1% tetrahydrocannabinol, THC), medium
(4% THC), or high (7% THC) dose of cannabis. Baseline assessments of spontaneous pain,
evoked pain and cognitive testing were performed. Subjects were then administered
aerosolized cannabis or placebo and pain intensity and subjective “highness” scores was
measured at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes and then every 30 minutes for an additional 3
hours. Cognitive testing was performed at 5 and 30 minutes and then every 30 minutes for
an additional 3 hours.
This trial was performed as an outpatient study at the General Clinical Research Center at
the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Medical Center. The study was approved
and monitored by the UCSD Institutional Review Board, the Research Advisory Panel of
California, the US Food and Drug Administration, the US Drug Enforcement
Administration, the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the University of
California Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research.
All active and placebo cannabis was provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and
was constructed of the same base material. Active strengths ranged from 1% to 7% Δ -9-

tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] concentration by weight. Cannabidiol concentration was <1%.
Placebo cannabis was whole plant material from which the cannabinoids had been extracted
and was identical in appearance to active cannabis. Cannabis was placed in an airtight
container and stored in a locked, alarmed freezer at the UCSD Medical Center
Investigational Drug Service Pharmacy. Cannabis was humidified at room temperature
within a dessicator using a saturated sodium chloride solution for 12–24 h before use. The
potency of the cannabis was provided by the Research Triangle Institute, a sub-contractor to
the NIDA Drug Supply Program and the University of Mississippi. Under the contract
arrangement, RTI prepares, analyzes, stores, and ships marijuana to recipients designated by
NIDA. Confirmatory testing for the potency of cannabis used in this study was not done.
However, prior CMCR studies conducted initial periodic testing to confirm the potency and
stability of each batch of cannabis material provided by NIDA. Cannabis cigarettes were
selected from each batch, and the entire content of each cannabis cigarette was extracted into
Folch's reagent (chloroform:methanol, 2:1) for analysis by gas chromatography. This
internal testing demonstrated adequate agreement between the labeled potency and actual
potency, and confirmed the stability of stored cannabis material over the life of the study.
Nurses weighed material before and after vaporization and returned all used and unused
medication to the pharmacy Investigational Drug Service for appropriate disposal.
Randomization was performed by a research pharmacist using a random number
permutations, and the key to study assignment was withheld from investigators until
completion statistical analyses.[25]
Participants were men and women 1) age 18 or older with 2) diabetes mellitus type 1 or type
2, who had stable glycemia (HbA1c ≤ 11%) and were maintained by diet or a stable regimen
of diabetic therapy for at least 12 weeks before the evaluation, 3) presence of both
spontaneous and evoked pain in the feet, 4) at least a six-month history of painful diabetic
peripheral neuropathy diagnosed according to research diagnostic criteria (using the
Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument)[26], which included the presence of abnormal
bilateral physical findings (reduced distal tendon reflexes, distal sensory loss) or
electrophysiological abnormalities (distal leg sensory nerve conduction studies), plus
paresthesiae and a pain of intensity of ≥ 4 on the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale. Exclusion
criteria were current DSM-IV substance use disorders; (2) lifetime history of dependence on
cannabis; (3) lifetime history of DSM-IV schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, generalized
anxiety or panic disorder, or previous psychosis with or intolerance to cannabinoids; (4)
Current use of cannabis within the past 30 days; positive urine toxicology screen for
cannabinoids during the wash-in week before initiating study treatment; (6) pregnant or
planning pregnancy; or positive urine pregnancy test at baseline; (7) serious medical
conditions that might affect participant safety or the conduct of the trial (e.g., cardiac or
pulmonary disease); (8) other medical conditions that are associated with peripheral
neuropathy or pain of vascular origin that might confound the assessment of painful DPN;
(9) lower extremity amputations other than toes; and documented unstable blood glucose
(fasting < 70mg/dl or random blood glucose >250mg/dl). If subjects were taking
medications to treat the DPN pain, they were required to maintain a stable dose for 30 days
prior and for the duration of the study.

Subjects passing a brief telephone screening directed towards painful diabetic neuropathy
were invited to in person interviews which included: 1) Medical History: A systematic semi-
structured interview was conducted, and as above, individuals with cardiovascular disease,
uncontrolled hypertension, and chronic pulmonary disease [e.g., asthma, COPD], were
excluded; 2) Substance Abuse History: The Substance Abuse Module of the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule for DSM-IV[27] was administered to exclude individuals with current
substance use disorders or a past history of dependence on cannabis; and 3) Psychiatric
Screen: The Screening Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [SCID-IV]
was used to identify individuals reporting potential histories of anxiety or psychotic
disorders using the appropriate module of the SCID-IV, and excluded if these disorders were
diagnosed. All subjects were provided information about the range of subjective effects they
may experience from inhaling marijuana, and were instructed in relaxation techniques,
should those effects become disturbing. None of the subjects required these relaxation
techniques. Vital signs were monitored throughout the protocol, and subjects remained in the
laboratory under direct observation by staff for two hours after the cannabis dosing was
completed. Before the participant was released from the clinic, a final vital sign and self-
report status check was made, and the subject was transported from the clinic by taxicab or
prearranged transportation.
At each session prior to study drug delivery, the following were measured in order: 1) a
spontaneous and evoked pain score; 2) Beck Depression Inventory-II; 3) cognitive testing;
and 4) a baseline blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature were measured.
After study drug administration, the following were assessed in order: 1) spontaneous and
evoked pain scores at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes and every 30 minutes thereafter for 4 hours.
2) subjective “highness” scores, euphoria and somnolence at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240
minutes; 3) cognitive testing at 5 minutes, 30 minutes and 30 minutes thereafter for 4 hours.
Each subject received placebo and a single dosing session of three doses of cannabis (1%,
4%, and 7% THC). A washout period of two weeks between dose administrations was
implemented to minimize a carry-over effect of the cannabis treatment. Study treatments
were administered under direct observation by a study nurse using a cued-inhalation
procedure. Subjects were given verbal instructions prior to initiation of the procedure. The
respective dose of cannabis or placebo cigarette was aerosolized using the VOLCANO-
System-Vaporizer [VSV][Storz and Bickel, Oakland, CA]. Cannabis was heated to 200° C
(below the point of combustion), at which point the VSV released the active ingredients of
the cannabis through vaporization by hot air. This vapor was captured in a bag attached to
the VSV, and a mouthpiece attached to the bag allowed for inhalation. The subject was
seated in a chair in the designated smoking room and given the bag containing aerosolized
cannabis. Using a modified Foltin procedure [28] study nurse provided verbal cues from an
adjacent room. The nurse instructed the participant to inhale for 5 seconds. The participant
was then instructed to remove the mouthpiece from the lips, hold the inhalation for 10
seconds [if possible], and then to exhale fully. The participant was given a 40-second resting
period. This process was repeated three more times, at which time the cannabis content of
the bag would be fully depleted. Dosing levels were controlled by administration of cannabis
with measured THC concentrations of 0, 1, 4 and 7 percent by weight. At a weight of 400mg

of plant material per administration, dosing therefore was controlled at 0, 4, 16 or 28 mg
THC per dosing session.
Pain scores were measured using a Visual Analog Scale. This consists of a 10 cm line with
“no pain” written at one end and the “worst imaginable pain” written at the other end. The
patient was asked to place a mark along the line, which corresponded with their pain. The
distance, in centimeters (cm), from the “no pain” end to the location of the mark gives a
measurement of the pain. Subjects were asked to rate their spontaneous pain and evoked
pain to a gentle stroke with a 1 inch foam brush and pinprick with a 5.18 von Frey hair
filament on the dorsum of the most painful foot. The foam brush was gently stroked over 1
second and the von Frey filament was applied until bending observed for 3 seconds followed
by a pain score.
Psychomotor speed, attention and cognitive sequencing was measured using the Trail-
Making Test [29]. In Part A, subjects were asked to quickly connect [in ascending order] a
series of randomly arranged dots numbered from 1 to 25. Part B requires subjects to arrange
a series of randomly arranged circles in a designated sequential order, based on alternating
numbers and letters [i.e., 1 to A to 2 to B, etc.] In addition to the skills required in Part A of
this test, shifting cognitive sets was required for Part B. The primary outcome was the time
to complete each task.
Attention, working memory, and information processing speed was measured using
thePaced Auditory Serial Attention Test [PASAT] [30]. In this test, a set of randomized
digits was serially presented via tape recording. Subjects were to add the current number to
the number that preceded it and responded with the total. Thus, after each new digit was
presented, a new total was achieved. The number of correct responses was the primary
outcome variable.
Subjective highness was assessed by asking the participants to rate their feeling of “high” on
a 10-point scale from 0 (“not high at all” ) to 10 (“the highest you've ever been”) at each
assessment point.[31] Euphoria and somnolence was assessed using a “yes/no” format. Any
other adverse effects that the subjects voluntarily reported were recorded.
Baseline depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]. The
BDI-II consists of 21 questions, each graded on a four-point scale ranging from 0 to 3;
statements are ordered to show increasing severity of the cognitive and somatic dimensions
of depressed mood. Scores range from 0-63, with higher scores indicating more depressed
mood. Scores from 0-13 indicate minimal depressive symptoms, 14-19 mild depression,
20-28 moderate depression, and 29-63 severe depression. The items of the BDI were
clinically derived and have undergone extensive testing for reliability and internal
consistency. [32]
Three types of pain were statistically analyzed: spontaneous, evoked foam brush, and evoked
von Frey. Mixed effects models with subject-specific random intercepts were used for all
analyses, unless stated otherwise. Changes in pain scores over 240 minutes following the
inhalation were analyzed using two end points. First, pain score at each time point were
regressed on log -transformed time and drug dose. Time-dose interactions were

investigated, but excluded from the final models due to non-significant p-values. A
significant interaction term would indicate differences in slopes [a measure of change in pain
over time] between different doses. Without the interactions, models assume differences in
pain scores between doses to be constant at all time points. Log transformation of time was
used, because the observed pain scores exhibited a steep initial decrease in their values
[Figure 1], followed by a more gradual change. Such patterns are consistent with logarithmic
functions. To evaluate a potential unblinding effect of the order of the placebo dose [first
visit versus other] on mean pain scores, it was added as a covariate, but it did not have a
significant effect on the outcomes, thus it was not kept in the models. Separately, an
indicator for previous study treatment condition (5 levels: none, placebo, low, medium, and
high) was added to the models as a covariate to assess a potential carryover effect. The
secondary end points for analyzing change in pain scores over time were individual
differences in pain scores between prior to and after inhalation for each time point. Lower
values of change in pain correspond to better pain relief. These changes were compared
between doses with the repeated measures ANCOVA, where pain scores at baseline [time =
0] were used as covariate. This method was also used to compare doses on the average
minimum achieved pain level over the span of 240 minutes and the average time it took to
achieve the lowest pain. Tukey's HSD test for multiple testing was used to perform post hoc
pair-wise comparisons. Cohen's d, referred to as simply d in the following text, was used to
estimate effect size for the mean differences between any two doses.
Following recent recommendations for reporting outcomes from clinical trials we also
calculated percent reduction in pain from baseline [time 0] to minimum achieved pain was
calculated for each type of pain. . Using a commonly-cited cut-off criterion of 30% as
clinically relevant response to pain treatment[33], proportions of participants who achieved
pain reduction of 30% or more were compared between doses using repeated measures
analyses with mixed effects logistic regressions. Due to concerns that this approach results
in greatly reduced power [34-36] we also analyzed percent pain reduction on a continuous
scale. (https://painconsortium.nih.gov/NIH_Pain_Programs/Task_Force/
cLBP_RTF_FullReport.pdf) The average percent reduction in pain scores were analyzed
using repeated measures ANCOVA with baseline pain score as a covariate. P-values for pair-
wise one-sided comparisons of cannabis doses with placebo were adjusted for multiple
comparisons using Dunnet method.
Statistical methods described above were also applied to evaluate effects of dose on
neurocognitive performance as measured by change in scores of three tests: Trail Making
Test A, Trail Making Test B, and PASAT-50, for which raw scores were converted to a
standardized scale in which a lower score indicates worse performance. Participants showed
improvement in test performance over the four visits, therefore visit order was included in
these models to control for practice effects. Baseline [time = 0] performance score was also
included to account for initial differences between doses. Lower values (i.e., larger negative
numbers) in the change in scaled scores for neurocognitive testing correspond to worse
performance.
Similarly, changes in Subjective Highness Score were evaluated using repeated measures
ANCOVA models to regress change in scores on treatment and baseline value as covariate.

Larger changes in Subjective Highness scores correspond to greater feeling of highness
measured over time.
Finally, the proportions of people who experienced euphoria and somnolence during the
experiment were compared between doses, using mixed effects logistic regressions with
random subject effect. Where appropriate, Firth's correction was applied. [37]
All tests were two-sided and deemed significant if p-value was less than 0.05. Assumptions
appropriate for parametric methods were checked prior to each analysis and, when
necessary, outcome transformations were used. All analyses were performed using statistical
software R version 3.0.1 [www.R-project.org].
Prior to the study, power analyses were performed and showed that a sample size of 20 was
needed to detect a significant beta coefficient in a repeated measures regression model at
alpha level = 0.05 and 80% power, where the size of the coefficient is equivalent to a partial
correlation of 0.45 between cannabis and pain outcome.
RESULTS
Thirty-one individuals were screened. Of these, 7 were not eligible for medical (N=2) or
psychiatric (N=1) reasons, or insufficient pain intensity/type (e.g., nighttime pain only).
Additional 8 subjects were excluded for other reasons, resulting in 16 consenting
participants that were randomized. One participant completed only 2 treatments [placebo
and high dose]; those data were used in analyses as appropriate. Baseline characteristics of
the study's cohort are given in Table 1. In general, the sample consisted of approximately
equal numbers of men and women, of African-American or White ethnicity, who were
middle-aged or older, and who had longstanding, often insulin-requiring, diabetes mellitus.
Patients reported chronic neuropathic pain of moderately severe intensity. One third of the
group had a BMI in the obese range. The 8 participants who reported use of analgesic
medications did not statistically differ from the rest of the group on most baseline
characteristics, including baseline pain score, duration of diabetes and pain [all p > 0.10;
detailed results are not shown], with the exception of height. Users of analgesic medications
were on average 3.6 inches taller than non-users [p = 0.027].
Mixed effects model shows that, with every 1 log units of time, spontaneous pain intensity
10
score decreased, on average, by 1.1 points. There was significant difference in spontaneous
pain scores between doses [p < 0.001] [Figure 1A]. Specifically, average pain intensity score
in the placebo dose was 0.44 points higher than the pain score in the low dose [p = 0.031],
0.42 points higher as compared to the medium dose [p = 0.04], and 1.2 points higher as
compared to the high dose [p < 0.001]. There was no statistical difference between the low
and the medium dose [p = 0.92], but the average pain score in the high dose was 0.73 and
0.75 points lower than the average scores in the low and the medium doses, respectively
[both p < 0.001]. The overall effect of dose on pain remained significant [p < 0.001] after
controlling for prior dose level, which was also a significant predictor of pain [p < 0.001].
On the dose level, only the differences in pain scores between high dose and other doses
remained significant. Specifically, the adjusted mean pain scores for high dose were 1.1

points lower than in placebo, 1.01 points lower than in low dose, and 0.9 points lower than
in medium dose [all p < 0.001].
For evoked foam brush pain the average reduction in pain was 0.86 points for every 1 log
10
units of time [Figure 1B], and significant differences in mean pain scores were observed
between the placebo and the medium doses [dif = 0.41, p = 0.045], between the placebo and
the high doses [dif = 1.06, p < 0.001], between the low and the high doses [dif = 0.75, p <
0.001], and between the medium and the high doses [dif = 0.65, p = 0.002]. After adjusting
for prior treatment, significant differences [all p < 0.001] in mean evoked foam brush pain
scores were observed between the placebo and the high dose [dif = 1.1], the low and the
high doses [dif = 0.92], and the medium and the high doses [dif = 0.73]. Similarly, for
evoked von Frey pain the average reduction in pain was 0.94 points for every 1 log units of
10
time [Figure 1C], and significant differences in mean pain scores were observed between the
placebo and the high doses [dif = 0.70, p < 0.001], between the low and the high doses [dif =
0.54, p = 0.007], and between the medium and the high doses [dif = 0.40, p = 0.04]. These
differences remained significant, after adjusting for prior treatment [placebo vs high: dif =
0.66, p = 0.001; low vs high: dif = 0.69, p = 0.001; medium vs high: dif = 0.52, p = 0.013].
Mean change in pain intensity scores was compared between conditions at every time point.
Table 2 lists estimated means and standard deviations of change in pain adjusted for baseline
pain values, where negative values indicate decrease in pain as compared to baseline. The
repeated measures ANCOVA analyses showed that decreases in spontaneous pain for the
high dose cannabis were significantly greater than decreases in the placebo after 30 minutes
[d = −1.02, p = 0.026], 45 minutes [d = −1.15, p = 0.006], and 60 minutes [d = −1.05, p =
0.016]. For changes in foam brush evoked pain, when comparing high dose cannabis and
placebo the effect sizes were d = −.089 (p = 0.06) and d = −.89 (p = .12) at 45 and 60
minutes, respectively. A significantly greater effect of high dose compared to placebo was
also seen in analysis of changes in von Frey pain after 15 minutes [d = −0.94, p = 0.04], 45
minutes [d = −0.88, p = 0.06], and 60 minutes [d = −0.94, p = 0.04].
The minimum pain score achieved during each 4-hour session was obtained for every
participant, as well as the time (in minutes) it took to achieve it. The unadjusted average
values for these measures are given in Table 3, separately for each dose and pain type. On
average, the lowest minimum pain score was achieved in the high dose and the highest
minimum pain score was in the placebo dose. However, models that adjusted for baseline
pain score, showed that these differences did not reach statistical significance, although, for
spontaneous pain, the effects size between the medium and the placebo doses was d = −0.61,
and between the high and the placebo doses d = −0.60. There were no statistical differences
between doses in average time it took to reach the lowest pain score.
Table 3 also shows results of the analyses of percent (%) reduction in pain scores from
baseline to the time point when the pain was the lowest. Pairwise comparisons showed that
the meanpercent reduction in spontaneous pain for the high dose was significantly greater
compared to the placebo dose [70% vs 53%, d = 0.81, p = 0.032], while comparison
between the medium and the placebo doses approached significance [65% vs 53%, d = 0.72,
p = 0.06]. Comparison of the proportions of participants who achieved at least 30%

reduction in spontaneous pain scores did not show statistically significant results. Analyses
of percebt reduction in foam brush evoked and, separately, von Frey evoked pain scores did
not show statistically significant differences between doses.
Results for the neurocognitive testing scaled scores at each time point are shown in Figures
2A-C. The overall tests for differences between doses in mean changes from baseline at each
time point were not significant for any of the cognitive tests. However, using a less
conservative pairwise analysis and adjusting for visit order and baseline scaled score [time =
0], performance on the PASAT during placebo differed from medium [d = −1.03, p = .024]
and high doses [d = −1.14, p = .008] at 15 minutes, while Trail Making Part B differed
between placebo and high dose only at 120 minutes [d = −1.15, p = 0.009]. There were no
significant differences between treatment conditions on Trail Making Part A at any time
point. The largest mean scaled score changes with treatment, compared to baseline, were
typically < 1.5 scaled score points. Given the small sample size and limited power, we also
examined effect sizes. Effect sizes were greater than 0.5 on Trail Making Part A at 15
minutes for high vs. low [d = −0.63] and high vs. medium doses [d = −0.80]; Trail Making
Part B at 15 minutes [medium vs. low dose; d = −0.56], 60 minutes [high vs. placebo; d =
−0.53], 120 minutes [high, medium, and low vs. placebo; d = −1.15, −0.71, and −0.75,
respectively]; and on the PASAT at 15 minutes [high, medium, low vs. placebo; d = −1.14,
−1.03, and −0.72 respectively] and 60 minutes [high vs. placebo {d = −0.81}, high vs. low
{d = −0.70}].
Analyses of changes in Subjective Highness Score showed a stair-step effect of dose that
mostly wore off after 4 hours [Table 4]. Significant differences in changes [all ps < 0.05]
were observed at 30 minutes [medium vs. placebo d = 1.14], at 60 minutes [medium vs.
placebo d = 1.49, high vs. placebo d = 1.64, high vs. low d = 1.01], at 90 minutes [medium
vs. placebo d = 0.97, high vs. placebo d = 1.21, high vs. low d = 1.13], and at 120 minutes
[medium vs. placebo d = 1.25, high vs. placebo d = 1.47, medium vs. low = 1.11, high vs.
low d = 1.34], but not at 240 minutes. Additionally, mixed effects models were used to
correlate Subjective Highness Score with spontaneous pain score. The analysis estimated
that, as Highness Score increased by 1 point, the pain score decreased on average by 0.32
points [p < 0.001].
Adverse effects of cannabis were defined as experiences of euphoria and somnolence [Table
5]. The proportion of participants experiencing euphoria ranged from 100% for high dose
cannabis to nearly 60% for placebo. Mixed-effects logistic regressions showed that the
differences in proportions were significant for high [p = 0.002] and medium [p = 0.042]
doses in contrast to placebo. Compared to placebo, only the high dose cannabis had a
significantly larger proportion of participants reporting somnolence [p = 0.018].
DISCUSSION
Our short-term, single session, crossover study in general found a dose dependent reduction
in pain intensity in response to inhaled cannabis in patients with DPN. Overall, our finding
of an analgesic effect of cannabis is consistent with other trials of cannabis in diverse
neuropathic pain syndromes. [21-24, 38, 39]

Nevertheless, there is some uncertainty regarding the dosing range that results in analgesia
after administration of cannabis. Some recent studies on the potential effectiveness of
cannabis have shown that a medium dose [3.5% THC] is as effective as the high dose [7%
THC]. [21, 22, 38] Another dose-finding study examined doses of inhaled cannabis ranging
from 0-9.4% THC on 23 patients with chronic neuropathic pain. This translated into a daily
dose ranging from approximately 2mg to 7mg THC. Only the high dose separated from
placebo. [23] That high dose is lower than most of those delivered in our protocol (eg, 4mg,
16mg, and 28mg THC). Studies in experimentally-induced pain suggest that high doses may
increase pain. [31, 40] In addition, a phase IIb study in cancer pain showed that a sublingual
spray of a THC: Cannabidiol [CBD] combination was only effective at the low and medium
dose but not the high dose. [41] The uncertainty of dosing from these studies may reflect
differences in pain mechanism, small sample size or psychosocial status of the subjects.
[42-44]
There was a significant dose dependent effect of cannabis on both spontaneous and evoked
pain in our study. However, the effect on spontaneous pain was more consistent than the
effect on evoked pain. A previous study we performed in healthy volunteers using the same
doses as those used in our current study showed a significant reduction in capsaicin-induced
spontaneous and evoked pain but not secondary hyperalgesia. [31] Our current findings
taken together with the previous study in healthy volunteers suggest a supraspinal
mechanism of cannabis, as hyperalgesia and allodynia are likely spinally mediated.
Marijuana contains nearly 500 known compounds, of which over 80 are classified as
cannabinoids. [45] The most abundant and main psychoactive compound in cannabis is
THC. [46] Other major cannabinoids found in cannabis are cannabidiol (CBD) and
cannabinol (CBN). CBD is the second most abundant compound in the plant. [47] CBD is
less psychoactive than THC and appears to enhance the effects of THC, although it is
unclear whether this is due to a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics interaction. [48]
Nabiximols is a sublingual spray containing both THC and CBD that is currently in phase III
trials for cancer pain. A preliminary study in 177 cancer patients showed that the THC:CBD
combination was superior to THC alone. [49]. Since the CBD concentration in the cannabis
used in this study was so low (<1%), the effects observed are most likely due to THC.
With respect to cognition, there were modest effects of treatment. Attention/working
memory, as measured by the PASAT, showed the greatest impact at 15 minutes post-
treatment, with some residual, albeit non-significant, differences in high vs. low dose and
placebo at 60 minutes. Interestingly, the effect on speeded set switching was greatest at 120
minutes, with the high dose vs. placebo difference reaching statistical significance, and
medium and low dose showing non-significant effect sizes of approximately .7 when
compared to placebo. Of note, most of the scaled score differences were less than 1.5 points
lower than baseline and did not drop below a score of 8 [in normative groups, scaled scores
have a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 3], indicating that there were no dramatic
declines in cognition, and not into the impaired range. However, it is possible that these
changes could impact tasks requiring intact attention and speeded processing [e.g.,
automobile driving] and as such these activities should be avoided in the hours after
treatment, particularly at higher doses. This may limit the clinical usefulness with some

patients. However, whether repeated dosing at low, clinically-effective levels results in
increased tolerance to the psychoactive effects is not known and is an area in need of future
research.. In addition, this study utilized a very brief battery, and thus did not address
cognitive functions such as learning and memory, or psychomotor speed [e.g., Grooved
Pegboard], which have been impacted in other clinical trials of cannabis for the treatment of
pain. [24]
Our study used vaporization of the cannabis leaf as the delivery method. Heating the
cannabis leaves to below combustion temperatures [175-225 degrees C] releases the
cannabinoids in a vapor that is easily inhaled and titrated to effect. Vaporization is an
attractive delivery method for research since it permits the inhalation of volatilized gases
without exposure to hazardous pyrroles and the high concentrations of carbon monoxide
than occurs with combustion. [39] In addition, the pharmacokinetics of inhalation are
superior to ingestion as peak effects occur quickly and are more easily titrated. As shown in
figure 1, there is an initial steep drop in pain within the first 15 minutes followed by a slower
decrease in pain over time. By comparison ingestion of cannabinoids results in a delayed
and highly variable onset and offset of action across individuals, a reduced ability to titrate
dosing, and more side effects. On the other hand, in clinical settings many individuals may
find vaporization to be inconvenient or adverse in its own right. This may further limit the
clinical applicability of cannabis. . Finally all patients reported either euphoria or
somnolence as adverse effects, which may limit the acceptability of cannabis for analgesia,
as is the case for many patients who are prescribed opioids for pain relief. In any event this
was a single dose study and no conclusions can be drawn over the long term tolerability as
compared with currently available therapeutics dosed over weeks. [42]
Limitations of our study include possible lack of blinding due to the psychoactive effects of
THC and cross-over design, the brief duration of the trial, a restricted assessment of
neuropsychiatric and other adverse effects, and the small number of subjects in the study.
There are two cross-over trials of cannabis that assessed blinding. Results suggest that with
the acute delivery, subjects (whether naïve or experienced users) are no more likely than by
chance to guess assignment. However with continued exposure, the chance of guessing
correctly increases. [23] Another study showed that subjects who received placebo first were
less likely to guess correctly as compared to those who received cannabis first. [22][20]
Studies in healthy volunteers show that even placebo cannabis results in reports of “high
feeling” although less than with active cannabis, showing dose dependent increase in reports
of “highness”. [31] However, in our study, after adjusting for previous exposures, the results
remained significant. Another limitation is the small number of subjects in the study. Power
analysis showed that we would need a total of 20 subjects to detect an effect, however the
study was discontinued at 16 subjects due to difficulties with recruitment during the time-
frame of funding. We chose to focus on anticipated AEs (subjective highness, euphoria,
somnolence and cognitive impairment) and relied on the subjects to voluntarily report other
AEs. Therefore, we may have missed more AEs than reported. In addition, we used the
Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. Although this instrument is a validated
screening tool, the requirement for either reduced DTRs or abnormal electrophysiological
abnormalities will push the selection of patients with at least a component of large fiber
neuropathy, essentially excluding those with predominant small fiber neuropathy.

Furthermore, there may have been an indirect effect on pain through a reduction in anxiety
that results from cannabis.[50] We tried to control for this by excluding patients with a
history of anxiety.
Despite these limitations, these preliminary findings, along with prior studies, suggest that
cannabis might have analgesic effects in neuropathic pain syndromes, including in patients
with treatment-refractory DPN. Larger randomized trials with longer-term follow-up are
warranted to assess the analgesic effectiveness of cannabis.

Perspective
This small, short-term, placebo-controlled trial of inhaled cannabis demonstrated a dose
dependent reduction in diabetic peripheral neuropathy pain in patients with treatment-
refractory pain. This adds preliminary evidence to support further research on the efficacy

Minimum pain score achieved in 240 minutes, time (minutes) it took to achieve the minimum, percent (%)
reduction in pain associated with the minimum pain, and proportion of participants who have achieved 30% or
more in pain reduction. Values are shown as mean (standard deviation) or N(%). Lower minimum pain scores
and greater % pain reduction indicate better pain relief. Lower times to minimum pain indicate faster pain
relief.
