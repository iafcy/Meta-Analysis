SUMMARY. Noncardiacchestpainisassociatedwithpoorqualityoflifeandhighcareexpenditure.Themajor-
ity of noncardiac chest pain is either gastresophageal reflux disease related or due to esophageal motility disor-
ders, and the rest are considered functional chest pain (FCP) due to central and peripheral hypersensitivity.
Current treatment of FCP improves 40–50% of patients. Cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB ) and 2 (CB ) modulate

sion and potentially could reduce esophageal hypersensitivity. We performed a prospective study to evaluate its
effects on pain threshold, frequency, and intensity in FCP. Subjects with FCP received dronabinol (5 mg, twice
daily; n57; average age, 44 years; mean body mass index, 26.7) or placebo (n56; average age, 42 years; mean
body mass index, 25.9) for 28 days (4 weeks). Chest pain, general health, and anxiety/depression questionnaires
wereassessedatbaselineandat4weeks.Subjectsunderwentanesophagealballoondistentiontestpriortotreat-
ment and on last dayof the study. Dronabinol increased pain thresholds significantly (3.0 vs. 1.0; P50.03) and
reduced pain intensity and odynophagia compared to placebo (0.18 vs. 0.01 and 0.12 vs. 0.01, respectively,
P50.04). Depression and anxiety scores did not differ between the groups at baseline or after treatment. No
significant adverse effects were observed. In this novel study, dronabinol increased pain threshold and reduced
frequencyandintensityofpaininFCP.Further,largescalestudiesareneededtosubstantiatethesefindings.
