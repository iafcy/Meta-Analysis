Objectives: To determine whether plant-derived cannabis medicinal extracts
(CME) can alleviate neurogenic symptoms unresponsive to standard
treatment, and to quantify adverse effects.
Design: A consecutive series of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
single-patient cross-over trials with two-week treatment periods.
Setting: Patients attended as outpatients, but took the CME at home.
Subjects: Twenty-four patients with multiple sclerosis (18), spinal cord injury
(4), brachial plexus damage (1), and limb amputation due to neuro(cid:142)bromatosis
(1).
Intervention: Whole-plant extracts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
cannabidiol (CBD), 1:1 CBD:THC, or matched placebo were self-administered
by sublingual spray at doses determined by titration against symptom relief or
unwanted effects within the range of 2.5–120mg/24 hours.
Measures used: Patients recorded symptom, well-being and intoxication
scores on a daily basis using visual analogue scales. At the end of each
two-week period an observer rated severity and frequency of symptoms on
numerical rating scales, administered standard measures of disability (Barthel
Index), mood and cognition, and recorded adverse events.
Results: Pain relief associated with both THC and CBD was signi(cid:142)cantly
superior to placebo. Impaired bladder control, muscle spasms and spasticity
were improved by CME in some patients with these symptoms. Three
patients had transient hypotension and intoxication with rapid initial dosing of
THC-containing CME.
Conclusions: Cannabis medicinal extracts can improve neurogenic symptoms
unresponsive to standard treatments. Unwanted effects are predictable and
generally well tolerated. Larger scale studies are warranted to con(cid:142)rm these
(cid:142)ndings.
