Cannabis sativahas been used to treat pain since the third
millennium BC.5 An endogenous pain-processing system has
been identified, mediated by endogenous cannabinoid ligands
acting on specific cannabinoid receptors.6 These findings,
coupled with anecdotal evidence of the analgesic effects of
smoked cannabis,7 support a reconsideration of cannabinoid
agents as analgesics.
Oral cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabid-
iol and nabilone have, alone and in combination, shown effi-
cacy in central8,9 and peripheral10 neuropathic pain, rheuma-
toid arthritis11and fibromyalgia.12
The analgesic effects of smoked cannabis remain contro-
versial, although it is used by 10%–15% of patients with
chronic noncancer pain13and multiple sclerosis.14Clinical tri-
als are needed to evaluate these effects, given that the risks
and benefits of inhaled cannabinoids may differ from oral
agents. To date, three small clinical trials of the analgesic
efficacy of smoked cannabis have been reported.15–17All stud-
ies were conducted in residential laboratories, and partici-
pants smoked multiple doses of the drug at each time point.
No study adequately reported data related to adverse events.
We conducted a clinical trial using a standardized single-dose
delivery system to explore further the safety and efficacy of
smoked cannabis in outpatients with chronic neuropathic pain.

Abstract
Background: Chronic neuropathic pain affects 1%–2% of the
adult population and is often refractory to standard pharma-
cologic treatment. Patients with chronic pain have reported
using smoked cannabis to relieve pain, improve sleep and
improve mood.
Methods:Adults with post-traumatic or postsurgical neuro-
pathic pain were randomly assigned to receive cannabis at
four potencies (0%, 2.5%, 6% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabi-
nol) over four 14-day periods in a crossover trial. Participants
inhaled a single 25-mg dose through a pipe three times daily
for the first five days in each cycle, followed by a nine-day
washout period. Daily average pain intensity was measured
using an 11-point numeric rating scale. We recorded effects
on mood, sleep and quality of life, as well as adverse events.
Results: We recruited 23 participants (mean age 45.4 [stan-
dard deviation 12.3] years, 12 women [52%]), of whom 21
completed the trial. The average daily pain intensity, mea-
sured on the 11-point numeric rating scale, was lower on the
prespecified primary contrast of 9.4% v. 0% tetrahydro-
cannabinol (5.4 v. 6.1, respectively; difference = 0.7, 95% con-
fidence interval [CI] 0.02–1.4). Preparations with intermediate
potency yielded intermediate but nonsignificant degrees of
relief. Participants receiving 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol
reported improved ability to fall asleep (easier, p=0.001;
faster, p<0.001; more drowsy, p=0.003) and improved qual-
ity of sleep (less wakefulness, p=0.01) relative to 0% tetrahy-
drocannabinol. We found no differences in mood or quality
of life. The most common drug-related adverse events during
the period when participants received 9.4% tetrahydro-
cannabinol were headache, dry eyes, burning sensation in
areas of neuropathic pain, dizziness, numbness and cough.
Conclusion:A single inhalation of 25 mg of 9.4% tetrahy-
drocannabinol herbal cannabis three times daily for five
days reduced the intensity of pain, improved sleep and
was well tolerated. Further long-term safety and efficacy
studies are indicated. (International Standard Randomised

prior experience with cannabis, which had been an early
ethics requirement; none was using cannabis at the time of
enrolment and they were not “experienced” users, so that the
lessons learned would be applicable to naive users of medical
cannabis. The use of small, fixed doses with a short trial dura-
tion may have reduced the effect size. We used a low dose to
minimize exposure to smoke and to reduce psychoactive
effects. Previous work has shown that a single dose of 0.4
mg/kg can be inhaled in a single lungful from a pipe,24,30
which for a 70-kg person approximates to 25mg per dose.
The frequency of dosing was based on a duration of action of
inhaled tetrahydrocannabinol of two to three hours31 and was
administered three times daily. We used a fixed dosing sched-
ule because the study was too short to allow dose titration and
we wanted the tetrahydrocannabinol potency to be the only
difference between cycles. Finally, the highest tetrahydro-
cannabinol-content cannabis (9.4%) legally available at the
time of the study was used. Additional studies with higher
potencies and flexible dosing strategies are needed to explore
dose–response effects.
With respect to our analysis, we are aware of issues sur-
rounding the use of early tests for carryover effects. However,
examination of pain scores during the washout period showed
that the washout was adequate (data not shown), and there-
fore we believe our approach was appropriate.
Our trial had several important strengths, including a cred-
ible placebo, good compliance and good safety reporting.
