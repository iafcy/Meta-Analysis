based medicine in central pain in
multiple sclerosis

Abstract—Background: Central pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) is common and often refractory to treatment. Methods:
We conducted a single-center, 5-week (1-week run-in, 4-week treatment), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-grouptrialin66patientswithMSandcentralpainstates(59dysesthetic,sevenpainfulspasms)ofawhole-plant

cosal spray, as adjunctive analgesic treatment. Each spray delivered 2.7 mg of THC and 2.5 of CBD, and patients could
gradually self-titrate to a maximum of 48 sprays in 24 hours. Results: Sixty-four patients (97%) completed the trial, 34
