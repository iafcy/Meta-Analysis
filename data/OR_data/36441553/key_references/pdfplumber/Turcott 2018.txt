Abstract
Background Over one half of the patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer experience anorexia. In addition to its high
incidence, cancer-induced anorexia promotes the development of the anorexia-cachexia syndrome, which is related to poor
clinical outcomes. Recently, drugs derived from cannabinoids, such as Nabilone, have been recognized for their appetite
improvementproperties;however,clinicaltrialstosupporttheiruseincancerpatientsarenecessary.

and 47 were randomized to receive Nabilone (0.5 mg/2 weeks followed by 1.0 mg/6 weeks) or placebo. After 8 weeks of
treatment, patients who received Nabilone increased their caloric intake (342-kcal) and had a significantly higher intake of

Conclusion Nabilone is an adequate and safe therapeutic option to aid in the treatment of patients diagnosed with anorexia.
