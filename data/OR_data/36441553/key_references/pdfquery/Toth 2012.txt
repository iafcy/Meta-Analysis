Cannabinoids are emerging as potential options for neuropathic pain treatment. This study evaluated an 
oral cannabinoid, nabilone, in the treatment of refractory human diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain 
(DPN). We performed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ﬂexible-dose study 
with an enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal design. DPN subjects with a pain score P4 (0-10 
scale) continued regular pain medications and were administered single-blinded adjuvant nabilone for 
4 weeks. Subjects achieving P30% pain relief (26/37) were then randomized and treated with either ﬂex- 
ible-dose nabilone 1-4 mg/day (n = 13) or placebo (n = 13) in a further 5-week double-blind treatment 
period, with 30% (11/37) of subjects deemed run-in-phase nabilone nonresponders. For nabilone run- 
in-phase responders, there was an improvement in the change in mean end-point neuropathic pain vs 
placebo (mean treatment reduction of 1.27; 95% conﬁdence interval 2.29-0.25, P = 0.02), with an average 
nabilone dose at end point of 2.9 ± 1.1 mg/day, and improvements from baseline for the anxiety subscale 
of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Medical Outcomes Study sleep scale problems index, 
and the European Quality of Life-5-Domains index score (each P < 0.05). Nabilone run-in-phase respond- 
ers reported greater global end-point improvement with nabilone than with placebo (100% vs 31%; 
P < 0.05). Medication-related confusion led to discontinuation in 2/37 subjects during single-blind nabi- 
lone treatment. Potential unmasking occurred in 62% of both groups. Flexible-dose nabilone 1-4 mg/day 
was effective in relieving DPN symptoms, improving disturbed sleep, quality of life, and overall patient 
status. Nabilone was well tolerated and successful as adjuvant in patients with DPN. 


Neuropathic pain (NeP) occurs as a result of damage or disease 
of the peripheral or central nervous system [1]. A common cause of 
NeP is diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPN) [43] leading to 
distal extremity symptoms, disturbed sleep, and diminished qual- 
ity of life [16,33]. Although symptomatic therapies such as gabap- 
entinoids, antidepressants, and opioids are available for treatment 
of NeP, many of these therapies remain suboptimal for quantity of 
pain relief or due to adverse effects [15]. The availability of adju- 
vant or other therapies for refractory NeP management is impor- 
tant for both clinicians and patients. Whereas most current NeP

medications act upon ion channels, the discovery of endocannabi- 
noids and cannabinoid receptors has led to new understanding of 
pain pathophysiology in animal models. Two subtypes of the can- 
nabinoid (CB) receptor exist: CB1 and CB2 [18]. Whereas CB2 is 
important within the immune system, the CB1 receptor is ex- 
pressed upon neurons with a direct role in neuronal pain sensitiv- 
ity [27]. Although scientiﬁc research has repeatedly demonstrated 
beneﬁcial effects of cannabinoids upon NeP behaviours [3,9,21], 
clinical data for cannabinoids in the treatment of chronic pain con- 
ditions are conﬂicting. While submucosal delivery of tetrahydro- 
cannabis 
in 
management of NeP in patients with multiple sclerosis, a study 
in patients with DPN-associated NeP failed to determine efﬁcacy 
for cannabinoids [40]. A systematic review evaluating numerous 
pain states also concluded that cannabinoids were similar to co- 
deine in pain relief and were associated with unwanted side effects 
[12]. A randomized comparison of the oral synthetic cannabinoid

and CB1 agonist nabilone and tetrahydro-codeine in patients with 
various pain conditions [22] did not show greater beneﬁt with can- 
nabinoids, perhaps related to the underdosing of nabilone. Finally, 
an open-label comparison of nabilone to gabapentin showed sim- 
ilar outcomes for pain relief and possibly better outcomes for sleep 
efﬁcacy with nabilone [6]. Thus, there has been uncertainty in the 
use of cannabinoids for management of NeP and its associated 
symptoms. 
Nabilone, a synthesized CB1 predominant receptor agonist, has 
been used for NeP relief based upon anecdotal evidence and 
uncontrolled case series [2,4], with probable efﬁcacy in ﬁbromyal- 
gia for pain [41] and insomnia [46]. With high bioavailability, rapid 
redistribution, metabolism, and excretion, nabilone also has a long 
half-life (t1/2 (cid:2) 20 hours) with active metabolites potentially fur- 
ther prolonging its action [38]. Nabilone’s side-effect proﬁle is also 
acceptable in most studies when compared to other medications 
used for NeP. 
The aim of this study was to compare the efﬁcacy of nabilone as 
adjuvant treatment for NeP due to DPN vs placebo using a random- 
ized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-assignment, ﬂexi- 
ble-dose comparison using an enriched-enrolment randomized 
withdrawal design. Our primary hypothesis was that nabilone 
would improve average daily pain scores from average weekly 
baseline values as compared to placebo, but we also hypothesized 
that nabilone would beneﬁt secondary outcome measures of asso- 
ciated features of NeP, including anxiety, depression, sleep efﬁcacy, 
and quality of life. 


This study was approved by the University of Calgary Conjoint 
Health Research Ethics Board and Health Canada. Subject recruit- 
ment occurred through both primary and tertiary care clinics in 
Calgary, Alberta, Canada with an intended equal distribution of 
recruitment. Subjects were assessed by one of 3 different neurolo- 
gists throughout the study. Men or women aged 18-80 years with 
DPN-associated NeP were screened if their DN4 [7] questionnaire 
score was P4. The presence of DPN-associated NeP was conﬁrmed 
by a neurologist. Pain must have persisted for at least 3 months 
and pain severity must have averaged scores of P40 mm on the 
100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) of the Short-Form McGill Pain 
Questionnaire [32] at the time of the visit. Then, following comple- 
tion of written informed consent, completion of daily pain diaries 
occurred over a 7-day screening period using an 11-point numeri- 
cal rating scale (NRS) from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain. 
Those subjects continuing with enrolment in the single-blind 
phase of the study were required to have an average daily pain 
severity of P4 during the week of these baseline scores (with at 
least 4 days completed during a 7-day period). 
Subjects with other causes of pain, including postherpetic neu- 
ralgia, lumbar radiculopathy, central neuropathic pain, complex re- 
gional pain syndromes I or II, or signiﬁcant osteoarthritis, were 
excluded. Any skin conditions over the area of DPN which could 
hinder examination, led to exclusion. Any current diagnoses of 
schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, bipolar affective disorder, obses- 
sive compulsive disorder, or major depressive disorder were also 
exclusionary. Clinically signiﬁcant unstable medical conditions 
that could compromise participation, such as with poor diabetic 
control (haemoglobin A1C P 11%), history of substance abuse or 
dependence, malignancy other than squamous cell carcinoma in 
the last 2 years, elevation of liver enzymes above 3 times the upper 
limit of normal, or an anticipated need for surgery or hospitaliza- 
tion within the next 16 weeks after screening led to exclusion at 
the discretion of the investigator. This was an adjuvant study – 
subjects were allowed to be taking other medications for their 
NeP, excluding cannabinoids, as long as their use had been stable 
for at least 1 month before the study and would remain so during 
the study. Those subjects previously exposed to nabilone were ex- 
cluded. Any use of self-obtained cannabinoids or other illicit drugs 
during the study was prohibited, and subjects with a positive 
urinary illicit drug screen (including detection of 11-nor-delta-9- 
tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid) were excluded at screen- 
ing. Women who were breastfeeding or pregnant were excluded, 
and female patients capable of conception were required to use 
reliable contraception. 
During the assessment of DPN, other potential aetiologies of the 
polyneuropathy were also determined based upon laboratory 
investigations and clinical information. Other blood work was per- 
formed in order to determine the presence of other confounding 
medical conditions. These investigations included complete blood 
count, electrolytes, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, 
aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alka- 
line phosphatase, albumin, total bilirubin, international normalized 
ratio, thyroid-stimulating hormone, fasting glucose, haemoglobin 
A1C, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, ex- 
tracted nuclear antibody testing, serum protein electrophoresis, 
rheumatoid factor, vitamin B12 levels, fasting methylmalonic acid, 
urine toxicology screening, and beta-human chorionic gonadotro- 
pin. At completion of the study, repeated testing was performed 
for all of the above except for antinuclear antibody, extracted nucle- 
ar antibody testing, serum protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid fac- 
tor, and fasting methylmalonic acid. 

This was a single-center, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo- 
controlled randomized clinical trial with a 4-week single-blind 
ﬂexible-dose phase of nabilone use followed by a randomized dou- 
ble-blind maintenance phase. It was designed to compare 5 weeks 
of stable-dose nabilone 1-4 mg/day with placebo, taken as 2 daily 
doses 12 hours apart with 1:1 allocation. The study concluded with 
a 1-week taper phase incorporated to reduce the risk of potential 
withdrawal effects for the subjects assigned to the nabilone treat- 
ment arm; subjects receiving placebo also tapered their placebo 
use similarly during the last week of the study. The Clinical Trial 
Registration 
is NCT01035281 
this 
(www.clinicaltrials.gov). 



After screening, when inclusion criteria were met and informed 
consent was completed, subjects were initiated on a 4-week ﬂexi- 
ble-dose single-blind run-in phase to receive adjuvant nabilone as 
part of an enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal (EERW) de- 
sign using exclusion of nonresponders. Subjects were unaware of 
therapy allocation in this single-blind phase. Baseline data were 
collected prior to single-blind dosing. Prior to obtained consent, 
it was explained that the subjects could receive either nabilone 
or placebo during each of the single-blind and double-blind phases. 
At baseline, patients were screened after informed consent 
completion. Efﬁcacy assessments and questionnaires were com- 
pleted, and no intervention was received during this baseline 
assessment week. The baseline week consisted of 1 week of com- 
pletion of daily pain severity and sleep disruption severity diaries; 
after this, efﬁcacy assessments and questionnaires were again 
completed prior to any intervention being provided. Next, the 4- 
week single-blind phase was initiated, with daily diaries evaluat- 
ing pain severity and sleep disruption severity again completed. 
During the single-blind phase, subjects were initially prescribed 
nabilone 0.5 mg twice daily for 1 week, with weekly follow-up vis- 
its to determine efﬁcacy, tolerability, and dosing adjustments. Nab- 
ilone was titrated up to 1.0 mg twice daily and as high as 2.0 mg 


twice daily as tolerated over the subsequent 3 weeks until day 28 
of the study. Adverse events were recorded during each visit. Only 
one dose reduction was allowed during the 4-week single-blind 
phase of the study. 
In order to be randomized at day 28, subjects were required to 
have completed at least 75% of their daily pain diaries over the 
4 weeks. If subjects did not achieve P30% pain relief for daily pain 
scores for the 7 days prior to day 28 when compared to the base- 
line scores, or if subjects developed intolerable side effects, then 
these subjects were not randomized in the double-blind phase 
of the study; this requirement was explained to patients prior 
to informed consent. It was also explained to subjects that at ran- 
domization, 
if their intervention was switched, then titration 
either onto or off of nabilone over the ﬁrst week of the double- 
blind phase would occur. During the double-blind phase, eligible 
subjects were randomly assigned to continue nabilone at the 
effective dose achieved in the ﬂexible-dose single-blind phase or 
to receive placebo. For subjects receiving nabilone during the dou- 
ble-blind phase, the dose of nabilone achieved at day 28 was con- 
tinued without change for 5 weeks. For subjects randomized to 
placebo, there was a 1-week blinded taper of either 0.5 mg daily 
or twice daily of nabilone regardless of dose achieved at day 28, 
followed by strict placebo use over the subsequent 4 weeks. How- 
ever, the number of pills received remained unchanged from the 
amount received on day 28 to avoid unmasking of allocation, with 
a mixture of nabilone and placebo provided to patients allocated 
to placebo. No further titration occurred after day 28 regardless 
of allocation. 
Medication was blinded for placebo using capsules of identical 
size, color, taste, and smell. An electronic randomization system 
was used to randomize individual subjects without block random- 
ization as developed by an outside coordinator. Randomization 
was concealed from subjects, clinical coordinator, and assessing 
physicians. Clinic visits were scheduled for screening, baseline, 
and at the end of weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 1 week after completion 
of the study or at 1 week after early discontinuation. Telephone 
visits took place during the end of weeks 3, 6, and 8. There was a 
1-week double-blind taper period at the end of the study for all 
subjects regardless of randomization to placebo or nabilone. 

The mean difference in the average daily pain score was the pri- 
mary efﬁcacy variable, based on the mean of the last 7 entries in 
the daily pain diary during the ﬁfth week of the double-blind 
phase, with comparison to the mean of scores obtained in the base- 
line week prior to single-blind nabilone use. Pain severity and 
sleep disruption severity over the preceding 24 hours were rated 
daily using an 11-point NRS from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible 
pain, and 0 = pain does not interfere with sleep to 10 = pain com- 
pletely interferes with sleep, respectively. Daily pain and sleep dis- 
ruption severities were recorded from the baseline visit until the 
end of the tapering of intervention after completion of the dou- 
ble-blind phase. 
Other efﬁcacy assessments and questionnaires were completed 
at the baseline visit, after the baseline week (day 0), at the end of 
the single-blind phase (day 28), and at the end of the double-blind 
phase (end of week 9). These secondary efﬁcacy assessments in- 
cluded the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOSSS) [25] based 
on a 1-week recall period, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS) [50], the modiﬁed Brief Pain Inventory short form 
(MBPI) [47], the EuroQol 5 Domains (EQ-5D), the Pain Treatment 
Satisfaction Scale (PTSS), and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom 
Inventory (NPSI). The EQ-5D has 2 sections; the ﬁrst section exam- 
ines the health state in 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain/complaints, and anxiety/depression. We calculated 
EQ-5D utility scores and index VAS scores [44]. The PTSS is a 14- 
point scale used to provide subject-related evaluation of treatment 
effectiveness [19]. The NPSI [8] consists of 12 items regarding 
qualities and quantities of pain descriptions as well as subscores 
(burning, pressing [deep], paroxysmal, evoked, paresthesias/dyses- 
thesias) and was administered at baseline, day 28, and at end point. 
We also used the VAS scale as a 100-mm unmarked line with sub- 
jects asked to indicate their level of pain severity during the week 
prior to evaluation, ranging from no pain (0) to worst possible pain 
(100) – the distance in millimetres measured from the left end of 
the scale (no pain) to the subjects’ mark was recorded at baseline, 
day 28, and at the end of week 9. The Patient Global Impression 
of Change (PGIC) [20], during which subjects rate their overall sta- 
tus on a 7-point scale from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very 
much worse, was completed at day 28 and at the end of week 9. 

All spontaneously reported and observed adverse events were 
recorded at each clinic visit and during telephone follow-up visits. 
Vital signs and body weight were monitored at all clinic visits. 
Electrocardiograms were completed at screening and at the end 
of study for all subjects. A full physical examination including a 
neurological component was completed at baseline and at end 
point for all subjects. Adverse events were coded using standard 
terminology [10]. 

Based upon our primary end point of mean pain reduction 
based upon weekly mean scores from the daily pain diary scales, 
sample size estimates were performed assuming a 2-sided com- 
parison with tolerance for type I error set to be alpha = 0.05. Based 
on the results of 2 previous randomized controlled trials of cannab- 
inoids in separate conditions [5,37], the effect size (difference from 
placebo in change of end-point mean pain score) was estimated to 
be 2.0, with an estimated SD of 1.0. A sample size of 20 subjects per 
group would provide 80% power to detect a treatment effect of 2.0. 
We assumed a dropout rate of 10%, meaning that a required group 
size of 44 total subjects in the randomized phase would be re- 
cruited. No interim analyses were planned. 
All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population. 
The proportions of subjects with a P30% and P50% reduction in 
pain score between baseline and end point (responder analyses) 
were calculated, and compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
testing. Mean changes from baseline to end point in the secondary 
efﬁcacy variables were also determined for each scale. All analyses 
were based on 2-sided testing without adjustment for testing mul- 
tiple measures. The analysis of weekly mean pain and sleep inter- 
ference scores was based on a mixed-model repeated-measures 
(MMRM) analysis and least squares (LS) means were compared be- 
tween groups each week. The MMRM analysis used all of the avail- 
able data from sequential observations. All other continuous 
variables were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
controlling for baseline values. Statistical signiﬁcance was set to 
be a = 0.05 in each case. Missing values were handled using impu- 
tation techniques using the last value carried forward technique. 
Categorical variables such as with the PGIC were analyzed using 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. 
Financial provisions for this study were discontinued by the 
sponsor earlier than anticipated, leading to suboptimal patient 
enrolment. Upon completion of the last study visit, database clo- 
sure occurred and a post hoc analysis was performed using avail- 
able data. 




This study was concluded earlier than anticipated due to insuf- 
ﬁcient funding; as a result, we did not achieve the estimated total 
of 44 subjects in the second randomized phase of the study. 
Recruitment occurred between December 2006 and March 2011. 
A total of 51 subjects were screened for the study, with 27 of these 
subjects recruited from tertiary care clinics in the investigators’ 
primary institution. A total of 37 subjects were enrolled in the sin- 
gle-blind phase of the study (Fig. 1). Of these subjects, 3 discontin- 
ued the study prior to day 28 due to lack of efﬁcacy (n = 1) and 
intolerable side effects (ie, confusion; n = 2). At day 28, a total of 
8 subjects were excluded from entry into the double-blind phase 
of the study due to <30% improvement in daily pain severity 
achieved during the 7 days prior to day 28 when compared to base- 
line data obtained. Therefore, 26 subjects were randomized and 
received either placebo (n = 13) or nabilone (n = 13). One subject 
from the placebo cohort discontinued the study at day 56 (prior 
to end of the double-blind phase) due to inefﬁcacy of pain relief, 
but data were maintained for intention-to-treat population analy- 
sis. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were gener- 
ally similar in the 2 randomized treatment cohorts, except for a 
greater proportion of women randomized to the nabilone group 
than in the placebo group (Table 1). Baseline and later timepoint 
characteristics between the subject groups receiving nabilone or 
placebo did not demonstrate any remarkable differences in con- 
comitant medication use (including concomitant pain medication 
use) or comorbidities (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). 

At day 28 (prerandomization), nabilone dosing was as follows: 
21 subjects (62%) received 2 mg/day, 7 subjects (21%) received 
4 mg/day, and 6 subjects received 1 mg/day. Subjects not achieving

P30% pain relief consisted of 5 subjects receiving 1 mg/day and 3 
subjects receiving 2 mg/day. The mean end-point nabilone dose 
was 2.85 ± 1.14 mg/day, consisting of 1 subject taking 1 mg/day, 
6 subjects taking 2 mg/day, and 6 subjects taking 4 mg/day. There 
was no difference in change in weight between baseline and end 
point for subjects receiving nabilone as compared to those subjects 
receiving placebo (+0.8 ± 0.2 kg vs +0.6 ± 0.3 kg, P = NS). 

For the primary end point, nabilone adjuvant therapy was sta- 
tistically more effective than placebo in improving pain at end 
point (MMRM analysis with LS means, P < 0.05) (Fig. 2). The num- 
ber of subjects with P30% reduction in pain from baseline to end 
point was 11/13 (85%) in the nabilone group, compared to 5/13 
(38%) in the placebo group (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The percentage of 
subjects achieving P50% reduction in pain from baseline to end 
point was 4/13 (31%) in the nabilone group, compared to 1/13 
(8%) in the placebo group (ANOVA, P = NS). For the 37 subjects 
enrolled in the single-blind phase, the NRS was 6.6 ± 1.8, as 
compared to 3.6 ± 2.0 at day 28 (P < 0.01, MMRM analysis with 
LS means). At the end of the double-blind phase, the NRS was 
3.5 ± 1.3 in the nabilone cohort, as compared to 5.4 ± 1.7 in the 
placebo cohort, giving a mean difference of 3.0 ± 1.2 in the 
nabilone cohort, as compared to 1.1 ± 1.5 in the placebo cohort 
(P < 0.01, MMRM analysis with LS means). For the single-blind 
phase (with comparison to baseline), an effect size of 1.10 was 
calculated using the standardized mean difference (using baseline 
SD values), while for the double-blind phase, an effect size of 0.67 
was calculated for nabilone compared to placebo use. 
In the MMRM analysis of weekly mean pain scores, pain relief 
favouring nabilone was ﬁrst apparent at week 6 after baseline 
(P < 0.05, MMRM analysis with LS means), and then present weekly 
from week 6 to week 9 (P < 0.05 for each week, MMRM analysis 
with LS means) (Fig. 2). Assessment of sleep disruption scores 
showed less sleep disruption with nabilone at weeks 6, 8, and 9 
(P < 0.05 for weeks 6, 8, and 9, MMRM analysis with LS means) 
(Fig. 2). 


HADS depressive symptoms subscale score of P10, indicating mild 
depressive levels. There was a modestly signiﬁcant improvement 
in HADS anxiety scores at end point for subjects receiving nabilone, 
as compared to subjects receiving placebo (P < 0.05, ANCOVA, 
F = 2.24) (Table 2). There was no signiﬁcant change from baseline 
or difference between nabilone and placebo cohorts for the HADS 
depressive symptoms scale score at end point. 
The evaluation of sleep using the MOSSS indicated an improve- 
ment in the overall sleep problems index of the MOSSS in the nab- 
ilone-receiving group (Table 2) (P < 0.05, ANCOVA, F = 1.91). The 
mean MOSSS sleep problems index score at end point of the dou- 
ble-blind phase was improved for the nabilone cohort compared 
to the placebo cohort (27.2 ± 2.5 vs 33.0 ± 2.8). 
Quality of life was assessed using the self-reported EQ-5D util- 
ity score and the composite EQ-5D index score. Although there was 
no signiﬁcant difference in the EQ-5D utility score reported at end 
point (Table 2), a signiﬁcant improvement in the composite index 
score occurred, with nabilone subjects reporting a signiﬁcantly im- 
proved quality of life as compared to subjects receiving placebo 
(P < 0.05, ANCOVA, F = 2.55). 
The VAS was also administered at intervals of baseline, 28 days, 
and at double-blind phase end-point visits using a continuous non- 
marked line, identifying a signiﬁcant improvement in VAS at the 
end of the single-blind phase (P < 0.05, ANCOVA, F = 1.92), as well 
as signiﬁcant improvement for VAS in patients receiving nabilone 
at the end of the double-blind phase (Table 2) (P < 0.05, ANCOVA, 
F = 2.67). 
The PTSS subject self-evaluation of their satisfaction with treat- 
ment demonstrated improvement in subjects’ feelings about the 
form, frequency, and amount of pain medications taken at the 
end of the single-blind phase when compared to baseline values 
(Table 3). There was also greater satisfaction with level of pain re- 
lief at the end of the single-blind phase. For the end point of study, 
subjects taking nabilone had greater satisfaction with amount of 
pain medication used when compared to subjects taking placebo 
(P < 0.05, ANCOVA, F = 2.41). 
The MBPI pain interference scores identiﬁed a number of 
improvements at the end of the single-blind phase when values 
were compared to baseline values: levels of worst pain, least pain, 
average pain, current pain, and degree of pain relief were all signif- 
icantly improved, as was the level of pain interference with sleep 
(Table 3). At study end point, subjects taking nabilone reported sig- 
niﬁcantly better responses for levels of worst pain, least pain, aver- 
age pain, current pain, and for interference with sleep when 
compared to subjects taking placebo (P < 0.05, ANCOVA, F = 1.47- 
5.05).

The NPSI categorizes symptomatic descriptors of pain. There 
were no signiﬁcant differences between responses at the end of 
the single-blind phase and baseline amongst subjects enrolled in 
the single-blind phase. However, subjects receiving nabilone in 
the double-blind phase reported fewer symptoms of electrical 
shocks and less provocation or increase in pain with light touching 
when compared to subjects receiving placebo (P < 0.05, ANCOVA, 
F = 1.77-3.44) (Table 3). 
At the end of the single-blind phase, a leftward shift in the sub- 
ject global impression of change (PGIC) could be seen when com- 
pared to week 1 of the study, although 2/34 subjects regarded 
themselves to be much worse (Fig. 3). At end point, all subjects 
in the nabilone treatment group rated themselves as improved. 
In the placebo group, over half the subjects rated themselves as un- 
changed, while 4 subjects stated they were improved, and one sub- 
ject rated their overall status to be worse. The distribution of 
responses across the 7 PGIC categories was statistically signiﬁcant 
(P < 0.05) in favour of improvement in the nabilone cohort at end 
point. 
After completion of the study, subjects were asked to speculate 
upon which treatment had been administered: 24/37 subjects 
(65%) correctly identiﬁed receiving nabilone during the single- 
blind phase. With respect to the double-blind phase, 8/13 (62%) 
subjects receiving placebo correctly identiﬁed receipt of placebo, 
while 8/13 (62%) subjects receiving double-blinded nabilone cor- 
rectly identiﬁed receiving the active therapy. 
Imputation of data using the last value carried forward tech- 
nique was required for <0.5% of all data assessed in the study – this 
was required for data for 3 patients discontinuing during the sin- 
gle-blind phase and for one patient receiving placebo in the dou- 
ble-blind phase. 

At baseline, all 37 subjects participating in the single-blind 
phase had symptoms or adverse events possibly related to baseline 
medications (Supplementary Table 3). At day 28, with completion 
of the single-blind phase, there were new adverse events possibly 


Fig. 3. Patient global impressions of change were analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel procedure, adjusting for center in each case. When compared to baseline data 
accumulated from day 0 (A), there was a leftward shift towards improvement seen at the end of the single-blind phase (B). Subjects reported a signiﬁcant perceived overall 
improvement with adjuvant nabilone therapy (C) when compared to placebo group subjects (D) at end point (⁄P < 0.05). 
including dizziness, dry 
related to single-blind nabilone use, 
mouth, drowsiness, confusion or impaired memory, 
lethargy, 
euphoria, headache, and increased appetite. In total, treatment- 
emergent adverse events were reported in 13/37 (35%) subjects 
within the single-blind phase receiving nabilone. For the subjects 
participating in the double-blind phase, treatment-emergent ad- 
verse events were reported by 6/13 (46%) subjects receiving pla- 
cebo and by 7/13 (54%) subjects receiving nabilone. Most adverse 
events were either mild or moderate in intensity. Two subjects 
receiving nabilone in the single-blind phase developed intolerable 
confusion (at doses of 2 mg daily and 4 mg daily) leading to discon- 
tinuation, constituting 2 serious adverse events; in one subject, 
confusion led to admission to the Emergency Department and 
work-up for delirium, with symptoms discontinuing after cessa- 
tion of study medication. Weight gain was not self-reported by 
any subjects nor detected by study personnel during the study. 

This is the ﬁrst clinical trial to examine a potential role for nab- 
ilone as an adjuvant in the management of diabetic peripheral neu- 
ropathic pain. Both in the single-blind phase and in the 
randomized double-blind phase, nabilone use was associated with 
improvements in pain relief, sleep efﬁcacy, and quality of life. Nab- 
ilone demonstrated superiority to placebo with respect to a num- 
ber of 
associated 
comorbidities for run-in phase nabilone responders. Adverse ef- 
fects were few, but 2 subjects developed confusion, requiring dis- 
continuation of nabilone during the single-blind phase of the 


study, while tolerable adverse effects included drowsiness and 
dizziness. 
This study has several important strengths. The second half of 
the study compared nabilone to placebo using a randomization 
scheme with double blinding. Subjects were blinded as to inter- 
vention status throughout the study, permitting greater assess- 
ment of blinded use of nabilone in a larger population of subjects 
during the single-blind phase despite the lack of a placebo control. 
Flexible dosing assessment was analogous to typical use of pain 
medications in the clinical setting. Subjects recruited represented 
equally patients presenting to either primary or tertiary care clin- 
ics. Finally, multiple measures other than pain severity, including 
sleep, well-being, and quality of life, showed improvement with 
nabilone therapy when compared to placebo therapy. 
The EERW design has been used in previous phase III analgesic 
studies [14,24]. Putative advantages of this design are the ability to 
show a larger effect size and avoid dilution of a true treatment ef- 
fect between active drug and placebo, as well as reduced variance 
[26,30]. This may be due to greater ease in discerning a loss of pain 
control rather than a gain in pain control, as is usually investigated 
using conventional studies. As a result of its design, EERW permits 
study of time to efﬁcacy failure end point, which may permit great- 
er statistical power than do studies examining mean pain intensity 
[24]. Furthermore, nonresponding patients or those developing 
prominent adverse effects are rapidly discontinued from further 
treatment, analogous to the general clinical setting [28]. Potential 
criticisms of the EERW design [29,42] include the potential for re- 
duced generalizability of study results to a larger population aside 
from responders, the potential for carryover medication effects 


during the withdrawal phase in subjects randomized to placebo, 
underestimation of adverse event prevalence [23], and concerns 
of discernment, or unmasking, of blinded subjects to absence of 
treatment. 
The effects of cannabinoids on pain have been recognized for 
millennia [34], but the knowledge of endocannabinoids and can- 
nabinoid receptors in the nervous system spans only 2 decades 
[17]. Clinical trials of cannabinoids in chronic pain disorders have 
also reported improved sleep as either a primary or secondary out- 
come measure [39,46]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the 
ability of CB1 receptor agonists to ameliorate pain in animal mod- 
els of diabetic neuropathy and promote neurite outgrowth 
[11,45,48], effects that may be lost with downregulation of the 
CB1 receptor in models of diabetic neuropathy [49]. However, 
these ﬁndings are controversial as well, as CB1 receptor antago- 
nists are also reported to relieve neuropathic pain behaviours in 
animal models of diabetic neuropathy [13,31]. It is possible that, 
in addition to interaction with the CB1 and CB2 receptors, interac- 
tions with the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channels 
may be important for the effects of cannabinoids [51]. 

There are limitations associated with this study and its results. 
The greatest limitation was the relatively low number of subjects 
studied and the inability to randomize the numbers of subjects 
estimated by initial sample size calculations. The SD value of 1.0 
used to obtain the sample size calculation was possibly underesti- 
mated, perhaps further contributing to an underpowered study. 
Also, there were more women than men randomized to the active 
intervention in the double-blind phase, which may have inﬂuenced 
outcomes. The exposure to the double-blind phase portion was 
limited to a 5-week interval, with the possibility of the ﬁrst weeks 
of placebo use in the double-blind phase being contaminated by 
nabilone carryover effects with 1-week washout of nabilone use. 
NeP due to DPN is a chronic condition, and prolonged treatment 
over months to years is typically required clinically, but could 
not be studied with the present study. Dosing of nabilone was per- 
formed based upon individual subject tolerability and efﬁcacy, but 
further dose-ﬁnding studies may be more appropriate for determi- 
nation of safety and efﬁcacy if doses higher than 4 mg per day are 
to be considered. This study was performed to study the adjuvant 
potential of nabilone in subjects already receiving pharmacothera- 
peutic management for NeP due to DPN; the use of concomitant 
medications leads to difﬁculty in determination of the individual 
effect of nabilone. Future studies to assess the efﬁcacy of nabilone 
monotherapy requiring washout of medications for the study of 
primary efﬁcacy of nabilone for chronic NeP would be informative. 
Discernment of study allocation was above chance, with the prev- 
alence of potential cannabinoid-induced adverse effects, including 
dry mouth, dizziness, sedation, disturbed thinking, and euphoria 
possibly playing a role in unmasking [35]. Additionally, the ab- 
sence of titration of the number of pills provided during the dou- 
ble-blind phase of the study may have contributed to unmasking. 
It was unclear why there was an absence of improvements in NPSI 
subscores at the end of the single-blind phase, with improvement 
in some subscales of the NPSI at the end point of the double-blind 
phase. Finally, although subjects enrolled in this study were re- 
ferred from both primary care and tertiary care clinics, it is possible 
that they were not representative of the general population of sub- 
jects with DPN and DPN-mediated NeP. 

In conclusion, we report that the synthetic cannabinoid nabi- 
lone is an effective drug in management of NeP and associated 
promotion of sleep and quality of life in patients with NeP due to 
DPN. Further studies on the effects of nabilone for long-term pain 
relief, as well as safety and efﬁcacy in conditions of chronic pain, 
are warranted to verify our results, although the randomized dou- 
ble-blinded design and multiple positive indices are supportive of 
nabilone’s efﬁcacy in assisting the management of diabetic neuro- 
pathic pain. We suggest that nabilone should be considered as a 
potential adjuvant in the management of NeP due to DPN.
