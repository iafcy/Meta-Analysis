Objectives: To determine whether plant-derived cannabis medicinal extracts 
(CME) can alleviate neurogenic symptoms unresponsive to standard 
treatment, and to quantify adverse effects. 
Design: A consecutive series of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
single-patient cross-over trials with two-week treatment periods. 
Setting: Patients attended as outpatients, but took the CME at home. 
Subjects: Twenty-four patients with multiple sclerosis (18), spinal cord injury 
(4), brachial plexus damage (1), and limb amputation due to neuro(cid:142)bromatosis 
(1). 
Intervention: Whole-plant extracts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 
cannabidiol (CBD), 1:1 CBD:THC, or matched placebo were self-administered 
by sublingual spray at doses determined by titration against symptom relief or 
unwanted effects within the range of 2.5–120 mg/24 hours. 
Measures used: Patients recorded symptom, well-being and intoxication 
scores on a daily basis using visual analogue scales. At the end of each 
two-week period an observer rated severity and frequency of symptoms on 
numerical rating scales, administered standard measures of disability (Barthel 
Index), mood and cognition, and recorded adverse events. 
Results: Pain relief associated with both THC and CBD was signi(cid:142)cantly 
superior to placebo. Impaired bladder control, muscle spasms and spasticity 
were improved by CME in some patients with these symptoms. Three 
patients had transient hypotension and intoxication with rapid initial dosing of 
THC-containing CME. 
Conclusions: Cannabis medicinal extracts can improve neurogenic symptoms 
unresponsive to standard treatments. Unwanted effects are predictable and 
generally well tolerated. Larger scale studies are warranted to con(cid:142)rm these 
(cid:142)ndings.

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other 
cannabinoids have been shown1 to ameliorate 
both tremor and spasticity in a well-validated ani- 
mal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). There are 
many anecdotal reports2,3 
that cannabis can 
relieve some of the troublesome symptoms of MS 
and spinal cord injury. Open or single-blind 
observations in a small number of patients have 
given some support to these reports.4–6 Two small 
placebo-controlled studies7,8 indicated that THC 
in doses between 5 and 10mg orally was signi(cid:142)- 
cantly superior to placebo in relieving spasticity 
with minimal adverse effects, and Martyn et al.9 
reported that nabilone relieved muscle spasms 
and nocturia better than placebo in a study of a 
single case. Recent scienti(cid:142)c reviews in the UK10 
and 
in 
cannabis-derived medicines, but there are also 
dissenting voices12 and studies suggesting cau- 
tion.13 In this context, and given the legal and 
social arguments 
systematic 
research into the risks and bene(cid:142)ts that may be 
associated with cannabis-derived medicines is 
required. 






Recently, standardized whole-plant cannabis 
medicinal extracts (CME) have become available 
for clinical research. This is important because 
many components of the plant other than THC 
may have therapeutic potential or synergistic 
activity.14 
nonpsychoactive 
cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD), as well 
as various terpenoids and (cid:143)avonoids. CBD is of 
particular interest because of its potent antioxi- 
dant and anti-in(cid:143)ammatory properties, along 
with 
it may modulate 
unwanted THC effects.14 Selective breeding, a 
computer-controlled growing environment, and 
rigorous analytic procedures during extraction 
can be used to ensure the purity and stability of 
these extracts.15 Choice of delivery system 
remains critical to the successful clinical applica- 
tion of CME. Smoking is inappropriate for a 
pharmaceutical product, and bioavailability from 
the gastrointestinal tract is unpredictable. The 
sublingual route has been selected because it 
lends 
itself to self-titration by the patient 
and provides a satisfactory pharmacokinetic 
pro(cid:142)le.16 

This exploratory trial was designed as a pilot 
for future large-scale cohort studies. It set out to 
explore the practicalities of patient self-titration, 
to identify a satisfactory pattern of dosing, to 
establish whether neurogenic symptoms could be 
alleviated by sublingual CME, and to identify 
potential adverse effects. Its design was limited 
by various legal considerations relating to the 
medical use of CME within the UK at the time. 


The sample was drawn from local neurological 
rehabilitation outpatient 
individual 
patients who had heard of the project locally, and 
a database of patients who had contacted GW 
Pharmaceuticals to register their interest in tak- 
ing part in research. Eligible patients had to have 
a neurological diagnosis and to be able to iden- 
tify troublesome symptoms which were stable 
and unresponsive to standard treatments. The 
most predominant of these were neuropathic 
pain, spasticity, muscle spasms, impaired bladder 
control and tremor. Patients were excluded if 
they had a history of: drug or alcohol abuse, seri- 
ous psychiatric illness (excluding depression asso- 
ciated with the neurological condition), serious 
cardiovascular disease or active epilepsy. The 
study was approved by the local research ethics 
committee. 
After giving full informed consent to partici- 
pate, each patient was screened for suitability and 
up to (cid:142)ve target symptoms identi(cid:142)ed. Those 
patients taking other supplies of cannabis were 
asked to stop for four weeks before entry, and 
not to take any during the study. Assessments 
were conducted at baseline and then at the end 
of each two-week study period. The overall study 
(cid:143)ow of patients is shown in Figure 1. 
The following measures were used. Subjects 
kept a daily diary in which they scored their tar- 
get symptoms by means of visual analogue scales 
(VAS) at the same time each day. They also used 
VAS to provide a daily record of subjective 
intoxication, alertness, appetite, happiness, relax- 
ation, optimism, energy, general well-being, sleep 
and feeling refreshed. 
At each two-weekly assessment visit, the sub- 
jects completed the Short Orientation-Memory- 










Concentration (SOMC) test,17 the Barthel Activ- 
ities of Daily Living Index,18 
the Rivermead 
Mobility Index,19 and the General Health Ques- 
tionnaire 28.20 The following measures were 
taken when applicable: Ashworth scale for spas- 
ticity21; Nine Hole Peg Test of manual dexterity22; 
10-metre timed walk; numerical rating scales of 
fatigue, pain, spasticity, bladder urgency and uri- 
nary incontinence, and frequency of muscle 
spasms and nocturia. 
The test articles were whole-plant extracts of 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-rich CME), 
cannabidiol (CBD-rich CME) and a 1:1 prepara- 
tion of the two (THC:CBD). These were pre- 
sented in a pump-action sublingual spray that 
delivered 2.5 mg THC and/or CBD at each actu- 
ation. The maximum permitted dose of each 
CME was 120 mg / 24 hours. The placebo spray 
contained inert plant material and solvent only. 
incorporated a peppermint 
All preparations 
(cid:143)avour to disguise the taste of CME. Patients 
continued to take all previously prescribed med- 
ication but were asked not to take any other 
cannabis during the study. 
Following a drug-free run-in period and base- 
line assessments, the (cid:142)rst period of dosing was 
with open label THC:CBD in order to familiar- 
ize the subject with procedures and ensure they 
could tolerate a CME. First dosing for each treat- 
ment period took place in clinic under nursing 
and medical supervision, and was followed by a 
two-week period of home dosing. The initial 
clinic regime permitted up to eight sprays (20 mg 
of THC and/or CBD) to be administered over a 
period of 70 minutes. This sometimes resulted in 
marked intoxication, so from subject 8 onwards 
the maximum clinic dose was reduced to four 
sprays over 2 hours. Patient 14 became intoxi- 
cated after four sprays, so for subsequent patients 
initial dosing was further reduced to two sprays 
over 2 hours. All patients were closely monitored 
for 4 hours after the start of dosing. 
On leaving the clinic patients were instructed 
to increase their dose cautiously over the (cid:142)rst 
week of each period, monitoring bene(cid:142)t and 
adverse effects, until an optimal dose was 
obtained. The timing of each spray was recorded 
in 
the daily diary. Research nurses main- 
tained regular telephone contact to check on the 
patient’s well-being and ability to use the spray. 
After the (cid:142)rst two-week period using open- 
label known THC:CBD, the patient entered an 
eight-week double-blind study phase with four 
two-week stages using THC:CBD, or CBD alone, 
or THC alone, or placebo. Randomization was 
achieved using Williams’ squares, and vials for 
each two-week period were allocated and coded 
before despatch to the investigators. The patient 
was then given a supply of vials to use over each 
two-week period. Initially, for ethical reasons, 
patients were allowed a supply of open-label 
THC:CBD as ‘rescue’ medication during the 
cross-over trial but were encouraged to use it as 
sparingly as possible. Results from the subgroup 
of patients who used zero or negligible amounts 
of rescue medication were subjected to separate 
statistical analysis. 
At the end of the double-blind cross-over 
study, patients were allowed to continue on 
active medication as part of a long-term safety 
and tolerability study if they chose to do so. 
Since the (cid:142)rst week of each treatment period 
was spent titrating up to optimal dosing patterns 
and may have been compromised by carry-over 
effects, daily VAS scores were averaged for days 
8–14 in each period for comparison between peri- 
ods. Data collected at each assessment point were 
analysed in their entirety. Treatments during the 
double-blind periods were compared using analy- 
sis of variance with patient, period and treatment 
as factors. Least square means for each treatment 
and the difference in least square means between 
each active treatment and placebo were calcu- 
lated. In addition, comparisons were made 
between baseline and placebo using paired 
t-tests. A two-sided signi(cid:142)cance level of 5% was 
used to determine statistical signi(cid:142)cance. 

Twenty-four patients were enrolled into the 
study, and three of these withdrew during the 
open label THC:CBD period. One could not get 
bene(cid:142)t without intoxication, one had a vasovagal 
episode during (cid:142)rst clinic dosing, and one devel- 
oped a sublingual burning sensation. Data from 
one other patient could not be included because, 
owing to marked sensitivity to the psychoactive 
effects of THC, she did not complete all treat- 





ment periods. Half the sample reported having 
used cannabis for medicinal purposes on at least 
one occasion in the past, but none had done so 
within the previous six months. Twenty patients 
(10 males) completed the study, of whom 14 had 
multiple sclerosis (MS), four had spinal cord 
injury, one had a brachial plexus lesion and a 
neuropathy, and one had an amputation with 
pain in the phantom limb. Average age of the 
sample was 48 years, and distribution of target 
symptoms was as follows: pain = 13; muscle 
spasms = 17; spasticity = 9; impaired bladder con- 
trol = 11; tremor = 8. Twelve patients used zero 
or negligible amounts of rescue medication. Data 
were analysed for the whole sample, and sepa- 
rately for the rescue-free group. This analysis 
revealed a very similar pattern of responses to 
outcome measures between the two groups. 
Plasma samples con(cid:142)rmed that sublingual CME 
were reliably absorbed. 
In Tables 1–3, (cid:142)gures in bold indicate scores in 
the randomized periods that are statistically dif- 
ferent from placebo. Table 1 shows the mean 
diary VAS scores for the whole sample. In com- 
parison with placebo, CBD CME signi(cid:142)cantly 
improved pain, THC CME signi(cid:142)cantly improved 
pain, muscle spasm, spasticity and appetite, and 
THC:CBD signi(cid:142)cantly improved muscle spasm 
and sleep. All three CME produced improve- 
ments in other parameters in comparison with 
placebo that did not reach statistical signi(cid:142)cance. 
Table 2 shows the results from the two-weekly 
assessments in the whole sample. In comparison 
with placebo all three CME produced signi(cid:142)cant 
improvements in ratings of spasticity, and both 
THC CME and THC:CBD signi(cid:142)cantly reduced 
the frequency of muscle spasms. THC CME 
reduced SOMC more than the other extracts. 
Table 3 shows the doses of test article and res- 
cue medication in each period for the whole sam- 
ple and rescue-free subgroup, and self-ratings of 
intoxication. Use of rescue medication did not 
differ signi(cid:142)cantly across treatment groups. Level 
of intoxication was highest following THC CME. 
In the rescue-free group, average daily intake of 
sprays was 30% higher in the placebo period than 
in the active periods. 
Individual patients also reported bene(cid:142)ts with 
other symptoms such as co-ordination, bladder 
and bowel control, and visual acuity but these 
were not studied systematically.

Four subjects reported soreness or numbness of 
the mouth or throat. 

This preliminary study demonstrates that CME 
can alleviate previously intractable neurologically 
based symptoms, including pain, spasms and 
spasticity in some patients. Intoxication seemed 
to be primarily associated with THC CME but 
even here was usually of tolerable intensity. 
CBD CME appeared to have analgesic and 
anti-spasticity properties in its own right. These 
(cid:142)ndings, which require independent con(cid:142)rma- 
tion, are potentially important because CBD is 
nonpsychoactive and has a relatively benign 
adverse event pro(cid:142)le. 
Early experience with rapid initial dosing with 
THC:CBD indicated the need for more gradual 
introduction to CME. When over-dosing did take 
place supportive measures were all that were 
required. Patients disliked 
intoxication and 
wished to avoid it, in contrast to recreational 
users. During self-titration this was the dose-lim- 
iting effect in several patients, and was the pri- 
mary reason for withdrawal in three cases. How- 
ever, with careful self-titration most patients 
were able to achieve useful symptom relief at a 
subintoxication dose. Soreness from the alcohol 
solvent was noted in a few patients and caused 
one to withdraw. 
No patients were suspected of abusing CME, 
and most used doses that were much less than the

maximum permitted. Some patients had the drug 
administered by family members or paid carers 
and again there were no practical problems. 
The study had methodological limitations as a 
consequence of the need to adopt a cautious 
design, primarily to protect patients but also to 
satisfy regulatory authorities. It was felt neces- 
sary to demonstrate patients’ ability to tolerate a 
cannabis derivative by exposing them to a two- 
week period on open-label THC:CBD before 
embarking on the double-blind study. Initially, 
access to THC:CBD as ‘rescue medication’ dur- 
ing the randomized crossover was allowed to 
allay potential loss of bene(cid:142)t when moving from 
active to inactive medication. After experience 
with 13 patients it was felt that rescue medication 
was not required ethically or in practice. This 
decision was endorsed by the research ethics 
committee. However, although patients had prior 
experience of active medication, they did not use 
much rescue medication suggesting that they 
were truly unaware of what drug was being given. 
The patients were heterogeneous both in terms 
of underlying diagnosis and in terms of the main 
troublesome symptoms. A large number of mea- 
sures were used, many of them visual analogue 
scales or numerical rating scales. The analysis 
involved a large number of statistical compar- 
isons. Consequently it is possible that some sta- 
tistically signi(cid:142)cant results arose through chance. 
However, the positive (cid:142)ndings are internally con- 
sistent and in keeping with existing evidence 
from basic science and anecdotal patient reports. 
The emergent side-effect pro(cid:142)le was consistent 
with expectations for cannabis-based medicines. 
A third potential area of concern is the great 
variability in dose used. This obviously might 
reduce the likelihood of detecting an effect, but 
conversely it allows the patient to titrate to an 
effective dose without side-effects. Dose titration 
is common when using symptomatic treatments 
such as this. 
A (cid:142)nal area of concern is that patients may 
have self-selected as being particularly responsive 
to cannabis. The main purpose of this study was 
to determine if there was any evidence of a ben- 
e(cid:142)cial response, and so this was not of great con- 
cern. However it should be noted that only half 
had any previous experience of cannabis, and 
also that most drug interventions probably only 
help a proportion of all patients taking the drug. 
In conclusion, this preliminary investigation 
suggests that sublingual CME may be an effec- 
tive treatment for resistant symptoms associated 
with neurological diseases including pain, muscle 
spasms and spasticity, impaired bladder control, 
reduced appetite and poor sleep. Larger scale 
studies to con(cid:142)rm these (cid:142)ndings and further 
explore the utility of CME are now required.
