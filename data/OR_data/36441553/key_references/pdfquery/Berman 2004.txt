The objective was to investigate the effectiveness of cannabis-based medicines for treatment of chronic pain associated with brachial 
plexus root avulsion. This condition is an excellent human model of central neuropathic pain as it represents an unusually homogenous group 
in terms of anatomical location of injury, pain descriptions and patient demographics. Forty-eight patients with at least one avulsed root and 
baseline pain score of four or more on an 11-point ordinate scale participated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three period 
crossover study. All patients had intractable symptoms regardless of current analgesic therapy. Patients entered a baseline period of 2 weeks, 
followed by three, 2-week treatment periods during each of which they received one of three oromucosal spray preparations. These were 
placebo and two whole plant extracts of Cannabis sativa L.: GW-1000-02 (Sativexw), containing D9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):cannabidiol 
(CBD) in an approximate 1:1 ratio and GW-2000-02, containing primarily THC. The primary outcome measure was the mean pain severity 
score during the last 7 days of treatment. Secondary outcome measures included pain related quality of life assessments. The primary 
outcome measure failed to fall by the two points deﬁned in our hypothesis. However, both this measure and measures of sleep showed 
statistically signiﬁcant improvements. The study medications were generally well tolerated with the majority of adverse events, including 
intoxication type reactions, being mild to moderate in severity and resolving spontaneously. Studies of longer duration in neuropathic pain 
are required to conﬁrm a clinically relevant, improvement in the treatment of this condition.

Avulsion of nerve rootlets from the spinal cord following 
traction injuries to the brachial plexus frequently produces a 
highly characteristic pain syndrome. Constant, spontaneous 
crushing and burning pain is felt in the distal part of the 
anaesthetic limb and is often accompanied by shooting 
pain (Frazier and Skillern, 1911; Parry, 1980). It is not 
uncommon for the pain to persist for many years making 
this a difﬁcult condition to treat. Options include empirical 



drug therapy, nerve transfer surgery and dorsal root entry 
zone (DREZ) lesions. There is a small body of evidence to 
support surgical intervention (Berman et al., 1998; Samii 
et al., 2001; Thomas and Kitchen, 1994). However, the 
published evidence on drug treatment 
is essentially 
anecdotal. 
Many of our patients have given spontaneous reports 
regarding the efﬁcacy of ‘street’ cannabis in treating the 
pain from brachial plexus avulsion. These have been in 
cases where the use of a wide range of anticonvulsants, 
opiates and tricyclic antidepressants have had only partial 
or no success. These reports led us to try nabilone on a 
number of occasions. This synthetic THC analogue is 
licensed in the United Kingdom as an antiemetic during

chemotherapy. Unfortunately its use has been limited by 
problems with availability and more particularly a 
perception that psychotropic side effects were more 
common at analgesic levels than was the case with 
cannabis (Hirst et al., 1998). Whole plant extracts of 
Cannabis sativa L. contain a complex mixture of natural 
cannabinoids and other chemical compounds. These may 
interact 
to provide a superior therapeutic proﬁle over 
single synthetic entities. It was therefore a logical step for 
us to test newly available pharmaceutical grade cannabis 
based medicines in patients with this condition. An 
additional reason for choosing this population of patients 
is that they are an unusually homogenous group in terms 
location of injury, pain descriptions and 
of anatomical 
demographics. They therefore represent an excellent 
human model of central neuropathic pain. 
The main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis extract is 
D9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This is an agonist at the 
CB1 receptor, which is found at many sites within the 
central nervous system (Pertwee, 2001). Some of its 
unwanted side effects may be modulated by another 
naturally occurring cannabinoid, cannabidiol 
(CBD) 
(McPartland and Russo, 2001). In this study we tested two 
whole plant extracts of Cannabis sativa L.; one with an 
approximate 1:1 ratio of THC:CBD, coded as GW-1000-02 
(Sativexw) and a THC extract, coded as GW-2000-02. The 
extracts were used in an oromucosal spray containing 
27 mg/ml THC and 25 mg/ml CBD and tested against 
an inactive placebo. Our primary question was whether 
GW-1000-02 reduced chronic pain, with GW-2000-02 
assessed as a secondary objective. In addition to further 
pain related questionnaires, secondary questions also aimed 
to review improvement in overall quality of life. Patients 
report that they cope better with their pain during work or 
other activities that provide distractions whereas periods of 
relaxation and sleep are more problematic. 


Study participants were recruited between December 
2001 and July 2002 from patients treated at the Royal 
National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) in Stanmore. This 
is the UK national referral centre for patients with brachial 
plexus injury. Most patients had previously been treated by 
the Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit at the RNOH and had also 
attended the pain clinic. 
Men and women aged 18 years or more, with at least one 
avulsed brachial plexus root and with the injury occurring 
R18 months previously were included. Patients who scored 
four or above on a zero to 10 eleven point ordinal pain 
severity scale at Visits 1 and 2 and had a pattern of pain that 
in the investigator’s opinion had been stable over the 
previous 4 weeks were eligible. No analgesics were 
prohibited; all permitted concurrent medication had to 
have been stable during the previous 4 weeks and was to 
remain stable during the study. Patients were required 
to stop any cannabis or cannabinoid use at least 7 days prior 
to entry into the study. 
Patients with a history of any of the following were 
ineligible: schizophrenia, other psychotic illness or signiﬁ- 
cant psychiatric illness, other than depression associated 
with chronic illness; serious cardiovascular disease; signiﬁ- 
cant renal or hepatic impairment; epilepsy or convulsions; 
signiﬁcant history of substance abuse; known adverse 
reaction to cannabis or the product excipients; surgery 
within 2 months (6 months for nerve repair). Female 
patients who were pregnant, lactating or at risk of pregnancy 
were also excluded. Concurrent use of levodopa, sildenaﬁl 
and fentanyl during the study was not permitted due to the 
theoretical inhibition of selected cytochrome P450 isoforms 
by CBD. For similar reasons the dose of amitriptyline was 
restricted to a maximum of 75 mg per day. 
Patients were not allowed to drive within 4 h of a dose of 
the study drug or if they felt intoxicated in any way (see 
Discussion). 
The local ethics committee at RNOH approved the study. 
The study was conducted according to the International 
Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki with respect to 
informed consent. 

This was a single centre, double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, 
three period crossover study. All 
patients self-administered GW-1000-02, GW-2000-02 and 
placebo, with each medication given for a minimum of 
14 days with the visit window allowing ﬂexibility in clinic 
appointment timing up to a maximum of 20 days. Patients 
were randomly allocated by a computer generated list to the 
six possible sequences of 
receiving the three study 
medications. Although the treatment sequence was blinded, 
sealed code break envelopes, one for each patient, contain- 
ing information on the treatment sequence were available if 
necessary. Blinding was maintained throughout the study. 
After the initial contact, patients attended for their ﬁrst 
visit. During this visit patients gave consent and underwent 
a full eligibility screen including physical examination, vital 
signs, and a battery of baseline assessments as described in 
Section 2.3. Patients recorded their baseline symptoms in a 
daily diary then returned for a second visit, 7–24 days later, 
for randomisation and dose introduction. Patients were 
instructed on how to self-medicate and were monitored in 
clinic over 4 h, on the dosing day at the start of each period, 
while they took up to four initial doses. Patients returned for 
their next visit 2 weeks later for end of period assessments 
and to receive the next medication. This process was 
repeated at a fourth visit, 2 weeks later. Two weeks after 
this, patients attended for a ﬁfth and ﬁnal visit that included 



At each clinic visit, patients recorded a pain review score 
on a BS-11 scale. On this scale patients recorded the 
severity of their pain over the previous 7 days. 
Sleep quality was measured using a BS-11 scale from 
zero ‘Best Imaginable’ to 10 ‘Worst Imaginable’. Sleep 
disturbance (number of times woken due to pain) was 
measured using a four point categorical scale of none, once, 
twice, more than twice. Both these measures were recorded 
daily in the patient diaries. Patients also recorded the 
number of medication sprays taken during each 24-h period. 
The short form McGill questionnaire (SF-MPQ), Pain 
Disability Index (PDI) and General Health Questionnaire-12 
(GHQ-12) were administered at Visit 2 (baseline), Visits 3 
and 4 (medication crossover) and Visit 5 (end of study) 
(Banks, 1983; Melzack, 1987; Tait et al., 1987). 

A visual analogue scale (VAS) intoxication score was 
recorded at each visit along with AEs that were reported on 
open questioning. A physical examination was performed at 
Visits 1 and 5. Standard full blood count, urea, electrolytes, 
liver chemistry, urinalysis and 12 lead ECG were performed 
at Visits 1 and 5 or upon withdrawal. Additionally at Visit 1 
a full medical history was taken from all patients including 
recording all concomitant medications. Female patients of 
child-bearing age were given a urine based pregnancy test at 
Visits 1 and 5. 

The sample size was based on the primary variable of the 
BS-11 pain scale. Based on the limited previous published 
work for this condition an approximate within patient 
standard deviation of 2.4 was assumed. Assuming a drop out 
rate of 20%, 48 patients were required to detect a mean two 
point difference in change from baseline in pain score 
between the cannabis based medicines and placebo with 
aZ0.05 and a power of 90% using a two sided signiﬁcance 
test. The intention to treat population consisted of all 
the patients who entered into the study, were randomised 


a clinical assessment and end of study assessments. 
A ﬂowchart of the study plan is shown in Fig. 1. 
Depending upon their clinical response to the dose of 
study medication given in the clinic each patient was 
advised to take between four and eight sprays the next day. 
Patients were instructed not to increase their total daily 
number of sprays by more than 50% of the number taken 
during the previous 24 h. Patients were allowed to titrate 
freely within the following limits, according to subjective 
symptom relief and adverse events (AEs). The maximum 
permitted dose was eight sprays (THC 21.6 mg or THC 
21.6 mg/CBD 20 mg or placebo) at any one time or within a 
3-h period and 48 sprays (THC 129.6 mg or THC 
129.6 mg/CBD 120 mg or placebo) within any 24 h period. 
At the ﬁnal visit patients were given the choice to stop 
the medication or receive GW-1000-02 within an open label 
extension study. The purposes of this extension included 
collection of long-term safety and efﬁcacy data and 
prevention of patients feeling the need to seek illegal 
sources of cannabis. The extension study is still in progress. 
This paper has been presented according to the 



The primary measure of efﬁcacy was a standard eleven 
point ordinal pain severity scale ranging from zero ‘Best 
Imaginable’ to 10 ‘Worst Imaginable’, recorded in the daily 
diary. This was recorded as an eleven point Box Scale 
(BS-11) where patients ticked one of a row of boxes above 
the numbers 0–10 (Jensen et al., 1986, 1989). Baseline was 
taken as the average of these scores for the last 7 days before 
dosing. The on-treatment scores were the average of the last 
7 days of each of the 2-week treatment periods, to minimise 
carry over effects from the previous period. Based on 
previously published work, it was assumed a priori that a 
difference of at least two points in the BS-11 pain score 
between the active and placebo phases would represent a 
clinically signiﬁcant change (Farrar et al., 2001).

from a treatment period. Any patients who received at least 
one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis 
population. 
No washout period was used between the three treatment 
periods. Any carry over effect was unlikely to be for greater 
than 2–3 days so the ﬁrst week of titration for each period 
would be sufﬁcient 
to counteract any carry over with 
efﬁcacy comparisons being made by averaging the variables 
over the last 7 days of treatment. By 24 h post-dose the 
plasma level of the major efﬁcacy constituents of GW-1000- 
02 is usually at or below the lower limit of quantiﬁcation. 
In trials conducted to date using GW-1000-02, the putative 
effective half-lives of CBD, THC and 11-hydroxy THC 
(the main metabolite of THC) have been calculated to be in 
the order of 100, 85 and 130 min, respectively (Guy, 2003).

Twenty two (45.8%) had previously used cannabis medic- 
inally and 29 (60.4%) had used it recreationally. The pattern 
of injury, operative repair and time since last surgical 
intervention are shown in Table 1. Of the 45 completing 
patients, 36 (80%) entered the open label extension study, 
using GW-1000-02. 
Patients were taking a variety of analgesic medication 
concurrently throughout the study, this is shown in Table 2. 
Forty patients (83%) were taking at least one concomitant 
medication, of these, eight patients were taking only one 
medication, 12 patients were taking two, four taking three, 
nine taking four medications and seven were taking ﬁve or 
more. Some patients may have failed previously tried 
analgesics. 




Of the 48 patients randomised three withdrew before 
completing the study. One patient experienced nausea and 
vomiting during placebo administration, another with- 
drew due to an episode of feeling faint whilst 
taking 
GW-1000-02, the last patient withdrew due to feelings of 
anxiety and paranoia, experienced whilst taking placebo

each treatment period. The SF-MPQ scores, pain review 
BS-11 scores, PDI and GHQ-12 were recorded at the start of 
the study and the end of each treatment period. The present 
pain intensity (PPI) section of the SF-MPQ questionnaire 
was not analysed. 

The appropriateness of the protocol speciﬁed statistical 
model was investigated by an inspection of the ﬁtted 
residuals and no statistical issues were apparent. In addition, 
it is noted that neither the mean pain score nor the pain 
review score recorded at clinic visits provided any evidence 
of a treatment by period interaction effect. See discussion of 
carryover effects in Section 2.4. 

The difference in the mean diary BS-11 pain score 
between both study medications and placebo was statistically 
signiﬁcant but did not reach the a priori assumed level 
for clinical signiﬁcance of two boxes; GW-1000-02 
compared with placebo equalled a reduction of 0.58 boxes 
(PZ0.005, 95% CI: K0.98, K0.18 boxes) and GW-2000-02 
compared with placebo gave a reduction of 0.64 boxes 
(PZ0.002, 95% CI: K1.03, K0.24 boxes). Fig. 3 shows the 
mean daily pain score by day and Fig. 4 shows the mean daily 
pain scores during each period. 

Table 3 shows the mean scores, P-values, and conﬁdence 
intervals (given as the difference from placebo) for the 
secondary outcome measures. The sleep quality and sleep 
disturbance scores are the daily means over the last 7 days of 

The numbers needed to treat (NNT) have been calculated 
according to the method described by Walter (2001). The 
NNTs for the diary BS-11 pain score are shown in Table 4 
for threshold reductions in pain scores of one and two points 
as well as 30 and 50% against placebo (primary measure). 
Table 5 presents the same data for sleep quality. 
Using a 30% decrease as the threshold for clinical 
relevance of pain relief the equivalent NNTs would be 9.0 
(GW-1000-02) and 7.7 (GW-2000-02), respectively. At the 
50% response level only one patient in the GW-2000-02 
treatment group was classed as a responder (NNT 46) and 
none in GW-1000-02 group. 

The study medication was well tolerated by all patients 
with no serious AEs occurring throughout 
the study. 
There were more AEs experienced during the active 
medication periods than during the placebo period. 
However, the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in 
severity and resolved spontaneously. Intoxication VAS 
(100 mm) scores at the end of each dosing period were 
1 mm for placebo, 5.9 mm for GW-1000-02 and 9.7 mm for 
GW-2000-02. Table 6 provides a summary of the number of 
patients experiencing the ﬁve most common treatment 
emergent, treatment related AEs by preferred term.

AEs that may indicate intoxication include: dizziness, 
somnolence, feeling drunk, euphoric mood, headache, 
nausea and lethargy. The incidence of these, based upon 
the treatment emergent, all causality AEs, does not differ 
greatly across the three treatment groups. Euphoric mood 
and feeling drunk were not experienced by the placebo 
group, dizziness was the most frequently experienced AE, 
see Table 6, with also the largest difference in incidence 
when either of the active medications is compared with 
placebo. 

This is the ﬁrst randomised controlled trial of any drug 
used to treat pain resulting from brachial plexus avulsion 
injury. 
When treatment with study medications was compared to 
placebo the primary outcome measure (BS-11 pain severity 
score) failed to fall by the two points deﬁned in our 
hypothesis. However, both this measure and measures of 
sleep showed statistically signiﬁcant 
improvements. All 
patients remained on their existing medications throughout 
the study therefore this modest beneﬁt is in addition to that 
provided by existing medications. 
The lack of change in the PDI may reﬂect the patients’ 
underlying physical disability, which was not affected by 
the study medication. 
A number of factors may have acted to confound the 
reliability of the results. The most problematic of these was 
the difﬁculty of guaranteeing full blinding although efforts 
were made to ensure that 
this was maintained. Many 
patients had previous experience of cannabis. Side effects 
suggestive of mild intoxication were more common in the 
active treatment phases when compared to placebo. 
Dysgeusia (bad taste) was also more common with active 
treatment. If patients associated these effects with receiving 
active drug this could have biased the study towards a 
positive outcome. 
Patients were selected from the pain clinic and also by 
searching patient notes for mention of signiﬁcant pain. Such 
a method may introduce bias although it is not clear whether 
any other selection method would have been better. 
Patients continued to receive their regular analgesics 
throughout the study. As cannabis based medicines are 
likely to be used as adjunctive therapy we wanted the study 
design to reﬂect this. This may have reduced the measurable 
analgesic effect although conversely there is the possibility 
of synergistic effects with opiates (Lynch and Clark, 2003). 
Another reason for allowing patients to continue their 
regular analgesics was to improve the recruitment rate. 
We chose a self-titration dosing schedule for several 
reasons. Data from human volunteer studies showed a high 
inter-subject variability in the bioavailability of GW-1000- 
02. Patients from previous studies had, due to symptom 
relief and tolerability, required the full range of dose, 
between 1 and 48 sprays per day (Notcutt et al., 2004; Wade 
et al., 2003). Self-titration also enabled patients, most of 
who were working and driving, to achieve their individual 
optimum therapeutic dose by balancing any analgesia 
against possible side effects and allowing them to vary the 
dose depending on their levels of pain, activity and to ﬁt in 
with their lifestyle. 
The sample size was sufﬁcient to show a statistically 
signiﬁcant change in the primary outcome measure. A larger 
sample and longer duration of treatment, would be required 
to comment more meaningfully on the true size of this effect 
(Moore et al., 1998). The extension study should provide 
this information in due course. 
An important aspect of this study is the homogeneity of 
the study population. All injuries occurred at anatomically 
similar sites and pain descriptions were similar. The 
consistency of brachial plexus pain has been well described 
before (Bruxelle et al., 1988; Parry, 1980). It would be 
simplistic to suggest that the underlying mechanism of pain 
is the same in all patients following brachial plexus 
avulsion. There is much variation in the precise anatomical 
location of injury both in relation to the proximity of each 
avulsion to the spinal cord and the combination of nerve 
roots affected. There is evidence to suggest, however, that 
segmental deafferentation of the dorsal horn may be an 
important mechanism in the production of pain following 
avulsion injury. Both burst and continuous spontaneous 
ﬁring of dorsal horn neurones have been reported following 
experimental avulsion injuries in the cat (Ovelmen-Levitt, 
1988). Similar patterns of activity have also been recorded 
in man following spinal cord injury (Loeser et al., 1968). It 
has been suggested that such patterns of neuronal activity 
correlates with both the continuous and paroxysmal patterns 
of pain seen following avulsion injuries although this was 
not conﬁrmed in a recent study (Guenot et al., 2003). 
Can these proposed mechanisms be used to inform 
treatment using the 
effective treatment? Neurosurgical 
DREZ lesion was originally developed in the 1970s and 
continues to be used (Nashold and Ostdahl, 1979; Samii 
et al., 2001; Thomas and Kitchen, 1994). DREZ is an 
effective long-term treatment for brachial plexus avulsion 
pain producing long-term signiﬁcant pain reduction in about 
two-thirds of patients. This strongly suggests that the dorsal 
horn is a signiﬁcant site of ongoing pain generation 
following avulsion. Unfortunately DREZ is associated 


with a signiﬁcant rate of neurological complications limit- 
ing the use of this technique to only the most severe and 
refractory cases. 
Surgical repair of avulsion injuries by nerve transfer has 
also been reported to lead to amelioration of pain (Berman 
the 
et al., 1998). If this is a true causal relationship, 
mechanisms are unclear. 
Pharmacological treatment still remains the ﬁrst line 
treatment for avulsion pain. In the absence of speciﬁc 
randomised trials this is based on their use in other 
neuropathic pain syndromes. Anticonvulsants, 
tricyclic 
antidepressants and opiates are the main drug groups used. 
The use of tricyclic antidepressants has frequently been 
limited by side effects that are unacceptable to this active 
group of patients. There is anecdotal evidence that opiates 
are only partially effective in a signiﬁcant proportion of 
these patients (Berman et al., 1998). 
Like the opioid system, the cannabinoids modulate pain 
processing at multiple sites within the central nervous 
system (Rice, 2001). Cannabinoids produce analgesia 
independently of opiates. Cannabinoid analgesia is well 
established in animal models of neuropathic pain (Bridges 
et al., 2001; Fox et al., 2001; Hamann and di Vadi, 1999; 
Herzberg et al., 1997; Mao et al., 2000). However, evidence 
for cannabinoid analgesia in man is limited. A recent 
systematic review revealed only two single subject case 
reports speciﬁcally looking at neuropathic pain (Campbell 
et al., 2001; Holdcroft et al., 1997; Maurer et al., 1990). 
Randomised controlled studies are only now starting to 
appear. The recently published CAMS study did show 
improvements in pain in multiple sclerosis with oral 
cannabis extract and also oral synthetic D9-THC when 
compared to placebo (Zajicek et al., 2003). 
Like this study, a recent study of the effect of cannabis 
showed 
based medicines on neurogenic symptoms 
improved sleep quality (Wade et al., 2003). This may 
therefore prove a useful alternative to amitriptyline. It 
would be worthwhile to conduct studies comparing these 
two agents. 
The adverse effects of smoked cannabis have been 
studied closely (Joy et al., 1999). When used recreationally 
cannabis does appear to have some potential for depen- 
dence (Ashton, 1999). There is also a consensus opinion 
illness may be aggravated by 
that established mental 
cannabis (Patton et al., 2002). For this reason, patients 
with a history of signiﬁcant mental illness were excluded 
from this study. Heavy, 
recreational cannabis 
smoking at a young age in vulnerable subjects may be 
associated with an increased risk of subsequently devel- 
oping schizophrenia (Arseneault et al., 2002; Zammit 
et al., 2002), but this remains a controversial issue. In 
assessing potential risk to medicinal subjects, it should 
also be borne in mind that the aim of the recreational user 
is to achieve intoxication, whereas, as seen in this study 
the aim of the medicinal user is to avoid it. No medication 
can be considered risk free. However, in the controlled 

setting there is no evidence that cannabis based medicine 
is less safe than other analgesic drugs. 
Eighty percent of the patients considered the study drugs 
of sufﬁcient beneﬁt to warrant continuing into the extension 
study. This puts into context the clinical relevance of the 
modest drop in pain scores in a condition that is long lasting, 
difﬁcult to treat and that has already proven refractory to our 
standard methods of treatment by both nerve repair and oral 
analgesics. The presented NNTs might be useful for 
clinicians to determine whether this drug would have a 
role in their practice. However, this must be set against the 
lack of consistency in outcome measures in central pain 
drug trials and consequently the difﬁculty in comparing 
NNTs across studies (Finnerup et al., 2002). 
Further longer term studies of cannabis based medicines 
in central neuropathic pain are now required to demonstrate 
a clinically relevant, improvement in the treatment of this 
condition.
