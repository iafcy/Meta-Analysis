Cannabinoids are known to have analgesic properties. We evaluated the eﬀect of oro-mucosal sativex, (THC: CBD), an endo- 
cannabinoid system modulator, on pain and allodynia, in 125 patients with neuropathic pain of peripheral origin in a ﬁve-week, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial. Patients remained on their existing stable analgesia. A self-titrat- 
ing regimen was used to optimise drug administration. Sixty-three patients were randomised to receive sativex and 62 placebo. The 
mean reduction in pain intensity scores (primary outcome measure) was greater in patients receiving sativex than placebo (mean 
adjusted scores (cid:2)1.48 points vs. (cid:2)0.52 points on a 0–10 Numerical Rating Scale (p = 0.004; 95% CI: (cid:2)1.59, (cid:2)0.32). Improvements 
in Neuropathic Pain Scale composite score (p = 0.007), sleep NRS (p = 0.001), dynamic allodynia (p = 0.042), punctate allodynia 
(p = 0.021), Pain Disability Index (p = 0.003) and Patient’s Global Impression of Change (p < 0.001) were similarly greater on sat- 
ivex vs. placebo. Sedative and gastrointestinal side eﬀects were reported more commonly by patients on active medication. Of all 
participants, 18% on sativex and 3% on placebo withdrew during the study. An open-label extension study showed that the initial 
pain relief was maintained without dose escalation or toxicity for 52 weeks.

drugs, opioids and topical local anaesthetics constituting 
the ﬁrst-line therapy [2]. Despite diﬀerences in their 
mechanism of action, these agents appear similar in 
analgesic eﬃcacy and tolerability. There is a well-recog- 
nised need for better pain relief than is currently avail- 
able. This study reports the eﬀect of the administration 
of a highly standardised THC:CBD endocannabinoid

neuropathic pain. Identiﬁcation of cannabinoid recep- 
tors [20] and encouraging results from preclinical and 
clinical studies [15,16] and change in the political and 
scientiﬁc scene in some countries, notably Canada, have 
led to revived interest in cannabinoids as a therapeutic 
modality. Two controlled trials on central pain associ- 
ated with MS found short-term eﬃcacy from them 
[26,30], whereas two other studies in which pain was 
not a primary outcome measure gave conﬂicting results 
[33,40]. Neuropathic pain of peripheral or mixed periph- 
eral and central origin was reported to respond to aju- 
lemic acid, 
smoked cannabis; however, 
treatment arms in these studies were short, between 5 
and 14 days [1,6,19]. 

Sativex is derived from extracts of selected strains of 
cannabis plants (Cannabis sativa) which produce high 
and reproducible yields of the principal active cannabi- 
noids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and canna- 
bidiol (CBD). It is administered as a spray for sub- 
lingual 
administration. Each 
100 ll spray delivers 2.7 mg of THC and 2.5 mg of 
CBD. 

Cannabinoids are thought to work via two types of 
receptors, CB1 and CB2. CB1 is widely distributed in 
the peripheral and central nervous system, acting as a 
presynaptic modulator of neurotransmitter 
release. 
The main target for the eﬀects of THC, CB1, occurs 
at many sites critical for nociception. CB2 is also acti- 
vated by THC but in normal circumstances is found in 
immune cells only. However, in clinical pain the role of 
the CB2 receptor may be diﬀerent because following 
tissue injury it is shown to be expressed in central ner- 
vous system microglia and dorsal root ganglion cells 
following tissue injury [28] CBD appears to have lim- 
ited aﬃnity for either cannabinoid receptor, but in 
higher doses may potentiate the eﬀects of THC [32] 
and mediate non-cannabinoid eﬀects by activating the 
TRPV1 receptor [8]. Combining the two in the same 
preparation is thought to lead not only to increased 
analgesic eﬀect but may also result in antagonism of 
adverse eﬀects [27]. 


This was a 5-week multi-centre (5 centres in UK, 1 in Bel- 
gium), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel 
group study. Patients were screened to determine eligibility 
and completed baseline diary assessments of daily pain inten- 
sity and sleep disturbance scores in the 7–10 days prior to 
ﬁrst treatment assignment. After eligibility was conﬁrmed, 
patients were assigned to the next sequential randomisation 
number within each centre. The randomisation schedule 
had a 1:1 treatment allocation ratio with randomly permuted 
blocks stratiﬁed by centre and was generated using a com- 
puter based pseudo-random number algorithm. The randomi- 
sation schedule was held by the sponsor with a copy in 
patient-speciﬁc sealed envelopes sent to the pharmacy in each 
centre. Once the patient’s eligibility was conﬁrmed, they were 
assigned to the next sequential randomisation number within 
each centre. The placebo medication was identical in compo- 
sition, appearance, odour and taste with the study medication 
but without cannabis extract. That the smell and taste of the 
cannabinoid preparation might 
lead to unblinding was 
averted by disguising them with addition of peppermint oil 
to both preparations. All medication was provided in identi- 
cal amber vials, packaged and labelled by the sponsor. 

Patients had to have a current history of unilateral periph- 
eral neuropathic pain and allodynia. Further enrolment crite- 
ria are shown in Table 1. Concomitant analgesia was 
maintained at a stable dosage regimen for the duration of 
the study. The decision to recruit was based on the patient’s 
history. No tests for drugs of abuse potential were carried 
out. Ethical approval was granted by the Local Ethics Com- 
mittees of 
In one centre the 
approval was conditional on patients not driving during the 
trial. 


Initial dosing was under clinical supervision at the study 
site. A pre-dose 100 mm ‘‘Intoxication’’ (0 = no intoxication 
and 100 = extreme 
intoxication) Visual Analogue Scale 
(VAS) was obtained and vital signs were checked. A maxi- 
mum of 8 sprays were administered over 2 h with Intoxica- 
tion VAS and vital signs checked at regular intervals. If, 
following any dose, patients scored higher than 25 mm, or 
there were clinical concerns, e.g. the patients showing dys- 
phoria or cardiovascular changes, subsequent doses were 
omitted [6,7]. 
After satisfactory completion of initial dosing, patients 
began home dose titration and were allowed a maximum dose 
of 8 sprays per 3-hour interval and a maximum of 48 sprays 
per 24 h. At the next visit (after 7–10 days) titration, compli- 
ance and adverse events were reviewed, and patients advised 
on how to optimise dosing for the rest of the study period. 
Those patients who satisfactorily completed the trial were 
oﬀered the opportunity to participate in a common open-label 
extension study of sativex. 
All used and unused study medication containers were 
returned at each visit to the research centre. Patients were 
withdrawn from the study if there were indications of misuse, 
including failure to record dosage accurately. Periodic tele- 
phone monitoring was undertaken at pre-arranged times dur- 
ing home dosing to check the patient’s condition and to 
answer any queries. Throughout the study, allowable concom- 
itant medications or treatments were continued to provide ade- 
quate background analgesia at a constant dose. Any 
medication, other than the study medication taken during 
the study, was recorded. 
Patients kept a diary from the screening visit until end of 
treatment in which they recorded daily their pain and sleep 
scores (on the appropriate NRS), as well as adverse events 
and the number of sprays used.

Tests for allodynia were carried out at baseline and end of 
study. The investigator recorded the most painful area within 
the aﬀected territory. Mechanical dynamic allodynia was 
assessed by stroking the skin over the aﬀected area ﬁve times 
with a standardised brush, designed speciﬁcally for sensory 
testing (Senselab Brush-05, Somedic, Horby, Sweden) at 
P5 s intervals, and recording the pain severity on a 0–10 point 
scale. All strokes were of the same length, minimum 2 cm. 
Each dynamic allodynia score was calculated as the average 
of the ﬁve strokes. 
Punctate allodynia was measured using an in-house built 
pressure algometer comprising a strain gauge connected to a 
metal ﬁlament with a diameter of 1 mm and blunt tip at base- 
line and end of study. The ﬁlament was manually directed 
against the skin at an angle of 90(cid:4) and a steadily increasing 
pressure applied until the patient verbally indicated that they 
perceived pain (punctate pressure pain threshold). A contralat- 
eral mirror image site was used as control to identify any sys- 
temic eﬀect from the trial drugs, as well as to introduce the 
method to the patient before performing the test on the allo- 
dynic site. This control site was checked for evidence of local 
injury, scar, rash or neurological deﬁcit. During each session 
the normal contralateral side was tested ﬁrst. Once the patient 
indicated that the sensation of pressure had turned into pain, 
the algometer was removed and the pressure reading (in grams) 
recorded. The same method was used for allodynic sites. 
In addition, patients were asked to verbally rate the inten- 
sity of the pain elicited, choosing a number between 0 (no pain) 
and 10 (most intense pain imaginable). The investigators were 
aware of the previous punctate allodynia threshold and could 
use it as guidance. Because some investigators expressed con- 
cern at using a rigid threshold as a targe for the second mea- 
surement, it was agreed that they could exercise discretion in 
applying the force needed to reproduce approximately the 
same pain as at baseline. The patients’ verbal pain score and 
pressure used were recorded. Each punctate pain provocation 
test was done only once during a single visit. 

The primary outcome measure was a change from baseline 
on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of mean intensity of global 
neuropathic pain, where 0 = ‘‘No Pain’’ and 10 = ‘‘Worst Pos- 
sible Pain’’. Secondary measures included the composite score 
calculated from the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) [10], tests 
for mechanical allodynia, a four-step verbal rating scale for 
sleep disturbance (see below), 
the Pain Disability Index 
(PDI) [31], the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
of both pain and allodynia, and the General Health Question- 
naire (GHQ-12) [5]. Possible cognitive decline was assessed 
using the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests 
(BRB-N) [7]. Information regarding the frequency of adminis- 
tration of the medication was recorded by the subjects in their 
diary. Adverse events were collected at each clinic visit, and 
haematology, clinical chemistry and ECG monitored at the 
beginning and end of the study. 

The sample size calculation was based on an expected SD of 
1.8 for the pain intensity score, estimated from several studies 
on peripheral neuropathic pain. To detect a diﬀerence between 
treatment groups of 1.0 on a 0–10 (11-point) NRS with 80% 
power and a 5% level of signiﬁcance, 52 evaluable subjects 
per group were required. A dropout rate of 15% was antici- 
pated, bringing the total number of patients needed to 120. 


The primary analysis for the primary and secondary end- 
points was performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) popula- 
tion. The neuropathic pain intensity NRS score at baseline 
was deﬁned as the mean of all diary entries from Day (cid:2)7 to 
Day (cid:2)1 and, for the end of treatment score, the mean of all 
diary entries during the last 7 days in the study, or the last 3 
days in the event of withdrawal. The NRS scores were summa- 
rised by treatment group for baseline, each week and end of 
treatment. The change in NRS pain scores was compared 
between treatment groups using analysis of covariance, the 
model including treatment and trial centre as factors and base- 
line pain severity as a covariate. From this analysis the 
adjusted treatment means, treatment diﬀerence and 95% Con- 
ﬁdence Interval (95% CI) for the treatment diﬀerence were 
calculated. 
The total scores for all questionnaires (NPS, PDI, GHQ- 
12), as well as 0–10 NRS ratings of punctate and mechanical 
allodynia, were obtained at baseline and end of the 5-week 
trial. Sleep disturbance was measured by asking the subjects 
to indicate the number of times they woke in previous nights 
due to symptoms on a four category scale where 1 = none, 
2 = once, 3 = twice, 4 = more than twice. The scores for this 
‘‘Sleep Disturbance NRS’’ were obtained at baseline and 
weekly thereafter until the end of trial. Statistical comparisons 
were performed in the same way as the primary outcome mea- 
sure. The PGIC was compared between treatments using Fish- 
er’s Exact Test. 

A total of 141 patients were assessed for eligibility, 16 
(11%) of whom failed to meet the eligibility criteria. 
Sixty-three subjects were randomised to sativex and 62 
to placebo (Fig. 1). At all participating centres, the ran- 
domisation led to a complete balance between treatment 
allocations. Baseline demographic details for both groups 
are shown in Table 2. The treatment groups were well 
matched for age, duration of neuropathic pain, distribu- 
tion of diagnostic pain subgroups, height, weight and 
for history of previous cannabis use. The diagnosis was 
based on existing clinical, imaging and neurophysiological

4 other 
eral neuropathics were similar across the two groups 
(Table 2). The background use of concomitant analgesic 
medication was high in both groups. The most frequently 
reported medication was opioids, being taken by 74% of 
the placebo group and 63% of the sativex group. Other fre- 
quently used background medications were tricyclic anti- 
depressants, antiepileptic drugs, and NSAIDs (Table 2). 
Thirteen sativex patients (21%) failed to complete the 
study; 11 withdrew because of side eﬀects, 1 due to 
patient non-compliance and one due to lack of eﬃcacy. 
Seven patients (11%) on placebo failed to complete the 
study, 2 because of adverse eﬀects and 5 because of lack 
of eﬀect. All randomised patients were included in the 
ITT analysis. For the per-protocol (PP) analysis, there 
were 47 patients on sativex and 56 on placebo. Protocol 
violations were due to failure to meet the stringent time 
window set for the ﬁnal visits (12 patients on sativex, 2 
on placebo), use of prohibited medication (6 on sativex, 
two of whom also failed to meet the ﬁnal visit time win- 
dow, and 2 on placebo) or violation of inclusion/exclu- 
sion criteria (0 on sativex, 2 on placebo). One patient in 
each group had their data censored because of use of 
prohibited medication after Day 26. 

At baseline, the mean intensity of reported pain 
scores (SD) on NRS was in the severe range with no dif- 
ference between the sativex and placebo groups 7.3 (1.4) 
and 7.2 (1.5), respectively (Table 2). At the end of treat- 
ment, the sativex group demonstrated an adjusted mean 
change in NRS score of (cid:2)1.48 points (a 22% reduction) 
while the change for the placebo group was (cid:2)0.52 points 
(an 8% reduction) (Fig. 2). The estimated treatment

(mean (SD) diﬀerence between the contralateral site 
and allodynic site: 127 (78) g). The severity of the allo- 
dynia within the aﬀected area was comparable between 
both sativex and placebo groups for pressure needed 
to elicit pain (68.8 (47.7) g vs. 83.0 (77.4) g) and for 
the level of pain generated by the stimulus itself (7.3 
(1.7) vs. 7.4 (2.1)). At the end of study, there was no evi- 
dence of a change in the punctate pain threshold at the 
irrespective of whether the 
contralateral control site, 
patients were on sativex or placebo (treatment diﬀerence 
11.1 g in favour of placebo; p = 0.3). At the allodynic 
site, the placebo group reported unchanged punctate 
pain pressure thresholds at end of study (83.0 (77.4) g 
vs. 85.8 (68.9) g) with no change in pain levels (7.4 
(2.1) and 7.2 (2.2)). In the sativex group, the threshold 
levels increased from 68.8 (47.7) g to 86.2 (73.2) g but 
signiﬁcantly compared to the placebo group 
not 
(p = 0.14). Despite this increase of applied punctate 
pressure there was a notable decrease in the allodynia 
pain scores (baseline: 7.3 (1.7) vs. end of treatment: 6.2 
(2.6)). The estimated treatment diﬀerence of (cid:2)0.87 was 
in favour of sativex (p = 0.021; 95% CI: (cid:2)1.62, (cid:2)0.13), 
giving an NNT (30%) of 5.9 and NNT (50%) of 13.4. 
Inspection of punctate allodynia data revealed that in 
some cases the pressure applied with the algometer to 
the allodynic site had changed considerably between 
diﬀerence of (cid:2)0.96 points was statistically signiﬁcant in 
favour of sativex (p = 0.004; 95% CI: (cid:2)1.59, (cid:2)0.32). 
The improvement in pain over placebo was evident from 
the second week after self-titration and was maintained 
until the end of the study (Fig. 2). On sativex, 26% of 
patients had at least a 30% reduction in pain score and 
20% of patients had at least a 50% reduction in pain 
score, compared with 15% and 8% of patients on pla- 
cebo; the NNT (50%) and NNT (30%) calculated from 
these ﬁgures were 8.5 and 8.6, respectively. Analysis of 
the PP population also showed a signiﬁcant treatment 
diﬀerence of (cid:2)1.42 points 
sativex 
(p < 0.001; 95% CI: (cid:2)2.10, (cid:2)0.74). 


All questionnaire-based measures of pain and pain- 
related co-morbidity improved signiﬁcantly more in 
patients randomised to sativex than placebo (Table 3). 
NPS composite score in the sativex group decreased signif- 
icantly more than in the placebo group. Sleep disturbance 
also decreased early on and improvement was maintained 
until the end of the study (Fig. 3). Of the seven functional 
areas assessed in the PDI, only sexual activity failed to 
show a substantial improvement on sativex (Table 3). 


All patients recruited into the study showed dynamic 
allodynia. There was no diﬀerence in detected mean 
(SD) allodynia pain scores between the two groups at 
baseline (5.4 (2.7) vs. 5.0 (3.4)). At the end of treatment, 
the mean reduction of dynamic allodynia was 20% in the 
sativex group, and 5% in the placebo group, with an esti- 
mated mean treatment diﬀerence of (cid:2)0.82 (p = 0.042; 
95% CI: (cid:2)1.6, (cid:2)0.03)) in favour of sativex. NNT for 
30% reduction in the allodynia score was 9.2 and for 
50% reduction 7.5. 

At baseline, all randomised patients except one on 
sativex showed punctate allodynia with clearly reduced 
thresholds in the aﬀected area vs. contralateral control

analysis was carried out in patients in whom the investi-

vex group than the placebo group leading to a 
treatment diﬀerence of (cid:2)0.94 (p = 0.046; 95% CI: 
(cid:2)1.85, (cid:2)0.02) in line with the ITT analysis. 
When all subjects were analysed together, there was a 
strong correlation between the intensity of punctate 
allodynia, dynamic allodynia and spontaneous pain at 
baseline and end of study, with similar strong correla- 
tions between the three parameters for change in scores 
(punctate allodynia vs. dynamic allodynia, r = 0.526, 
p < 0.001; punctate allodynia vs. pain r = 0.369; 
p < 0.001; dynamic allodynia vs. pain, 
r = 0.436, 
p < 0.001). Inspection of sativex and placebo groups 
separately showed that similar signiﬁcant correlations 
were present, except for change in dynamic allodynia 
in the placebo group (r = 0.065, p = 0.61). 
Results of the secondary eﬃcacy end-points are sum- 
marised in Table 3. Thirty-two (51.6%) patients taking 
sativex compared to 12 (19.3%) taking placebo consid- 
ered their primary condition to be very much, much or 
minimally improved (p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact 
test). 
The odds ratio for achieving a better response on sativex 
than placebo, calculated from a logistic regression of the 
data, was 3.55 (95% CI: (cid:2)7.61, (cid:2)1.72) in favour of sat- 
ivex. There was no diﬀerence between groups in the 
GHQ-12 score. 

The mean (SD) number of sprays taken during the 
ﬁrst week of dose titration for sativex and placebo was 
7.3 (3.5) and 10.9 (3.9), respectively. From the second 
week onwards, the dose frequency remained stable in 
both treatment groups, with no tendency to increasing 
dose over the duration of the study. The number of 
sprays used daily in the placebo group was higher than 
in the sativex group (Table 4). Over the study period, 
patients randomised to sativex used a mean (SD) of 
10.9 (6.8) sprays daily compared with 19.0 (8.3) by 
patients on placebo. 

Fifty-seven (91%) patients in the sativex group expe- 
rienced at least one adverse event (AE) during the course 
of the study compared with 48 (77%) patients in the pla- 
cebo group. The most frequent AEs were central ner- 
vous system related or gastrointestinal. Most were 
observed at onset of treatment, and in the majority 
described as mild. However, 6 (10%) patients on sativex 
reported several gastrointestinal AEs (nausea, vomiting 
diarrhoea, constipation) with none on placebo reporting 
the same. Severe symptoms suggesting involvement of 
the nervous system were reported with sativex in 7 
(11%) and placebo 5 (8%) cases. All reported gastroin- 
testinal AEs combined irrespective of their severity were 
more common in the sativex group (31/63 (49%) than in 
the placebo group (20/62 (32%), p = 0.003, Fisher’s 
exact test), whereas the nervous system AEs (33/63 vs. 
23/62, p > 0.10) were not. One case of severe psychiatric 
AE was recorded on both groups (with sativex, emo- 
tional stress associated with paranoid thinking and with 
placebo, confusion) and 6 further mild-to-moderate 
ones in the sativex group as opposed to 3 in the placebo 
group; these were mainly mood related. AEs seen in 3 or 
more subjects are shown in Table 5 for all AEs and for 
those considered possibly related to treatment. 
In the sativex group, 11 (18%) patients withdrew due 
to an AE compared with 2 (3%) in the placebo group. 
There was one transient ischaemic attack in the sativex 
group rated as a serious adverse event (SAE) and

considered unrelated to study treatment. Oral discom- 
fort, other than dryness of mouth, occurred in 8 (13%) 
patients taking sativex and 11 (18%) taking placebo 
and was usually reported as mild. One patient on sativex 
had transient mucosal ulcerations but leukoplakia was 
not observed. No signiﬁcant haematological or bio- 
chemical abnormalities were encountered in laboratory 
parameters. 
The Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological 
Tests (BRB-N) was given to 85 patients (43 randomised 
to sativex and 42 to placebo). No diﬀerence was seen 
between groups assessed for cognitive function with this 
method at the beginning and end of treatment (Table 6). 
Intoxication scores (SD) remained low throughout 
the study, peaking after the self-titration week at 8.0 
(15.4) for sativex and 3.0 (7.9) for placebo on a 0–100 
scale, respectively. Five patients on sativex and 2 
patients on placebo scored more than 40/100 during 
the maintenance period. 

At the end of their 5-week trial period, each patient 
was oﬀered the chance to enter an open-label extension 
study. Of the 125 subjects eligible, a total 89 (71%) of the 
patients accepted the oﬀer. They subsequently under- 
went re-titration of sativex from zero, in a way identical 
to that used in the randomisation phase. Patients were 
reviewed initially at 4 weeks thereafter every 8 weeks. 
The duration of participation in the extension trial 
ranged from 1 to 871 days. By study closure, 56 (63%) 
patients had been withdrawn; 18 patients due to adverse 
eﬀects, 16 due to lack of eﬃcacy, 15 due to withdrawal of 
consent, 7 for other reasons. The mean (SD) duration of 
the participation of withdrawn patients was 135 (147) 
days. An LOCF analysis involving 76 patients carried 
out at 52 weeks demonstrated a mean decrease of pain 
NRS from the baseline of 7.3 (1.4) to 5.9 (2.4), i.e., similar 
to that seen in the randomised trial. The daily number of 
sprays did not increase appreciably during this period (N 
(SD) 10.2 (6.0) at the end of the re-titration vs. 12.2 (7.6) 
at 52 weeks). Two episodes of serious adverse eﬀects were 
reported (urticaria with eyelid oedema and an event of 
somnolence, dysarthria and weakness) both leading to 
withdrawal of the patient in question from the study. 

This study demonstrates that sativex is eﬀective in the 
relief of peripheral neuropathic pain when given in addi- 
tion to existing medication. Greater than 30% improve- 
ment in pain intensity, generally considered as clinically 
meaningful [9], was reported by 26% of subjects receiv- 
ing sativex, compared with 15% of patients taking

placebo. At recruitment, all our patients were either 
non-responders to several conventional neuropathic 
analgesics, or were in severe pain despite taking appro- 
priate therapy. Considering the refractory nature of 
their pain, and that patients remained on their existing 
analgesia, the improvement of the ongoing pain in those 
on the active drug is encouraging. Further evidence for 
the eﬃcacy of sativex comes from improvement in 
mechanical dynamic and punctate allodynia pain, sleep 
and disability demonstrated in this study. Reduction in 
systematically measured mechanical allodynia is not 
commonly reported in controlled trials on neuropathic 
pain [17] and usually only seen in single dose studies 
or following other than oral administration, and failure 
is common. [3,21,23,29,34–36]. Because to date there are 
no reliable data converting reduction in allodynia scores 
to clinically meaningful improvement, the NNT values 
presented should be interpreted with caution. 
In comparison with pain relief reported from other 
cannabis-related clinical trials, sativex in our group of 
patients demonstrated a greater diﬀerence over placebo 
(0.96, 95% CI (cid:2)1.59, (cid:2)0.32) than in patients with plexus 
avulsion (treatment diﬀerence (cid:2)0.58, 95% CI (cid:2)0.98, 
(cid:2)0.18) but somewhat less than in patients with central 
pain due to MS ((cid:2)1.25; 95% CI (cid:2)2.11, 0.39) [6,26]. 
The treatment diﬀerence reported for dronabinol 
in 
MS patients deprived of concomitant analgesic medica- 
tion was 0.6 (95% CI (cid:2)1.8, 0) while that for smoked can- 
nabis in painful HIV neuropathy was approximately the 
same as in the present study (as extrapolated from the 
reported median 18% treatment diﬀerence in pain relief 
from mean baseline scores of 53 and 54/100) [1,30]. Dif- 
ferences in patient populations, numbers of withdraw- 
als, concomitant medications, trial designs and trial 
durations probably explain a great deal of these varying 
results. Interestingly, the two other cannabinoid trials in 
which evoked pain was assessed, albeit in a limited fash- 
ion, also report some beneﬁt in line with the present 
study [1,30]. 
Our reason for maintaining existing analgesia was 
based on both ethical and clinical considerations. A 
number of 
treatments that have shown eﬃcacy in 
peripheral neuropathic pain are in widespread use in 
accordance with existing guidelines [2]. Depriving a 
patient from such therapies during a placebo-controlled 
trial could not be ethically justiﬁed. Clinical practice is 
also moving toward combination therapies due to the 
realisation that in chronic neuropathic pain multiple 
mechanisms are the norm [12,39]. 
The lack of GHQ-12 to show any change during the 
present study is in line with virtually all other cannab- 
inoid trials in which the psychosocial domain was 
explored, irrespective of the measure used (GHQ-30, 
[40]; GHQ-28, [33]; SF-36, [30]; GHQ-12, [6]; HADS, 
[26]; POMS, [1]). GHQ-12 is a well-validated measure 
of anxiety, depression and social dysfunction [37] and 
shows adequate sensitivity to change in longitudinal 
studies in manifest depression [11]. The role of the 
endocannabinoid system in the regulation of anxiety 
and mood disorders still remains unclear, and both 
CB1 agonists and antagonists have been shown to pos- 
sess either anxiolytic or anxiogenic eﬀects as well as 
variable eﬀects on mood [38]. It 
is possible that 
GHQ-12 cannot detect modest changes in a population 
such as ours scoring just above the mean of the general 
population [24]. Alternatively, the above paradoxical 
eﬀects of THC, or the ability of CBD to block some 
of the psychomimetic eﬀects of THC, may explain 
the lack of change in this measure. 
The self-titration schedule used in this study was cho- 
sen for several reasons. Previous studies [6,26] indicated 
that individual subjects have a variable threshold to the 
known pharmacodynamic eﬀects of sativex. A self-titra- 
tion regimen permitted individual patients to optimise 
their dose on the basis of their own eﬃcacy and tolera- 
bility response. Both experimental and human volunteer 
studies suggest that tolerance to some of the side eﬀects 
of cannabis occurs within days of its repeated adminis- 
tration [14,18,22]. A self-titration regimen allows for this 
to occur, further optimising the therapeutic response. 
There appears to be substantial between-patient vari- 
ability in the pharmacokinetics of THC and other can- 
the 
nabinoids 
implementation of a ﬁxed-dose regimen is likely to yield 
suboptimal results. 

The mean number of sprays taken daily by the sativex 
group remained stable during the course of the study 
despite patients having the freedom to determine their 
own dosing, indicating that tolerance did not develop at 
least over the 4-week stable treatment period of this study. 
The dose titration regimen used was usually successful in 
providing the optimal therapeutic level for individual 
patients. This conclusion is endorsed by the observation 
that those patients who took part in the open-label exten- 
sion study did not increase the number of daily sprays 
during the ﬁrst 52 weeks of open-label treatment while 
apparently maintaining the initial analgesic eﬀect. 
While the therapeutic eﬀects of cannabis have often 
been attributed to THC, the second major constituent 
of the trial medication, CBD has been shown to have 
eﬀects which may be additive to those of THC in pain 
relief in animal models, and also to have the potential 
to ameliorate some of the psychoactive eﬀects of THC 
[27]. This interaction between the two components 
may permit subjects to tolerate mean daily doses of 
more than 27 mg THC. This dose is in excess of those 
used in other controlled studies of THC, and may 
account for the observed eﬃcacy [14]. 
The adverse events reported by the patients were 
mostly gastrointestinal, central nervous system related 
or topical. While reported gastrointestinal AEs were 
more common in the sativex group, central nervous sys- 


tem AEs were not; and, importantly, objective measure- 
ment of psychomotor performance did not vary across 
the two groups. In general, the number of patients who 
withdrew is similar to those reported in well-known large 
trials of other drugs used in neuropathic pain [4,25]. That 
PCIG scores favoured sativex over placebo suggests that 
subjective pain relief, reduced disability and improved 
sleep overrode the negative impact of AEs. 

There was no formal assessment of whether unblin- 
ding might have taken place. The psychotrophic eﬀects 
of cannabis are well known to the public, and 20% of 
the participants in the present trial had previous expo- 
sure to cannabis. A post-hoc analysis found that previ- 
ous use of cannabis was not predictive of the change 
in mean pain scores. Classical psychotrophic eﬀects of 
cannabis were reported by relatively few patients. The 
intoxication scores were marginally higher in the sativex 
remained 
group, and psychometric tests 
unchanged during the trial. It is therefore unlikely that 
a signiﬁcant number of those on sativex would have cor- 
rectly guessed they were on active medication unless 
they deliberately overdosed. From returned trial medica- 
tion it was concluded that such practice did not take place. 
Patients taking placebo may have concluded that they 
were taking inactive substance, given that they used a rel- 
atively high number of sprays. However, the majority of 
patients took less than the highest allowable dosage. Also, 
only 5 (8%) of the placebo group withdrew for lack of eﬃ- 
cacy, suggesting that no signiﬁcant unblinding took place. 
We conclude that the results from this study indicate 
that sativex has a positive broad spectrum therapeutic 
eﬀect in neuropathic pain, when used in addition to exist- 
ing analgesic medication. The emergence of a highly stan- 
dardised, uniform preparation of THC:CBD should allow 
for further studies which better deﬁne the role for cannab- 
inoids in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes.
