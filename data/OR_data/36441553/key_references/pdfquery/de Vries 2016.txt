Continuous data are expressed as mean (SD) and categorical data as numbers (n). Weak opioids were defined 
as codeine and tramadol. Strong opioids were defined as opioid-based therapies such as oxycontin, fentanyl and 
morphine. Abbreviations: PCM=paracetamol, NSAID= non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
