Abstract: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the 
beneﬁt of nabilone in pain management and quality of life improvement in 40 patients with 
ﬁbromyalgia. After a baseline assessment, subjects were titrated up on nabilone, from 0.5 mg PO at 
bedtime to 1 mg BID over 4 weeks or received a corresponding placebo. At the 2- and 4-week visits, 
the primary outcome measure, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and the secondary outcome 
measures, number of tender points, the average tender point pain threshold, and the Fibromyalgia 
Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), were evaluated. After a 4-week washout period, subjects returned for 
reassessment of the outcome measures. There were no signiﬁcant differences in population demo- 
graphics between groups at baseline. There were signiﬁcant decreases in the VAS ((cid:1)2.04, P < .02), FIQ 
((cid:1)12.07, P < .02), and anxiety ((cid:1)1.67, P < .02) in the nabilone treated group at 4 weeks. There were 
no signiﬁcant improvements in the placebo group. The treatment group experienced more side 
effects per person at 2 and 4 weeks (1.58, P < .02 and 1.54, P < .05), respectively. Nabilone appears 
to be a beneﬁcial, well-tolerated treatment option for ﬁbromyalgia patients, with signiﬁcant beneﬁts 
in pain relief and functional improvement. 
Perspective: To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst randomized, controlled trial to assess the beneﬁt of 
nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, on pain reduction and quality of life improvement in patients with 
ﬁbromyalgia. As nabilone improved symptoms and was well-tolerated, it may be a useful adjunct for 
pain management in ﬁbromyalgia.

differentiation of ﬁbromyalgia from other chronic mus- 
culoskeletal pain with a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of al- 
most 85%.16 
Patients with ﬁbromyalgia have lower pain thresholds 
to both mechanical and thermal insults, give higher pain 
ratings, and experience an altered temporal summation 
to painful stimuli.16 The sensitization of pain perception 
that is present in these patients can occur both peripher- 
ally and centrally after tissue damage but may also be 
present in patients with no obvious tissue damage.20 
Sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of patients with 
ﬁbromyalgia, as activity of both unmyelinated C ﬁbers 
and A-(cid:1) ﬁbers is increased14,21; however, it is unknown 
whether sensitization is due to increased pain ﬁber facil- 
itation, or decreased inhibition.20 
Given the lack of understanding in the pathophysiol- 
ogy of ﬁbromyalgia, it is not surprising that until re- 
cently, with the approval of pregabalin, no medical treat- 
ment had been speciﬁcally approved by the United States 
Food and Drug Administration for its management.13 
There is also evidence that tricyclic antidepressants, cardio- 
vascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy and patient 

education are effective in reducing the pain experienced 
by ﬁbromyalgia patients.16 A recent case series of 4 pa- 
tients has suggested the possible beneﬁt of nabilone, a 
synthetic cannabinoid, in the treatment of ﬁbromyalgia, 
however more studies are required.18 
Two types of cannabinoid receptors have been isolated: 
CB1 and CB2. The CB1 receptor is found predominantly 
in the central and peripheral nervous system,25 whereas 
CB2 receptors are found principally in the immune sys- 
tem.27 Endogenous cannabinoids have been isolated 
that interact with these receptors.10 CB1 agonists have 
been shown to have an analgesic effect in acute and 
chronic pain models.10 The CB1 agonists act at many sites 
along pain transmission pathways including activation of 
peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal CB1 receptors, each 
independently decreasing nociception.10 
The endocannabinoid system shares several similarities 
with the opioid system.9 CB1 and opioid receptors are 
both found in similar areas of the nervous system in- 
volved in pain control, including the periaqueductal gray 
matter, rostral ventromedial medulla, and the spinal 
cord.29 Besides the similarities with the opioid system, 
cannabinoids have also been shown to inhibit prosta- 
glandin E-2 synthesis,8 reduce platelet aggregation,31 
and have an anti-inﬂammatory effect twice as great as 
hydrocortisone and 20 times that of aspirin.12 
Nabilone is 1 of 2 orally administered cannabinoids 
available in Canada and is currently approved for the 
management of nausea and vomiting during chemo- 
therapy. Research into oral cannabinoid use in the man- 
agement of chronic and neuropathic pain has been en- 
couraging.18,32 As no treatment has been speciﬁcally 
approved for management of ﬁbromyalgia, further re- 
search into treatment strategies is important. To date, no 
randomized, controlled trials have been conducted to 
assess the efﬁcacy of a synthetic cannabinoid on pain and 
quality of life in patients with ﬁbromyalgia. 
Our hypothesis was that nabilone will signiﬁcantly re- 
duce the pain and improve quality of life in ﬁbromyalgia 
patients compared with placebo, as evidenced by signif- 
icant improvements in visual analog scale pain scores 
(VAS), number of tender points, average tender point 
pain threshold, and scores on the Fibromyalgia Impact 
Questionnaire (FIQ). 


The study was conducted in the Outpatient Musculo- 
skeletal Clinic at the Rehabilitation Hospital, Health Sci- 
ences Centre (HSC), Department of Physical Medicine 
and Rehabilitation, 
in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, 
from April 2006 to November 2006. Patients were re- 
cruited from the musculoskeletal practices of attending 
Physiatrists and Rheumatologists at the Rehabilitation 
Hospital. 

Inclusion criteria for the study included the subject 
meeting The American College of Rheumatology (1990) 

criteria for the classiﬁcation of ﬁbromyalgia38; patients 
between 18 and 70 years of age; having continued pain 
despite the use of other oral medications; and no previ- 
ous use of oral cannabinoids for pain management. 

Subjects were excluded from participating in the study 
if their pain was better explained by a diagnosis other 
than ﬁbromyalgia; for abnormalities on routine baseline 
blood work including electrolytes, urea and creatinine, a 
complete blood count, and liver function tests; heart dis- 
ease; schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder; severe 
liver dysfunction; history of untreated nonpsychotic 
emotional disorders; cognitive impairment; major illness 
in another organ system; pregnancy; nursing mothers; a 
history of drug dependency; or a known sensitivity to 
marijuana or other cannabinoid agents. 

Subjects met the eligibility criteria through a struc- 
tured interview process, and participants provided in- 
formed consent. HSC Research ethics board, HSC Impact 
Committee and Health Canada approval was obtained 
prior to proceeding with the study. 
Subjects were randomly assigned by the HSC pharmacy 
into treatment and control groups, each consisting of 20 
participants (Fig 1). The examining physicians and the 
subjects were blinded to the randomization process. All 
of the study medication was provided by Valeant Canada 
Limited (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and was identical to 
placebo. Subjects in both groups were seen at baseline, 
after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of treatment and after a 
4-week washout period. Subjects in the treatment group 
received 0.5 mg nabilone PO at bedtime for a 1-week 
period, with instructions to increase to 0.5 mg BID after 7 
days. At the 2-week visit, subjects were evaluated for the 
presence of side effects and drug tolerance, and if they 
consented to continue, had the prescription increased to 
nabilone 0.5 mg PO in the morning and 1 mg PO at 
bedtime, with instructions to increase to 1 mg BID after 7 
days. Subjects in the control group received a corre- 
sponding placebo. Subjects were assessed for the safety 
and efﬁcacy of their prescription based on the outcome 
measures at the 2-, 4-, and 8-week follow-up visits. Sub- 
jects were asked to continue any current treatment for 
ﬁbromyalgia, including breakthrough pain medications, 
but not to begin any new therapies. 

The primary outcome measure was a 10 cm VAS for 
pain. The secondary outcome measures included the 
number of positive tender points; the average tender 
point pain threshold; and the subject’s score on the FIQ. 
At each visit, subjects were asked to rate their current 
level of pain on the 10 cm VAS, (0 (cid:2) no pain; 10 (cid:2) worst 
pain imaginable), a valid and reliable scale for rating 
pain intensity.26 Subjects then ﬁlled out the FIQ, which is 
a validated, self-administered test, scored out of 100, 
that evaluates physical function, work status, depression, 



anxiety, sleep, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well-being in 
patients with ﬁbromyalgia.7,23 The higher the score on 
the FIQ, the greater the impact of ﬁbromyalgia on the 
subject’s quality of life.7 Subjects were then assessed for 
the number of positive tender points by digital palpation 
over the 18 characteristic tender point sites in the ACR 
criteria for the diagnosis of ﬁbromyalgia,38 which has 
been previously shown to have both good intrarater and 
interrater reliability.33 The subjects were asked to iden- 
tify if a given point was painful as slow steady digital 
pressure was applied. The same evaluation of the tender 
points was then repeated with a hand-held Fischer al- 
gometer. This test has also demonstrated good interra- 
ter and test-retest reliability.33 Pressure was applied over 
each tender point at a rate of 1 kilogram per square 
centimeter per second, and subjects were asked to iden- 
tify the moment the pressure became painful. The pain 
threshold at each of the 18 tender points was recorded 
and an average tender point pain threshold for each visit 
was calculated. During each visit, any reported side ef- 
fects as well as weight, blood pressure, and heart rate 
were recorded. 


investigating 
nabilone use in ﬁbromyalgia,18 we calculated that 16 
patients would be necessary in each group to detect a 
change of 2 cm on the 10 cm VAS, using an (cid:3) of (cid:4)0.05 
and a power of 80%. Allowing for dropouts, our aim was 
to have 20 subjects in each group start the study. Statis- 
tical analysis was conducted, and we considered P (cid:4) .05 
to be statistically signiﬁcant for all of our outcome mea- 
sures. The mean and standard deviation was calculated 
for each outcome measure at each visit and a Student’s 
t test was performed to compare the change in the mean 
from baseline within and between groups. 

Forty-four subjects were screened to participate in the 
study between April and November of 2006. Four sub- 
jects did not meet the entrance requirements for the 
study. Reasons for their exclusion included a history of 
multiple medical problems (n (cid:2) 1); subjects did not like 
the stigma associated with the use of cannabinoids (n (cid:2) 
2); and previous oral cannabinoid use (n (cid:2) 1). 
The remaining 40 subjects were randomly assigned by 
the HSC pharmacy into either the nabilone or placebo 
group (Fig 1). The examining physicians and patients 
were blinded to the randomization process. The baseline 
demographic data and baseline outcome measures are 
presented for both groups (Table 1). No signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences in baseline demographic data or primary and 
secondary outcome measures were present. The percent- 
age of subjects employed and the use of opioid medica- 
tions for pain were not signiﬁcantly different between 
the 2 groups.

from the placebo group dropped out of the study before 
its completion. All of the subjects who withdrew from 
the study did so at or before the ﬁrst follow-up visit. In 
the control group, one subject discontinued the medica- 
tion after 4 days because of headaches; the other with- 
drew at the ﬁrst follow-up visit, after 2 weeks, although 
no side effects or reason for dropping out was stated. Of 
the subjects in the treatment group, 3 withdrew before 
the ﬁrst follow-up visit. Two of these subjects did not 
state a reason for withdrawal and listed no side effects, 
whereas the other subject experienced dizziness, disori- 
entation, and nausea. The remaining 2 subjects in the 
treatment group to withdraw did so at the ﬁrst fol- 
low-up visit, after 2 weeks. One subject stated poor co- 
ordination, dizziness, headache, and nausea as the rea- 
sons for withdrawing from the study, whereas the other 
experienced drowsiness and fatigue. All patients in the 
treatment group that continued with the study achieved 
a nabilone dose of 1 mg BID. 
There was a signiﬁcant increase in the weight of sub- 
jects treated with nabilone for 2 weeks, (1.13 kg, P (cid:4) .01). 
This effect, however, was transient, as there was no sig- 
niﬁcant difference in weight change observed between 
the 2 groups during the 4-week and 8-week visits. 
When compared with baseline, at the 2-, 4-, and 
8-week visits, no statistically signiﬁcant differences were 
observed in any of the outcome measures in the placebo 
group. 
There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences from 
baseline in the outcome measures in the nabilone 
treated subjects, at a dose of 0.5 mg BID, after 2 weeks of 
treatment. However, at the 4-week follow-up visit, at a 
nabilone dose of 1 mg BID, statistically signiﬁcant im- 
provements were seen in the VAS, FIQ, and FIQ anxiety 
scale. The VAS scores for pain decreased from baseline at 
4 weeks ((cid:5)2.04, P (cid:4) .02) (Fig 2). Fibromyalgia Impact 
Questionnaire scores also signiﬁcantly decreased ((cid:5)12.07, 
P (cid:4) .02) (Fig 3). The 10-point anxiety scale within the FIQ 
was the ﬁnal outcome to be statistically improved from 
baseline after 4 weeks of treatment ((cid:5)1.67, P (cid:4) .02) (Fig 4). 
The remaining outcomes we assessed including num- 
ber of tender points, tender point pain threshold, and

the depression and fatigue scales on the FIQ were not 
signiﬁcantly different from baseline values. 
Comparing the treatment and placebo groups at 2 
weeks of treatment, no signiﬁcant differences were seen 
in VAS, number of tender points, tender point pain 
threshold, or FIQ. Of the 3 separately analyzed questions 
in the FIQ concerning anxiety, depression, and fatigue, 
only anxiety was signiﬁcantly less at the 2-week visit in 
the nabilone group. The score on the 10-point scale for 
anxiety decreased in the treatment group at a nabilone 
dose of 0.5 mg BID ((cid:5)1.92, P (cid:4) .025). 
At the 4-week visit, statistically signiﬁcant differences 
between the treatment and placebo groups were also 
present. The change from baseline in visual analogue 
scale pain scores ((cid:5)1.43, P (cid:4) .05) (Fig 5), FIQ scores 
((cid:5)10.76, P (cid:4) .01) (Fig 6), and the FIQ anxiety scale ((cid:5)2.20, 
P (cid:4) .01) (Fig 7) all showed signiﬁcant improvement when 
compared with the placebo group. 
No signiﬁcant differences were seen between the 
treatment and placebo groups after the 4-week washout 
period at the 8-week visit. 
Side effects were more common in the nabilone- 
treated subjects compared with placebo controls at both 
2 and 4 weeks of treatment, (1.58, P (cid:4) .02 and 1.54, P (cid:4) 
.05), respectively. The frequency of the most common 
side effects for both groups is listed in Table 2. The most 
common side effects reported by subjects in the nabilone 
group include drowsiness (7/15), dry mouth (5/15), ver- 
tigo (4/15), and ataxia (3/15). No serious adverse events 
occurred during the study. 

Our study was conducted to investigate the possible 
beneﬁts of the synthetic cannabinoid nabilone on pain 
reduction and quality of life improvement in patients

with ﬁbromyalgia. Signiﬁcant reductions in VAS score for 
pain, FIQ score, and FIQ anxiety score were seen in the 
treatment group at the 4-week visit. These signiﬁcant 
reductions are found both when comparing the treat- 
ment group with their baseline values and when com- 
paring the change from baseline to the placebo group at 
4 weeks. None of the study participants achieved a total 
remission of their ﬁbromyalgia symptoms. 
Although improvements in VAS and FIQ scores were 
present after 4 weeks of treatment, there was no signif- 
icant change in the number of tender points or tender 
point pain threshold, which is supported by other stud- 
ies.2,23 
Subjects in the placebo group did not obtain any sig- 
niﬁcant beneﬁt in the outcome measures at any time 
during the study. After a 4-week washout period, out-

come measures were not signiﬁcantly different from 
baseline in both groups. Nabilone does not appear to 
have any lasting beneﬁt in subjects when treatment is 
discontinued. 
Comparing the baseline FIQ scores in our study to some 
recent studies that used the FIQ, our subjects scored on 
average 12 to 22 points higher,2,5,30 indicating their 
quality of life was more severely affected by ﬁbromyal- 
gia.23 As our recruitment practices were similar, the rea- 
son for the disparity in the baseline FIQ scores and its 
effect on our results is unclear. 
The signiﬁcant drop in the VAS ((cid:5)2.04, P (cid:4) .02) in our 
treatment group was similar to those of other drug trials, 
which ranged from 1.2 to 2.2.2,5,17 Our ﬁnding of a sig- 
niﬁcant drop in the FIQ score ((cid:5)12.07, P (cid:4) .02) was also 
similar to other drug trials whose drop in FIQ score 
ranged from 5.53 to 15.8.2,3,5,17,30 Despite the poorer 
baseline quality of life of our subjects, they still managed 
a signiﬁcant improvement in FIQ scores on par with other 
studies. This suggests that nabilone is an effective treat- 
ment even for those with severe cases of ﬁbromyalgia 
with marked functional impairment. 
Although statistically signiﬁcant reductions in VAS 
score for pain, FIQ score, and FIQ anxiety score were 
observed in this study, the question remains whether 
these ﬁndings are clinically signiﬁcant? With the cur- 
rent lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of 
ﬁbromyalgia, and options in its medical manage- 
ment,13 the statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁts obtained 
in this study are promising and require consideration 
as an adjunct to the current medical management of 
ﬁbromyalgia.

ment of acute and chronic pain have already been estab-

lished,10 so their beneﬁt in ﬁbromyalgia patients is not 
surprising. Whether this beneﬁt is secondary to a clinical 
endocannabinoid deﬁciency in ﬁbromyalgia patients as 
has been suggested28 or the synergistic relationship with 
endogenous opioids,27 it is clear from previous studies 
that cannabinoids act at many sites along pain transmis- 
sion pathways. 
Other known actions of cannabinoids including inhibi- 
tion of prostaglandin E-2 synthesis,8 its anti-inﬂamma- 
tory effect,12 experimental increases in (cid:8)-endorphins,34 
and the regulation of substance P and enkephalin mRNA 
levels in the basal ganglia22 could all contribute to less 
pain experienced in the nabilone-treated patients. 
Anxiety on the FIQ was also decreased in the treatment 
group at the 4-week visit, which is not exclusive to our 
study. A trial assessing the effects of tramadol and acet- 
aminophen on patients with ﬁbromyalgia found similar 
improvements in VAS, FIQ, and anxiety, without signif- 
icant improvements in depression or fatigue.5 Al- 
though part of the beneﬁt obtained in pain reduction 
and quality-of-life improvement in these patients may 
be secondary to reduced anxiety, other studies have 
not shown a change in anxiety despite signiﬁcant func- 
tional improvements.30 Further studies with validated 
scales for anxiety need to be conducted to explore this 
issue. 
Nabilone was generally well tolerated by participants 
throughout the study. This is reassuring, as it is well 
known that patients with ﬁbromyalgia are sensitive to 
most medications and have difﬁculty tolerating medica- 
tion side effects.15 Although there were signiﬁcantly 
more side effects per person in the treatment group at 2 
and 4 weeks (1.58, P (cid:4) .02 and 1.54, P (cid:4) .05), respectively, 
no serious adverse effects were seen in the nabilone- 
treated subjects during the study. Three-quarters of the 
subjects in the treatment group tolerated the medica- 
tion well and completed the study. Those who withdrew 
from the study did so at or before the ﬁrst follow-up visit 
at 2 weeks. The reported side effects of nabilone were 
generally mild, and nabilone did not appear to have ad- 
verse interactions with any of the concomitant medica- 
tions patients were taking, including antidepressants, 
muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatories, 
and opioids. This supports the ﬁndings from the previ- 
ously conducted case series with nabilone and ﬁbro- 
myalgia patients.18 Slowing the titration of the medi- 
cation in longer studies may further reduce treatment 
side effects. 
When prescribing nabilone, cost must be taken into 
consideration. Participants using nabilone at the dose we 
found to be effective in the study should expect to pay 
over four thousand dollars for a year’s supply of the med- 
ication in Canada. Patients must weigh these costs 
against the potential beneﬁts of pain reduction and im- 
proved quality of life. As the medication’s cost may be 
prohibitive to some patients, nabilone probably would 
not be the ﬁrst line therapy prescribed to patients with 
ﬁbromyalgia but should be considered if other treat- 
ments have been ineffective. 

The current study is not without its limitations. Partic- 
ipants in both groups were allowed to continue any 
treatments for pain, with the use of nabilone as an ad- 
junctive therapy. Despite the beneﬁt in pain and anxiety 
reduction and quality of life improvement in the treat- 
ment group, it cannot be deﬁnitively concluded that the 
beneﬁt was not a result of the combination of therapies. 
We thought that allowing both groups to continue their 
ongoing pain therapies controlled for this variable, and 
as ﬁbromyalgia patients using complementary therapies 
ranges in studies from 60 to 90 percent,4 the use of 
nabilone as an adjunct is clinically relevant. Future stud- 
ies could be done using nabilone as a single agent to 
determine its effect on pain and quality of life alone. 
Given the ﬂuctuating nature of ﬁbromyalgia symp- 
toms,15 our study was limited by its short duration and 
limited number of visits. To control for the ﬂuctuating 
nature of ﬁbromyalgia symptoms a pain journal could be 
given to subjects; however, this requires more effort on 
their behalf and may lead to decreased adherence to the 
protocol. 
Subjects were only trialed on nabilone for a total of 4 
weeks, of which only the last week of treatment was at 1 
mg BID. The long-term effect of nabilone in alleviating 
pain and improving quality of life in patients with ﬁbro- 
myalgia cannot be determined based on the short dura- 
tion of the study. As this study was the ﬁrst randomized, 
controlled trial to assess the beneﬁts of nabilone in sub- 
jects with ﬁbromyalgia, it was reasonable to conduct this 
study for a shorter duration. Now that our study has 
shown signiﬁcant improvements for ﬁbromyalgia pa- 
tients, future studies should involve a longer duration of 
the treatment, at a stable dose. 
Although anxiety, depression, and fatigue were as- 
sessed in this study with single questions on the FIQ, 
these single questions are not validated scales for the 
respective symptoms. As the outcome measures in our 
study focused on pain and quality of life, the VAS for 
pain and FIQ were the scales used to assess them. Reports 
exist for19,24 and against1 the incidence of depression 
and anxiety being higher in the ﬁbromyalgia popula- 
tion, and this area is still up for debate. Chronic fatigue 
syndrome is associated with ﬁbromyalgia,6 and it has 
been reported that patients with ﬁbromyalgia have less 
restorative sleep.11 Future studies to evaluate the effect 
of nabilone on anxiety, depression, and fatigue in pa- 
tients with ﬁbromyalgia should use validated scales for 
each. 
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst randomized, con- 
trolled trial to demonstrate the beneﬁt of nabilone on 
pain and quality of life in subjects with ﬁbromyalgia. The 
signiﬁcant reductions in VAS, FIQ, and anxiety seen in the 
treatment group, coupled with minimal side effects, sug- 
gest that nabilone may be a beneﬁcial, well-tolerated, 
treatment option in patients with ﬁbromyalgia. Future 
studies are still necessary to assess the long-term beneﬁt 
of nabilone on pain and quality of life, and secondary 
outcome measures such as anxiety, depression, and 

fatigue should be further explored with validated assess- 
ment tools.
