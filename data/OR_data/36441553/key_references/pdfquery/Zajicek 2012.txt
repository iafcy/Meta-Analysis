ABSTRACT 
Objective Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with 
chronic symptoms, including muscle stiffness, spasms, 
pain and insomnia. Here we report the results of the 
Multiple Sclerosis and Extract of Cannabis (MUSEC) 
study that aimed to substantiate the patient based 
ﬁndings of previous studies. 
Patients and methods Patients with stable MS at 22 UK 
centres were randomised to oral cannabis extract (CE) 
(N¼144) or placebo (N¼135), stratiﬁed by centre, walking 
ability and use of antispastic medication. This double blind, 
placebo controlled, phase III study had a screening period, 
a 2 week dose titration phase from 5 mg to a maximum of 
25 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol daily and a 10 week 
maintenance phase. The primary outcome measure was 
a category rating scale (CRS) measuring patient reported 
change in muscle stiffness from baseline. Further CRSs 
assessed body pain, spasms and sleep quality. Three 
validated MS speciﬁc patient reported outcome measures 
assessed aspects of spasticity, physical and psychological 
impact, and walking ability. 
Results The rate of relief from muscle stiffness after 12 
weeks was almost twice as high with CE than with 
placebo (29.4% vs 15.7%; OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.24 to 4.13; 
p¼0.004, one sided). Similar results were found after 4 
weeks and 8 weeks, and also for all further CRSs. Results 
from the MS scales supported these ﬁndings. 
Conclusion The study met its primary objective to 
demonstrate the superiority of CE over placebo in the 
treatment of muscle stiffness in MS. This was supported 
by results for secondary efﬁcacy variables. Adverse events 
in participants treated with CE were consistent with the 
known side effects of cannabinoids. No new safety 
concerns were observed. 
Trial registration number NCT00552604. 
INTRODUCTION 
Of the many symptoms encountered in multiple 
sclerosis (MS), muscle stiffness as a result of 
increased pyramidal tone and spasms occurs in up 
to 90% of patients at some time.1 This often leads 
to considerable distress from pain, reduced mobility 
and interference with activities of daily living, 
including sleep quality. 

symptomatic therapy often provides 
inadequate relief and may be limited by toxicity. As 
a consequence, people with MS have experimented 
with many alternative therapies to ease their phys- 
including cannabis.2 3 It has been 
ical problems, 
estimated that between 1% and 4% of the total UK 
MS population is using cannabis for symptom relief.4 
Several phase III trials of cannabinoids in MS have 
been conducted in recent years, the largest of which 
was the Cannabinoids in Multiple Sclerosis (CAMS) 
study.5 This double blind, placebo controlled study 
evaluated the effect of cannabinoids on symptoms 
such as spasticity, pain and sleep quality. Although 
the analysis did not show signiﬁcant beneﬁt using 
the primary outcome measure, the Ashworth Scale, 
patients themselves rated cannabinoids as clearly 
helpful. In the 1 year blinded follow-up of the CAMS 
study, there was a small signiﬁcant treatment effect 
on muscle spasticity seen in the Ashworth score, 
with spasticity, spasms, pain and energy signiﬁcantly 
improved in patient subjective ratings.6 The limita- 
tions of the single item, semi-objective Ashworth 
Scale in measuring the highly complex phenomenon 
of spasticity are well known, and it is now not 
recommended for spasticity assessment.7 8 As well as 
difﬁculties with outcome measures, other problems 
encountered in evaluating the potential beneﬁt of 
cannabinoids for MS symptoms have included high 
placebo response rates and potential unmasking 
of treatment group, either due to side effects or 
improved symptoms. 


We therefore designed the present phase III clinical 
trial (MUltiple Sclerosis and Extract of Cannabis 
standardised oral 
(MUSEC)) 
cannabis extract (CE) for the symptomatic relief of 
muscle stiffness and pain in adult patients with 
stable MS and ongoing troublesome muscle stiffness. 
We used an 11 point numerical rating of change scale 
as a more patient orientated measure of efﬁcacy than 
the Ashworth Scale, as recommended by the Euro- 
pean Medicines Agency.9 As well as being used in 
this and previous studies,5 this type of scale is also 
being used as the standard outcome in other studies 
for licensing purposes.10 Additionally, we used newer 
patient reported outcome measures in order to 
investigate which aspects of MS were most likely to 
beneﬁt from CE use. 
METHODS 
Participants 
Patients aged 18e64 years with a diagnosis of MS 
according to the McDonald criteria,11 who had had 
stable disease for the previous 6 months and trou- 
blesome and ongoing muscle stiffness for at least 
3 months before enrolment (as shown by a current 
disability score of at least 4 on an 11 point category 
rating scale (CRS)), were enrolled. 
All physiotherapy regimens or medications likely 
to affect spasticity were adjusted, where necessary, 
before study entry and not altered in the 30 days 



 




before study start. Patients with active sources of infection or 
taking immunomodulatory drugs that might affect spasticity 
(eg, b-interferon, but not azathioprine) were excluded. Other 
exclusion criteria included ﬁxed tendon contractures, severe 
cognitive impairment, history of psychosis, major illness, preg- 
nancy and cannabis use in the 30 days before study start. 
The study was approved by the Scotland A Research Ethics 
Committee and is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT00552604). 
Randomisation and masking 
Participants were evenly allocated to CE or placebo by means of 
an interactive voice response system. Computer generated 
permuted block randomisation was used, stratiﬁed by centre, 
ambulatory status (able to walk or not) and concurrent use of 
antispasticity medication (yes or no). Active treatment was an 
extract from Cannabis sativa L (extraction medium ethanol 96%) 
in soft gelatine capsules, standardised on cannabidiol (range 
0.8e1.8 mg) and containing 2.5 mg D9- tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC) as the main cannabinoid (Cannador; Society for Clinical 
Research, Berlin, Germany). Matched placebo capsules contained 
the same partial glyceride vehicle (Imwitor 742; Hüls AG, Marl, 
Germany). The study coordinating team, all investigators and 
participants were blinded to treatment allocation throughout. 
Study conduct 
The study consisted of a pretreatment screening period of 
1e2 weeks, a 2 week dose titration phase and a 10 week mainte- 
nance phase. Total treatment duration was 12 weeks. Participants 
were assessed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the start of treatment. 
The starting dose was 2.5 mg D9THC (one capsule) twice 
daily. Subsequent doses were individually titrated upwards by 
5 mg D9THC/day every 3 days for up to 12 days to optimise the 
ratio between therapeutic effect and side effects, and to achieve 
a maximum daily dose. The maximum allowable total daily 
dose was 25 mg D9THC. Participants used diaries to record 
capsules taken daily. 
In the event of intolerable side effects, the daily dose was 
reduced by one capsule until the side effect(s) resolved. After 
resolution, one rechallenge with a further dose escalation was 
required. If the side effect(s) returned, the dose was reduced 
again, with no further rechallenge allowed. 
The primary outcome measure was an 11 point CRS to 
evaluate perceived change in muscle stiffness after 12 weeks 
of treatment compared with the premedication phase. At the 
ﬁnal visit, participants answered the following question on a 
symptom questionnaire: “Compared with before the study 
started, my muscle stiffness over the last week has been.” 
providing a rating on an 11 point numerical CRS where 0¼very 
much better, 5¼no difference and 10¼very much worse. Cate- 
gories 0e3 of the rating scale were classiﬁed as ‘relief of muscle 
stiffness’dthat is, as a clinically relevant response. 
Secondary outcome measures included further equivalent CRSs 
measuring perceived relief from body pain, muscle spasms and 
sleep disturbance compared with pretreatment (at 4, 8 and 12 
weeks). Absolute amount of muscle stiffness, body pain, muscle 
spasms and sleep disturbance (at screening, baseline and 4, 8 and 
12 weeks) was also asked for by similar 11 point rating scales 
stating “Over the last week, the (symptom) I have had is .” 
providing a rating in categories between ‘no (symptom)’ and 
‘extreme 
reported secondary 
outcome measures included validated disease speciﬁc multi-item 
rating scales measuring aspects of spasticity in MS (MS Spasticity 
Scale (MSSS-88)),12 the physical and psychological impact of MS 

(MS Impact Scale (MSIS-29))13 and walking ability (MS Walking 
Scale (MSWS-12))14 (at screening, baseline, 4 and 12 weeks). 
Investigators evaluated severity of disability (Expanded 
Disability Status Scale (EDSS))15 and all safety parameters at 
screening and at week 12. Safety was evaluated using laboratory 
parameters, vital signs and adverse events (AEs), in accordance 
with good clinical practice. 
Calculation of sample size 
In the CAMS study, 27% of placebo participants and 42% of CE 
participants showed relief from muscle stiffness, as deﬁned in 
the present study. Assuming a two sided test of hypothesis with 
a power of 80%, a 5% level of signiﬁcance and an active treat- 
ment to placebo ratio of 1:1, about 170 evaluable participants 
per group would be required to detect a signiﬁcant improvement 
in relief rate compared with placebo, according to the sample 
size approximation of Casagrande et al for Fisher’s exact test.16 
With an assumed dropout rate of 15%, it was planned to enrol 
a total of 400 patients. 
An unblinded adaptive interim analysis was planned by means 
of ADDPLAN software V.4 and performed at an a error level of 
a¼0.0026 after the ﬁrst 200 patients had completed the study, 
applying the inverse normal procedure of Wassmer with stopping 
boundaries of O’Brien and Fleming.17e19 On the basis of this 
analysis, the Independent Data Monitoring Board recommended 
reducing participant numbers from 400 to 300 as this sample size 
was sufﬁcient to maintain a conditional power of 95%. The post- 
interim results conﬁrmed the validity of this approach. 
Statistical analysis 
All decisions regarding primary outcome data were ﬁnalised by 
a blind data review panel before unblinding. SAS/STAT software 
(V.8.02) was used, based on a pre-agreed analysis plan.20 All 
primary and sensitivity analyses were carried out on the 
full analysis set (FAS) (ie, all patients enrolled), had at least 
screening/baseline measurements and had taken at least one 
dose of study medication. For the efﬁcacy analysis, missing data 
were replaced by the last observation carried forward approach. 
In addition, as a sensitivity assessment of the primary efﬁcacy 
parameter, worst case and multiple imputation substitutions 
were performed. 
The primary analysis of efﬁcacy compared the proportion of 
patients with relief from muscle stiffness (0e3 on the CRS) in 
the CE and placebo arms. A logistic regression model was used 
with ﬁxed factors treatment (binary), ambulatory status at 
screening (binary), use of spasticity medication (binary) and 
geographical region (binary dummy coded). A one sided test for 
superiority of CE over placebo was performed with a prespeci- 
ﬁed a error level of a¼0.024 for the ﬁnal analysis, incorporating 
a global error level of a¼0.025 combined from the interim and 
ﬁnal analyses. 
Secondary efﬁcacy endpoints were analysed in the same way 
as the primary endpoint for numerical rate of change scales or 
non-parametrically for amount of symptoms in CRS and MS 
speciﬁc questionnaires. The MSSS-88 has 
sections 
measuring three spasticity related symptoms, effect of spasticity 
on three aspects of physical function and two aspects of 
psychosocial function. Analysis included the factors treatment, 
ambulatory status and antispasticity medication (all binary) 
using Lehmann’s non-parametric aligned rank test. 

The MSIS-29 has two scales measuring the self-reported 
physical 
impact (nine 
items) of MS, each with ﬁve response options. The MSWS-12 is 
a self-rated measure of walking ability. This questionnaire was 




 




not administered in patients unable to walk and the analysis 
therefore included only the factor treatment (binary), evaluated 
using Wilcoxon’s rank sum test. 
The MSSS-88, MISIS-29 and MSWS-12 were also analysed 
using Rasch measurement methods.21e23 This modern psycho- 
metric analytic method has the advantage of deriving linear 
measurements from ordinal patient responses to items, and 
enabling legitimate analysis at the individual person level. 


The CochraneManteleHaenszelec2 test was used to test for 
differences between the proportion of patients with AEs in the 
CE and placebo groups stratiﬁed for separate visits. Laboratory 
parameters were compared using Fisher’s exact test. 

secondary and safety parameters where considered 
statistically signiﬁcant with a (local) two sided error level of 
a¼0.05. 
RESULTS 
A total of 279 patients were randomised at 22 centres in the UK 
between June 2006 and September 2008 (ﬁgure 1). 
Each centre randomised between one and 31 patients. Fifty-one 
patients failed the initial screening. One hundred and nine of 
the 144 patients randomised to CE (75.7%) and 115 of the 135 
patients randomised to placebo (85.2%) completed the study. 
As one participant in each treatment group did not receive study 
medication, 277 randomised participants were included in the 
FAS. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar in the 
two FAS treatment groups (tables 1 and 2). Although there were 
slightly more people with relapsingeremitting MS in the CE 
treated group, this was not signiﬁcant and unlikely to have in- 
troduced bias by recovery from relapse, as all participants needed 
to be at least 6 months relapse free prior to study entry. 
The proportion of patients with self-reported relief (deﬁned as 
categories 0e3 on the CRS) was 29.4% in the cannabis group

and 15.7% in the placebo group (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.13,

In a prespeciﬁed subgroup analysis (baseline status of the 
speciﬁc symptom (low vs high), geographic region, ambulatory 
status (walking vs non-walking) at screening and use of anti- 
spasticity or analgesic medication (yes or no)), more patients on 
CE experienced relief than on placebo, in all subgroups. The 
smallest difference was found between treatment groups in the 
non-walking subgroup (25.8% CE group and 25.0% placebo 
group). The difference between treatment groups was most

pronounced in patients not using antispasticity medication 
(37.9% CE group vs 16.3% placebo group). 
Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the conﬁr- 
matory (last observation carried forward) analysis (worst case 
analysis: 29.4% vs 20.1%, OR 1.65, 95% CI (cid:2)1.59 to 20.04, 
p¼0.041; multiple imputation: 30.8% vs 15.7%, OR 2.36, 95% 
CI 4.62 to 25.57, p¼0.003). 
Secondary efﬁcacy variables were self-reported relief from 
muscle stiffness after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, and relief from 
body pain, muscle spasms and sleep disturbance after 4, 8 and 12 
weeks of treatment. The rate of self-reported relief was consis- 
tently higher under CE than under placebo. At all visits, differ- 
ences between treatment groups were statistically signiﬁcant 
(p<0.025, one sided) for all variables (table 3). 
The only exception was the difference between the rate of 
relief from body pain after 12 weeks of treatment (p¼0.028). 
When this analysis was restricted to the subgroup of patients 
with high baseline pain scores, the treatment differences were 
greater because of lower placebo response rates (rates of relief 
after 4, 8 and 12 weeks for CE: 27.7%, 26.6%, 29.8%; for placebo: 
15.0%, 13.8%, 11.3%) and the result was statistically signiﬁcant, 
even at week 12 (p¼0.001). 
The OR for relief from muscle spasms increased over time due 
to an increase in the rate of relief from CE and because of an 
extremely low responder rate in the placebo group at week 12. 
Response rates for improvement in quality of sleep were most 
pronounced for all CRS efﬁcacy parameters, especially in the CE 
group, and ORs after 4 weeks and 8 weeks were the highest 
observed during the study. 
In parallel with assessing the degree of relief from each 
symptom, participants determined the absolute level of MS 
symptoms they had had over the previous week. Baseline values 
were similar in the treatment groups. Ratings improved during 
the treatment phase from week 4 to week 8 and week 12, and 
mean symptom values were always lower in the CE group 
(table 4). With regard to change from baseline, differences 
between ratings after 12 weeks of treatment were statistically 
signiﬁcantly in favour of CE for amount of muscle stiffness and 
amount of body pain (table 5). 
Baseline values for MSSS-88, MSIS-29 and MSWS-12 were 
similar in the treatment groups. Ratings improved during 
treatment in both groups. Mean ratings were always in favour 
of the CE group, except for the MSSS-88 section ‘effect of 
spasticity on daily activities’ (table 5). 
Differences between ratings after 12 weeks of treatment were 
statistically signiﬁcant in favour of CE for sections of the MSSS- 
88 measuring muscle stiffness, muscle spasms and effect of 
spasticity on body movements, and the MSWS-12. 
The mean and median EDSS scores were similar in the 
treatment groups at screening and after 12 weeks of treatment. 
At the end of the titration period, approximately 87% of 
participants in the placebo group were taking the maximum 
daily ‘dose’ of 25.0 mg. In contrast, only 47% of participants in 
the CE group had up titrated to a maximum daily dose of 
25.0 mg. Of the CE patients who did not achieve the maximum 
daily dose, most were taking daily doses of 10.0 or 15.0 mg. 
Sixteen participants (11.2%) in the CE group discontinued study 
medication during titration, compared with four in the placebo 
group (3.0%). 
At the end of the study, only 24.5% of CE participants were 
taking the 25.0 mg dose, compared with 69.4% of placebo 
participants (table 6). 
In total, 34 patients in the CE group (23.8%) and 20 in the 
placebo group (14.9%) discontinued study medication before the

end of the study, including the 20 patients who discontinued 
during titration. 
Participants in the placebo group showed greater compliance 
(median index 98%) with study treatment than those in the CE 
group (83%). 
There were no deaths during the study. Serious AEs (SAES) 
were reported for seven participants in the CE group (4.9%) and 
for three participants in the placebo group (2.2%). Urinary tract 
infection was reported as an SAE for three patients in the CE 
group (2.1%). None of the other SAEs were reported for more 
than one participant. 
Altogether, 233 of 277 participants (84.1%) in the FAS experienced 
at least one treatment emergent AE. The proportion of patients 
with AEs was higher in the CE group than in the placebo group 
(93.0% vs 74.6%). Thirty patients in the CE group (21.0%) and nine 
in the placebo group (6.7%) were withdrawn from the study or 
discontinued study medication due to AEs. Despite this, more 
than 95% of AEs in each treatment group were mild or moderate, 
and the majority subsided after the end of study/treatment (table 7). 
In the CE group, rates of AEs were highest during titration 
(75.5%) and decreased continuously over the course of the study 
(table 8). AEs classed as nervous system disorders were most 
followed by gastrointestinal disorders 
common (71.3%), 
(41.3%). AEs that occurred at clearly higher rates in the CE 
group than in the placebo group (difference >3%) were dizzi- 
ness, disturbance in attention, balance disorder, somnolence, dry 
mouth, nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling abnormal, 
urinary tract infection, disorientation, confusional state and fall. 
Pain in extremities occurred at a higher rate in the placebo group 
than in the CE group. No relevant changes were seen for 
haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis variables or vital signs. 
DISCUSSION 
Treatment with standardised oral extract of Cannabis sativa 
relieved muscle stiffness. The proportion of participants expe- 
riencing relief was almost twice as large in the CE group as in 
the placebo group (29.4% vs 15.7%), which conﬁrmed the 
superiority of CE over placebo in the treatment of muscle

stiffness. Sensitivity analyses using a worst case approach 
and multiple imputation of missing data corroborated the 
robustness of the results. Similar results were found in rates of 
relief from body pain, spasms and for sleep quality. It should be 
noted that a treatment effect after 12 weeks similar to the ﬁnal 
analysis result had already been observed at the interim analysis. 
Based on the interim analysis of the FAS, it was possible to 
reduce the sample size, mainly for ethics reasons, while never- 
theless maintaining a high conditional power for the remaining 
study.

(overall rate of relief 34.5% in CAMS, 22.6% in MUSEC), the 
overall rate of relief from CE and placebo differed by 15% in both 
studies. As the most important secondary efﬁcacy parameter, 
the rate of relief from body pain was also consistently higher in 
the CE group than in the placebo group. 
Rating scales are increasingly being used as primary and 
secondary outcome measures in clinical studies in neurology.22 
Evidence supports the use of a balanced 7 and 11 point numer- 
ical scale with written descriptors at the ends and in the middle 
of the scale, as used in the MUSEC study. Such instruments 
have the advantages of clinical relevance, adequate reproduc- 
ibility and sensitivity to change, and are intuitively easy to 
understand by the patient and the person administering them. It 
must, however, be taken into account that a patient’s condition 
at the time of asking might inﬂuence the rating change scored 
that is, greater positive changes may be seen in patients with 
lower symptom severity scores, and vice versa. 
Analysis of the MSSS-88, MSIS-29 and MSWS-12 data 
supported the outcome of the primary endpoint. For the MSSS- 
88 sections with relatively high baseline values (ie, muscle 
stiffness, muscle spasms and effect of spasticity on body 
movements) and for the MSWS-12, the differences between 
ratings after 12 weeks of treatment compared with baseline 
were statistically signiﬁcantly in favour of CE. A post hoc Rasch 
analysis has also been performed in order to support the main 
ﬁndings of this study, and will be presented elsewhere. Rasch 
analysis offers advantages over more traditional methods of 
analysing rating scale data that are clinically meaningful for 
neurology research.23 24 
As would be expected, dose escalation resulted in a higher 
percentage of participants taking the maximum daily dose of 
25.0 mg in the placebo group than in the CE group. A relatively 
high proportion of participants in each treatment group had 
reduced their daily dose by the end of the study (placebo 17.9%, 
CE 22.4%). However, the proportion of CE patients still on the 
maximum daily dose at the end of the study was similar to the

ﬁndings of an earlier randomised, double blind, crossover study 
which compared the same CE and placebo where the respective 
proportion was 23.2%.25 
Not surprisingly, the overall rate of AEs was higher in the CE 
group than in the placebo group with the highest rate at the end 
of the dose escalation phase. A marked continuous decrease in 
AE rates was observed over the remainder of the study (16.8%). 
A similar trend was observed in the placebo group, although the 
changes in AE rates over the course of the study were not as 
pronounced. Thus the greatest difference between AE rates was 
observed during the titration phase and can reasonably be 
attributed to the fast dose escalation. In this study, fast dose 
escalation to the individual maximum tolerated dose was 
distinctly different from the CAMS study and was chosen 
deliberately to ensure that none of the potential efﬁcacy of CE 
was missed, since an absolute maximum dose cannot be speci- 
ﬁed. Thus a higher rate of AEs and, in consequence, AE related 
withdrawals, had to be accepted.

A second point regarding tolerability of CE is that the fast 
dose escalation and strict clinical trial titration regimen (only 
one titration was allowed) in this study does not reﬂect normal 
clinical routine in which dose titration can be performed more 
slowly and where more up and down titration usually occurs. 
As expected, CNS symptoms occurred at a higher rate under 
the psychoactive CE compared with placebo (24.5% vs 7.5%). 
Most CNS AEs were mild, the most common being disorienta- 
tion and confusion. 
Muscle spasms, musculoskeletal stiffness and paindthe main 
outcomes of this trialdwere reported as AEs at low frequencies, 
and with only small differences between treatment groups. Three 
SAEs (urinary tract infection, head injury and interstitial lung 
disease) were considered treatment related by the investigator. 
Although patients taking b-interferon were excluded from 
this short term study, this was in order to prevent any con- 
founding of spasticity induced by interferon administration. 
There is no reason to believe that any treatment effect would 
not be seen in patients taking b-interferon, or any other 
immunomodulatory drug. 
The CAMS study is still the largest study to have assessed the 
effect of a standardised CE on MS symptoms. The present 
MUSEC study results conﬁrmed the positive effects seen in 
CAMS, and were also similar to the ﬁndings of two other studies 
that showed a signiﬁcant reduction on an 11 point numerical 
spasticity rating scale in patients treated with an oromucosal 
cannabinoid.10 26 In assessing the context of these results, it 
must be acknowledged that the level of evidence for many 
approved drugs to combat symptoms is weak. Clinical experi- 
ence provides evidence that baclofen may cause more weakness 
in already weak patients, and the effect of tizanidine is often 
unsatisfactory. A recent Cochrane review of antispasticity 
agents for MS concluded that the paucity of evidence meant 
that no prescribing recommendations can be made, and that 
better outcome measures need to be developed.27 This may 
explain why 40% of participants in this study did not receive 
any other antispasticity medication. In order to circumvent high 
non-responder rates, an enriched study design has recently been 
used to evaluate an oromucosal cannabinoid, at the cost of 
provoking a very high placebo response rate.10 In the present 
study, we were able to demonstrate signiﬁcant efﬁcacy without 
resorting to such measures. Clearly, the difﬁculty in identifying 
patient responders within study groups may dilute apparent 
treatment effects and there is a considerable need to develop 
methodology in this area. 
Our ﬁndings suggest that standardised CE can be clinically 
useful in treating the highly complex phenomenon of spasticity 
in MS, and that an 11 point numerical rating change scale is 
a useful instrument to measure the treatment effect of relief 
from muscle stiffness. Effective pain relief is also achieved by CE, 
especially in patients with a high baseline pain score.
