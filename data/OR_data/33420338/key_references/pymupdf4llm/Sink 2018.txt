Abstract
Introduction: Owing to its capacity to perform remote assessments, telemedicine is rising as a new force in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management. We conducted an eight month randomised-controlled-trial to
study the effect of an automated telemedicine intervention on patients’ time-to-hospitalisation.
Methods: A total of 168 patients with a diagnosis of COPD in the past 24 months were enrolled to receive the
intervention at a primary care clinic. The treatment group received daily phone messages from an automated system
asking them to report if they were breathing better than, worse than, or the same as the day prior. Patients reported
their breathing status by responding to the text message or call. If a patient reported breathing worse, an alert was sent
directly to that patient’s provider within the clinic. The control group received the same daily phone messages as the
treatment group. However, no proactive breathing alerts were ever generated to the provider for these subjects. The
primary outcome was the subjects’ time-to-first-COPD-related hospitalisation following the start of messages.
Results: The treatment group’s time-to-hospitalisation was significantly different than the control group’s with a hazard
ratio of 2.36 (95% confidence interval 1.02–5.45, p 0.0443). The number needed-to-treat ratio was 8.62. Subject
¼
engagement consistently ranged between 60% and 75%. The treatment group received both proactive monitoring and
follow-up care from the providers.
Discussion: Active monitoring with provider feedback enables the detection of exacerbation events early enough for
subjects to avoid admissions. The use of non-smartphone interventions reduces barriers to care presented by more
complicated and expensive technologies. This intervention represents a simple, innovative, and inexpensive tool for
improved COPD management.

## Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
common condition worldwide that impacts nearly
every aspect of patients’ health related quality of life.[1,2]

COPD is the third leading cause of death and the fifth
leading cause of disability in the United States (US).[3]

Patients suffer from frequent shortness of breath, exercise intolerance and respiratory infections.[4] Owing to its
capacity to perform remote assessments, telemedicine is
rising as a new force in COPD management.
Despite the preventable and treatable nature of
COPD, it is an extremely costly disease that places a


heavy burden on the US healthcare system. In 2006
alone, there were more than 1.25 million hospital
admissions classified as acute exacerbation episodes
resulting in a total in-patient cost of US$11.9 billion.[5]

Around 50–75% of the total cost of COPD care
is associated with acute exacerbation events.[4]

Exacerbations place unnecessary physical and mental
strain on the patient, and they are associated with a
higher risk of short-term and long-term mortality.[6]

The hypothesis surrounding the application of telemedicine to COPD is that more frequent monitoring of
patients’ symptoms will allow for early detection and
intervention of exacerbation events before they lead to
the utilisation of clinical resources.[7,8] A well-designed
COPD intervention could improve patient quality of
life, lower hospitalisations, and reduce associated
healthcare costs.[9] The intervention should make the
patient’s respiratory condition more visible to the provider, allow providers to monitor long-term trends,
effectively triage patients based on their respiratory
condition and, most importantly, detect exacerbation
events before they result in hospitalisation.[10]

However, the results of past studies have not demonstrated a definitive clinical or economic benefit to
these interventions. Several systematic reviews have
concluded that while many past trials have shown positive trends, there is not sufficient evidence at this time
to say that COPD telemedicine interventions have a
significant effect on the standard of care.[11,12]

The Epharmix COPD system, hereafter referred to
as EpxCOPD, is an intervention designed to remotely
monitor the self-reported breathing status of patients
with COPD through the use of automated phone calls
and SMS text messages. EpxCOPD was originally
developed by researchers at Washington University in
Saint Louis. The product has now been commercialised
in the form of Epharmix Inc. (Epharmix Inc. Saint
Louis, MO, USA). The system was intentionally structured to meet the needs of patients with low technology
literacy. The major goals of the system are to improve
patients’ quality of life, increase their connection to
their care team, and reduce their rate of COPD exacerbations. We set out to demonstrate the effective
implementation and clinical benefits of EpxCOPD by
running an eight month randomised-controlled-trial
(RCT) in a primary care medicine clinic.

## Materials and methods

 Trial design

Participants were recruited between January and April
2016 at a resident-run primary care medicine clinic at an
academic institution in St. Louis, Missouri for an eight
month, double-blinded RCT (Figure 1). The trial regis[tration number is NCT03002311 (see https://clinical](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03002311)
[trials.gov/show/NCT03002311). Residents participat-](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03002311)
ing in the trial included 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year residents.
In the case of one resident being temporarily unable to


J f ( )

participate due to other residency commitments, coresidents filled in to cover each other’s patients.
A list of 633 potential trial participants was queried
from the clinic’s EMR based on an ICD-9 or ICD-10
diagnostic code for COPD in the 24 months preceding
the trial. Inclusion criteria included those with a diagnosis of COPD made in the preceding 24 months, age
greater than 18 years, and a willingness to provide a
telephone number at which they can receive text messages or voice phone messages. Exclusion criteria included people with intention to transfer care away from the
clinic during the trial period. Mental status was not
specifically assessed prior to enrolment. Ability to complete the enrolment process was accepted as appropriate
capacity to participate in the trial and understand
English voice calls. Subjects elected themselves to
choose the text message or voice phone option.
Research staff independent from the trial investigators performed the trial recruitment and informed consent over the phone between January and April 2016.
Consenting subjects were randomised by simple randomisation and allocated into two cohorts in a 1:1
ratio using the Excel Random Number generator function. Once subjects were consented and randomised,
they were enrolled in the EpxCOPD system. All subjects were given the option of receiving messages via
either SMS text message or voice phone and selected
the time of day that they preferred to receive messages.
Usual care was continued for both groups.
EpxCOPD is part of broader telemedicine platform,
Epharmix, that has recently been developed and
applied to many different disease states. EpxCOPD
differs from many previously attempted interventions
since all it requires of patients is the capability to
receive phone calls or simple SMS (short message service) text messages. Patients send and receive automated messages from the Epharmix central server in
order to communicate disease-specific biometric data
(Figure 2). The message algorithms, built in association
with physicians, nurses, patients, and medical
students from our affiliated programs, use Bayesian
branching logic to generate meaningful provider
alerts and reports to keep providers up-to-date on
their patients’ conditions.

## Intervention

The treatment group received a daily message from the
EpxCOPD system via automated phone call or text
message asking them ‘Are you breathing better than,
worse than, or the same as yesterday’? (Figure 3). After
considering his or her current breathing status, the subject then responded to the question by typing a
response into their telephone. If a subject responded
‘better’ or ‘the same’, then no action was taken by

worse breathing relayed to providers.


the EpxCOPD system. If a subject responded ‘worse’,
then the EpxCOPD system immediately triggered an
alert to the subject’s assigned provider in the resident
clinic. To minimise any potential liability, all
EpxCOPD message sequences ended by instructing
the subject that if they were experiencing a medical
emergency, to present to the emergency department
to seek care.
The medical residents assigned to the subjects
received alerts in the form of a text message and in
messages placed in their task folders in the clinic
EMR. The alert message included a notice that the
subject had reported breathing worse and provided a
phone number and subject-specific alert code to use to
contact the subject for follow-up. When residents
dialled this subject-specific alert code, they were
routed through the Epharmix server directly to the


subject who had set off the alert. The provider then
had the opportunity to counsel the subject on how to
return to a stable breathing state or to order the appropriate clinical intervention.
The control group received the same daily message
from the EpxCOPD system via automated phone call
or text message asking them ‘Are you breathing better
than, worse than, or the same as yesterday’? However,
the control group did not have their alerts proactively
transmitted to their providers. When a subject in the
control group reported breathing worse, no alert was
generated to inform their provider to provide follow-up
care. However, these subjects still had the capability to
call into the system on their own accord and be connected to their provider.
Subjects in both the treatment and control groups
began the trial by receiving the EpxCOPD message

sequence once per day. EpxCOPD included a smart
schedule feature that scaled back the number of messages if there was evidence that a subject was doing
relatively well. If a subject reported breathing ‘better’
or ‘the same’ for 30 consecutive days, they were shifted
to a twice-weekly message schedule. If a subject on the
twice-weekly schedule ever reported breathing ‘worse’,
the subject would be temporarily placed back onto the
daily schedule plan for a period of time until their
breathing stabilised.

## Data analysis

The primary outcome was subjects’ timeto-hospitalisation, defined as the number of days
between a subject’s enrolment in the EpxCOPD
system and their day of admittance to the hospital.
For the purposes of this study, we defined the onset
of an ‘exacerbation’ as a subject’s day of admittance
to the hospital. The secondary outcome was subjects’
cumulative weekly engagement with the Epharmix
telemedicine system.
Time-to-hospitalisation data was collected by analysis of subjects’ medical records in the EMR. Using
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, powered at 80%,
with an a priori alpha set at 0.05 and expecting an absolute delta of 10%, from an estimated pre-trial 20% hospitalisation rate, we expected to require 296 patients.
The hypothesis was that subjects in the treatment
group receiving proactive communication with alerts
transmitted to their primary care providers would be
detected sooner when an exacerbation occurred.
The subject engagement rate was calculated from
data stored on the Epharmix HIPAA-secure web
server as the fraction of total subjects responding to
at least one message during a 1-week period. Subject
demographic information was collected by pre-trial
enrolment survey. Pre-trial disease severity was
assessed by retrieving subject’s most recent
pulmonary function test (PFT) from the EMR, if available. Not all of the subjects had a PFT available
for inclusion.
Because some subjects revoked their consent to
receive Epharmix messages during the trial, it was necessary to consider in some cases if a subject revoked
their consent before or after the date of any COPDrelated hospitalisation found in the medical record. No
efforts were made to prevent subjects from revoking
their consent or to recruit subjects back onto the
system after they withdrew their consent to receive
messages. To test the effectiveness of EpxCOPD in
preventing hospitalisations, those subjects who stopped
messages in the intervention group were censored from
the Kaplan–Meier analysis the day they stopped messages. For the control group, subjects were censored


from the analysis on the last day data was collected,
whether or not the subjects stopped the placebo messages themselves.

## Results

At the end of the enrolment period, 168 subjects were
successfully consented and enrolled into the EpxCOPD
telemedicine system, of which 83 subjects were randomised into the treatment group. Only the clinic residents served as ‘providers’ receiving alerts for the
purpose of the trial. However, 17 subjects receiving
care from the clinic site were included in the trial
even though they were not assigned to one of the residents at the time of enrolment. This occurred because
these patients had been seen in previous years by resident physicians who had graduated at the time of
the start of the study. These patients not been yet
assigned to a new resident as a PCP, but still
appeared on the initial list of 633 patients queried
from the medical record. Because these subjects could
not functionally be placed into the intervention group,
they were included in the control group without
randomisation. Therefore, 68 subjects were randomised
into the control group; 17 subjects were placed
by default into the control group without randomisation. Demographic information collected during the
enrolment suggests that the cohorts were mostly nonwhite individuals of low socioeconomic status. There
were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of age, gender, race, smoking status, smoking
history or annual income between the two cohorts
(Table 1).

Analysis of the subjects’ most recent PFTs revealed
that the treatment and control groups were very similar
in their pre-trial lung function. No significant difference
in the FEV1/FVC or FEV1% predicted existed between
groups. The subjects were grouped according to their
classification in the GOLD criteria (Table 2). Subjects
for whom we were unable to locate PFTs were excluded
from this analysis. Additionally, we compared the lung
function of the 68 randomised and 17 non-randomised
members of the control group. The FEV1% predicted
refers to the forced expiratory volume of air that a subject is able to expel in 1 s compared with predicted values
for a reference population with similar age and body
weight. The FEV1/FVC ratio compares the forced expiratory volume in 1 s relative to the subject’s total forced
vital capacity. The FEV1/FVC is used clinically to measure the severity of lung damage in patients with COPD.
Although there was no significant difference in FEV1%
predicted, there was a significant difference in the FEV1/
FVC ratio between the randomised and nonrandomised members (Table 3).
Throughout the trial, the cumulative subject engagement rate consistently ranged between 65% and 87%
(Figure 4); 13 members of the intervention group and
15 members of the control group revoked their consent
to receive message prior to the stop date of the trial.
The reasons cited for revoking consent included message fatigue, not enough contact with their provider, or
loss of interest in participating in the study. There was
a significant change in time to hospitalisation between
the treatment group and control groups, with a hazard
ratio of 2.36 (95% confidence interval 1.02–5.45,

## Discussion

The management of patients with COPD remains an
extremely complex, multifactorial process. The ambiguity of the disease’s primary symptom, dyspnoea, has
made designing a COPD telemedicine intervention a
particular challenge. The intervention must be easyto-use for patients, easy for providers to manage, and
provide measurable clinical benefits.
EpxCOPD was designed to address the economic
and social barriers that may limit a COPD patient’s
access to high quality telemedicine monitoring. The
system is inexpensive to operate, and all messages
are free to patients. The cost of operating the messaging system is approximately US$10 per patient per
month. Message sequences were designed to be
understood by anyone with at least a fourth-grade
reading level. The messages are accessible with any
type of phone, mobile or landline, smartphone or
burner phone.
The study population consisted primarily of elderly
subjects with low annual income. Elderly populations
are sometimes considered to have too low technology
literacy to use telemedicine tools. However, the rate at
which subjects complied with EpxCOPD seems to discredit this theory (Figure 4). Well-designed, simple to
use telemedicine interventions can be accessible to
patients drawn from any age group or socioeconomic class.
Survival analysis of the treatment and control
groups indicated a statistically significant difference in
subjects’ time-to-hospitalisation. We are highly encouraged by this result as confirmation that this intervention is having a meaningful effect not only on patient
engagement, but also on clinical outcomes. The
number of patients needed to treat to prevent one
COPD hospitalisation was 8.62; this is an extremely
economically efficient alternative to both alternative
COPD telemedicine interventions and certainly less
expensive that the cost of a COPD hospitalisation.
This study is one of the first, if not the first, RCTs of
a COPD telemedicine system to demonstrate a statistically significant clinical outcome among a large patient
population with many participating providers. No
other trial has used simple text messages or phone
calls to reach a more underserved population with
many different participating providers.


There are several limitations to this study which we
wish to address. First, the analysis of the primary
outcome was limited to specifically examining COPDrelated hospitalisations as opposed to all-cause hospitalisations. We wished to limit the scope of the analysis
in order to expressly show the effect of EpxCOPD on
hospital admissions related to changes in respiratory
status. In addition, the data collection for the primary
outcome was performed only within the host clinic’s
EMR. The hospitalisations recorded in the clinic
EMR are limited to admissions that occurred within
the affiliated hospital system. It is possible that some
hospitalisations occurred outside the scope of record of
the EMR and thus were omitted from the analysis of
the primary outcome.
Analysis of the subjects’ pulmonary function tests
revealed that the 17 non-randomised members of the
control group may have had slightly worse lung function at the start of the trial than the randomised members of the control group. However, during the trial
period, the fraction of subjects in the group of 17 subjects not assigned to a resident who experienced a
COPD hospitalisation during the trial (17.6%) was
less than the fraction of patients hospitalised in the
rest of the control group (19.1%). Therefore, we do
not believe the 17 patients affected the analysis of the
primary outcome.
There was some variability in the rate at which the
residents responded to subjects’ alerts. Some providers
were very good at responding to alerts in a timely
manner; other providers took longer to respond or
failed to respond at all. If some alerts went without
follow-up, subjects in the intervention group who
may have benefited from receiving attention from
their provider did not receive it. Despite this variability,
enough residents complied with the intervention to
demonstrate a significant change in the primary outcome.
We intend to expand the EpxCOPD algorithm to
include additional questions beyond the current question, ‘Are you breathing better than, worse than, or the
same as yesterday’? When EpxCOPD was created, it
was intentionally limited to just one question in order
to keep the algorithm as simple as possible. Adding
additional questions to the algorithm will hopefully
increase the specificity of alerts, so providers only
receive alerts that critically require follow-up.


-----

## Conclusion

This eight month RCT demonstrated the successful
implementation of the EpxCOPD telemedicine system
among a large cohort of subjects and a large number of
providers. EpxCOPD facilitated a statistically significant change in subjects’ time to hospitalisation, and
subjects remained highly compliant with messages
throughout the trial. EpxCOPD is a cost-effective,
easy-to-use clinical tool for improved COPD management accessible by nearly all potential patients, including those in underserved urban communities.
