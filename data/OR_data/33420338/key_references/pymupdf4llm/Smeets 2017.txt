### Abstract

**Background:** The use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices
is expanding in the treatment of heart failure. Most of the current devices are equipped with remote monitoring functions, including
bioimpedance for fluid status monitoring. The question remains whether bioimpedance measurements positively impact clinical
outcome.
**Objective:** The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical interventions taken based on remote
bioimpedance monitoring alerts and their impact on clinical outcome.
**Methods:** This is a single-center observational study of consecutive ICD and CRT patients (n=282) participating in protocol-driven
remote follow-up. Bioimpedance alerts were analyzed with subsequently triggered interventions.
**Results:** A total of 55.0% (155/282) of patients had an ICD or CRT device equipped with a remote bioimpedance algorithm.
During 34 (SD 12) months of follow-up, 1751 remote monitoring alarm notifications were received (2.2 per patient-year of
follow-up), comprising 2096 unique alerts (2.6 per patient-year of follow-up). Since 591 (28.2%) of all incoming alerts were
bioimpedance-related, patients with an ICD or CRT including a bioimpedance algorithm had significantly more alerts (3.4 versus
1.8 alerts per patient-year of follow-up, P<.001). Bioimpedance-only alerts resulted in a phone contact in 91.0% (498/547) of
cases, which triggered an actual intervention in 15.9% (87/547) of cases, since in 75.1% (411/547) of cases reenforcing heart
failure education sufficed. Overall survival was lower in patients with a cardiovascular implantable electronic device with a
bioimpedance algorithm; however, this difference was driven by differences in baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio of
2.118, 95% CI 0.845-5.791). No significant differences between both groups were observed in terms of the number of follow-up
visits in the outpatient heart failure clinic, the number of hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of heart failure, or mean
length of hospital stay.
**Conclusions:** Bioimpedance-only alerts constituted a substantial amount of incoming alerts when turned on during remote
follow-up and triggered an additional intervention in only 16% of cases since in 75% of cases, providing general heart failure
education sufficed. The high frequency of heart failure education that was provided could have contributed to fewer heart
failure–related hospitalizations despite significant differences in baseline characteristics.

### Introduction

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices and
implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are
guideline-recommended treatments for heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction, left bundle branch block, very wide QRS
complex (>150 ms), or sudden cardiac death [1,2]. The use of
these cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is
rapidly increasing with 51,274 and 85,289 patients, respectively,
receiving a CRT or ICD device in Europe in 2013 [3]. Remote
follow-up of this group is slowly finding its way into routine
clinical practice since it may hold major advantages for patients,
health care workers, and society [4]. Over the last decade,
several CIED manufacturers have marketed thoracic impedance
measurement algorithms integrated into their devices. Changes
in bioimpedance measurements reflect changes in intrathoracic
fluid status and are evaluated based on a vendor-specific
computer algorithm. Early investigations reported an inverse
correlation with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and fluid
balance [5] and a higher sensitivity and lower unexplained
detection rate compared to acute weight changes [6]. In addition,
a decrease in bioimpedance happened even before clinical
manifestation of heart failure worsening and before hospital
admission for fluid overload [5]. These algorithms are therefore
very promising for the early detection of impending
decompensated heart failure and enable the possibility to adjust
treatment strategies in order to prevent heart failure
hospitalization [7,8]. Despite early investigations showing
promising results, larger randomized trials have revealed
disappointing outcomes [9-12]. A shortcoming in current studies
is the lack of standardization and information as to what clinical
actions are coupled to remote bioimpedance alerts, making it
difficult to draw conclusions on its clinical impact.

In 2010, a dedicated remote follow-up program of heart failure
patients with a CIED was started at Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg
(Genk, Belgium). Dedicated nurses, trained in electrophysiology,
device follow-up, and heart failure pathophysiology, review all
incoming alerts in a systematic and standardized manner with
automatic interventions triggered by protocol-based,
guideline-recommended care [13,14]. In this observational
registry study, we closely analyzed all bioimpedance alerts and
subsequent triggered interventions from OptiVol and OptiVol
2.0 (Medtronic PLC) and CorVue (St. Jude Medical LLC)
CIEDs using the default alert settings, and we studied their
impact on clinical outcome. As such, the current research builds
on previous studies since these lack this level of detail.

### Methods

##### Study Design

This is an observational registry study of ICD and CRT patients
from a single tertiary care center (Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg,
Genk, Belgium) implanted with the devices between February
2010 and May 2013. Since February 2010, all patients receiving
either an ICD or CRT device with remote monitoring capabilities


were asked to participate voluntarily in a remote follow-up
program. The type of CIED that was implanted was solely based
on the device’s therapeutic capabilities (right ventricular pacing,
biventricular pacing, and antitachycardia treatment) and was
left to the discretion of the treating physician. For this analysis,
only patients enrolled in remote follow-up within 6 months after
device implantation are included. Patient baseline information
is collected at the time of device implantation. All participants
provided written informed consent and were followed until
February 1, 2015. The study complies with the Declaration of
Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the local
committee on human research.

##### Remote Follow-Up and Alerts

A vendor-specific transmission device, usually installed in the
patient’s bedroom, collected disease- and device-related data
from the CIED that was transmitted to an online database
accessible to the multidisciplinary heart failure team. All alerts
were interpreted on weekdays by dedicated nurses trained in
electrophysiology, device follow-up, and heart failure
pathophysiology; notifications received during weekends were
read on Monday. Daily alert transmissions were generated when
predefined alarm thresholds were crossed. Besides alert
transmissions, each device was programmed to send a scheduled
transmission report monthly. Alerts were categorized according
to their nature into technical (missed scheduled transmission
and technical device problems) or clinical (rhythm,
bioimpedance, and miscellaneous [changes in daily activity,
heart failure management, etc]) alerts. Our study focuses on all
bioimpedance-related alerts.

##### Bioimpedance Measurements

Since bioimpedance is measured from the electrode lead to the
device can, any thoracic fluid change including vascular,
interstitial, or alveolar fluid results in a change in its value.
Therefore, bioimpedance measurements are not specific to one
disease.

In 2004, Medtronic was the first company to introduce a
bioimpedance algorithm, known as the OptiVol algorithm, in
its CIEDs. For the OptiVol algorithm, bioimpedance is measured
in a semicontinuous way every 20 minutes from 12 AM to 5
PM. The algorithm starts 34 days postimplant and generates 2
separate graphs: one displays the raw bioimpedance data and
the other indicates the accumulated change between the daily
bioimpedance measurements and a dynamic reference
impedance. The latter one, called the OptiVol fluid index,
triggers an alarm when a predefined threshold is met, by default
set at 60Ω [5]. The OptiVol fluid index graph may indicate an
event, while the raw bioimpedance graph may indicate the
severity of the event [15,16]. In 2010, Medtronic launched
OptiVol 2.0, an updated version of the initial bioimpedance
algorithm. The updated version is intended to lower the number
of false positive alerts. Alterations include a faster changing
reference after initialization, a slower accumulating fluid index
for an initial duration of the event in patients with higher
day-to-day variability in impedance, and a fluid index which


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Smeets et al


accumulates only over the last 30 days [15]. An initial study
has reported a 40% decrease in unexplained detections [17]. In
our study, the default OptiVol threshold settings were used.

In 2009, St Jude Medical introduced its own bioimpedance
algorithm, known as CorVue. There are some fundamental
differences compared to the OptiVol algorithms. CorVue also
measures intrathoracic impedances in a semicontinuous way
every 2 hours around the clock. In addition, depending on the
type of lead, the impedance is measured in one (ie, unipolar
leads) or multiple vectors. Within the first 2 weeks, the
algorithm starts to build a reference impedance which is a
long-term moving average (ie, over the last 144 or 168
measurements for CRT or ICD devices, respectively).
Afterward, a short-term moving average (ie, over the last 12
measurements) of multivector impedance measurements builds
the daily impedance. A bioimpedance alert is triggered when
the daily impedance is lower than the reference impedance for
a programmable duration known as the congestion trigger (ie,
nominal 13 days for ICDs, 14 days for CRT-D, and 16 days for
CRT-P) [15]. In our study, the default congestion trigger settings
were used.

The presence of a bioimpedance algorithm is dependent on the
CIED manufacturer: most Medtronic and St Jude devices are
equipped with a bioimpedance algorithm and generate
bioimpedance alerts, while Biotronik and Boston Scientific
devices do not generate any bioimpedance alerts. In our study,
the choice of CIED brand implanted in a particular patient is
completely random. Therefore, the presence or absence of a
bioimpedance algorithm in this patient population is also
randomly assigned.

##### Intervention Protocol for Bioimpedance Alerts

All incoming bioimpedance alerts were deemed to be of
potential clinical relevance and resulted in a phone contact
between the interpreting nurse and the patient. In exceptional
cases, where the patient had an in-hospital check-up very
recently or had one planned in the near future, a phone contact
was not initiated. A custom-made heart failure questionnaire
was used to identify potential causes for the bioimpedance alert

[14,18]. Additional questions could be asked at the discretion
of the health care worker in order to gain better insight.
Appropriate feedback and general heart failure education (ie,
stress the importance of the conservation of a salt-free diet and
fluid restrictions) were always provided. Further action was
protocol-driven in consultation with a dedicated heart failure
specialist.

##### Outpatient Follow-Up

Patients enrolled in remote follow-up visit the outpatient
cardiology clinic for device and clinical heart failure follow-up
at 6 weeks after implantation and subsequently every 6 months
with a minimum of 2 visits per year as per standard practice in
our institution. Patients in this study were followed until death,
exclusion from remote follow-up, heart transplantation, or
February 1, 2015, whichever came first.


##### Statistical Analysis

Demographic and functional characteristics were compared
using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables are expressed
as mean and standard deviation (SD) if normally distributed or
median and interquartile range (IQR) otherwise. Survival curves
were constructed according to the Kaplan Meier method, with
the log-rank test used for comparison among groups. Unadjusted
and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated by Cox
regression analysis with Firth's penalized likelihood correction.
To define statistical differences between both groups, the
independent samples Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test
were used for normally and not normally distributed continuous
variables, respectively, and the chi-square test and Fisher exact
test were used accordingly for categorical variables. To define
statistical differences between the different bioimpedance
algorithms, the Kruskal Wallis test was used. The significance
level for tests was 2-sided with alpha=.05. All statistical analyses
were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 (IBM Corp);
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) was used for Cox regression with
Firth’s penalization.

### Results

##### Study Population

From a total of 506 patients with a CIED implanted during the
study period, 110 patients were excluded due to the presence
of a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P)
device without remote monitoring capabilities, 82 patients were
excluded because the remote monitoring program was started
more than 6 months after device implantation, 22 patients
refused study participation, and 10 patients were excluded due
to follow-up in another center. The final study population
consisted of 282 patients: 155 (55.0%) patients with a CIED
equipped with a bioimpedance algorithm (CIED[+]) and 127
(45.0%) patients with a CIED without an available bioimpedance
algorithm (CIED[—]) (Figure 1). Of 282 devices, 110 (39.0%)
Medtronic, 105 (37.2%) St. Jude Medical, 61 (21.6%) Biotronik,
and 6 (2.1%) Boston Scientific CIEDs were implanted.

Respectively, 26.4% (41/155), 43.2% (67/155), and 30.3%
(47/155) of patients in the CIED[+] population had a device
implanted with Optivol, Optivol 2.0, and CoreVue algorithm.
The median time interval between CIED implantation and start
of remote follow-up was 1 day (IQR 1 to 2 days), with 81.9%
(231/282) of patients included within 1 week. Patients were
followed for 34 (SD 12) months leading to 801 cumulative
patient-years of follow-up. The number of follow-up visits in
the outpatient device clinic was 3.25 per patient-year of
follow-up, of which 93% were elective and 7% were triggered
by remote monitoring. Baseline characteristics of the study
population at the time of implantation are shown in Table 1.

##### Remote Follow-Up Notifications, Alerts, and Interventions

During follow-up, the clinical call center handled 1751 remote
monitoring notifications. Since a notification can contain
multiple alerts, a total of 2096 unique alerts were received (ie,
2.6 alerts per patient-year of follow-up). Patients with a CIED[+]


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Smeets et al


had significantly more alerts than those with a CIED[—]: 1413
(67.41%, 3.4 per patient-year of follow-up) and 683 (32.59%,
1.8 per patient-year of follow-up), respectively, _P<.001. The_
amount of technical and arrhythmia alerts was similar in both
patient groups. The higher number of alerts in the CIED[+]

population can be entirely attributed to bioimpedance alerts.
The distribution of the different alert categories among both
groups is shown in Figure 2.

##### Bioimpedance Notifications and Interventions

During follow-up, 591 notifications including a bioimpedance
threshold crossing were received for 111 of 155 (71.6%)
patients. In 44 of these notifications, 1 or more additional alerts
were combined resulting in 547 bioimpedance-only notifications.

**Figure 1.** Flowchart of the study.


In 498 (91.0%) of bioimpedance-only notifications, the patient
was contacted by phone and a standardized heart failure
questionnaire was used. In 9.0% (49/547) of cases, a phone
contact was not initiated since the patient had an in-hospital
check-up very recently or had one planned in the near future.
In 75.1% (411/547) of bioimpedance-only notifications, only
general heart failure education was given. An additional
intervention was triggered in 15.9% (97/547) of cases (Figure
3, left). In total, 97 interventions were performed (Figure 3,
right), including medication changes in 50% (48/97) of cases,
referral to the general practitioner or cardiologist in 27% (26/97)
and 23% (22/97) of cases, respectively, and in 1% (1/97) the
patient was asked to visit the emergency room. A combination
of different interventions for 1 bioimpedance alert is also
possible.

##### Different Bioimpedance Algorithms

There was a statistically significant difference in number of
bioimpedance alerts per patient-year between the different
bioimpedance algorithms (χ[2]=12.643, P=.002) (Figure 4). The
updated OptiVol 2.0 algorithm (0.79 alerts per patient-year of
follow-up) triggered significantly fewer bioimpedance alerts
than OptiVol (1.67 alerts per patient-year of follow-up; P=.02)
and CorVue (1.97 alerts per patient-year of follow-up; P=.005).
No differences were observed concerning the distribution of
interventions triggered by the different bioimpedance algorithms.

##### Clinical Outcome

At mean time of follow-up (ie, 34 months), 26 patients had died,
leading to an overall survival rate of 90.8%. Seven patients died
in the CIED[—] population compared to 19 in the CIED[+]

population, leading to all-cause survival rates of 94.5% and
87.7%, respectively (P=.047) (Figure 5A). Most deaths were
due to cardiovascular causes, with 6 in the CIED[—] population


compared to 15 in the CIED[+] population (P=.10). No significant
differences in survival rate were observed for the different
bioimpedance algorithms.

At mean time of follow-up, 40 patients were hospitalized with
a primary diagnosis of heart failure and hence 85.8% (242/282)
of patients were free from heart failure–related hospitalization.
No significant difference was observed between both groups
(23/155, 85.2%, for CIED[+] versus 17/127, 86.6%, for CIED[—]

at mean time of follow-up, _P=.76) (Figure 5B) or for the_
different bioimpedance algorithms (P=.95) (Figure 5C).

No significant differences were observed between both groups
with respect to the number of elective follow-up visits in the
outpatient heart failure clinic (P=.45) or the number of
cardiac-related hospital admissions (P=.32). For those who had
at least 1 cardiac-related hospital admission, median length of
hospital stay was 6 (IQR 3 to 14) days. There was no significant
difference for length of hospital stay between both groups or
for the different bioimpedance algorithms.

Table 2 provides an overview of the unadjusted and adjusted
Cox regression analysis with Firth's penalization. Presence of
bioimpedance algorithms in the CIED resulted in a
nonsignificant adjusted hazard ratio of 2.118 (95% CI
0.845-5.791) for all-cause death and 2.335 (95% CI 0.852-7.020)
for cardiovascular death. Multivariate analysis indicated that
age, ejection fraction, and QRS time contribute to the observed
difference in survival rate between both groups.

### Discussion

##### Principal Findings

Although many newly implanted CIEDs have a built-in
bioimpedance algorithm, it remains unclear whether
bioimpedance measurements contribute to improved clinical
outcome when incorporated in a standardized heart failure care
path including remote follow-up. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive overview of bioimpedance alerts and subsequent
triggered interventions in patients with either a CRT or ICD
device enrolled in a dedicated, protocol-driven, remote follow-up
program in a single Belgian tertiary care center.

Major insights include the following:

1. Patients with a CIED equipped with a bioimpedance
algorithm have significantly more remote monitoring
notifications
2. In 75% of bioimpedance-only alerts, reenforcing heart
failure education was the only action taken; in 16% of cases,
an additional intervention was triggered; and in 9%, the
patient was not contacted
3. For the different bioimpedance algorithms, significant
differences were observed for the number of bioimpedance
alerts but not for triggered interventions or clinical outcome

Although patients with a CIED equipped with a bioimpedance
algorithm have a significantly lower survival rate, driven by
differences in baseline characteristics, there was no difference
in heart failure–related hospitalizations.

An important observation that merits further attention is the
high number of patients with bioimpedance-only alerts who
were contacted and given heart failure education only without
any additional interventions. This may indicate a high sensitivity
but low specificity of these alerts to detect emerging congestion
as well as the existence of a temporal lag between a
bioimpedance alert and clinical manifestation of heart failure
worsening [5,7-12,19-21]. Therefore, a possible explanation for


the rather low number of additional interventions could be that
due to these bioimpedance alerts, patients are contacted in the
early phase of emerging congestion. By the fact that patients
are contacted and general heart failure education is repeated, it
is possible that their perception of disease awareness strengthens
(ie, importance of fluid and salt restriction, heart failure
medication intake, and physical activity), avoiding further
worsening of congestion.

The updated OptiVol 2.0 algorithm triggered significantly fewer
bioimpedance alerts than the other two bioimpedance
algorithms. This corresponds to literature, where a 40% decrease
in unexplained bioimpedance alerts was observed [17].
However, no changes in intervention strategy or impact on
clinical outcome compared to the other bioimpedance algorithms
was observed. Although improvements to bioimpedance
algorithms have already been made, this could still indicate that
intrathoracic impedance is currently wrongly measured, handled,
or interpreted. In the majority of cases, the bioimpedance alarm
threshold is set to default. These thresholds should be
individually adjusted in order to improve sensitivity and
specificity rates, as suggested by previous research [7,8,15].
Another possibility to improve intrathoracic impedance
measurements is controlling the circumstances in which
measurements are performed. Currently, measurements are
performed under different circumstances throughout the day.
Since bioimpedance measurements are also influenced by
motion and body posture, reliability could be improved by a
lower number of measurements that are all performed under the
same posture (eg, during the night when lying in a particular
posture). Finally, instead of alerts triggered by bioimpedance
crossings alone, integration with other parameters currently
monitored by implantable electrical devices (eg, patient activity,
heart rate variability, average ventricular rate) will provide a
more efficient tool to predict heart failure worsening [18].

Patients with a CIED[+] showed a lower overall survival rate.
However, this difference can be explained by differences in
baseline characteristics between both groups rather than the
presence of a bioimpedance algorithm. Indeed, multivariate
analysis indicated a significant hazard ratio for age, ejection
fraction, and QRS time and a nonsignificant adjusted hazard
ratio for the presence of a bioimpedance algorithm in the CIED.
Concerning heart failure–related hospitalizations, both groups
showed similar results. This could indicate a potential benefit
of bioimpedance algorithms on clinical outcome since, based
on baseline characteristics, one would expect a higher number

of heart failure–related hospitalizations in the CIED[+] group.
This could mean that the high frequency of heart failure
education provided in cases of a bioimpedance alert could have
prevented heart failure–related hospitalizations.

When reviewing available literature, it is clear that the success
rate of remote monitoring is strongly dependent on optimal
workflow with standardized protocols and appropriate feedback
loops. The DOT-HF (Diagnostic Outcome Trial in Heart Failure)
trial [9], where patients received an audible alert in case of a
bioimpedance crossing, showed that providing wrong feedback
can even induce an increase in hospital admissions. In the
LIMIT-CHF (Lung Impedance Monitoring in Treatment of
Chronic Heart Failure) trial [15], bioimpedance alerts triggered
empirical changes in diuretic dose, which did not significantly
prevent heart failure–related hospitalizations. Moreover, the
OPTILINK-HF (Optimization of Heart Failure Management
using OptiVol Fluid Status Monitoring and CareLink) trial [12]
employed a similar approach of protocol-driven remote
monitoring as used in our center and reported no significant
improvements in clinical outcome. Shortcomings in this trial
were the single-parameter follow-up, suboptimal data
transmission, and the absence of a centralized monitoring team.
In our study, a multiparameter approach was used and all
incoming alerts were handled in a standardized way. In addition,
remote follow-up in our center is performed by a small team of
dedicated heart failure nurses who have close personal contact
with the patients. Furthermore, our nurses are operating from
inside our tertiary care center and hence have daily contact with
the treating physician. This approach facilitates protocol
standardization and has already been shown to be effective in
the IN-TIME (Influence of Home Monitoring on Mortality and
Morbidity in Heart Failure Patients With Impaired Left
Ventricular Function) trial [22]. It is clear that there is not just
one remote monitoring approach, but a high variability exists
and hence each approach needs to be assessed on its individual
merit. In our study, the question remains to what extent
reinforcement of heart failure education is crucial in remote
bioimpedance monitoring and impacts clinical outcome.

##### Study Limitations

This study should be interpreted in the light of some limitations.
First, this is a relatively small single center observational registry
study with classic limitations associated with this type of study
design, thereby making the study results mainly
hypothesis-generating. Although a nonsignificant adjusted

hazard ratio was obtained for the presence of bioimpedance
algorithms in the CIED, a potential power problem can be
present in the all-cause survival analysis due to the rather low
sample size and low event rates. Next, since the presence of a
bioimpedance algorithm is dependent on CIED manufacturer
and is therefore random, our study is a nonrandomized clinical
trial. A possible selection bias could be present due to the device
indication. However, the assignment of the type of CIED that
was implanted was solely based on the device’s therapeutic
capabilities (right ventricular pacing, biventricular pacing, and
antitachycardia treatment) and was left to the discretion of the
treating physician. Other diagnostic information, for example,
the presence or absence of bioimpedance algorithms in the
CIED, was not taken into consideration when assigning the
CIED type or brand. In the CIED[+] population, more CRT-D
devices are present since these devices were first equipped with
bioimpedance algorithms. In general, patients who receive a
CRT-D device have more advanced heart failure than patients
who receive an ICD device. This can explain the differences in
baseline characteristics (eg, older population with a lower left
ventricular ejection fraction and broader QRS complex). Finally,
study inclusion was based on voluntary participation to remote
follow-up. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility that
enrolled patients were more motivated for follow-up with better
expected compliance to therapies. However, the majority (>95%)
of patients agree to remote follow-up, reducing the risk for
selection bias.

##### Conclusion

In patients with a CIED with a bioimpedance algorithm,
bioimpedance alerts constitute almost half (42%) of incoming
alerts when turned on during remote follow-up. Repeating
general heart failure education by phone sufficed in 75% of
cases, and an additional intervention was performed in 16% of
cases. The high frequency of heart failure education that was
provided could have contributed to fewer heart failure–related
hospitalizations despite significant differences in baseline
characteristics. Future trials are needed to verify whether
bioimpedance algorithms can only be used to trigger heart failure
education or if they have an intrinsic value to change treatment
strategies. In addition, future improvements in the way
bioimpedance is measured, handled, or interpreted could further
increase its clinical relevance. Before bioimpedance
measurements can be widely implemented in clinical practice,
larger multicenter randomized controlled trials are required.
