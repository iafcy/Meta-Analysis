Abstract
Background We aimed to investigate whether patient self-evaluated symptoms transmitted via Internet is feasible between
planned visits to provide an early management of fever and neutropenia induced by chemotherapy, and if it can reduce hospitalizations for severe neutropenia.
Methods Patients who received a chemotherapy regimen with an overall risk of febrile neutropenia ≥ 20% had to report daily
temperature between physician planned visits using a web application. Fever and clinical signs of seriousness were reported to the
physician (if some criteria were fulfilled in a specific algorithm) via automatic email notifications by the web application. Patients
could be hospitalized quickly or could take over at home, make blood count, and take predefined oral antibiotics if indicated.
Primary outcome was patient’s compliance and satisfaction. The number and the cost of hospitalization were also assessed and
compared with an historical cohort of patients with similar clinical conditions and treatment.
Results Among the 41 patients included, 36 (87.8%) used the web application with 88% of daily compliance and 90% (28/33) of
satisfaction. One patient (2.7%) had planned hospitalization after the web application alert. In the historical cohort, the rate of
unplanned hospitalization for febrile neutropenia was 17% (6 patients) and 2.7% (1 patient) in users of the web application
cohort. The cumulative cost of hospitalization for neutropenia was USD 28,827 in the historical cohort and USD 6563 in the web
application cohort.
Conclusion Web-mediated follow-up of febrile neutropenia is feasible. It led to high patient satisfaction, high compliance, and a
possible reduction of the number and the cost of hospitalizations.

## Introduction

Patient self-reported outcomes in oncology recently received a
growing interest for their potential to improve the follow-up of
symptoms and the efficiency of clinical care [1, 2]. The healthrelated qualify of life was thus improved in patients whose
symptoms were monitored during routine cancer care [3, 4].

Recent prospective randomized studies also suggested survival improvement in cancer patients using web-mediated follow-up called Moovcare™ which allowed early detection of
relapses and dangerous medical conditions [5–8].
Febrile neutropenia is defined as fever superior or equal to
38.3 °C and an absolute neutrophil count inferior to
1000/mm[3]. It is a frequent and potentially severe complication
of chemotherapy [9]. It requires rapid management using antimicrobial agents according to guidelines [10]. Patients are
usually informed by the physician that febrile neutropenia is
possible and that they should call him if fever occurs.
However, communication of symptoms and the assessment
of severity are not optimal. Although primary prophylaxis
with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) reduces
febrile neutropenia incidence by 46% in a meta-analysis, this
event leads to unplanned and expensive hospitalizations and
lethal complications subsequently to the delay in fever management in some patients [9, 11–13].


-----

Web-mediated follow-up may optimize communication of
symptoms and blood results between patients and physicians
and is able to tailor and accelerate the process of febrile neutropenia management in patients under high-risk chemotherapy. We report the results of a prospective trial designed to assess
the feasibility of a follow-up by a web application. The compliance and the satisfaction of patients using a web application
with a specific algorithm triggering email notifications to physicians, as well as the number and the cost of hospitalization
related to febrile neutropenia management were assessed.

## Materials and methods

### Study design and population

In this study, eligible patients had histologically proven solid
or hematological tumors regardless of the location (except
brain tumor) and should receive chemotherapy (any indications) associated with overall risk of febrile neutropenia greater than or equal to 20%. Overall risk was defined using NCCN
guidelines and took into account chemotherapy regimen and
patient risk factors such as age 65 and older, previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, poor performance status, or poor renal or liver function [14]. Patients with brain metastasis or
dementia were excluded. Chemotherapy duration must be inferior to 4 months, that is, four to six cycles. Performance
status was 0 to 3 and patients must have had Internet familiarity and prior email experience. Prophylactic G-CSF was
allowed and provided to all patients as well as for treatment
of febrile neutropenia if needed. All patients provided their
written informed consent. The study was conducted by the
Integrated Center for Oncology (ICO, Angers, France) which
gathered the data using an electronic case report form (eCRF).

### Web-mediated follow-up

We designed a web application allowing patients to send daily
their temperature and self-evaluate symptoms to the physician
between planned visits via Internet using a smartphone or a
personal computer. Five days after the day 0 of the first cycle
of chemotherapy administration, the use of the application
was initiated and temperature measurement was performed
at home by an infrared forehead thermometer provided as part
of the study, in a systematic manner once daily at the same
time of day and in case of unexplained fatigue. An online form
was also completed by the patient looking for clinical signs of
seriousness to assess condition if fever was superior or equal
to 38.3 °C. Clinical signs of seriousness were as follows: fever
superior to 39.5 °C, the presence of shivers, a brutal asthenia, a
decrease in urine volume, an important breathlessness, pain
when swallowing, or blood in mouth. If some criteria were


fulfilled in a specific algorithm, automatic email notifications
were triggered to the physician by the web application. For
example, if one clinical sign of seriousness was reported by
the patient, a notification was sent to medical team which
called the patient by phone. The patient could then have quick
planned hospitalization (that is, without a consultation or a
passage at the emergency unit). Without seriousness, the patient could stay at home and the application requested him to
make blood count, then to send results of neutrophil count
using application and to take predefined oral antibiotics if
neutrophil count was inferior to 1000/mm[3]. New notification
to medical team occurred if new clinical signs of seriousness
occurred or if fever was reported despite 2 days with antibiotics. Planned hospitalization could then be decided by the
physician. The physician performed an initial 5-min demonstration of the use of software after enrollment and an email
with instructions and password was then sent to patients. The
prototype of the application used in this study had no automatic reminder to uncompliant patient Fig. 1.

### Outcome assessment

The first primary outcome was patient compliance rate. The
longitudinal compliance rate was computed as the ratio between the number of forms filled in by the participants and
the theoretical maximal number of forms that the patients
included should have filled in between the fifth day of the first
cycle of chemotherapy and 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy. The second was the opinion of the patients regarding this

application which was assessed through a satisfaction survey
completed just after the last cycle of chemotherapy. The questions were:

a. BDo you feel reassured when monitored by your oncologist using the Bioconnect follow-up?^
b. BDo you feel anxious when you fill in the form each
day?^
c. BDo you consider the Bioconnect web application easy to
use?^
d. BDo you feel better monitored by your oncologist with
this application?^
e. BAre you generally satisfied with this application?^ The
secondary endpoints were the number and cost of unplanned emergency hospitalizations for febrile
neutropenia.

Patients were followed from the fifth day after the day 0 of
the first chemotherapy cycle to the end of the last cycle, that is,
3 weeks after the final cycle of chemotherapy.
An analysis of the primary endpoints was computed after
41 patients’ enrollment in intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis and in
a per-protocol analysis. Patients who did never use the application before a first event were kept in ITT analysis and removed from per-protocol analysis (5 patients).
Accuracy rates of this exploratory analysis were determined according to our previous feasibility results [5–7]. To
deserve further development, the satisfaction and the longitudinal compliance had to be greater than 75% (lower bound of
CI 95 equal to 60%).
In experimental cohort, patients were hospitalized if clinical signs of seriousness were reported by a patient during a
phone call from the physician who received blood count
which showed neutropenia or if fever was reported by a patient despite 2 days of antibiotics.
A comparison of the rate and cost of unplanned emergency
hospitalizations in the experimental cohort was made with an
historical cohort of 36 consecutive patients who were treated
in the same center and followed between May 2015 and
September 2015, that is, just before the initiation of the study.
Costs of hospitalization were directly reported from the electronic medical record of the medical centers. It contained daily
cost of stays and delivered treatments.
Patients must have had similar clinical conditions and they
all had G-CSF prophylaxis and treatments. No significant
changes between chemotherapy regimens occurred between
the two periods and between the two cohorts. This study was

## Results

### Patients characteristics

Between September 2015 and August 2016, 41 patients were
enrolled in this prospective study. No patient explicitly canceled his participation to the study. Five patients were deemed
ineligible after inclusion in per-protocol analysis because they
did not use application subsequently to a lack of Internet connection or a wish not to use it. They had routine monitoring.
Patients who had at least one connection to the application
before any event were assessable for user (per-protocol)
analysis.
Patient characteristics of the patients in ITT and perprotocol analyses are reported in Table 1.

### Primary outcomes

Daily longitudinal compliance rate of web application
use was 81.2% (interquartile range = 46.2–100%, μ =
67.2%, σ = 35.8) for the intent-to-treat patient’s cohort
and 88.4% (interquartile range = 53.2–100%, μ = 76.5%,
σ = 27) in user cohort (per-protocol analysis).
Satisfaction of patients was observed in 90.3% of the
31 patients who filled out the form (Table 2). They
considered the application easy to use (83.9%), and felt
better monitored by their oncologist (80.6%). Ten users
did not fill out the satisfaction form: 5 patients did
never connect, 1 was lost of follow-up after chemotherapy, 3 had cancer complications and wished not to fill it
out, and 1 forgot it despite 3 recall.

### Secondary outcomes

In intent-to-treat population (41 patients), 2 patients had grade
4 febrile neutropenia and required hospitalization.
One (2.7%) had a planned hospitalization, that is, an hospitalization preceded by a notification of the application to the
physician who contacted the patient by phone and organized
an hospitalization in a medical service without going in an
emergency room. This hospitalization costed USD 3328 and
lasted 4 days.
The second one (2.7%) had a non-planned emergency hospitalization which costed USD 3235 and lasted 1 day.
Therefore, the cumulative cost of these hospitalizations
was USD 6563 with a mean cost per patient for this cohort of
USD 182.

Two other patients had fever without neutropenia

In the historical cohort with routine follow-up, the rate of
unplanned emergency hospitalizations for febrile neutropenia
was 17% (6 patients, one episode per patient), and the mean

chemotherapy having high risk of febrile neutropenia. It
showed satisfaction in almost all users and a high longitudinal
compliance rate. One (2.7%) unplanned hospitalization was
observed in users, although 17% were reported in an historical
cohort of patients having similar disease and characteristics.
Web-mediated follow-up was already assessed in prospective trials and showed benefit in quality of life and in survival,
as well as cost-effectiveness [2, 3, 7, 8].
We already showed a high level of satisfaction (100%) and
compliance (84%) with another web application for relapse
detection of lung cancer and kept the same friendly interface
for Bioconnect web application prototype [7]. This may explain the high compliance level in this study, although the
daily connection could have reduced patient adherence compared to a weekly connection in lung cancer trial.
The low cost of hospitalization for severe hematological conditions in our trial may be subsequent to an
earlier management of fever allowed by the web application which sent notifications in real time to both physician and patient in order to manage him at the first
symptoms of febrile neutropenia. This may lead to reduce the cost and the duration of hospitalizations and
potentially severe sepsis complications. As recently reported, the clinical burden induced by chemotherapyinduced febrile neutropenia is still considerable. In
France, using the National Health Insurance (PMSI) database, which includes all hospitalizations occurring annually, the rate of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia
in newly diagnosed patients was of 7.4% in 2010–2011,
with a mortality rate of 7%. In the USA, the total cost
of cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations was $2.3
billion for adults and $439 million for children.
Cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations accounted
for 5.2% of all cancer-related hospitalizations and
8.3% of all cancer-related hospitalization costs. For
adults, the mean length of stay for cancer-related neutropenia
hospitalizations was 9.6 days, with a mean hospital cost of
$24,770 per stay. For children, the mean length of stay for
cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations was 8.5 days, with
a mean hospital cost of $26,000 per stay [13]. We found the
same mean length of stay in hospital in our historical cohort


(9 days) and a shorter in experimental arm (1 and 4 days),
suggesting a potential benefit of our approach on hospitalization duration.
We observed a low rate of FN in study cohort.
Unfortunately, we cannot know if duration of G-CSF prophylaxis was different between historical and study cohorts. The
difference of FN rate might be subsequent to the heterogeneity
of population on other parameters than those selected for population characteristics description.
As this study is exploratory, interpretation has limitations
subsequently to the low number of patients, and the comparison with an historical cohort of patients. However, it provides
a rationale for the development of a larger multicentric trial.
We are working on two large international studies in which
Bioconnect will be integrated with other patient-reported outcome modules (such as Moovcare ™) to follow patients during all the cancer management pathway including treatment
phase (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy) and
to detect relapse and other clinical events. One will be randomized and will focus on quality of life and costeffectiveness for good prognosis cancers, and the other will
focus on survival and cost-effectiveness and will not be randomized. In both trials, the cost of hospitalization for FN will
be exhaustively reported for several countries. This approach
is a starting point for incorporating new technology into the
management of patients with chemotherapy with which they
can give and receive continuous feedback between visits to
their physician.
