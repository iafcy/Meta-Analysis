###### Aims Hospital admissions are frequently preceded by increased pulmonary congestion in heart failure (HF) patients. This
study evaluated whether early automated fluid status alert notification via telemedicine improves outcome in HF
patients.

###### Methods Patients recently implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) with or without cardiac resynchroniza- and results tion therapy were eligible if one of three conditions was met: prior HF hospitalization, recent diuretic treatment, or

recent brain natriuretic peptide increase. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to have fluid status alerts automatically
transmitted as inaudible text message alerts to the responsible physician or to receive standard care (no alerts). In the
intervention arm, following a telemedicine alert, a protocol-specified algorithm with remote review of device data and
telephone contact was prescribed to assess symptoms and initiate treatment. The primary endpoint was a composite of
all-cause death and cardiovascular hospitalization. We followed 1002 patients for an average of 1.9 years. The primary
endpoint occurred in 227 patients (45.0%) in the intervention arm and 239 patients (48.1%) in the control arm [hazard
ratio, HR, 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72–1.04; P ¼ 0.13]. There were 59 (11.7%) deaths in the intervention
arm and 63 (12.7%) in the control arm (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62–1.28; P ¼ 0.52). Twenty-four per cent of alerts were not
transmitted and 30% were followed by a medical intervention.

###### Conclusion Among ICD patients with advanced HF, fluid status telemedicine alerts did not significantly improve outcomes.
Adherence to treatment protocols by physicians and patients might be challenge for further developments in the
telemedicine field.

## Introduction

Heart failure is a highly prevalent syndrome, affecting over 23 million
people worldwide.[1][,][2] Although improvements have been made in
the treatment of chronic HF, morbidity, and mortality remain
high.[3] In ≏90% of cases, patients hospitalized for HF present with
pulmonary congestion with increased filling pressures and volume
overload[4] often preceding the development of symptoms and
hospitalization.[5][,][6] A variety of strategies has been tested leveraging
implantable technologies for the early detection of congestion, thus
enabling intervention in an effort to avoid hospitalization.[5] [–] [9] However, these attempts have had mixed results. In a previous study,
intrathoracic impedance monitoring with audible patient alert did
not reduce all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations in the management of patients with HF.[7] In fact, using this diagnostic information
together with an alert audible for patients resulted in more hospitalizations and outpatient visits. A proportion of hospitalizations may
well have been driven mainly by the audible alert itself and the need
of patients (and also physicians) to resolve the situation even in the
absence of signs and symptoms for HF deterioration. Recently, findings from the IN-TIME study[10] showed a modest benefit in a clinical
score consisting of all-cause death, overnight hospitalization for HF,
change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, and
change in patient global self-assessment. However, a recent systematic meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials on remote
monitoring of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients
involving 6469 patients failed to show effects on all-cause mortality,
cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization.[11]

The OptiLink HF (Optimization of Heart Failure Management
using OptiVol[TM] Fluid Status Monitoring and CareLink[TM]) study
was designed to investigate whether early detection of pulmonary
congestion via telemedicine with a defined intervention algorithm
reduces all-cause death and cardiovascular (CV) hospitalizations in
chronic HF patients with an ICD compared with patients without
telemedicine access.


(CRT-D) within the preceding 3–21 days according to guideline recommended indications.[12] Of note, CRT-D patients needed QRS ≥120 ms
and left ventricular end diastolic diameter ≥55 mm. All patients received a Medtronic ICD or CRT-D with the capability of intrathoracic
fluid status monitoring and telemedicine functionality. In addition, one
of three conditions had to be met: either HF hospitalization within
the last 12 months, intravenous/oral diuretic treatment within 30
days, or increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal-pro-BNP
within 30 days. Cut-offs were .400 pg/mL for BNP and .450 pg/mL in
patients,50 years, .900 pg/mL in patients 50–75 years, .1800 pg/mL
in patients .75 years for N-terminal-pro-BNP. Patients with chronic
renal failure requiring dialysis, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, or with planned heart transplantation were ineligible.
The study design required follow-up visits every 6 months after randomization up to 18 months. In the first quarter of 2011, during the
course of the trial, the protocol was revised to extend follow-up until
all participants had reached the 18-month visit. The revision was at
the request of the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) due to slower
than anticipated enrolment.
The executive committee designed and oversaw the conduct of
the trial and data analysis in collaboration with the sponsor, Medtronic.
The trial was monitored by an independent DSMB. Data were collected
and managed by the sponsor and analysed according to a pre-specified
statistical analysis plan. The trial protocol was approved by the ethical
committees of the individual centres and is available along with the statistical analysis plan at eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org. All patients provided
written informed consent prior to enrolment into the trial.

##### Randomization


## Methods

##### Study design and participants

Optimization of Heart Failure Management using OptiVol[TM] Fluid Status
Monitoring and CareLink[TM] was a prospective, multi-centre, randomized, and unblinded study conducted in Germany. Eligible patients
were in stable NYHA class II or III HF, left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) ≤35%, and received a market-released ICD (newly implanted or
replacement) with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy


Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to have their devices set to automatically transmit fluid index telemedicine alerts or to not transmit
alerts. The randomization was done using a centralized, concealed process implemented by the sponsor, and stratified by NYHA class, history
of atrial fibrillation (AF), history of ventricular arrhythmia (VT/VF), and
ischaemic status. The random allocation sequence with random blocks
of four was computer generated. Control patients were not set up in the
telemonitoring system so that no accidental crossover could occur.

##### Intervention algorithm

As described previously,[13] patients randomized to the intervention arm
had telemedicine alerts enabled, triggered by intrathoracic fluid index
threshold crossing (FTC), which was programmed at the investigator’s
discretion. The fluid status monitoring algorithm detects changes in
thoracic impedance resulting from accumulation of intrathoracic fluid
as an early sign of developing cardiac decompensation.
Alerts were automatically transmitted via text message to the responsible physician but were ‘silent’ (inaudible) to the patient. Following
a telemedicine alert, a protocol-specified intervention algorithm, as previously shown in Figure 2 in the OptiLink HF design paper[13] was followed


-----

with follow-up actions being documented on Telemedicine Alert Evaluation Forms (TAEFs). Briefly, the HF-specific device data were reviewed
remotely, and the patient was contacted within 2 working days by phone
to evaluate condition and HF status and to take appropriate measures.
Up to 3 further telemedicine-guided remote contacts with review of device data and HF status were scheduled in the 2 weeks following the
alert. When contacting patients on the basis of telemonitored data,
the investigators used a standardized telephone interview to establish
whether the patient’s overall condition had worsened and whether
the patient was regularly taking prescribed drugs. Patients randomized
to the control group did not have access to telemonitoring, although
device data could be accessed in the clinic.

##### Study outcomes


The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and CV hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, composite of all-cause death and HF hospitalization,
CV hospitalizations, HF hospitalizations, and all-cause hospitalizations
during follow-up.
An Event Adjudication Committee, blinded to the treatment arms, adjudicated all reported events and deaths. For all events and deaths, a final
consensus classification was reached. Analyses used adjudication results.

##### Statistical analysis


implanted with a single-chamber ICD (23.3%), dual-chamber ICD
(14.2%), or CRT-D (62.6%) prior to enrolment. Mean age was
66.3 + 10.4 years, 79.7% were male. Patients’ demographics and
clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Based upon observed
imbalances in gender and history of HF hospitalization, formal statistical testing was done, which confirmed the imbalances. I.V. diuretics prior to randomization was slightly imbalanced.
Patients were followed for 22.9 + 18.2 months. Figure 1 shows
the study flow in CONSORT format. All patients received treatment
per their randomized allocation, with 505 receiving an alert enabled
system (intervention) and 497 receiving an alert disabled system (control). The number of patients with signed re-consent and long-term
data follow-up available was 175 (34.6%) in the intervention arm and
167 (33.6%) in the control arm. The proportion of patients with
extended follow-up was similar between groups. Nonetheless,
some selection bias cannot be ruled out, and caution must be used
upon interpretation of data beyond 18 months of follow-up. All
1002 patients were included in the analysis per intention-to-treat.

#### Endpoints


Statistical analysis was pre-specified in the study protocol and a statistical analysis plan. Freedom from event is illustrated with Kaplan–Meier
curves and compared between randomized arms with a stratified logrank test. The stratifying variables are device type (ICD vs. CRT-D)
and the variables used in the randomization process, i.e. NYHA class,
ischaemic, or non-ischaemic HF aetiology, history of VT/VF, and history
of AF. Hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) are reported from stratified Cox proportional-hazards regression
models. All HR estimates are for the intervention arm relative to the
control arm. Subgroup analyses were performed with use of stratified
cox proportional-hazards regression models, having treatment group
and a baseline factor as covariates along with their interaction term.
The rate of HF hospitalization per patient per year was analysed through
a negative binomial regression with only treatment arm as covariate and
log (follow-up time) as an offset variable to account for different followup time among the subjects.
As re-consent was optional, long-term follow-up data were included
in analysis only after poolability assessment. Patients in the primary objective analysis cohort who re-consented and were followed beyond 18
months are compared against those who survived to 18 months but did
not re-consent and exited at the 18-month visit with respect to gender
and the above mentioned stratifying variables. Fisher’s exact test was
performed for each of these characteristics.
The study was designed to include 1000 patients to ensure 80%
power when the event-free rate at 18 months would be 72% in the control arm and 80.4% in the intervention arm. Two interim analyses were
scheduled when 33 and 67% of the 238 expected primary endpoints occurred, with a-levels of 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively. The final analysis
was done with a ¼ 0.0495 to compensate for the interim analyses,
maintaining total type I error at 0.05.

## Results


#### Study patients

From 28 October 2008 through 29 April 2013, a total of 1002 subjects were recruited from 65 centres in Germany. Patients had
NYHA class II (19.4%) or III (80.6%) HF symptoms and were


In the intervention arm, 227 patients reached the primary endpoint,
compared with 239 in the control arm (Table 2). Event-free survival
at (18, 24) months was (59.0%, 52.7%) for the intervention group
and (56.1%, 47.8%) for the control group, respectively (HR, 0.87;
95% CI, 0.72–1.04; P ¼ 0.13). Figure 2A displays the survival curves
by treatment arm for the primary endpoint, which were drawn
when the number of patients at risk was at least 50 to avoid misinterpretation of estimated survival probabilities that are based on few
patients at risk. Two interim analyses were performed as planned.
The stopping boundaries were not crossed and the DSMB recommended continuation of the study.
There were 59 deaths in the intervention arm and 63 in the control arm. All-cause death incidences at (18, 24) months were (6.3%,
11.0%) and (8.5%, 15.7%) respectively (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62–1.28;
P ¼ 0.52). Figure 2B displays the survival curves by treatment arm for
all-cause death.
There were 435 patients who experienced a total of 928 CV hospitalizations post-randomization; 495 events in 214 patients in the
intervention arm and 433 events in 221 patients in the control
arm. Time to first CV hospitalization was not different between
the treatment and control groups (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73–1.08;
P ¼ 0.22). Figure 2C displays the survival curves by treatment arm
for the CV hospitalization endpoint.
Post-randomization HF hospitalizations were also similar between the treatment arms. More specifically, the survival probabilities from HF hospitalization at (18, 24) months were (79.2%, 75.4%)
in the intervention arm, and (76.2%, 71.8%) in the control arm (HR,
0.87; 95% CI, 0.67–1.12; P ¼ 0.28). Intervention vs. Control HR estimates for primary and secondary objectives are shown in Table 2.
The number of HF hospitalizations per patient per year as estimated
from a negative binomial regression model was 0.24 for the Intervention arm and 0.30 for the Control arm (P ¼ 0.20).

#### Subgroup analysis


Figure 3 presents the intervention vs. control HRs and 95% CIs for

for the interaction term between the baseline factor and treatment

group. There were no statistically significant differences in the effect
of intervention on event-free survival for the primary endpoint
according to the baseline factors evaluated.

#### Post hoc analyses


As there was an imbalance between the two arms with respect to a
history of HF hospitalization in the 12 months prior to randomization, the analysis was repeated adjusting for HF hospitalization and
i.v.-diuretics prior to randomization (added as covariates to the
stratified Cox regression models). None of the endpoints had a
significant HR, except for the composite of HF hospitalization and
all-cause death (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61–0.98; P ¼ 0.03).

#### Alerts and compliance


In the investigational arm, there were 1748 FTCs in 406 patients
(80.4%). Of these, 1324 (75.7%) generated an alert that was


wirelessly transmitted to the treating physician through telemedicine. Follow-up actions are illustrated in Figure 4. They were documented on TAEFs in 1128 cases (64.5% of FTCs). The
protocol-required telephone contact took place for 1074 TAEFs
(95.2%). For 983 cases (87.1%) at least one remote check of device
data was done, with 1, 2, and 3 interrogations in 226 (20.0%), 264
(23.4%), and 493 (43.7%) cases, respectively. At least one subsequent telephone call with the patient took place in 995 cases
(88.2%), with 1, 2, and 3 subsequent telephone calls in 220
(19.5%), 272 (24.1%), and 503 (44.6%) cases, respectively.
Patients reported worsening HF symptoms at any of the telephone contacts for 425 (37.7%) of the TAEFs. For 529 (46.9%)
TAEFs, medical actions were taken, including medication changes
for 455 (40.3%). Therefore, of the 1748 FTCs, 30.3% led to a medical action and 26.0% altered medication. Taking into account HF
medication changes which occurred within 30 days after a TAEF,

algorithms.
TAEFs were followed by hospitalizations adjudicated as
CV-related within 30 days of an FTC in 72 cases (6.4% of 1128
TAEFs). In total, there were 110 CV hospitalizations within 30
days of an FTC for the intervention arm. Thus 38 CV hospitalizations within 30 days of an FTC occurred which were not followed
with a TAEF.


Device data from in-office visits were collected in both arms. In
the intervention arm, data from remote telemedicine interrogations
were also collected, which led to high completeness of device data
in the intervention arm compared with moderate completeness in
the control arm. Out of 554 CV hospitalizations or deaths in the
intervention arm, 118 (21.3%) were preceded by a documented
FTC in the preceding 30 days. In the control arm, this was the
case for 56 of 496 events (11.3%). Restricting to events with complete device data in the 30 preceding days, 104 of 374 endpoints in

the intervention arm (27.8%) had an FTC in the 30 preceding days; in
the control arm, this occurred for 50 of 228 events (21.9%). These
percentages were not statistically different (P ¼ 0.12).


Further post hoc analyses were done to evaluate the prognostic
importance of early fluid threshold crossings (FTC), similar to the
analysis reported by Tang et al.[14] Results are presented in


-----

[Supplementary material online. In brief, early FTCs are associated](http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehw099/-/DC1)
with an increased incidence of primary endpoints .6 months after
enrolment (P ¼ 0.0019). The study intervention was associated
with a lower late event incidence in those patients that remained
free from endpoints and FTCs in the first 6 months (P ¼ 0.035).
Thus, the intervention does not appear to prevent repeat events
in patients that have an early event, but only in patients that are
event-free at 6 months.

## Discussion


In the OptiLink HF study, use of a specific intrathoracic impedance
and telemedicine-based HF disease management strategy in patients
with moderate-to-severe HF, severe left ventricular dysfunction,
and prior implantation of an ICD/CRT-D device did not significantly
reduce the rate of all-cause death or CV hospitalization compared
with standard clinical assessment. In addition, the secondary morbidity
and mortality outcomes did not show a statistically significant benefit.
The effects of telemonitoring within OptiLink HF depended upon
multiple factors including the performance of the device, successful
transmission of FTCs, physician follow-up, subsequent intervention/
medical action, and patient adherence. The intrathoracic impedance
monitoring feature has been previously evaluated, demonstrating


high correlation to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and net
fluid loss during hospitalization[15] but with wide ranging sensitivity
(20.7–76.9%) and positive prediction (4.7–60%) to HF hospitalization.[15][,][16] Tang et al.[14] reported an association of FTC with a 2-fold
increase risk in mortality. The strategy to use implantable technology for the management of fluid congestion requires medical action
to be taken, potentially in the absence of symptoms. Within OptiLink HF, the proportion of events with prior FTC is highest for
HF-related hospitalizations, as expected. However, only one in
three HF hospitalizations had a prior crossing. Consequently,
assuming crossings .30 days before hospitalization are unrelated
to the event, at best, one in three HF hospitalizations could have
been prevented by the OptiLink HF intervention.
While the OptiLink HF study used a prescriptive intervention
algorithm, medication changes, and medical actions were at the
discretion of the investigator. We observed that 30% of FTCs led
to medical action and 26% to medication change. More specifically,
on average, patients in the intervention arm had 0.37 HF medication
changes per 6 months as a result of TAEF algorithms. Conversely,
Adamson et al.[17] reported an average incremental rate of 5.8 devicedriven medication changes per 6 months for reduced EF patients
with daily ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure monitoring
(9.5 changes in the treatment vs. 3.7 in the control subjects).


-----

From the analyses performed it must be concluded that the rate
of telemonitor-guided medical intervention was low. Intervention
following an FTC was 30%, and there was no record of any intervention in 38 of the 110 CV hospitalizations which occurred within
30 days of an FTC. Since patients and investigators were carefully
introduced to the use of the device and the application of the predefined treatment algorithm at entry and during follow-up of the
study, the reported intervention rate may more closely reflect
real life practice, highlighting challenges associated with reliable
data transmission and confidence in fluid index algorithms.
The success of telemonitoring is dependent on both optimal
physician reaction to alerts and optimal monitoring of patients.
Centralized monitoring with an associated call centre could have
led to an improvement of these conditions. However, OptiLink
HF was designed to create conditions, which are practical and
affordable in real life. Therefore, it was decided not to use a central
monitoring unit but to rely on appropriate clinical response to
telemonitoring. The low rate of telemonitor-guided medical intervention may reflect the need to invest additional effort into educational activities to train physicians to react to telemonitoring data,
eventually also in patients before symtoms develop. In addition,
efforts to improve the technology of data transmission for telemonitoring are warranted. Results from our trial highlighted these
challenges in telemonitor-guided HF disease management.
A limitation of the study was the optional extended follow-up
beyond 18 months. However, no differences in baseline characteristics were observed between patients with follow-up completed at


18 months compared with patients continued in the study. Another
limitation is the potential heterogenous treatment of the intervention patients, with some physicians being more aggressive than
others in responding to alerts. However, this phenomenon is
inflicted in every trial where physicians must react according to their
usual medical practice. Also, as the study was only conducted
in Germany the results may not apply to several other regions. In
addition, there was an inability to mask patients and investigators
to the treatment allocation inherent with the technology used
creating a potential bias.
In conclusion, OptiLink HF did not show a benefit of early detection
of congestion using a remote fluid index alert system on the composite
of all-cause death and cardiovascular hospitalizations. Physician and
patient adherence to telemonitoring systems, which are practical and
affordable, represents a major and underappreciated challenge.
