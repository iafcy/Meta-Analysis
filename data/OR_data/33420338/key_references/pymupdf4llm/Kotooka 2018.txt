**Abstract**
Home telemonitoring is becoming more important to home medical care for patients with heart failure. Since there are no
data on home telemonitoring for Japanese patients with heart failure, we investigated its effect on cardiovascular outcomes.
The HOMES-HF study was the first multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to elucidate the effectiveness of home telemonitoring of physiological data, such as body weight, blood pressure, and pulse rate, for Japanese patients
with heart failure (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry 000006839). The primary end-point was a composite of all-cause death or
rehospitalization due to worsening heart failure. We analyzed 181 recently hospitalized patients with heart failure who were
randomly assigned to a telemonitoring group (n = 90) or a usual care group (n = 91). The mean follow-up period was 15
(range 0–31) months. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary end-point between groups [hazard ratio
(HR), 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.548–1.648; p = 0.572]. Home telemonitoring for Japanese patients with heart
failure was feasible; however, beneficial effects in addition to those of usual care were not demonstrated. Further investigation
of more patients with severe heart failure, participation of home medical care providers, and use of a more integrated home
telemonitoring system emphasizing communication as well as monitoring of symptoms and physiological data are required.

### Introduction

Since the prevalence of heart failure (HF) increases with
age, it is estimated that the number of elderly patients with
HF in Japan will peak in 2035 [1] and will decrease thereafter in association with a falling birth rate and depopulation. High rehospitalization rates, long hospital stays, and
high medical costs impose an increasing burden on such
patients, their families, health care providers, and society.

Not only Japan, but also many developed countries face the
same issues. As a countermeasure, the Japanese government
has recently decided to shift the main healthcare environment from the hospital to the community by 2025. However,
most patients with HF need intensive and specific care; so
there are many obstacles to transferring patients with HF
from cardiologists and hospitals to primary care physicians
and home-healthcare providers. Home telemonitoring is a
promising solution to reduce rehospitalization and mortality
rates [2], despite the negative results of some multicenter,
randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) [3, 4]. The existence of
a subgroup of patients who might benefit from home telemonitoring has been suggested [5]. In that analysis, treatment
effects were significant only for patients with a prior HF
decompensation or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
(ICD) or a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score

of less than 10. However, there are no data regarding the
effectiveness of home telemonitoring in Japanese patients
with HF. Therefore, in this multicenter, prospective RCT,
the Home Telemonitoring Study for Japanese Patients with
Heart Failure (HOMES-HF), we planned that all participants
were hospitalized or recently discharged due to HF decompensation, and screened with the PHQ-9.

### Methods

#### Study population

The protocol of this trial was described previously [6]. In
brief, eligible patients were randomly assigned via a website
to either a telemonitoring group or a usual care group with
a biased-coin minimization method balanced for age (≥ 65
vs < 65 years), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; ≥ 30
vs < 30%), and history of ischemic heart disease (IHD;
IHD vs non-IHD) [7]. The patients and treating physicians,
but not the independent endpoint committee, were aware
of group allocation. The participants were enrolled from
December 2011 to August 2013 and were followed until
August 2014. The intervention was continued to the end of
the follow-up period. Eligible patients were aged 20 years or
older with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional
class II–III HF and were discharged or scheduled to be discharged following admission for acute HF or acute decompensated chronic HF within 30 days of enrolment. The exclusion criteria were as follows: use of an implantable device

[i.e., cardiac pacemaker, ICD/cardiac resynchronization
therapy (CRT), because an alternating-current signal travels
through the body when patients measure their body weight
and body composition on an electronic scale]; hemodialysis
requirement or serum creatinine level ≥ 3.0 mg/dl; severe
liver dysfunction; planned percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting; unable to stand on
a scale safely; limited life expectancy because of malignant
diseases or other causes; high suspicion of severe depression (e.g., PHQ-9 score ≥ 20); severe dementia; pregnancy;
and no access to a telephone line. All participants provided
their written informed consent, and the study protocol was
approved by the institutional review board of Saga University and each participating site. The trial was registered
with the University Hospital Medical Information Network

#### Participating centers

A total of 27 centers participated in this study. The types
of hospitals were as follows: 3 outpatient clinics, 4 provincial hospitals, 6 general hospitals in urban areas, 1 national
center, and 13 university hospitals in Japan.

#### Home telemonitoring system

The home telemonitoring system consisted of an electronic
scale with a body composition meter, a sphygmomanometer
and a device called a “receiver,” which received acquired
physiological data, including blood pressure, pulse rate,
body weight, and body composition, wirelessly and transmitted the data to the central web server via the internet.
These were commercially available products for health
maintenance (Karada Karte™ Tanita Health-link Co. Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan), and were distributed to the participants
assigned to the telemonitoring group when they were discharged from the hospital. The patients were shown how to
use the monitoring devices after providing informed consent,
and they were encouraged to measure their body weight and
blood pressure by themselves at least once a day at approximately the same time to minimize daily variance caused by
meals, micturition and bowel movement. The telemonitoring
center was established at Saga University Hospital for the
present study, and full-time nurses monitored the acquired
data on the secure website from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., 7 days a
week. The monitoring nurses made contact with the patients
by telephone and established internet communication with
the monitoring devices as soon as the patient’s physician
ordered the home telemonitoring to start. Before the monitoring started, the patient’s physician determined the warning threshold for body weight, blood pressure and pulse rate
for each patient. If the acquired data exceeded the threshold,
the monitoring nurses notified the patient’s physician. There
were no restrictions on the ability of the patient’s physician
to perform any intervention in response, such as providing
telephone guidance, changing medications, modifying the
warning threshold, and ordering hospital readmission.

#### Usual care

Patients assigned to the usual care group were treated by
their physicians in accordance with the 2010 Japanese Circulation Society Guidelines for treatment of chronic HF.
Clinicians provided discharge education and encouraged
the patients to measure their body weight by themselves
every day.


-----

#### Adherence

The adherence of the patients randomized to the telemonitoring group to measurement of their daily weight and blood
pressure was defined as follows:
Adherence = (days that each patient actually measured
body weight and blood pressure in a month/days that body
weight and blood pressure should be measured by the patient
in a month)*100%.

#### Study endpoint

The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death
or rehospitalization due to worsening HF. The secondary
endpoints were as follows: all-cause death; death from cardiovascular causes; all-cause rehospitalization; rehospitalization due to cardiovascular causes; rehospitalization due
to worsening HF; worsening of symptoms; cost of medical care; worsening of LVEF, the levels of N-terminal pro
B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP), high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), pentraxin-3 (PTX3), highsensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), or high-molecular weight adiponectin; changes in the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score, the General Self-Efficacy
Scale (GSES), the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure
(MLWHF) score, or the PHQ-9 score; and adherence to
medication. The MMSE is a commonly used paper-based
test for the diagnosis of dementia, with a maximum score
of 30. MMSE scores 25–30, 20–25, 10–20, and 0–10 represented questionably significant, mild, moderate, and
severe dementia, respectively [8]. The GSES is a 16-item

**Fig. 1 The numbers of patients**
randomly assigned to the telemonitoring group and the usual
care group and analyzed for the
primary endpoint


psychometric scale to assess optimistic self-beliefs to cope
with a variety of difficult demands in life [9]. The maximum
score of GSES is 16, and a higher GSES score indicates
higher self-efficacy. The MLWHF is a 21-item diseasespecific instrument with summary scores ranging from 0
to 105, with a higher score representing a worse HF-related
quality of life [10]. The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-administered
tool for assessing the presence and severity of depression. A
PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity
of 88% for major depressive disorder. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10,
15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe,
and severe depression, respectively [11]. All endpoints were
assessed by the independent endpoint committee after the
follow-up period.

#### Statistical analysis

We assumed that the Hazard Ratio (HR) of the primary endpoint (all-cause death or hospitalization for worsening HF) of
the telemonitoring group to the control group would be 0.60
and that the cumulative annual event rate in the usual care
group would be 0.30, based on the results of previous studies

[12, 13]. This study was designed to have 80% power to detect
a 40% relative reduction in the risk of the primary outcome
in the telemonitoring group within 12 months as compared
with the control group, based on an expected death rate at
12 months of 30% in the control group using a log-rank test
with a two-sided α of 0.05. A total sample size of 420 patients
was planned according to the Schoenfeld and Richter method

[14], with a 2-year period for patient enrolment and a followup period of 1 year. All statistical analyses were pre-specified

in a detailed statistical analysis plan and performed at the
Department of Biostatistics, Chiba University Hospital. The
analyses of the adjudicated primary and secondary outcomes
were performed on the full analysis set. For the baseline variables, summary statistics were constructed employing frequencies and proportions for categorical data and means and SDs
for continuous variables. Patient characteristics were compared with Fisher’s exact test for categorical outcomes, the
Wilcoxon rank sum test for ordinal variables, and t tests for
continuous variables, as appropriate. The primary endpoint
of the composite of all-cause death or rehospitalization for
worsening HF was analyzed with the stratified log-rank test
for eligible patients with age (65 vs < 65 years), LVEF (≥ 30
vs < 30%) and history of IHD (IHD vs non-IHD) as stratification factors. Time-to-event analyses were carried out with

## 1 3


the Kaplan–Meier method, and adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with Cox proportional
hazards models with stratification factors. For the aforementioned secondary endpoint analyses of time-to-event outcomes,
competing risk analysis was performed with the Fine-Gray
generalization of the proportional hazards model accounting
for death as a competing risk [15, 16]. Fine-Gray makes use
of the sub-distribution hazard to model cumulative incidence,
thereby quantifying the overall benefit or harm of an exposure

[17]. Death is a competing risk for loss to follow-up; therefore,
patients who died could no longer become lost to follow-up.
Competing risks are defined as events that prevent the outcome of interest from occurring. The standard Kaplan–Meier
method assumes the follow-up of those developing a competing event to simply be censored. This assumption is invalid

Shaded areas represent 95% CIs

because the outcome of interest can no longer occur in those
developing the competing event, and such analyses will therefore overestimate the probability of the outcome of interest

[18]. All comparisons were planned, and all p values were
two-sided. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed
with SAS software V.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

### Results

We planned a total sample size of 420 patients before the
study started. However, we could not reach this number
within the pre-defined enrollment period. As a result, a total
of 183 patients were randomly assigned to the telemonitoring group or the usual care group. One patient withdrew
consent immediately after randomization and refused to
allow use of any of his baseline data for analysis. Another
patient never visited the outpatient clinic after discharge

**Table 3 Primary and secondary endpoints**


(both patients were in the telemonitoring group). Of the 181
patients (telemonitoring group, n = 90; usual care group,
_n = 91) who were assigned to the analysis, 29 patients (16_
patients in the telemonitoring group and 13 patients in the
usual care group) dropped out during the study period.
Among these, 7 patients underwent placement of a cardiac
pacemaker or ICD/CRT, 7 became unable to continue the
study (for reasons including cognitive disorder, frailty, or
malignant diseases), 6 withdrew consent during the followup period, 5 dropped contact, 3 changed their physician or
moved, and the remaining patient was never discharged after
randomization (Fig. 1).

#### Baseline characteristics

Both groups were similar with respect to a range of baseline characteristics, including age, gender, ratio of NYHA
class II/III, number with IHD, and number of prior hospitalizations. Medications were balanced between the groups
at baseline. In the telemonitoring group, 81 patients (90%)
received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or
angiotensin receptor blockers, 53 patients (58.9%) received
aldosterone blockers, and 83 patients (92.2%) received
beta-blockers with the use of guideline-directed dosages.
In the usual care group, 82 (90.1%), 58 (63.7%), and 79
(86.8%) patients received these medications, respectively.
Laboratory data, including hemoglobin, serum albumin,
sodium concentration, total cholesterol levels, plasma NTpro BNP levels, and plasma BNP levels were also similar
in both groups. Left ventricular echocardiographic parameters, including left ventricular end-diastolic dimension
(LVDd), left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVDs),
and LVEF, were also similar in both groups (Table 1).

#### Adherence

Adherence to daily measurements for the patients assigned
to the telemonitoring group was maintained sufficiently

#### Primary endpoint

The median interval from discharge up to the start of the
home telemonitoring was 9 (interquartile range 6–13)
days, and the mean follow-up period was 15 (range 0–31)
months. During the follow-up period, the composite of
all-cause death or rehospitalization due to worsening HF
occurred in 24 (26.7%) patients in the telemonitoring
group and in 27 (29.7%) patients in the usual care group.
As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 3, there was no significant
difference in the primary endpoint between groups (HR
0.95; 95% CI 0.548–1.648; p = 0.572).

#### Secondary endpoints

There were no significant differences between groups
with respect to the secondary endpoints, including
all-cause death (Fig. 3a, Table 3; HR 0.809; 95% CI
0.354–1.847; _p = 0.614), death from cardiovascular_
causes (Fig. 3b, Table 3; HR 0.524; 95% CI 0.176–1.557;

95% CI 0.534–1.897; _p = 0.983), changes in NT-pro_
BNP (ANCOVA 135.18; 95% CI − 1133.59 to 1403.95;
_p = 0.829), changes in BNP (ANCOVA 47.74; 95% CI_
− 58.71 to 154.19; _p = 0.375), and changes in LVEF_
(ANCOVA − 0.24; 95% CI − 5.18 to 4.70; p = 0.922),
(Table 4). The other secondary endpoints, including worsening of symptoms, cost of medical care, and changes
in hs-CRP, PTX3, hs-cTnT, and high-molecular weight
adiponectin could not be analyzed because of insufficient data collection. Improvements in the MMSE score
(ANCOVA − 0.24; 95% CI − 1.07 to 0.59; p = 0.568),
the GSES score (ANCOVA 0.03; 95% CI − 0.28 to 0.34;
_p = 0.842), the MLWHF score (ANCOVA − 0.27; 95%_
CI − 7.72 to 7.18; _p = 0.943), and the PHQ-9 score_
(ANCOVA 0.49; 95% CI − 0.94 to 1.91; p = 0.498) were
also similar between groups (Table 5).


#### Safety

There was no harmful event caused by the telemonitoring
system.

### Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first
multicenter RCT to assess whether a home telemonitoring
system has a benefit over usual care for reducing rehospitalization and mortality rates in Japanese patients with HF.
Contrary to our expectation, the results showed that home
telemonitoring of physiological data, including body weight,
blood pressure, and pulse rate, in addition to usual care for
recently hospitalized patients with HF did not reduce the
rate of all-cause death or rehospitalization compared to
usual care. Although several meta-analyses and systematic
reviews have found beneficial effects of home telemonitoring
on the management of patients with HF [2, 12, 13, 19, 20],
two recently reported large-scale, multicenter RCTs showed
negative results [3, 4]. In the Tele-HF study [3], Chaudhry
and colleagues discussed that their negative results might
have been explained by poor adherence, because 14.4% of
the participants who were assigned to the telemonitoring
group never used the monitoring system, and only 55.1% of
the patients were using the system at least three times per
week at week 26 of the study period. Regarding this point,
Swedberg and coworkers suggested that patient-centered
care (PCC) could increase the effectiveness of home telemonitoring, and discussed the importance of a partnership
between patients and healthcare professionals [21]. Accordingly, we intended to maintain adherence by introducing the
concept of PCC, referring to a 2012 policy statement by
the American College of Cardiology Foundation [22]. For
instance, in the outpatient clinic, mainly nurses (sometimes
physicians) provided advice to the patients at every visit
on the basis of their physiological data obtained from the
daily monitoring, while showing patients the website on a
tablet computer. However, our results did not show an additional benefit of home telemonitoring, despite the finding
that the mean adherence rate of the present study participants was actually maintained at about 90% at 12 months.
One of the potential reasons for that might be patient selection. In the present study, we excluded patients in whom
a pacemaker or ICD/CRT was implanted, because a body
composition scale using an alternating current for measurement was included in our home telemonitoring system.
Therefore, there is a high probability that many patients in
stage D of HF were excluded. We also excluded patients
with severe renal dysfunction, severe liver dysfunction, and
limited life expectancy because of malignant diseases or
other causes; therefore, the Charlson Comorbidity Index

[23] of the present study participants might be less than 1
point. As a result, rehospitalization rates for worsening HF
were 21 and 22% for each group, respectively, during the
mean follow-up period of 15 months, which is significantly
lower compared with that in previous Japanese reports [24,
25]. DeBusk and colleagues showed that a specific nurse
care management program for HF did not reduce rehospitalization rates in patients with low-risk HF compared with
usual care [26], suggesting that such specific care might not
be effective in patients with a low risk for rehospitalization [12]. In another recently reported large-scale, multicenter RCT, the Telemedical Interventional Monitoring in
Heart Failure (TIM-HF) trial [4], the authors suggested that
when telemonitoring is applied to stable, optimally treated,
ambulatory patients with chronic HF, a reduction in mortality is not present. The second potential reason might be the
quality of usual care. Goldberg and coworkers demonstrated
that specific care using a technology-based daily weight and
symptom-monitoring system also did not reduce rehospitalization rates, even in patients with advanced HF, compared

with usual care [27]. In their study, all enrolled patients were
followed at HF specialty clinics, and they reported that it
was possible that the high quality of usual care left little
room for improvement by the additional specific care. In
the present study, most of the patients visited the same hospital from which they were recently discharged, and were
provided ambulatory treatment by cardiologists. Pandor and
colleagues stated that structured telephone support (STS)
delivered via human–human contact and home telemonitoring with medical support showed beneficial effects compared
to STS delivered via a human–machine (interactive response
system) interface in their latest systematic review and metaanalysis [2]; therefore, it may be that human–human communication plays a key role in home telemonitoring for HF
to prevent rehospitalization [28]. The home telemonitoring
system in the present study did not have an interactive communication function, and the monitoring nurses were prohibited from having direct conversations with the patient,
excluding a response to malfunction of the home telemonitoring devices, because of a limitation by a national medical


-----

practitioners’ act. Furthermore, no home-healthcare professionals participated in this study.
Our study has several limitations. First, the number of
study participants was smaller than we initially planned in
the study protocol. We were unable to extend the registration
period of the study due to insufficient funds. Therefore, the
study may have been statistically underpowered to detect
the primary endpoint. Second, the open-label design may
have introduced bias, especially for occasionally subjective
outcomes, such as rehospitalization [29]. In addition, there
were no existing home telemonitoring services for patients
with HF in either the public or private sector, and home
telemonitoring has not been covered by the national health
insurance program in Japan. Therefore, all of the healthcare
professionals who participated in the present study were
inexperienced in the telemonitoring process, and the monitoring system was handmade by a physician with commercially available devices.
In conclusion, home telemonitoring of physiological
data for patients with HF was feasible under the current
Japanese healthcare environment; however, its effects in
addition to the benefit of usual care were not demonstrated
for the present study participants. In the near future, more
patients with HF will be treated by home-healthcare providers in Japan and many developed countries because of the
growth of the aging population. Frenneaux et al. stated in
their recent editorial comment, “It is likely that the greatest
promise lies with next generation home-monitoring systems,
provided that strategies are implemented for integrating
them effectively into the healthcare framework to close the
loop between patients and healthcare providers” [30]. Further investigation of more patients with severe heart failure,
participation of home medical care providers, and use of
a more integrated home telemonitoring system emphasizing communication as well as monitoring of symptoms and
physiological data are required.
