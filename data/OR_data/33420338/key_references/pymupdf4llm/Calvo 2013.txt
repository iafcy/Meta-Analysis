Summary
Background: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOP) are key
events in the natural history of the disease. Patients with more AECOPD have worse prognosis.
There is a need of innovative models of care for patients with severe COPD and frequent AECOPD, and Telehealth (TH) is part of these programs.
Methods: In a cluster assignment, controlled trial study design, we recruited 60 patients, 30 in
home telehealth (HT) and 30 in conventional care (CC). All participants had a prior diagnosis of
COPD with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV1)% predicted <50%, age �50
years, were on long-term home oxygen therapy, and non-smokers. Patients in the HT group
measured their vital signs on a daily bases, and data were transmitted automatically to a Clinical Monitoring Center for followed-up, and who escalated clinical alerts to a Pneumologist.
Results: After 7-month of monitoring and follow-up, there was a significant reduction in ER
visits (20 in HT vs. 57 in CC), hospitalizations (12 vs. 33), length of hospital stay in (105 vs.
276 days), and even need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (0 vs. 8), all p < 0.05. Time
to the first severe AECOPD increased from 77 days in CC to 141 days in HT (K-M p < 0.05).

#### Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading
but under-recognized cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. No other disease that is responsible for comparable burden worldwide is neglected by healthcare providers as much as COPD [1,2]. COPD is projected to move
from the currently fourth to third position in terms of
morbidity by 2020 [3,4]. A key aspect in the natural history
of the disease are episodes of acute exacerbations
(AECOPD). AECOPD are more frequent in patients with
larger airflow obstruction and a history of more episodes in
the previous year [5]. Moreover patients who suffer the
highest numbers of AECOPD are considered to have a faster
disease progression, presence of comorbidities, and worse
functional prognosis [6].
Research is therefore needed on innovative models of
care for patients with severe COPD and frequent AECOPD,
in order to detect and manage the occurrence of exacerbations of AECOPD at an early stage, and hence reduce
their negative effect on the disease progression. The
importance of these programs has been highlighted in the
National Strategy for COPD of the Spanish National Health
System [7]. Telehealth (TH) is part of these programs, as it
allows patients to be monitored in their home, gathering
useful information that can be used for an early intervention should an AECOPD occur [8].
Current evidence shows that Home Telehealth (HT)
programs can reduce the number and length of stay in
hospital admissions and emergency visits [9]. And Sicotte
et al. demonstrated that TH increases empowerment and


patient’s satisfaction, specially in the older and more severe patients [10].
Although TH programs have been developed for COPD
patients, none has been specifically geared to people who
experience severe airflow obstruction, multiple comorbidities, and limitations in daily life. We hypothesized that HT
can be a useful strategy for monitoring these patients at
the home in a follow-up program that coordinates Primary
and Secondary Care services.
The purpose of our study (the PROMETE study, “Madrilian Telehealth PROject for COPD) was to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of a home telehealth program for
COPD patients with severe airflow obstruction by measuring
the number of emergency room visits, hospitalizations,
length of hospital stay, and mortality.

#### Material and methods

##### Study population

We conducted an open-label, controlled, non-blind clinical
trial, coordinarted at the Pneumology Service of the Hospital Universitario La Princesa (HULP) with the Primary Care
Centres (PCC) in its area of influence.
Initially we randomized the PCC customers that
belonged to HULP into two groups: HT or Conventional Care
(CC). Patients were randomized following a two-color code.
All PCC customers were assigned to one or another color
using an envelope system dividing into two groups by
chance. According to PCC membership patients were

assigned to each study group (group allocation). Patients
referred from the Goya, Montesa, Lagasca and Castello PCC
were assigned to HT, and the rest were cluster assignment
to the CC group. We performed group treatment allocation
by center, one case to one control. All PCC customers
shared the same geographic localization (District of Salamanca in Madrid), population characteristic, cultural and


economic levels (Table 1), and hence it is fair to state that
all determinants were equally balanced by study group.
In addition, all patients were followed up at the pneumology clinic in our hospital, which also unifies the criteria
for monitoring and treatment of respiratory disease. Whenever patients from either group came to the emergency room
(ER), they were evaluated by the Pneumologist in charge,

ergo maintaining a similar approach in the assessment of ERs
and deciding whether the patient should be admitted or
discharged, independently of their group assignment.
Eligible patients were identified if they had been
admitted to any of the following units in our hospital:
Pneumology, Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases
services, with a clinical diagnosis of “COPD exacerbation”
during the period from January 1, 2010 to July 31, 2011. We
identified a total of 594 patients in the HULP database
system (Fig. 1).
Consecutively we selected patients who met the
following inclusion criteria: 1) prior diagnosis of COPD according to GOLD criteria [11]; 2) severe or very severe
obstruction to airflow (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.70 and
FEV1 %predicted <50%); 3) age older than or equal to 50


years; 4) on long-term home oxygen therapy; 5) no current
smoker, at least for the past 6 months, determined by
measuring carboxyhemoglobin levels in arterial blood gas
2%. Patients were excluded if: 1) did not meet at least
�
one of the above criteria; 2) were enrolled in a palliative
care program for lung or another disease; 3) were institutionalized or at risk of social exclusion; 4) were deemed
unable to understand all procedures.
Both study groups continued with their scheduled medical visits during the entire study period within the standard
universal, free healthcare for all of the Spanish public
system, and therefore we did not change the regular office
visits and home calls either by the Pneumologist or the
Primary Care doctors.
Patients in the control group had no intervention apart
from this standard, conventional care, and no other pro

-----

active interventions during the entire study. All information
during the study was collected by visit at the patient’s
home except for the satisfaction questionnaire that was
obtained through telephone calls in a blinded fashion in
both groups.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
HULP, and the study number was 1819. All patients signed
an informed consent form prior to inclusion.

##### Study procedures

The PROMETE telehealth program was based on the daily
follow-up of patients with severe COPD at the home by
monitoring the following parameters: blood pressure, oxygen saturation and heart rate on a daily basis, and peak
expiratory flow (PEF) three times a week.
Other TH programs have used similar parameters to
monitor the patients as: pulsioximetry, blood pressure,
temperature, PEF and spirometry [12e14].
We chose to use PEF according to Jo´dar-Sa´nchez et al. as
PEF as it showed more acceptable to being carried out by
the patient [15], and since van de Berge et al. [16] have
linked the fall of percentage of peak-flow with the risk of
COPD exacerbations.
Measurements were made once a day in the morning,
and given the following set of conditions: 20 min after
medication had been taken, at rest and while on oxygen
therapy. The patients took their measurements on a daily
bases (Monday through Sunday). Monday through Friday the
data were monitored and assessed by the Clinical Monitoring Center (CMC) from 9:00 to 17:00. And during weekends, the data were directly analyzed by a Pneumologist.
During the recruitment period all patients who were
presumed to satisfy the inclusion criteria were consecutively contacted by telephone, until there were 30 patients
in each group. The purpose of the study was explained to
them, and if they agreed to participate an appointment was
made for a home visit with the Pneumologist.
At the first clinical visit the informed consent form was
signed, and data were collected including: gender, age,
level of education, household composition, limitations of
activities of daily living, presence or absence of carer,
medication, relevant medical history (Charlson index) [17],
basic physical examination, quality of life questionnaires
(generic like SF-12, and EuroQol, and disease-specific like
SGRQ, and COPD Assessment Test, CAT) [18e20], the Barthel Index [21], and finally the Goldberg questionnaire for
anxiety and depression [22].
Throughout the duration of the study we collected the
number of ER visits, hospitalizations, length of hospital
stay, need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and need for
admission to ICU for both groups.

##### Patient monitoring and follow-up

On the first day of the HT programme, monitoring devices
were delivered and installed at the patient’s home by
nursing staff. Patients were trained in their operation and it
was verified that they were able to take all measurements
properly. Written information was as well given on how to
handle/use the monitoring devices, and how to correctly


transmit the measurements. A contact phone number from
the CMC was left to the patients for any technical
problems.
The parameters were collected using the following devices: a spirometer, a pulse-oximeter and heart rate
monitor (Spirotel[�], MIR), and blood pressure monitor (A&D,
model UA-767 BT). Each day after taking these measurements, data were sent automatically via a modem (TeleModem�, Aerotel Medical Systems) over the patients’
telephone lines. Further details can be found in the online
supplement.
Patients entered the study in a stable situation, being
exacerbation-free for at least 15 days. Entry into the study
of patients in the exacerbation phase was postponed until it
was over.
The information was received, monitored, assessed and
followed-up by the CMC through an application that acted
as a traffic light system:

B Green: meant that measurements had been taken and
were within the predefined limits, and no further action was required.
B Yellow: “technical alert”. This means that the measurements had not been taken or had not been
received. This alert could lead to a “clinical alert” due
to a lack of adherence or discouragement. When the
parameters were not received the nurse at the CMC
called the patient to find the reason behind the alert,
and either ruled out medical causes or, if one, notified
the Pneumologist leading the study.
B Red: “clinical alert”. Meant that a measurement
exceeded the limits that were previously preestablished for each patient (further details can be
found in the online supplement).

After verification of a Red Flag -Clinical Alert by the
CMC, a protocolized escalation and clinical response procedure commenced.

##### Clinical support

Clinical support occurs as a result of the coordination between the CMC, the Pneumology specialist and the Primary
Care physician.
Whenever a Red Flag (clinical alert) was triggered the
nurse at the CMC contacted the patient to verify the alert
(further details can be found in the online supplement).
When a Red Flag was confirmed, the nurse escalated the
clinical alert to the Pneumologist who then classified the
exacerbation as moderate, severe or very severe. For
moderate exacerbations, advice to start medical treatment
was given over the telephone; in severe cases, visits were
made to the patient’s home, and in the very severe cases
the patient was advised to come to the emergency room
department (Figs. 2 and 3).
As we worked in coordination with each Primary Care
Center, the head of the PCC was alerted when a Red Flag
was detected and, in accordance with our protocol, patients with moderate exacerbations who did not improve
with the prescribed treatment were referred to their corresponding PCC for further follow-up.

##### Exacerbation

In our study COPD exacerbation was defined as: “an acute
event” characterized by a worsening of patient’s respiratory symptoms (increased dyspnea, expectoration, purulent sputum, or any combination of these three symptoms)
that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to
change in medication [11].

##### Control group

The control group received Conventional Care. There was a
first clinical visit at the home during which baseline data
were collected for the study and quality of life questionnaires were completed, and also a visit at the end. Data
relating to clinical activity were obtained from the HULP
information system and through monthly telephone calls to
the patients.
For these patients we collected data related to blood
pressure, pulsioximetry and heart rate in the first clinical
visit at home. The baseline of these parameters at the
beginning of the study compared with the HT group is show
in Table 1.

##### Statistical analysis

For the descriptive analysis we used mean, range, and
standard deviation for quantitative variables, while qualitative variables were expressed in terms of frequencies and


percentages. To measure the relationship between independent quantitative variables Student’s t-test was used,
and for qualitative variables the Chi[2] test was used. The
relationship between two qualitative variables and relative
risk was obtained through use of contingency tables. Clinical follow-up and monitoring of both groups was measured
using KaplaneMeier curves to indicate the time to the first
contact with the hospital (emergency room visit or hospitalization) analysis. Statistical significance was considered
at p < 0.05.
Given the nature of this pilot study, no formal sample
size was estimated a priori. For convenience and availability, we piloted 30 patients per group, which is reasonable number of patients with severe COPD and multiple
comorbidities considered to be a representative sample.
The study duration was based upon covering the peak
months of maximum stability and number of exacerbations
(December to February) followed by another period of
stability until May. A posteriori, given the differences obtained in all primary and secondary outcomes, they should
be considered not only statistically significant but also
clinically relevant.

#### Results

A total of 594 patients were considered for recruitment. Of
these, 195 initially met our inclusion criteria and made up
the pool of candidates who were contacted and invited to
participate in the study until 60 patients. The 60

participants were recruited and assigned to the two groups:
30 patients to the CC group and 30 patients to the HT group
(Fig. 1).
Their socio-demographic and clinical characteristics are
shown in Table 1. The mean age was 73.8 years (standard
deviation 9.5) and 44 patients (74.6%) were men. 62.7%
�
of patients reported having an informal primary carer (IPC);
in 60.5% of the cases this was the spouse, followed by the
patients’ children (15.7%).
The mean Charlson index score was 3.5 (SD 1.9) and
�
the average number of drugs taken by the patients per day
was 8.3 (SD 2.5). Regarding specific treatments for COPD,
�
the most commonly used bronchodilators were a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting betaadrenergic agonist together with a long-acting muscarinic
receptors antagonist (Table 1).
All patients in the study could be classified into group D
as defined by the revised 2011 GOLD classification (patients
at high risk and with many comorbidities); mean postbronchodilator FEV1 was 39.1%, mean BODE index was 5.5,
and CAT questionnaire was 19.3 (moderate impact on stable
disease). All patients were long-term home oxygen therapy


users, although seven of them used it erratically. At the
study onset, the mean number of days of clinical stability
per year (defined as days with no COPD exacerbation) was
166 days, and the mean number of hospitalizations was 1.8
per exacerbation in the previous year.
During the 7-months study period, we observed decrease
in the number of emergency room visits in the HT group (20
visits) vs. the CC group (57 visits) (p Z 0.001); number of
hospitalizations: HT 12 hospitalizations vs. CC 33 hospitalizations (p Z 0.015); length of hospital stay: HT 105 days
vs. CC 276 days (p Z 0.018) and need for NIV: HT 0 patients
vs. CC 8 patients (p < 0.0001). We also found that the
average number of days to first exacerbation requiring
hospitalization was 77.28 days in the CC group and 141.07
days in the HT group (p Z 0.003) (Fig. 4). Four patients in
the CC group died (3 of causes related to COPD and 1 secondary to a retroperitoneal hematoma) vs. two patients in
the HT group (1 of causes related to COPD and another
secondary to an intestinal obstruction).
We identified a total of 50 Red Flags (clinical alerts),
from which following our classification system: 39 (78%)
were classified as moderate, 8 (16%) as severe, and 3 (6%) as

observation/hospitalization, by group.

very severe. Clinical interventions were conducted primarily over the telephone (in 37 occasions) or in the patient’s home (in 8 occasions). The main parameters that
triggered Red Flags were oxygen saturation (in 30 occasions), followed by peak-flow (in 7 occasions). In 7% (4 occasions) of raised “red flag” were due to blood pressure
alteration, though in our study blood pressure had a low
predictive capacity to a COPD exacerbation. Importantly, in
12 cases a Red Flag was not raised although the patient had
a COPD exacerbation. In the majority of these cases the
exacerbation occurred out of office hours or during weekends (5 cases), the parameters received were correct (3
cases), the patient went to the emergency room department without being previously monitored and advised (4
cases).

program at the end of trial.


Overall, 78% of AECOPD in the HT group were classified
as of a milder severity. In the CC we did not attend the
patient’s home or perform any other planned intervention,
and for this reason we are unable to establish the severity
of the AECOPD in this group.
We did not observe any withdrawals as a result of difficulties in using the devices and the technology, although in
one case the data received were those of the carer and not
from the patient. The overall patient satisfaction rate was
high (median of telemonitoring time was 72.5%), with the
HT programme being awarded a score of 9 out of 10 (Fig. 5).
The average of telemonitoring days was 152,2 days (72.5%
of the total study time). We defined adherence as the
percentage of the total days the patient used the devices to
monitor parameters during the study period. To improve
the adherence each patient was provided with a user
manual for each device and a “trial run” was performed to
ensure the patient understood the proper functioning of
the system. Additionally the CMC nurse called the patients
who did not take their measurements on a dally bases.

#### Discussion

The PROMETE study is a novel and innovative home telehealth program that improved the care of severe COPD
patients. It is the first study conducted in this population
and demonstrated an improvement in many clinical
outcomes.
The study combines telehealth resources with conventional care and early interventions after a detection of an
AECOPD to improve the care of patients with severe COPD.
The main results of this trial revealed a significant reduction in emergency room visits, hospitalizations and length
of hospital stay of COPD patients enrolled in HT, with
equivalent safety and high acceptance for patients
receiving CC.
Our study population was made by COPD patients with
severe airflow obstruction (mean FEV1 38.9%), on long-term
home oxygen therapy, with multiple comorbidities (Charlson index score of 3.57), limitations in activities of daily
living (Barthel index 89.3 and 64% in need of a carer), using
multiple medications (average of 8.30 drugs per day) and
46.7% of the HT group reported hospitalizations due to
AECOPD in the previous year. Using HT for daily monitoring
and follow-up allowed us to detect and treat exacerbations
in their early stages. Overall, 78% of AECOPD were classified
as moderate and interventions were conducted mainly over
the telephone (74%), or as home visits (5%). We focused on
care at the patient’s home, initiating treatment for AECOPD
from the home in 80% of the cases. We demonstrated that
HT allows detecting early changes in measurable parameters and therefore identify an AECOPD prematurely. In fact,
we detected more milder exacerbations with HT since we
were able to monitor daily changes in the patient’s
condition.
In December 2011 the UK Department of Health published the results of the “Whole System Demonstrator”
(WSD) program, a randomized clinical trial which involved
6191 patients, 3030 of whom had chronic diseases such as
COPD, diabetes mellitus or heart failure, across 3 distant
geographic areas [23]. Health parameters (blood pressure,


-----

oxygen saturation and temperature) were telemonitored
with a device installed at the patients’ home. Early results
showed at reduction of hospitalizations (20%), length of
stay (14%) and time spent in emergency room (14%). The
implementation of this program was planned to last about
seven years and the potential maximum benefits were expected to be achieved in phase III (in about 3e4 years from
start).
In a review published in 2010, HT was shown to reduce
the number of hospitalizations and emergency room visits
in comparison to CC, although the clinical characteristics of
the studies reviewed were very heterogeneous [24]. Similar
results were published in a Cochrane review in 2011 [25],
which also found improvement in the quality of life of patients. No differences were found in mortality rates;
possible explanations being that both study groups were
composed of patients in the worst functional class, which in
itself is associated with a poorer prognosis, and the short
period of follow-up (total of 7 months). All these reports
concluded that better-designed studies on specific populations are needed. To the date, studies in groups of patients with more severe disease are limited to Vitacca’s
work [26] in a population of 240 patients with severe respiratory failure, with a mean FEV1 of 40%.
With respect to the utility of the telemonitoring parameters, there are few studies exploring the utility of PEF
in COPD patients, especially in these patients without
bronchial hyperactivity. Hurst [12] and van de Berge [16]
linked the fall in the PEF with the probably to detect
early COPD exacerbation. In our study, in 7 occasions PEF
triggered clinical while oxygen saturation did in 30 occasions, and blood pressure only in 7% of the times (4
occasions).
To sum up the authors concluded that HT programs coordinated by primary and secondary care groups can
improve the efficient delivery of the health services to
chronic patients due to an easier and more effective
follow-up of chronic patients.

##### Advantages and limitations

Adherence to the HT program in our trial was good, and
there were no withdrawals due to complications of use,
although one of the patients had difficulties taking the
measurements, and in the end it was identified that data
received were those of the carer. This reinforces the
importance of selecting patients who may best benefit from
a TH program [25]. An important aspect for patient
adherence to a HT is the use devices that are not difficult to
use; Finkelstein and Friedman showed that with a short
training, elderly patients were capable of using a home
monitoring system via videoconference [27].
Our study did not vary the schedule of the patients’
appointments to visit the Pneumologist or PCCs, intervening
only if there was some change in the monitored parameters
that were recorded daily, and thereby ensuring patients did
not lose their relationship with their regular doctors. Coordination with the PCC was essential to maintain continuity of care and to avoid duplicating clinical interventions
and treatments. We dealt with a large amount of data and
information, clinical and non-clinical; and in this case the


CMC nurse played a key role in filtering the alerts. In this
way in clinical alert, AECOPD were differentiated from
other causes, and were able to detect false positives; And
in technical alerts, false negatives were managed by the
CMC nurses, all this reducing the burden of interventions by
the, as the Pneumologist was only alerted when clinical
alerts were confirmed by the CMC nurses.
We must emphasize that any integrated program for
COPD care, with or without TH, requires the cooperation
and coordination between primary and specialist care
within the community and the hospital.
Finally, the main limitations of our study were: 1) the
small sample size, albeit given the severity of the disease,
it was sufficient to obtain significant clinically relevant and
statistically significant differences between the two
groups; 2) given the poor functional prognosis (COPD GOLD
stage IV with multiple comorbidities) and only 7 months of
monitoring period, we were unable to obtain significant
differences in mortality between the two groups; 3) the
study follow-up was less than one year; and hence we were
unable to take into account seasonality of AECOPD 3) the
patient selection could be better; although there were no
withdrawals because of difficulties in using the devices and
the overall satisfaction rate was high; 4) the lack of individual randomization, as mentioned above.

##### Future

Real-life effectiveness and economic feasibility studies are
needed to implement HT programmes. In addition, larger,
multicenter studies and the development of integrated
care programs within the healthcare system are needed
and no more repetitive “pilot projects”. We must improve
the selection process to better identify patients that are
most likely to benefit from TH programs, define the roles of
the staff involved, and assess the impact of these programs
on the patient’s carer.
In conclusion, the PROMETE study has shown clinical
efficacy in monitoring COPD patients in GOLD group D [11]
(severe airflow obstruction, respiratory symptoms, and atrisk of AECOPD), who also have multiple comorbidities, by
reducing the number hospital visits through early detection
and proactive intervention in the patient home before the
AECOPD occur. This was possible with the coordination of
Primary Care, Pneumologist, and nursing staff. However,
we must carefully evaluate the population who meet inclusion criteria for HT programmes, as the majority of patients are elderly, some of them with cognitive, hearing, or
visual defects that may hinder the continuity of TH on a
daily basis [28]. Hence, HT programs in severe COPD patients are safe and efficacious in reducing healthcare resources utilization in elderly patients with multiple
comorbidities.
