## ABSTRACT


**Aim. To see if home telemonitors reduce healthcare use in those with optimized chronic ob-**
**structive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods. We randomized 40 stable patients with moderate**
**to severe COPD, who had completed at least 12 sessions of outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation**
**(PR), to receive standard care (Controls) for 52 weeks or standard care plus Docobo HealthHUB**
**monitors at home for 26 weeks followed by 26 weeks standard care (Tm Group). During the**
**monitoring period, the Tm Group completed symptoms and physical observations twice daily**
**which were stored and then uploaded at 2 am through a freephone landline. Nurses could ac-**
**cess the data through a secure web site and received alerting e-mails if certain combinations**
**of data occurred. Results. There were fewer primary care contacts for chest problems (p <**
**0.03) in the Tm group, but no differences between the groups in emergency room visits, hos-**
**pital admissions, days in hospital or contacts to the specialist COPD community nurse team,**
**during the monitoring period. After the monitors were removed, there were no differences**
**between the groups for any of the health care contacts (p > 0.20 throughout). Conclusion.**
**In stable, optimized COPD patients who have already completed PR, telemonitoring in addi-**
**tion to best care, reduces primary care chest contacts but not hospital or specialist team**
**utilization.**

users (3). Integrated case management has improved outcomes

Despite better understanding of disease mechanisms and

in COPD (4, 5) and information technologies have helped inte
treatment standardization, (1) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary

grated case management reduce hospitalisations for COPD (6).

Disease (COPD) remains a leading cause of death and morbidity

Telemonitoring has also been used to reduce admissions and


-----

worsen outcome in COPD (10). Alternatively, such an active
monitoring process may make patients feel there is an increased
sense of control from clinical staff, cause inconvenience or even
increase health care contacts if they become aware of (asymptomatic) changes in their pulse oxygenations, temperature or
heart rate or have a daily reminder of their illness when completing uploads.
The Better Breathing Project (11) is a European Unionfunded market validation project under the eTEN program, with
ten partners from five European countries aiming to reconfigure
the normal care pathway for COPD by implementing integrated
supported home-hospital and rehabilitation services. As one of
the field-trial sites for Better Breathing, we wanted to see if
telemonitoring technologies placed in the home are feasible and
useful. Our aim was to see if telemonitoring in stable, and optimized COPD patients affects their health care utilization.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS


This was a randomized trial for 6 months (intervention),
followed by a 6-month passive (observational) period. Locoregional ethical approval was obtained (Ref: 07/WMW01/53)
and the trial registered (ISRCTN 41424840).

## Participants


**Figure 1. Patient flow chart.**


Ninety-nine still-living subjects were identified from our PR
database. The exclusion criteria are shown in Figure 1 and we
approached remaining patients until we obtained 40 patients
with the following inclusion criteria: a primary diagnosis of
moderate to severe COPD, according to a standard definition
and prescribed optimal medication (1) and who had completed
at least 12 of 18 sessions of our PR program.
The program includes outpatient multidisciplinary input
from occupational therapists, physiotherapists, dietetics staff,
physicians, specialist respiratory nurses, social workers and a
smoking cessation counselor. This PR program is closely based
on a model with a strong evidence base for a range of beneficial clinical outcomes (12). They were enrolled in the present
study a median of 8 months after completing PR (range 2–19
months). To help ensure standardization, all patients also had to
be known to our community-based Chronic Disease Management Team (CDMT). This local service consists of 2 specialist
nurses, a respiratory physiotherapist and nurse manager.
If contacted by patients, a member of the CDMT would visit
them at home usually within one working day for clinical assessment, pulse oximetry, to take sputum cultures, and recommend
treatment escalations (e.g., home steroids or home antibiotics).
The CDMT liased with primary care doctors and had weekly
contacts with the hospital-based respiratory consultants (specialists) to discuss any problems. Doctors wrote prescriptions
on CDMT advice and the CDMT could take these medications
directly to the patient’s homes.


## Procedure

After consent, subjects completed baseline demographic
questions. Occupation was used to estimate socioeconomic
grouping according to established criteria (13). Subjects were
randomized using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) (Chicago, Illinois), version 12.0, random number generator, into 2 groups and allocated using sealed opaque envelopes.
Twenty subjects received standard care, including continued
CDMT and hospital / primary care support at the discretion of
their clinical teams for 12 months (Controls). The 20 subjects in
the intervention arm (Tm Group) received standard care plus a
handheld telemonitor – the Docobo[⃝][R] Health HUB[TM] (Docobo
Ltd, Bookham, UK), (HUB) for 26 weeks. Users do not need
Internet connections as the HUB integrates through a freephone
landline with the doc@HOME care management system (Docobo Ltd, Bookham, UK), a generic web-based telemonitoring
system that can be pre-configured to specific needs. The CDMT
received two training sessions each lasting approximately 1 hour
from the HUB manufacturers before the project started.
A generic community, telecare team (separate from the clinical staff), installed the monitors and trained subjects in their
own homes in January 2008. Each patient-training session took
less than 1 hour. The installation team dealt with any technical
problems and visited only 2 patients over 6 months, when the
signal was lost. Twice daily, patients completed button screen

They recorded their oral temperatures, using a manual thermometer (model FT04-1, Beurer, Ulm, Germany) and typed
the result into the HUB. They placed their index finger into a
pulse oximeter probe (part no. 3831-001, Nonin Inc, Minnesota,
USA) connected to the HUB. The HUBs were pre-configured
for the pulse oximeters and although all equipment was British
safety approved, hospital technicians checked it prior to home
installation.
Data were not accessed ‘live’ by the CDMT but were transferred in a ‘store and forward model’ to the central server at 2
am daily. Health professionals (primarily the CDMT but also a
respiratory consultant and a specialist hospital nurse) could access the server, via a secure Internet connection at any time, or
if the patient phoned with worsening symptoms. The final number of individual data points completed on the central server
was divided by the total number of data points possible (max
13 data points per person per day over the 6 months) to estimate HUB usage. If there were 24 hours without data upload to the central server, a member of the CDMT phoned the
patient.
In addition to regular reviews of the results (daily, MondayFriday) on the doc@home web site, an alerting e-mail was sent
to the CDMT and hospital respiratory nurses if there were a


combination of 2 or more of any of the following recordings on
a single session upload:

a) Any question scoring ‘much worse than usual’
b) Pulse rate greater than 120 beats per minute
c) Oxygen saturations less than 88% (on their usual air/oxygen)
d) Temperature greater than 38.5 degrees centigrade

The CDMT telephoned the patient on receipt of this alerting
e-mail during working hours (Mondays-Fridays, 9 am–5 pm).
After 6 months the telemonitors were removed from the Tm
group to see if withdrawal would lead to increased healthcare
usage possibly after patients become accustomed to their use.
The first 26 weeks of the study was the active intervention, then
the monitors were removed and this was followed by 26 weeks
of (passive) observation in both groups.
Both patient groups were instructed to seek help from their
primary care or emergency doctor if they felt urgent treatment
was needed and it was emphasized that the HUB was not a
replacement for but was to work in conjunction with standard
support.
All patients were treated according to the clinical discretion of their primary care doctors, specialist nurses and hospital specialists. Apart from the CDMT, these other health care
providers were all unaware of the Telemedicine allocation, unless the patient told them during the consultation. Hospital,
CDMT and primary care contacts were collected from medical records and hospital computers and primary care data were
collected from their computerized databases corroborated by a
researcher (blinded to group allocation) phoning each primary
care practice monthly during the monitoring periods.
A senior respiratory clinician (separate from the research
team) independently reviewed the medical records of any deaths
or withdrawals to determine if telemonitoring contributed towards adverse consequences e.g., unusual delays in treatment.
At the end of whole 12 months, those allocated to the Tm, who
were still living, were posted a simple questionnaire asking if
they thought the Tm was helpful or inconvenient. A committee
from the Better Breathing Project performed a site inspection
after 6 weeks and received progress reports at 26 weeks and
completion.

## Statistics


We used SPSS version 13.0. Following distribution plots
(with Lilliefors correction) parametric data were compared with
_t-tests and other data evaluated with either Mann–Whitney or_
Wilcoxon signed rank test. Categorical data were compared
with Chi Square. Throughout, p < 0.05 was deemed significant.
Based on the assumption that our patients with severe COPD
who we had targeted with the CDMT service, previously had a
mean of 1.2 admissions per year (standard deviation 0.9) and we
could reduce this rate by two thirds, to 0.4 admissions per year
with Tm — we estimated we would need around 22 patients per
group to show a significant difference, with a Type 1 (alpha)
error rate 0.05 and power 0.80. We had funding for 20 Tm
machines for this pilot.

## Secondary outcomes — telemonitors usage:


On an intention to monitor analysis, the patients uploaded
a median 97% of total available data during the first 6 months
(monitoring period). Figure 2 shows the distribution of data
points uploaded as a percentage of total available data, during
the monitoring period in the Tm Group. None of the 17 Tm
patients, who completed the study, reported difficulties using
the monitors. 15 from 17 found it ‘helpful’ or ‘very helpful’.

## Safety


There were 2 deaths in the Tm Group – one man died after
15 days in hospital of multi-organ failure following a gastrointestinal haemorrhage; one lady was withdrawn when she went
into a nursing home, where she died 2 months later of ‘old age.’
Neither had used their monitors for at least 15 days before their
death and neither death (nor preceding deterioration) was attributed to the telemonitors. There was 1 other withdrawal in
the Tm Group after 3 months, because the patient found it too
cumbersome, when she wanted to travel. All 3 had been good
users prior to withdrawing and their last recorded symptoms,
heart rate and oximetry showed no worrying trend. We had no
user satisfaction ratings on these 3 subjects.

## DISCUSSION


For stable COPD patients, who have completed PR and who
are actively engaged with and supported by a specialist CDMT
team, continuous home telemonitoring and alerts to provide
reassurance and avoid clinical worsening, is associated with
reduced contacts to the primary care physicians for chest /respiratory problems, but we found no statistically significant differences in hospital admissions, or utilization of hospital or
specialist community team resources. In particular, we cannot


reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the number of hospital admissions over a 6-month period.
The reduction in primary care contacts during telemonitoring is biologically feasible and this was not at the expense of
increased CDMT or hospital usage. The difference of 2–3 primary care visits per 6 months may still be clinically important
and should be included in any cost-effectiveness modeling. The
reduction in phone calls in the Tm group when the monitors
were removed is interesting; this may be because patient confidence has built up or because the CDMT were not checking
up on occasional e-mail alerts. At least it can be argued that
withdrawal of Tm is not associated with any surge in health care
usage as patients feel less secure following the HUB’s removal.
Although we found no statistically significant reduction in
hospital admissions it could be argued that our ‘usual clinical
support’ is above standard and doesn’t leave much room for the
telemonitor to help. Nevertheless, the Tm group did better with
4 hospitalizations compared to 7 in the control group and this
approximate halving of admissions is actually similar to other
studies of telemedicine in COPD (14, 15). Our primary event
rate (admissions) was much lower than expected.
If we were to plan a repeat study of such an optimized population who had completed PR and who already have ongoing
CDMT support, with a ‘mean’ admission rate 0.35 admissions
per patient per 6 months and achieve an estimated mean of 0.20
admissions per 6 months in the Tm group, we would need to
study around 138 patients in each arm, to find a statistically
significant difference in hospital admissions for COPD. These
power calculations assume the admission data is parametric
(which it usually isn’t), an alpha level of 0.05 and power 0.80,
without Fisher’s correction (or 151 patients per group if we apply a corrected chi-square). Such a pivotal study of around 150
patients per arm seems feasible compared with other studies of
medications designed to show reductions in hospital admissions
in COPD.
Other studies have applied different types of telemedicine
in COPD. Mair et al. reported technical difficulties (16) and
patient reticence (17) in implementing a real-time home video
monitoring at set times for COPD patients so we chose simpler equipment, offered telemedicine in addition to rather than
_instead of home nurse visits; as we did not require real time_
monitoring, our patients had greater time flexibility in inputting
data. Finally, we recruited from patients well known to the
specialist teams, rather than from emergency departments (17)
where patient engagement may be lower. For these reasons, our
recruitment and installation was complete within 4 weeks of
receiving ethical approval. Our 18 ‘refusers’ had similar sociodemographics and QoL scores post PR, as the participants
(details omitted). We hoped that continuous monitoring might
ameliorate exacerbations or reduce unnecessary visits to or by
caregivers. The docobo HUB is compact, simple to use and has
been used successfully in conditions other than COPD (18–20).
A small study from Portugal using the docobo HUB in remote
home monitoring for COPD, reported reductions in symptoms
and demand activity on the hospital. This was a conference abstract reported in a magazine and more details are awaited. Dale

et al. reported the effects of a different home monitoring system
(recording pulse, saturations and body weight) for patients with
COPD over a 3-month period (21).
This seemed to avert some of the predicted increase in hospital admissions but it is difficult to tease out the effects of
the monitoring from the protocol’s additional daily telephone
calls that are not feasible in most settings. Vontetsianos et al.
used telemedicine monitoring via a visiting nurse in 18 ‘wellmotivated’ patients with advanced COPD who had previous
admissions. They reported a decrease in hospitalizations, emergency visits and use of health services but the patient’s disease
knowledge and self-management also improved (15).
Again, it is difficult to see what additional benefit the realtime video link offered on its’ own as it was only set up during the
nurse home visits. Maiolo et al studied 30 patients with various
respiratory illnesses, on long-term oxygen. 23 completed the
study and they found that twice weekly home monitoring of
heart rate and arterial oxygen saturations was associated with
50% reduction in hospital admissions, 56% reduction in acute
exacerbations and overall cost savings of 17% (14).
Importantly, none of these studies were randomized control
trials but a ‘before and after’ trial design, akin to one of our
secondary endpoints. Such studies could be influenced by other
changes in clinical and social care and treatment of co-morbidity.
We emphasize that our system was not ‘real’ time, but a
store and forward’ type of monitoring with usually a 12–24hour delay between patient upload and the data being accessed
by the CDMT. Equipment offering immediate interaction with
a nurse may have different effects on health care utilization.
However, we do not believe this is the reason for our lack of
benefit because most COPD exacerbations develop over several
days rather than minutes or hours (9).
We were not using telemedicine to deliver a home exercise
program or other intervention to improve health outcomes. Such
an active process of educational approach, rehabilitative prescription and life style change is difficult to deliver effectively
through a simple device alone, but a change in at least quality of life and fitness leading to reduced health care utilization
may occur if this was combined with a continuous educational
reinforcement by nurses.
Did we choose the most appropriate target population? It
was a pre-requisite of the Better Breathing Study that participants had completed PR, which itself can influence study selection, enrollment, and outcome measures (22) so whether the
results can be generalized to other patients remains a question. In addition, our home CDMT service is multifaceted
and evidence-based (23). Hospital at home is recommended
in national guidelines (24) and our local CDMT’s creation has
very recently been evaluated and itself associated with reduced
COPD admissions, from a mean of 1.14 (median 1.0, IQR 0,
2.0) admissions, in the year preceding CDMT to a mean of
0.79 per patient (median 0.0, IQR 0, 1.0) in the year following. CDMT (p < 0.005) (25). It is therefore very likely that
our participants were already optimized so that additional telemonitoring (or other treatments) may add little clinical benefit
and we believe this is the main reason for our negative re

sult. The relatively (and unexpectedly) persistent low number
of healthcare contacts in both groups, especially hospital admissions, reflect the optimization and selection of our study population and the importance of applying a randomized trial rather
than a ‘before and after’ that is more influenced by concurrent
developments.
Strengths of our study include the randomized design with
overall good matching for most confounders. However, we did
not match on all baseline variables (as n 20) and we did not
=
have enough numbers to stratify the randomisation. The Tm
group had lower BMI, besides longer time from PR and worse
MRC and these could work against showing benefit in the Tm
group results. Our subject demographics are typical of those
with moderate-to-severe COPD, and although we included only
those who agreed to and completed PR, our PR program is based
on well-researched models.
Although many rural COPD services do not have access to
PR it is recommended for people with chronic lung disease who
remain symptomatic despite optimal medication in all guidelines. We are based in a non-teaching hospital unit serving a
town and rural population so our findings can be generalized to
both settings. Those collecting health care utilization data were
unaware of group allocation and we used more than 1 measure of
health contacts that all showed similar patterns. Our Tm technology was simple, readily deployed with minimum training
and widely used hence providing excellent data capture in the
monitoring period. We had 85–90% response rate of QoL questionnaires throughout the study, so lack of usage /engagement
was not a reason for the negative result.
The main weakness of the study is its small size; we chose
40 patients mainly due to funding (machine) constraints but also
because both staff and patients had never used home monitors
before and there was no funding for additional personnel. We
wanted to create a sustainable model in a real world setting
and asking inexperienced staff to start monitoring daily data
on up to 100 people in addition to their normal duties would
not be successful. Based on certain assumptions, we hoped that
20 patients per group would be enough to show differences
in hospital admissions as well as simultaneously establishing
safety and feasibility. By having a small (pilot) study we cannot
exclude the possibility especially of a Type 2 statistical error,
i.e., of failing to reject the null hypothesis when a true difference
really exists.
Certainly a reduction in admissions from 7 to 4 is encouraging and even avoiding one severe hospital acquired infection and prolonged stay on intensive care could still be
clinically important. We have not performed a cost-effective
analysis. There have been calls for better-designed studies of
telemedicine, noting in particular the lack of randomized controlled trials (26). This is the first such study of telemedicine in
the home monitoring of stable, optimized COPD patients who
have all had PR. It is important because although it shows telemonitoring is safe and very feasible in this group, and despite
being well used, it is not associated with significant changes
in specialist healthcare utilization. To avoid the possibility of
statistical errors, we believe that a 1:1 randomised controlled

-----

trial of around 150 patients per group is needed to establish a
good argument for Tm in optimized patients.
In summary, we believe that their primary care physicians,
without telemonitoring, can probably follow up such a stable
population. However, we do not want to throw the baby out
with the bath water! It is important that future studies on telemonitoring in COPD also look more closely at other (less optimized) groups such as those with multiple hospital contacts,
those unable to complete PR and those without community team
support or use telemedicine to deliver an intervention such as
PR. However, until adequately designed studies are performed,
telemedicine may never become fully accepted by most clinicians or purchased by providers with increasingly limited resources.
