###### Aim Remote follow-up (FU) of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) allows for fewer in-office visits in combination with
earlier detection of relevant findings. Its implementation requires investment and reorganization of care. Providers
(physicians or hospitals) are unsure about the financial impact. The primary end-point of this randomized prospective
multicentre health economic trial was the total FU-related cost for providers, comparing Home Monitoring facilitated
FU (HM ON) to regular in-office FU (HM OFF) during the first 2 years after ICD implantation. Also the net financial
impact on providers (taking national reimbursement into account) and costs from a healthcare payer perspective
were evaluated.

###### Methods A total of 312 patients with VVI- or DDD-ICD implants from 17 centres in six EU countries were randomised to HM ON and results or OFF, of which 303 were eligible for data analysis. For all contacts (in-office, calendar- or alert-triggered web-based


A total of 312 patients with VVI- or DDD-ICD implants from 17 centres in six EU countries were randomised to HM ON
or OFF, of which 303 were eligible for data analysis. For all contacts (in-office, calendar- or alert-triggered web-based
review, discussions, calls) time-expenditure was tracked. Country-specific cost parameters were used to convert
resource use into monetary values. Remote FU equipment itself was not included in the cost calculations. Given only
two patients from Finland (one in each group) a monetary valuation analysis was not performed for Finland. Average
age was 62.4 + 13.1 years, 81% were male, 39% received a DDD system, and 51% had a prophylactic ICD. Resource
use with HM ON was clearly different: less FU visits (3.79 + 1.67 vs. 5.53 + 2.32; P, 0.001) despite a small increase
of unscheduled visits (0.95 + 1.50 vs. 0.62 + 1.25; P, 0.005), more non-office-based contacts (1.95 + 3.29 vs.
1.01 + 2.64; P, 0.001), more Internet sessions (11.02 + 15.28 vs. 0.06 + 0.31; P, 0.001) and more in-clinic discussions (1.84 + 4.20 vs. 1.28 + 2.92; P, 0.03), but with numerically fewer hospitalizations (0.67 + 1.18 vs. 0.85 + 1.43,
P ¼ 0.23) and shorter length-of-stay (6.31 + 15.5 vs. 8.26 + 18.6; P ¼ 0.27), although not significant. For the
whole study population, the total FU cost for providers was not different for HM ON vs. OFF [mean (95% CI): E204

## Introduction

Over the last years remote monitoring of implanted devices like
implantable defibrillators (ICD) has been introduced. All stakeholders see potential benefits: physicians and hospitals (the ‘providers’) may optimize performance by reducing the number of
in-hospital visits, while specialist nurses and/or technicians can
filter alerts from the remote system, hence possibly saving physician
time.[1] For patients, the technology provides a more continuous
follow-up (FU) and saves time for visits to outpatient clinics that
often do not result in specific actions.[2][,][3] Many studies have shown
that remote technology results in patient care that is non-inferior
to classical FU with in-office visits.[1][,][4] [–] [8] Especially daily remote monitoring results in earlier detection of device and patient-related problems which translate into earlier clinical decision-making, less
inappropriate shocks and improved device longevity.[7] [–] [9] The
CONNECT trial also showed a significant reduction in the length
of cardiovascular hospitalizations[9] and the IN-TIME trial even
showed a mortality benefit in ICD patients with heart failure.[10]

Some trials have looked as secondary end-points at the cost impact
from the perspective of the healthcare payer.[6][,][11] There is data indicating that healthcare payers may have a dominant strategy option
with remote ICD monitoring, since costs may be reduced and outcomes improved with remote FU.
While investigators have evaluated the time needed from physicians and nurses/technicians for remote monitoring,[12] [–] [14] a formal
cost analysis from the providerviewpointhas neverbeen performed.
Nevertheless, the net financial impact on providers will influence
their willingness to change care models from reimbursed in-hospital
visits to remote evaluation, especially when the latter is not reimbursed and given the investments needed to train nurses and
employthosefortheFUactivities.[15] Industryhastoprovideadditional hardware (transmitters), set up infrastructure (servers) and take
care of communication costs, which are not covered separately
from the device price. If all stakeholders want to stimulate a reorganization of FU for ICD patients towards remote monitoring, they need
to know its cost structure to ensure proper financing for the future.
Therefore,the primaryobjective of this EuroEco trial wasto evaluate
theimpacton thecostfor providerswhen relying on Home Monitoring (HM)-based FU compared with classical FU with only in-office
visits.Sincereimbursementsystemsareveryheterogeneousindifferent European countries, secondary objectives were to study the


impact on the providers’ net clinical income for FU, and the costs
for ICD FU with or without remote monitoring from a healthcare
payer perspective. Further secondary end-points were the rate of
in-office FU visits with relevant findings and patient-reported
quality-of-life assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire.

## Methods

##### Study design

The European Health Economic Trial on HM in ICD Therapy was a randomized, non-blinded, parallel-design trial in which 17 centres from six
European countries (Belgium 3 centres, Finland 1, Germany 4, UK 3,
Spain 4, The Netherlands 1) participated. To be enrolled, patients had
to meet the standard indication for a new or replacement VVI- or
DDD-ICD enabled with HM technology capable of electrogram transmission (Biotronik ICDs models Lumos, n ¼ 3, or Lumax, all others).
There were no further clinical in- or exclusion criteria except age ≥18
years. A CRT-cohort was started as an extension and is still enrolling.
Patients were enrolled prior to ICD implantation, after which they
were randomized 1 : 1 to receive regular in-office FU visits (HM OFF
group) or a HM facilitated FU regime (HM ON group) for the next
2 years. Three in-office FUs were mandatory for all the patients (within
6 weeks after discharge, 12 + 1 and 24 + 2 months after discharge)
(see Figure 1). Further in-office FU visits were scheduled according to
each centre’s individual routine for the HM OFF patients only. Unscheduledin-officeFUvisitsinitiatedbythephysicianorthepatientcouldoccur
in both patient groups at any time during the study. Patients randomized
to HM ON wereundercontinuous, automatic remote monitoring during
the entire study. The frequency of HM data analysis and the response to
HM alerts was left to the investigators’ discretion.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Theprotocol wasapprovedby theEthics Committees of all participating institutions and the trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov
under identifier NCT00776087. All the patients gave their written
informed consent to participate in the trial.

##### Medical and resource use data collection

All medical contactsof thepatients wererecordedoverthe course of the
trial frompaperorelectronic charts, including contactswith the provider
(in-office,plannedorweb-baseddatareviewfollowingalerts,internaldiscussions, phone calls) as well as visits to other physicians, additional
medical examinations, and hospital admissions. All actions taken were
evaluatedforclinical relevance byan investigator blinded to group assignment and based on pre-specified criteria. A second blinded scientist


-----

double-checked the decisions. Patients self-reported their quality-of-life
using SF-36 at randomization, and after 1 and 2 years of FU.
For all provider contacts (including internal discussions between staff
members, phone calls, and unscheduled visits), staff time consumption


(type of staff and duration) was tracked, often using purpose-built electronic documentation tools (web-based time-tracking software that
wasactivated at the opening and closureof any contact; dedicatedchronometers; automatic logging of calls on mobile phones of nurses and/or


-----

physicians). All study personnel was trained to log time on contacts for
EuroEco patients. Data were later entered in paper-based case report
forms. The hospital charts of the patients were clearly labelled to
remind study personnel about the patient’s inclusion in the trial and the
need for time logging.

##### Monetary valuation: healthcare costs

Cost analysis was conducted from the provider perspective and from the
healthcare payer perspective. Provider net income was calculated as the
difference between payer reimbursement for FU services and provider
cost related to FU. Country-specific tariffs and staff costs were used to
convert measured resource use into monetary values and calculate the
costs per patient. Non-medical costs (overhead) were derived from calculated staff time and estimated office space, based on nationally
accepted percentages. Given only two patients from Finland (one in
each group) cost calculations were not performed for this country.
Remote monitoring equipment itself wasnot included in the costcalculations because of its arbitrary values; we rather opted for an analysis that
shows payers possible margins for reimbursement of the technology
based on their overall budget impact.
Payer costs were based on diagnosis-related groups tariffs, national or
regional fee-for-service tariffs, public general hospital tariffs, or publications at the end of 2013. If geographic differences were noted within a
single country, a mid-point estimate of the various observed tariffs was
taken. All costs were expressed in Euro (E). If not available, 2013 costs
were estimated by applying an appropriate inflation factor to previous
year costs using the country-specific consumer price index.
A stratified exploratory analysis comparing countries with different
reimbursement systems was pre-specified as a secondary end-point.
The challenges of an appropriate method for analysing healthcare data
fromdifferentjurisdictionshavebeendiscussedbyothers.[16] [–] [18] Arecommended method to calculate the costs for a given country is to consider
the resource use of all patients in the sample and then apply to these
resources cost data for that country. However, this method can only
be applied if resource use is homogeneous within the sample. Key
resource utilization data from the different countries (number of FU
visits,timespentbyhealthcareworkers,hospitalizationdata)weretherefore analysed using generalized linear modelling to verify whether they
were sufficiently homogeneous to be a valid basis for calculating countryspecific costs. Overall heterogeneity in resource use was detected. Two
sets of countries with homogeneous utilization (mainly based on the
number of FU visits to the provider centre) were identified, comprising
Belgium, The Netherlands, and the UK in one group and Finland,
Germany, and Spain in another.

##### Statistical methods

The sample size estimate was based on an anticipated reduction of total
time needed for FU by 14.5 min over 2 years, derived from early nonrandomized trialsand investigatordatabases.Foratwo-sided significance
level of 5% to detect this difference and a power of 80%, 312 patients
were needed. Ahead of database closure, statistical analysis plans were
developed for the clinical and the health economic evaluation, respectively, defining all analytical details. The SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc.,
USA) was used to evaluate utilization data and to undertake cost calculations. Categorical variables were described by number and frequency of
thenon-missingdataandcomparedbetweenarmsusingtheFisher`sexact
test. Continuous variables such as number of FU visits were not normally
distributed and were therefore compared between arms using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test. All tests were interpreted two-sided,
at a 5% level of significance.


For the analysis of the SF-36v2 questionnaires, Health Outcomes
Scoring Software 4.5 (QualityMetric Incorporated, Lincoln, RI, USA)
was used. Thereby, raw data of the SF36-items were transformed into
eight subscores by using the QualityMetric’s Missing Score Estimator.
These variables were transformed in subscores based on 2009 US
norms, from which the mental health sum-score MCS and physical
health sum-score (PCS) were calculated. In addition to both sum-scores,
subscores before norm-basing were analysed with respect to any difference between HM ON vs. HM OFF to rule out any bias caused by using
the standard US norm for European patients. For the purpose of comparative analysis, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was
applied here as well.
Cost per patient was described by mean, standard deviation, median,
minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Confidence
intervals were generated using the non-parametric bootstrapping
method with 1000 replicates. If the 95% CI for difference excluded
zero, the cost differences was considered statistically significant at the
P ¼ 0.05 level. The data were bootstrapped by study arm to ensure
the treatment balance remained constant. Costs were calculated for
the whole mix of patients as enrolled in the study, and also by country
based on its corresponding grouping of resource utilization data (see
above).
Pre-specified subgroups were evaluated in a multivariate analysis for
their impact on provider and payer costs. These subgroups were
single- vs. dual-chamber ICD, primary vs. secondary prevention indication, NYHA class ≤II and ≥III, and age below vs. above median, apart
from HM ON vs. OFF and country.

## Results

#### Patientcharacteristicsandstudyexecution

Of 312 patients enrolled between July 2008 and July 2011, 303 were
eligible for FU data analysis and constituted the actual sample size
(159 randomized to HM ON, 144 randomized to HM OFF) since
nine patients terminated the study prematurely without providing
any data after randomization (BE n ¼ 87, FI n ¼ 2, DE n ¼ 88, UK
n ¼ 47, ES n ¼ 54, NL n ¼ 25). The baseline characteristics of the
twostudygroupsweresimilar(Table 1)exceptfortherateofpatients
with a primary prophylactic indication, which was higher in the HM
ON group.
Six patients crossed over from HM OFF to ON for medical
reasons. In four cases, the investigator stopped study participation
for these patients, while the other two were analysed according to
the intention-to-treat principle. A total of 61 patients (20.1%) terminated the study before the pre-specified 24-month FU visit, mainly
due to death or other clinical end-points (Figure 1). The remaining
242 patients terminated the study as planned at the 24-month FU.
The median FU duration after randomization was 24.0 months
(IQR: 23.1–24.5) in those patients and 11.9 months (IQR: 5.1–
19.4) in patients with early termination, without differences
between study groups.

#### Resource utilization during follow-up

During thewholestudy period,HMON patients had significantlyless
scheduled in-office FU visits than HM OFF patients (Table 2). Despite
a significantly higher number of unscheduled in-office FU visits in the
HM ON group, the total number of FU visits was still significantly
lower with HM ON (3.79 + 1.67 vs. 5.53 + 2.32, P, 0.001). On


-----

theotherhand,theHMONgrouphadsignificantlymoreFUcontacts
outside of FU visits (i.e. phone calls) and internal discussions among
staff (Table 2). There were no significant changes in the utilization
of other healthcare services, although there were numerically
fewer cardiovascular hospitalizations and shorter length-of-stay in
the HM ON patients (Table 2).
The average time spent on each of the above-mentioned contacts
wasnotsignificantlydifferentforHMONvs.OFFpatients,neitherfor
physicians, nurses nor technicians (Table 2). Figure 2 showsthe cumulative time spent on every patient for all contacts combined: HM did
not change the total time needed for follow-up, nor the cumulative
time for all types of personnel combined: over the study period,
176 min of staff time per patient were required for HM ON vs.
178 min in HM OFF patients (NS). Only physicians spent significantly
less time for patients in HM ON, but the difference was small (64 vs.
73 min, P ¼ 0.028).

#### Costs for follow-up

Figure 3A shows the monetary valuation of the time needed by different provider personnel during FU and the non-medical costs (mainly
overhead): from a provider perspective, the average cost for FU
during 2 years was not different for the HM ON and OFF groups

[mean (95% CI): E204 (169–238) vs. E213 (182–243); range for


difference (E236 to 54), NS], without differences in either direct
medical or non-medical costs. For the average trial patient, also the
FU-related reimbursement was identical, leading to an unaffected
net clinical income for the provider [profit of E408 (327–489) vs.
E400 (345–455); range for difference (E2104 to 88), NS].
From a payer perspective (Figure 3 B), there was a small albeit not
statistically significant decrease in total costs over a 2-year period
(excluding the cost of the device and of any remote monitoring equipment or communication costs). The main cost driver for payers is the
number of hospitalization days for patients: in line with numerically
fewer hospitalizations and a shorter length-of-hospital stay, there
was a numerical (non-significant) reduction in hospitalization costs.
There wasno difference in the costs related to non-provider physician
visits or examinations.
Multivariable testing showed that the cost for providers was only
significantly dependent on the country (P, 0.001), while for total
payer cost only the type of ICD (VVI vs. DDD) had a significant
impact (P, 0.001). Costs were not dependent on primary or
secondary indication for implant (Table 3).
Figure 4 illustrates the heterogeneity among countries, with less
profit for providers in the absence of specific remote FU reimbursement (left side: Belgium, Netherlands, and Spain) vs. maintained or increased profit in case such reimbursement exists


-----

-----

(right side: Germany and UK). Nevertheless, the overall costs from
the payer perspective were numerically lower in countries without
reimbursement, and were similar in those with reimbursement
(Figure 5).

#### Other secondary end-points

There were no differences between HM ON and OFF in any of the
SF-36 patient-reported quality of life measures, not at baseline, and
not at 1 year or 2 years of FU, and there were no changes during
the course of the study in any of the measures: PCS at enrolment
was 44.7 + 9.3 for HM ON vs. 45.2 + 9.7 for HM OFF, with respectivevalues at1 year 43.9 + 11.1 vs. 45.1 + 10.2, and at 2 years 44.4 +
11.0 vs. 45.4 + 10.6; MCS at enrolment 48.8 + 10.6 for HM ON vs.
46.8 + 11.3 for HM OFF, and at 1 and 2 years 49.3 + 10.2 vs. 48.9 +
10.2 and 48.0 + 11.5 vs. 47.8 + 10.8, respectively (all inter- and
intragroup comparisons non-significant). In the HM ON group,
32.0% of in-office FU visits (193/603) resulted in a clinically relevant
finding/action (‘actionable visits’) compared with 26.8% (213/795) in
the HM OFF group (P, 0.05).

## Discussion

Although remote monitoring technology of cardiac implantable
devices entered the clinical field ≏10 years ago, EuroEco is the first
trial estimating the cost for providers in setting up an organization
based on such technology. Prior trials have shown that such FU is
non-inferior clinically from a major events perspective, and even
has clinical advantages like earlier actionability on clinical- or
device-related findings, fewer and shorter hospitalizations, fewer
inappropriate shocks, longer battery longevity, and even lower
mortality.[1][,][6][,][7][,][9][,][10][,][14] Taken together with data on the existing
reimbursement situation (defining provider income) and on the
costs from a payer perspective, EuroEco also allowed to estimate
the impact on the net income of physicians and hospitals. The financial
impact isan important determinant forphysicians andhospitals when
considering adoption of a remote monitoring-based FU. The findings
in the overallEuroEco populationshowedno change in providercost
of HM based vs. classical FU, nor on their net income. The HM ON
arm included significantly more patients with a primary prophylaxis
indication (who could be expected to require less intensive FU or
have less complications), but multivariate analysis did not show a significantimpactofthisvariableonprovidercosts.Althoughthesample
size calculation was based on time investment findings, cost valuation
was not used as basis for the power calculations. The aspect of heterogeneity in cost between the countries was underestimated. This
may have decreased the initially calculated power. Nevertheless,
the very close values for both arms for total time investment and
for the primary end-point make it very unlikely that a higher sample
size might have found different overall results.
In contrast to the overall trial population result, the patterns of
provider net income in individual countries are of most relevance
when interpreting the study data. In countries that have already
implemented reimbursement for remote monitoring (like the UK
and Germany), provider net income will increase, thus leading to
an incentive to use remote monitoring. It is very plausible that in
other countries (like Belgium, The Netherlands, or Spain in our


-----

study), theremaybemoreincentivestomaintainclassicin-officeFUs,
sincethat istheonlywaytogetreimbursementforFUactivities, costs

An interesting observation is that the total cost for the insurance
payer decreases, albeit not significantly, and does not even increase
in countries that have already implemented remote FU


-----

reimbursement,showingthatthereisroomforsuchpropercompensationofproviders.EuroEcoobservednumericallyfewerandshorter
hospitalizations, findings that corroborate with similar results from
other ICD trials such as ECOST (with non-significant lower hospital
costs) and CONNECT (showing a significantly shorter length of
stay)[9][,][11] as well as from pacemaker trials such as COMPAS and
Oedipe.[7][,][19] EuroEco did not make any cost-effectiveness calculations, since the payer perspective was not the primary one, and
since the trial was not powered to detect significant differences in
clinical outcome parameters. As the SF-36 measurements indicated,
we could also not detect a significant difference in health-related
quality-of-life, although prior trials have shown a high level of
patient acceptance and satisfaction.[3]

In our cost analysis, we deliberately did not take into account any
remote monitoring equipment itself, nor did we include communication costs, because such costs could be criticized as being arbitrary
since mainly based on unilateral estimates by the manufacturer.
Nevertheless, given the overall lower costs for payers with remote
monitoring, EuroEco will allow informed discussions between all
parties (payers, providers, and manufacturers) to come to balanced
reimbursement scenarios forall. Scientific organizations and industry
have already developed frameworks on how to provide appropriate
reimbursement for device telemonitoring, with general principles
and country-specific measures.[20][,][21] The EuroEco data may certainly
serve to specify these recommendations further.
While we are confident about the direction of the findings on
income impact of remote monitoring in different countries, we
want to raise caution about the absolute values of the calculated
costs and reimbursements which should not be taken for granted.
First, there was no statistical significance in any of the cost comparisons HM ON vs. OFF in the individual country scenarios, which may
be related to the smaller groups as result of the splitting of the whole
populationdue to heterogeneity of utilization data. Second, cost data
were derived from country-based national databases and tariffs,
which may not always be fully representative of a specific hospital’s
situation. Third, only a few centres per country participated and


these centres do not necessarily represent the average practice in
each country. Also, there may have some underreporting of the utilization data in the trial. In contrast to other clinical trials, in which a
pre-specified regimen is guiding data gathering, investigators and
nursesinEuroEcohadtodevelopareflexofdocumentingallcontacts
and their timing when dealing with study ICD patients, often unexpectedly (alerts, phone calls, . . .). Although we developed specific
tools to facilitate this work, some contacts may have gone undocumented. Nevertheless, our time measurements found higher time
consumption for FU in EuroEco compared with some previous
trials. For example, the total nurse + technician time for remote
FU (i.e. excluding the in-office visits) documented in EuroEco was
59 min per patient over 2 years, which would equal to ≏246 min
per month for 100 patients followed. Earlier trials estimated this
cumulative time ≏43, 59,[14][,][22] and 660 min,[13] a difference which
may be related to the different tasks included in the analysis.
The saving in physician time was only modest in EuroEco (73 vs.
64 min over 2 years; P ¼ 0.028) and total physician time was higher
than in other trials,[13][,][22] despite a similar significant reduction of
in-office visits. This may be due to a learning curve, where physicians
tended to do more of the HM work in the early phase of adoption,
while relaying more to trained nurses in a later phase. EuroEco was
startedin2008,i.e.shortafterHMtechnologywasadoptedintheclinical field. Also, our trial did a much more detailed and diverse time
tracking of physician commitments during FU than other studies,
including internal discussions, phone calls and unscheduled visits.
This can also explain why other trials also reported a much lower
physician- than nurse-time (10–25%) while both were comparable
over the full trial period in our study.[13][,][14] Nevertheless, our data indicate that HM allows reducing physician time and shifting it to other
competent staff members,which is one oftheprime driversof healthcare reform allover theworld.Thedisparity between nurseandtechnician time, as seen in EuroEco,may reflect country-based differences
that inessencemightnotbefundamental:both nursesand technicians
were specifically qualified personnel for device FU in all centres.
Hence, the activities performed by a study nurse in one centre


-----

could be regarded interchangeable with the responsibilities of technicians in other practices/countries. Also the EHRA reporton resource
use during device FU revealed these regional differences.[23]

This EuroEco report only deals with VVI- and DDD-ICD patients.
The study has been extended by also including heart failure patients
with a cardiac resynchronization ICD (CRT-D), for whom a more
complex and time-intensive clinical and device FU can be anticipated.
It needs to be seen in how far the health-economic results reported
here can be extended to the CRT-D population.


## Conclusion

For all the patients as a whole in the EuroEco trial, FU-related costs
for providers were not different for FU based on remote monitoring
vs. purely in-office FU of VVI- or DDD-ICD patients, despite reorganized care with clearly different utilization patterns. The costs for the
payers of healthcare were also statistically similar, although with
numerically decreased costs if HM ON, related to numerically
fewer and shorter hospitalizations. Disparity in the impact on


-----

provider budget among different countries illustrates the need
for proper reimbursement to ensure effective implementation of
remote FU.
