### Abstract

**Background:** Telehealth based on advanced information technology is an emerging health care strategy for managing chronic
diseases. However, the cost-effectiveness and clinical effect of synchronous telehealth services in older patients with cardiovascular
diseases has not yet been studied. Since 2009, the Telehealth Center at the National Taiwan University Hospital has provided a
range of telehealth services (led by a cardiologist and staffed by cardiovascular nursing specialists) for cardiovascular disease
patients including (1) instant transmission of blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiography, oximetry, and glucometry for
analysis, (2) mutual telephone communication and health promotion, and (3) continuous analytical and decision-making support.
**Objective:** To evaluate the impact of a synchronous telehealth service on older patients with cardiovascular diseases.
**Methods:** Between November 2009 and April 2010, patients with cardiovascular disease who received telehealth services at
the National Taiwan University Hospital were recruited. We collected data on hospital visits and health expenditures for the
6-month period before and the 6-month period after the opening of the Telehealth Center to assess the clinical impact and
cost-effectiveness of telehealth services on cardiovascular patients.
**Results:** A total of 141 consecutive cardiovascular disease patients were recruited, including 93 aged ≥65 years (senior group)
and 48 aged <65 years (nonsenior group). The telehealth intervention significantly reduced the all-cause admission rate per month
per person in the nonsenior group (pretelehealth: median 0.09, IQR 0-0.14; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P=.002) and the
duration (days per month per person) of all-cause hospital stay (pretelehealth: median 0.70, IQR 0-1.96; posttelehealth: median
0, IQR 0-0; P<.001) with increased all-cause outpatient visits per month per person (pretelehealth: median 0.77, IQR 0.20-1.64;
posttelehealth: mean 1.60, IQR 1.06-2.57; P=.002). In the senior group, the telehealth intervention also significantly reduced the
all-cause admission rate per month per person (pretelehealth: median 0.10, IQR 0-0.18; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P<.001)
and the duration (days per month per person) of all-cause hospital stay (pretelehealth: median 0.59, IQR 0-2.24; posttelehealth:
median 0, IQR 0-0; P<.001) with increased all-cause outpatient visits per month per person (pretelehealth: median 1.40, IQR
0.52-2.63; posttelehealth: median 1.76, IQR 1.12-2.75; P=.02). In addition, telehealth intervention reduced the inpatient cost in
the nonsenior group from $814.93 (SD 1000.40) to US $217.39 (SD 771.01, P=.001) and the total cost per month from US
$954.78 (SD 998.70) to US $485.06 (SD 952.47, P<.001). In the senior group, the inpatient cost per month was reduced from
US $768.27 (SD 1148.20) to US $301.14 (SD 926.92, P<.001) and the total cost per month from US $928.20 (SD 1194.11) to
US $494.87 (SD 1047.08, P<.001).

**Conclusions:** Synchronous telehealth intervention may reduce costs, decrease all-cause admission rates, and decrease durations
of all-cause hospital stays in cardiovascular disease patients, regardless of age.

### Introduction

Elderly individuals are often frail and at high risk for requiring
health care. According to Medicare data, 82% of elderly
individuals living in the United States have chronic conditions
that account for an annual average medical expenditure of US
$5015 per person during 1999 [1]. From research based on a
representative sample of seniors aged over 65 years nationwide
in Taiwan (N=114,873), the prevalence of chronic disease for
seniors is 70.4%, and medical expenditures for seniors with
chronic conditions accounts for 92.7% of the total medical
expenditures for seniors. Among these expenditures,
cardiovascular diseases account for an annual average medical
expenditure as high as US $4291 per person, which ranks it as
the most costly of the chronic diseases in Taiwan [2]. Those
patients with multiple comorbidities requiring continued medical
care tend to be older and they have often been denied access to
hospitals or have faced unequal access to health care, referral,
treatment, or other social security benefits in developed countries

[3,4].

Long-term chronic health conditions are one of the greatest
challenges to worldwide health care systems [5]. Nurse-led case
management for disease control and prevention has been
successful in diabetes [6], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

[7], coronary heart disease [8], and heart failure [9]. This is
particularly true for one of the most deadly diseases in
cardiology, chronic heart failure, in which effective management
is a major problem because of its high prevalence, high treatment
costs, mortality, and morbidity [10]. In addition to heart failure,
cardiovascular diseases also include diverse diseases, such as
coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy,
congenital heart disease, aortic disease, and valvular heart
disease. To date, comprehensive home-based heart failure
management care systems are thought to be effective in reducing
costs and the reliance on prescription drugs, improving clinical
outcomes and functional levels, bolstering patient knowledge
and self-care, prolonging total survival, enhancing drug
adherence, and improving quality of life in the United States,
Canada, Europe, and Australia [9,11-13]. Home-based
interventions have been shown to improve the clinical outcome
and cost-effectiveness of treatment throughout the world despite
differences in ethnicity, costs of treatment, differing medical
practices, and health care systems [14,15]. The weight of
existing evidence led the American College of Cardiology
(ACC) Foundation and the American Heart Association (AHA)
to recommend multidisciplinary disease management programs,
including telemonitoring for patients at high risk for heart failure
as a class I indication, with a class A level of evidence [16].
However, 2 prospective randomized multicenter clinical trials,
the Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes


(Tele-HF) study in 2010 and the Telemedical Interventional
Monitoring in Heart Failure (TIM-HF) study in 2011, used
telehealth monitoring for heart failure patients, but did not
demonstrate a benefit on mortality rates through telemonitoring

[17,18]. The lack of measured benefits was explained as being
a product of several factors: inadequate health care professional
staffing, information overload, and noncompliance to
telemonitoring intervention (in the Tele-HF study). In addition,
the TIM-HF trial was unable to detect clinically relevant
differences in mortality because of low statistical power.

Advances in modern telecommunication technologies, such as
Internet-based rather than telephone-based data exchange
platforms, have provided telehealth medicine a new approach
for chronic disease management [19]. Synchronous telemedicine
involves real-time processing of patient data obtained remotely;
therefore, the patient and care provider need to be
simultaneously available [20]. However, the effect of
synchronous telehealth medicine based on advanced information
technology in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease has
never been studied. The Telehealth Center at the National
Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) began physician-led
synchronous telehealth services in 2009. In this paper, we assess
the clinical impact and cost-benefits achieved using telehealth
services for patients with cardiovascular diseases.

### Methods

##### Patients

The study recruitment strategy followed a nonconcurrent
prospective design, approved by the Institutional Review Board
at NTUH (Taipei, Taiwan), and conducted by the Taiwan
ELEctroHEALTH study group (TELEHEALTH study group).
Informed consent was obtained from all participating patients.
The TELEHEALTH study group was located in the Telehealth
Center of NTUH and launched telehealth services for
cardiovascular disease patients in 2009. In order to include those
patients with diagnosed cardiovascular disease as well as
patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease, patients who
had the following disease conditions were considered for
enrollment in the telehealth service: (1) CAD with or without
percutaneous coronary intervention, (2) myocardial infarction,
(3) congestive heart failure, (4) arrhythmia, including
bradyarrhythmia, tachyarrhythmia, or ventricular arrhythmia
with an implantable cardiac defibrillator implant, (5) diabetes
mellitus, (6) syncope, (7) ≥2 CAD risk factors with angina, and
(8) other surgical or congenital heart conditions. Syncope, which
may be noncardiogenic, was also used as an indication because
biometric information obtained through telemonitoring can be
of value in cases that are caused from orthostatic hypotension
or vasovagal reflex. The main exclusion criterion for the
telehealth service was patient refusal. Between November 2009


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Chen et al


and May 2010, consecutive cardiovascular disease patients were
evaluated for eligibility for telehealth monitoring during
inpatient and outpatient treatment. After obtaining informed
consent, the patient and main caregiver completed a face-to-face
tutorial for operating the manometer, oximeter, glucometer, and
electrocardiography device. Internet access and biometrics
transmission were confirmed before launching the telehealth
service at home. Demographic and clinical data were collected
from all participants, including gender, age, occupation, marital
status, years of schooling, number of people in the household,
main caregiver, clinical comorbidities, biochemistry findings,
and echocardiography study results. The estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the simplified
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. The
clinical expenditure data, including outpatient costs, inpatient
costs, emergency department costs, and total cost of all-cause
health care and the frequency of health care visits (including
emergency department visits, inpatient admissions, inpatient
and outpatient procedures, and outpatient physician visits), were
collected 6 months before and 6 months after the initiation of
the telehealth service.

##### Telehealth Service

There were 3 components to the telehealth services provided.
First, there were real-time transmission of biometrics from the
patients to the health care team, including blood pressure, pulse
rate, electrocardiography, oximetry, and glucometry. Glucometry
was performed in patients with diabetes mellitus and those with
impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance.
Nondiabetic patients did not have glucometry as a
telemonitoring module. Each transmitted clinical biometric was
recorded in health record clouds that were under synchronous
surveillance by the Telehealth Center at NTUH. Second, there
were telephone exchanges between the health care team and
patients for communication and health promotion. Third,
full-time case managers and cardiologists were in charge of care
24 hours a day. The telehealth services included health
education, diet therapy, fluid status evaluation, drug adverse
effects evaluation, drug compliance monitoring, mood or
emotion care, and patient surveillance through the advanced
information technology-based monitor system. Nurse case
managers tracked and scrutinized the clinical information
carefully and contacted the patient or relatives at least once per
day (except in cases in which the patients indicated a preference
against daily interactions) or when abnormal data were
transmitted back to the service station at the Telehealth Center
at NTUH. Patients who were under surveillance by the telehealth
service could also contact the service station by telephone when
subjective or objective abnormalities were a concern. The
clinical information was relayed to the cardiology specialist;
the cardiology specialists made the final judgment and
suggestions regarding care. The Telehealth Center also provided


constant analytical and decision-making support. The
management of these heart failure patients was conducted
according to the ACC/AHA guidelines for heart failure
management [21,22].

##### Study Follow-Up and Endpoint

The clinical impact analysis was based on data from outpatient
and emergency departments, general wards, and intensive care
units. The admission rate, total hospital stay, and hospital costs
(including the emergency department, inpatient, and outpatient
costs) were collected before and after initiation of the telehealth
service. The data were expressed as a monthly average (US $1
equivalent to $31.40 New Taiwan dollars based on the exchange
rate on January 14, 2010).

##### Statistical Analysis

Enrolled participants were divided according to age into 2
groups: the seniors group included patients aged 65 years and
older and the nonseniors group included patients younger than
65 years. Because heart failure is the most-studied
cardiovascular disease in the literature and a higher proportion
of seniors had heart failure in our study, we further stratified
all the participants according to the disease state of heart failure
for analysis. Continuous data are presented as mean and standard
deviation (SD) and the skewed continuous data are presented
as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Discrete data are
given as counts (n) and percentages. The Student’s t test was
applied to compare continuous unpaired data between seniors
and nonseniors; for skewed continuous data, the Mann-Whitney
test was used. The chi-square test was used to compare
categorical data between seniors and nonseniors. The
Shapiro-Francia W' test for normality revealed that the changes
in clinical outcome were not normally distributed. Therefore,
after stratifying the patients according to age and the state of
heart failure, the pretelehealth and posttelehealth clinical
variables as well as the paired continuous data were compared
with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A _P value <.05 was_
considered statistically significant. Stata/SE 11.0 for Windows
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used for
statistical analyses.

### Results

Between November 2009 and May 2010, a total of 141
consecutive cardiovascular disease patients who received
telehealth service from the Telehealth Center at NTUH were
included in this study. Of these 141 patients, the mean age was
68.5 years (SD 14.4), and the mean duration of telehealth service
was 52.7 days (SD 38.2). Among the patients, 56.7% of had
preexisting CAD, 18.4% had a myocardial infarction, 39.7%
had heart failure, and 44.0% had an arrhythmia. The baseline
characteristics are presented in Table 1.

Patients were further stratified according to age. Seniors (aged
≥65 years) comprised 66.0% (93/141) of the total enrollment
with median age 76.3 years (IQR 71.1-80.9 years), and
nonseniors (aged <65 years) accounted for 34.0% (48/141) of
the total enrollment with median age 58.0 years (IQR 49.1-61.0
years). The indication for enrollment between the senior and
nonsenior groups was comparable. Seniors had a significantly
higher proportion of females (46.2% vs 25.0%, P=.01), fewer
years of schooling (mean 10.4, SD 4.7 vs mean 13.1, SD 3.9,
_P=.008), hypertension (88.2% vs 56.3%, P<.001), heart failure_
(45% vs 25%, P=.02), and chronic renal insufficiency (36.6%
vs 14.6%, P=.006). In addition, seniors had a significantly lower
level of hemoglobin (mean 12.4 g/dL, SD 1.8 vs mean 13.3
g/dL, SD 2.8, P=.04) and eGFR (mean 49.7 mL/min, SD 22.6
vs mean 64.2 mL/min, SD 26.4, _P=.001). The number of_
hypertension drugs was comparable between senior and
nonseniors; however, compared to the nonseniors, seniors used
a significantly higher proportion of diuretics (53.8% vs 29.2%,
_P=.005) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or_
angiotensin II receptor blockers (60.2% vs 35.4%, P=.005).

After receiving telehealth services, patients with cardiovascular
diseases had a significantly decreased all-cause admission per
month rate (pretelehealth: median 0.10, IQR 0-0.17;
posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; _P<.001), and decreased_
average days/month duration of all-cause hospital stay
(pretelehealth: median 0.60, IQR 0-2.20; posttelehealth: median


0, IQR 0-0; P<.001), and an increased all-cause outpatient visits
per month rate (pretelehealth: median 1.17, IQR 0.36-2.27;
posttelehealth: median 1.70, IQR 1.15-2.72; _P<.001). There_
was no significant difference in the all-cause emergency
department visit rate.

When stratified according to age, in nonsensiors the average
all-cause admission rate per month was significantly decreased
(pretelehealth: median 0.09, IQR 0-0.14; posttelehealth: median
0, IQR 0-0; P=.002) and the all-cause hospital stay days per
month duration was significantly decreased (pretelehealth:
median 0.70, IQR 0-1.96; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0;
_P<.001), whereas the all-cause outpatient visit rate per month_
was significantly increased (pretelehealth: median 0.77, IQR
0.20-1.64; posttelehealth: median 1.60, IQR 1.06-2.57; P=.002).
In seniors, the average all-cause admission rate per month was
significantly decreased (pretelehealth: median 0.10, IQR 0-0.18;
posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P<.001) and the all-cause
hospital stay days per month duration was significantly
decreased (pretelehealth: median 0.59, IQR 0-2.24;
posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; _P<.001), whereas the_
all-cause outpatient visit rate per month was significantly
increased (pretelehealth: median 1.40, IQR 0.52-2.63;
posttelehealth: median 1.76, IQR 1.12-2.75; P=.02). There was
no significant difference in all-cause emergency department
visit rates in both sensiors and nonsensiors (Table 2).

decreased (pretelehealth: median 2.25, IQR 0.97-4.49;
posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; _P<.001), whereas the_
all-cause outpatient visit rate per month was significantly


increased (pretelehealth: median 1.43, IQR 0.52-2.40;
posttelehealth: median 2.20, IQR 1.36-3.53; _P=.009). There_
was no significant difference in all-cause emergency department
visit rates for heart failure patients and non–heart failure patients
(Table 3).

After initiation of the telehealth service, the expenditure during
inpatient care decreased per month from US $784.15 (SD
1096.74) to US $272.63 (SD 875.08, _P<.001), and the_
expenditure during emergency department care increased per
month from US $19.09 (SD 32.82) to US $28.14 (SD 99.82,
_P=.007). Although, the expenditures for outpatient care_
increased per month from US $134.00 (SD 272.71) to US
$190.76 (SD 376.98, P=.007), the total cost of all-cause health
care decreased per month from US $937.25 (SD 1127.84) to
US $491.52 (SD 1012.45, _P<.001). This pattern of impact_
remained when patients were stratified according to either age
(Table 4) or heart failure status (Table 5).

In our clinical investigation, a real-time telehealth service based
on the combination of information technology and
rapid-response hospital services improved clinical outcomes,
decreased admission rates, and shortened the duration of
all-cause hospital stays for cardiovascular disease patients
younger than 65 years as well as patients older than 65 years.
The telehealth service also provided cost savings by decreasing
the expenses of inpatient and total cost of all-cause health care
in patients younger than 65 years and in those patients older
than 65 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to demonstrate age differences in the clinical impact and
cost-effectiveness of a real-time telehealth service in patients
with cardiovascular diseases.

##### Comparison to Prior Work

In contrast to traditional case management for chronic diseases,
new methods for health promotion and disease control, including
Internet-based interventions, telephonic support, home-based
interventions, and telemedicine sessions, have been employed
for various disease conditions. Telehealth services have been
enthusiastically adopted for patients affected by chronic
conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

[23], diabetes self-management [24], renal failure [25], and


heart failure [26]. Telemedicine is an efficient approach and is
suggested to be an important feature of heart failure management

[9,11-13]. Based on advances in telecommunication technologies
and their utilization in managing heart failure, 4 generations of
telemedicine were proposed: (1) nonreactive data collection and
analysis systems, (2) systems with nonimmediate analytical or
decision-making structure, (3) remote patient management
systems, and (4) fully integrated remote management systems,
including invasive and noninvasive medical devices [20]. From
the positive telephone support results and ongoing
telemonitoring studies, it seems likely that telemedicine will be
an efficient approach and become an important feature of heart
failure management. However, 2 recent randomized clinical
trials in heart failure did not corroborate these findings for
morbidity- and mortality-related endpoints [17,18], and another
telehealth study including elderly patients with multiple medical
issues reported increased mortality rates when telemonitoring
was in use [27]. The contradictory results are likely attributed
to several factors.

Remote telemedicine delivery methods, such as synchronous
(real-time) or asynchronous (store-and-forward) telehealth care
delivery [28], vary and this can affect the clinical impact of
telehealth care. After receiving the biometrics data through
telemonitoring, the manner in which the telehealth service or
telemedical remote management professionals utilize the data
is one of the most important factors determining clinical impact.


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Chen et al


In asynchronous telehealth care delivery, the biometric data can
be transmitted synchronously or asynchronously. The data are
often stored first and reviewed later; therefore, data processing
and remote patient management can be delayed, particularly
outside of office hours. The Tele-HF study is representative of
asynchronous telemonitoring [18] in which biometric data were
reviewed by the patient’s physician every weekday; the Tele-HF
study showed a negative result of telemonitoring in heart failure
patients. In synchronous telehealth care delivery, biometric data
are transmitted and processed on a real-time basis. The patient
and health care provider need to be simultaneously available,
as does the telemedical remote management professional. The
Telemonitoring in the Management of Heart Failure
(TEMA-HF) [29] and TIMF-HF [30] studies are representative
of synchronous telemonitoring which requires a high degree of
health professional participation for processing complex
incoming physiological data and making subsequent therapeutic
decisions. Although the TIM-HF study failed to reveal a clinical
benefit, the TEMA-HF trial showed a reduced mortality rate in
the telemonitoring group. Variations in the degree of urgency
following biometrics transmission may account for the
conflicting results of clinical research [20]. For the biometrics
transmission and remote patient management to be synchronous,
modalities such as telephone touch pad-based telemonitoring

[31], video consultation-based telemonitoring [32], and
iPhone-based telemonitoring [33] have been used. With
advances in modern telecommunication technologies, telehealth
has great potential to improve access to remote health care as
an adjunct to traditional medical management. However, its
adoption in routine health care has been slow, likely due to lack
of clarity regarding the value of telehealth implementation [34].

Differences in selected physiological monitoring parameters
(eg, body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature,
electrocardiography, oxygen saturation, and fasting glucose) in
noninvasive telemedical systems may influence the clinical
outcome. However, the question of which physiological
parameter provides the best benefit for cardiovascular disease
remains unanswered. Alternatively, the solution must be
connected to disease severity and the spectrum of disease.

Different diseases of interest or variations in disease severity
may result in differences in the efficacy of telehealth services.
Heart failure–related diseases with different New York Heart
Association functional classes, different stages of chronic kidney
disease, and different types of cardiorenal syndrome or
associated arrhythmia would fundamentally govern the clinical
course.

Social factors, cultural factors, diet habits, social habits,
adherence to medical prescriptions, self-empowerment,
consumer price index, medical practice behavior, and ethnic
differences may govern the results of telehealth service
investigations. Indeed, the key to telehealth service success is
that the service should offer patients the opportunity to become
actively involved in management of their own health care.
Information sharing and communication techniques provide the
opportunity for health professionals to improve patient health
awareness outside of the hospital and ensure that the patient
plays an active role in their own therapeutic process. The
incorporation of these techniques also will represent a new


approach to the therapeutic relationship, which will emulate the
traditional face-to-face relationship between health care
providers and patients in a remote capacity. Health professionals
that adapt these techniques are able to provide consultations
related to health promotion, disease prevention, and facilitation
of illness recovery in a more responsive manner.

Age is always a major concern in medical practice that should
never be overlooked. Older age is usually an independent
prognostic factor for infectious disease, acute coronary
syndrome, stroke, malignancy, and chronic kidney disease,
among others. Despite not actually being considered a minority
group, elderly patients may be discriminated against in several
health care-related situations. Health insurance providers tend
to exclude elderly patients from obtaining comprehensive
insurance coverage. In developed countries, issues of restricted
access to hospitals or facing unequal access to health care,
referral, and treatment remain [3,4]. Clinical trials tend to
exclude elderly patients [35]; hence, the conclusions reached
in studies of nonelderly populations cannot be extrapolated to
elderly patients. As the elderly population continues to grow,
geriatrics is a burgeoning science and a subspecialty of internal
and family medicine.

There are several concerns about the application of telehealth
services for the elderly. First, elderly patients may have more
comorbidities and chronic diseases that make periodic inpatient
medical care in this group almost inevitable. Therefore,
synchronous telehealth service for senior patients may not work
as effectively as in nonsenior patients. Second, seniors might
not be able to fulfill the telehealth care model completely due
to the decline of their physical and mental condition. Utilizing
computers and learning new communication technology may
be difficult for elderly patients with impaired cognitive and
physical function.

However, our study demonstrated that synchronous telehealth
service can provide cost-effectiveness benefits as well as clinical
benefits for reducing admission rates and duration of hospital
stay regardless of age status. We believe that the success was
because of the support from caregivers and families who built
up the care and fulfilled the complete model of synchronous
telehealth service. Although telehealth services cannot prevent
diseases or major adverse cardiac events from occurring, the
service may still be helpful in early detection of declining health
status and assist in the delivery of timely medical therapy.
Therefore, cost savings can still be achieved in elderly patients.

##### Limitations

There were several limitations of our study. First, the study
design lacked randomization, which resulted in the heterogeneity
of the patient population and disease severity. There were also
no control groups. Therefore, this study was a
quasi-experimental study. Second, the relatively short period
of follow-up may underestimate or overestimate the
cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes of the telehealth service
for patients with cardiovascular disease. Although the initial 6
months of follow-up provided satisfactory results, this initial
benefit may not guarantee a long-standing benefit or reflect
mortality reduction. Third, the diversity of medical prescriptions


-----

and baseline demographic data may potentially confound the
results.

##### Conclusions

The results of our study suggest that synchronous telehealth
intervention may provide cost savings and clinical improvement
in cardiovascular disease patients regardless of age status.
Particularly in patients aged older than 65 years whose
application of telehealth service was in doubt, they also benefit

from reduced health care expenditures, reduced admission rates,
and decreased duration of all-cause hospital stays when their
illnesses are managed by using a telehealth service. In
conclusion, telehealth medicine may be an effective model for
cost savings in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Due to
the limitations of the quasi-experimental study design, these
findings require confirmation in a large randomized controlled
trial in an older adult population with chronic diseases.
