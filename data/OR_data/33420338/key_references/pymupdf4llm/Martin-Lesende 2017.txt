ABSTRACT
Background: Recent evidence indicates that home telemonitoring of chronic patients reduces
the use of healthcare resources. However, further studies exploring this issue are needed in primary care.
Objectives: To assess the impact of a primary care-based home telemonitoring intervention for
highly unstable chronic patients on the use of healthcare resources.
Methods: A one-year follow-up before and after exploratory study, without control group, was
conducted. Housebound patients with heart failure or chronic lung disease, with recurrent hospital admissions, were included. The intervention consisted of patient’s self-measurements and
responses to a health status questionnaire, sent daily from smartphones to a web-platform
(aided by an alert system) reviewed by healthcare professionals. The primary outcome measure
was the number of hospital admissions occurring 12 months before and after the intervention.
Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and number of emergency department attendances. Primary care nurses were mainly in charge of the telemonitoring process and were
assisted by the general practitioners when required.
Results: For the 28 patients who completed the follow-up (out of 42 included, 13 patients died
and 1 discontinued the intervention), a significant reduction in hospitalizations, from 2.6 admissions/patient in the previous year (standard deviation, SD: 1.6) to 1.1 (SD: 1.5) during the oneyear telemonitoring follow-up (P <0.001), and emergency department attendances, from
4.2 (SD: 2.6) to 2.1 (SD: 2.6) (P <0.001) was observed. The length of hospital stay was reduced
non-significantly from 11.4 to 7.9 days.
Conclusion: In this small exploratory study, the primary care-based telemonitoring intervention
seemed to have a positive impact decreasing the number of hospital admissions and emergency
department attendances.

## Introduction

The growing prevalence of chronic health problems and
the pressing need for efficient healthcare resources are
encouraging the adoption of new effective primary care
models. Among such models, home telemonitoring of
patients with chronic diseases could offer a possible


solution. The telemonitoring of patients in a home setting involves the remote transmission of patient clinical
data, allowing subsequent examination by healthcare
professionals. Such flow of frequent clinical information
may facilitate the patient follow-up and enables decision making which in turn, could lead to faster

interventions and avoidance of hospital admissions and
use of other healthcare resources. This approach has
been most widely applied in heart failure (HF) and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Several randomized controlled trials (RCT) and systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses [1–10]
have been recently published regarding the utility of
telemonitoring in reducing hospital admissions and
mortality [1,2,4,8,9] in HF, and in decreasing admissions in COPD patients [7,10]. The effect in emergency
department attendances has been less explored or
there is less evidence regarding this outcome measure.
Among the randomized clinical trials, the ‘whole system demonstrator’ (WSD) deserves a special mention,
because of its size (3230 patients with diabetes, COPD
or HF were included), its practical nature (179 primary
care centres were involved) and the impact on mortality, number of emergency department attendances,
and number of hospital admissions, showing reductions of 45%, 20% and 11%, respectively [11,12].
However, the telemonitoring experiences managed
from primary care are still scarce [13], despite the fact
that chronic patients can receive routine care through
this level of assistance and implementation of such
technology in primary care has been associated with
higher efficiency and lower costs compared to the
hospital level [14,15].
In the previous TELBIL RCT [14,16], the assessment
of a primary care-based telemonitoring intervention
showed a significant decrease in healthcare resources
use [14]. In 2012, the TELBIL-A study was launched,
consisting of an implementation of the previous strategy and further evaluation of the adapted telemonitoring intervention. Marked changes were made seeking
to improve the benefits of the remote monitoring and,
at the same time, fully integrating the process within
actual clinical primary care practice. A high level of
acceptance and satisfaction with the TELBIL-A intervention was observed among both patients/relatives
and healthcare professionals [17,18].
The objective of the present exploratory study was
to assess the influence of a primary care-based home
telemonitoring intervention for highly unstable (complex) chronic patients, within routine clinical practice,
on healthcare resource use (i.e. hospital admissions
and emergency department attendances).

## Methods

Study design and setting

We used a comparative before and after exploratory
study, without a control group. The overall length of


the study (open recruitment of patients during the first
year) was from mid-February 2012 to mid-February
2014, with an individual follow-up per patient of one
year, from the inclusion date up to the following year.
Figure 1 summarizes the general project design.
The study was conducted in the urban-based
Bilbao-Basurto Integrated Healthcare Organization
(IHO), with a catchment population of around 384 000
people. This IHO included a referral hospital and 25
primary healthcare centres (PHC), with 230 general
practitioners (GPs) and 320 nurses.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
for Scientific Research (Basurto University Hospital,
Bizkaia) (19 October 2011) and the Primary Care
Research Committee of the Basque Health Service
(Osakidetza) (18 October 2011). Patients/relatives gave
written informed consent prior to participating in the
study.

Selection of study patients

Inclusion criteria. Adult housebound patients (with
great difficulty or inability to leave their home) with
HF and/or chronic lung disease (CLD) (mainly COPD
and a few of them with asthma), with a history of at
least two hospital admissions in the previous year (and
at least one of them due to the aforementioned conditions) were included in the study. These were also the
patient inclusion criteria in the TELBIL RCT.
For newly included patients, those who as well as
having HF and/or CLD, had markedly impaired functional status (Barthel index <60) due to concomitant
chronic conditions and had two hospital admissions in
the previous year or, alternatively, had several emergency department attendances or hospital admissions
in recent years could also be included in the study.
Owing to the specific inclusion conditions and complexity of the patients, and based on previous records
and lists used in the TELBIL RCT, we estimated that
there would be approximately 80 eligible patients in
the Bilbao-Basurto IHO. According to the ambulatory
care group-predictive modelling (ACG-PM) stratification

[19], 27.6% of patients included in our study were
labelled as ‘complex patients’ coinciding with the tip
of the Kaiser Permanente pyramid. The majority of
them, however, were above the aforementioned level,
giving an indication of the high complexity and
instability of the sample studied.

Exclusion criteria

Patients in residential care, those in terminal phases
with a life expectancy of less than six months due to

(as subjectively judged by their GPs), and those unable
to carry out a continuous follow-up using the telemonitoring equipment were excluded.

Patient recruitment process


multimorbidity at home). Participants gradually joined
the study over a period of one year. Influenced by
budget and time limitations, all potentially eligible
patients could not be included in the study.

Intervention


First, patients belonging to the intervention and control groups of the preceding TELBIL RCT, who wished
to continue or start the telemonitoring were recruited.
Second, new patients were recruited by nurses and
GPs that agreed to participate in the study, once the
project was presented at all PHC and collaboration
was requested. Additionally, recruitment was conducted by the advanced practice nurses (APN,
nurses who specialize in the care of patients with


The telemonitoring consisted of daily self-monitoring
of a patient-specific set of clinical parameters, sent
from the patient’s home using smartphones to a specific Web-platform. Additionally, patients/caregivers
completed a brief health status questionnaire assessing the patient’s perception of his/her medical and
functional condition, together with a series of common
and condition-specific questions. The contents of
the questionnaire were personalized based on the

the criterion of the GP or nurse in charge of the
patient. Table 1 illustrates the default clinical parameters for the patients. When pre-established threshold
values were crossed, red or yellow alerts were
triggered at the web-platform where the data were
transmitted daily.

Study variables

The sociodemographic and clinical baseline information is shown in Table 2. The main outcome measure was the number of hospital admissions that
occurred during the 12 months before and after the
inclusion of each patient in the study. Secondary
outcome measures were the length of hospital stay
per admission and the total number of emergency
department attendances during the year of follow-up
compared to the 12-months prior to telemonitoring.
The information required for the analysis was
obtained from electronic clinical records and discharge clinical reports.


Sample size and power estimation

A power estimation was calculated considering the
42 patients recruited for the study (constrained by
budget and time limitations), using the results
obtained in the preceding intervention group (IG) of
the TELBIL study [14]. A 25% loss to follow-up was
assumed after 12 months, together with a mean of
3.4 all-cause hospital admissions in the year prior to
telemonitoring and a standard deviation (SD) of 2.3
in the difference between the before and after rates.
Based on these data, the study was estimated to
have an 86% statistical power for detecting a 35%
decrease in the number of all-cause admissions during the year of follow-up as statistically significant
(95% confidence).

Data analysis

Patient’s baseline characteristics were defined as
those registered at the end of the telemonitoringfree period. Hence, the baseline values of participants coming from the IG of the TELBIL RCT

corresponded to the measurements taken at the
beginning of that study. Patients’ baseline characteristics were described using means and SD or frequencies according to the quantitative or qualitative
nature of the variables.
Homogeneity between patients lost to follow-up
and patients completing the study was analysed.
When dealing with quantitative variables the t-test
or the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test was performed depending on the fulfilment of the normality
assumption. For qualitative variables, the chi-squared
test or the Fisher’s exact test was conducted.
Homogeneity in baseline characteristics between
patients belonging to the IG of the preceding
TELBIL RCT and newly recruited patients was
checked analogously. A 95% confidence level was
established.
To assess the influence on healthcare resources use
(total and condition-specific admissions, length of hospital stays and emergency department attendances) a
before and after analysis was performed. T-test for
paired samples was carried out when the normality
assumption was met; otherwise, the Wilcoxon signedrank test was used.


## Results

A total of 42 patients were enrolled, 15 of which
belonged to the IG of the TELBIL RCT and 27 were
newly recruited (two patients were included by the
APN). Two patients, out of the 27 newly recruited participants, had a severely impaired functional status
with a Barthel index <60. These two patients had
other chronic diseases on top of HF/CLD that caused a
serious deterioration of their functional status: one
had morbid obesity and HF and the other had had a
stroke and COPD. Three patients from the IG of the
TELBIL RCT were excluded (two refused to continue
and one had advanced mental impairment). Twentyeight patients completed the 12-month follow-up,
11 of them came from the preceding trial. Fourteen
patients were lost to follow-up (13 died and one
declined to continue). Out of the 13 deceased patients,
five died of heart causes, five of respiratory causes and
three as a result of other diseases.

## Discussion

Main findings

Hospital admissions. The results of this small exploratory
study appear to show that the impact of the intervention on the reduction of hospital admissions and emergency department attendances seemed to be greater
than in the previous TELBIL RCT [14], probably due to
the positive influence of the modifications made to the
intervention. The before and after analysis, showed a
statistically significant decrease in the number of hospital admissions during the 12-month telemonitoring


period compared to the previous year. This finding is in
agreement with other studies [3,6–10,12,20].
Emergency department attendances. Moreover, a significant decrease in the number of emergency department attendances was observed. Specifically, the mean
number of total attendances fell from 4.2 in the
12-month period before telemonitoring to 2.1 during
the 12-month follow-up. A similar decrease was also
noted in other studies, such as the WSD project, which
reported a 20% reduction [12], although there is considerably less published evidence regarding this outcome measure. Nevertheless, the percentage of
emergency department attendances without subsequent hospital admissions increased, which could be a
positive indicator, since a higher percentage of emergency department attendances could have been
solved without the need for admission.
Length of hospital stay. A notable reduction of
length of the hospital stays was noticed, which, despite not being statistically significant, was consistent
with other telemonitoring studies of patients with HF
or COPD [2,12,13]. In the present study, the mean
length of stay decreased by 3.5 days after telemonitoring, which could have had a substantial impact both
on the quality of life of the patients/relatives and on
the costs associated with hospitalization. Such a reduction of hospital stay could be due to the early detection and treatment of exacerbating factors.
Satisfaction of professionals and patients. In addition
to the positive impact on the use of healthcare resources, the high level of satisfaction of the healthcare
professionals and patients/relatives with the telemonitoring in the TELBIL-A study constitutes a key factor
that may influence the successful uptake of such interventions [17,18]. Other studies have also shown that
healthcare professionals are generally satisfied with
telemedicine activities when they are closely involved

[21–23], although results are not consistent [24,25].

Strengths and limitations

Unlike the preceding TELBIL study, a RCT focused on
efficacy, this study closely reflects the patient baseline
conditions, since telemonitoring was integrated within


-----

regular clinical practice. We consider that the complexity of the patients included in the study (which had a
high mortality as shown in our previous publications

[26]), focussing on the comorbidity and functionality
more than on specific pathologies, and the control of
telemonitoring by professionals who are usually in
charge of these patients, are the main strengths of the
TELBIL design.
The main limitations of the present study are those
inherent to before and after study designs and the
lack of a control group. Another important limitation is
the fact that this was an exploratory study with a small
sample size. Such limitations should be taken into
account when interpreting the impact observed on
healthcare resources use.
We included patients coming from the preceding
TELBIL RCT, monitored for 2.5 years on average previously, which could bias the results. Nevertheless, the
statistical analysis applied considering the events at
baseline in patients coming from the TELBIL RCT, the
homogeneity analysis at baseline and the subgroup
analysis carried out, counteracted this influence showing that the possible bias introduced was not
substantial.

Implications for clinical practice

The present exploratory study appears to indicate the
utility of a primary care-based telemonitoring intervention for complex chronic patients in reducing healthcare resources use.
Among the key factors for successful implementation of home-care telemonitoring in primary care, we
highlight the positive acceptance and adherence to
telemonitoring of the primary care professionals in
charge of the patients, the promotion of the leading
role of nursing, the institutional support for these kind
of initiatives, the availability of human and material
resources and the reorganization of care processes
within a planned diffusion strategy. We believe that
telemonitoring of complex chronic patients managed
from primary care should be taken further, as the basic
means to ensure coordination of the care of these
patients across care levels.

## Conclusion

In the light of the findings of the present exploratory
study, home telemonitoring of patients with HF or
CLD implemented in real clinical practice and controlled from primary care seemed to have a positive
impact on healthcare resources use, reducing both all-cause and condition-specific hospitalizations and


emergency department attendances, and showing a
decreasing trend for the length of hospital stay.
