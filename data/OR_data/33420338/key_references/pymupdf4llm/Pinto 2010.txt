ABSTRACT
Background Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an efficient
method for treating respiratory failure in patients with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it requires
a process of adaptation not always achieved due to poor
compliance. The role of telemonitoring of NIV is not yet
established.
Objectives To test the advantage of using modem
communication in NIV of ALS patients.
Design Prospective, single blinded controlled trial.
Population and methods According to their residence,
40 consecutive ventilated ALS patients were assigned to
one of two groups: a control group (G1, n 20) in which
¼
compliance and ventilator parameter settings were
assessed during office visits; or an intervention group
(G2, n 20) in which patients received a modem device
¼
connected to the ventilator. The number of office and
emergency room visits and hospital admissions during
the entire span of NIV use and the number of parameter
setting changes to achieve full compliance were the
primary outcome measurements.
Results Demographic and clinical features were similar
between the two groups at admission. No difference in
compliance was found between the groups. The
incidence of changes in parameter settings throughout
the survival period with NIV was lower in G2 (p<0.0001)
but it was increased during the initial period needed to
achieve full compliance. The number of office or
emergency room visits and inhospital admissions was
significantly lower in G2 (p<0.0001). Survival showed
a trend favouring G2 (p 0.13).

Conclusions This study shows that telemonitoring
reduces health care utilisation with probable favourable
implications on costs, survival and functional status.

INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive
and fatal neurodegenerative disease in which
respiratory insufficiency is the most common
terminal event. Non-invasive positive pressure
ventilation (NIV) has become the standard
management to respiratory impairment by
increasing quality of life and reducing the likelihood
of resorting to tracheostomy.[1][e][8] Improved rate of
survival and quality of life seem to correlate with
the earlier prescription of NIV, before diurnal signs
of respiratory failure have been established, with


predicted value or at detection of early signs of
impending nocturnal respiratory insufficiency.[7 9][e][11]

NIV requires a dynamic process of adaptation
which is achieved in an unknown proportion of
patients. Probably, patients with severe bulbar
weakness and marked sialorrhoea have the highest
rate of poor compliance.[12 13] In fact, compliance
with NIV is a complex issue and a recent matter of
debate.[9] 14e17 Certainly, improved tolerance and
compliance can only be reached by continuous
customised setting of the device, which depends on
many factors, such as lung mechanics,[16 18] inspiratory and expiratory triggers, breathing
frequency,[19][e][21] effective correction of blood gases[12 22]

and different metabolic demands. Compliance with
NIV in ALS has only been evaluated in terms of the
number of hours of usage a day, which is very
limited. Nevertheless, most authors have reported
longer survival in patients using NIV for more than
4 h per day.[3 22][e][24]

Recent technological advances have allowed for
more extensive control of the relevant sets in
addition to analysis of the number of hours/day of
utilisation. It is possible to assess breath pressures
and volumes, the percentage of utilisation of
a predetermined target pressure, respiratory rate,
peak flow, number of apnoeas, percentage of leaks
and oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry. It is also
possible to perform online checking and correction
via modem connection, hopefully increasing
patient comfort, tolerance and compliance.[25]

Nonetheless, the advantages of these new technologies have scarcely been evaluated in neuromuscular patients.[26]

To the best of our knowledge, only one study has
compared the effectiveness of an outpatient initiation protocol with the standard inhospital model
for NIV.[22] No study has evaluated the impact on
compliance, function, survival and healthcare
utilisation of ALS patients submitted to wireless
telemetry to control NIV settings, compared with
the office visit approach. We aimed to investigate
this relevant problem.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
From January 2003 to September 2006, all consecutive ALS patients ventilated with a Goodknight
425ST bi-level device (Tyco Healthcare Group LP,
California, USA) were screened and considered for
inclusion in a prospective and controlled trial if at


-----

respiratory insufficiency with an FVC $75% of the predicted
value, PaO2 $80 mm Hg and PCO2 #45 mm Hg, and age
between 18 and 75 years. Patients with gastrostomy, cognitive
impairment or other significant disorders were also excluded
from this trial. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two
groups according to their residential area. Patients included in
group G1 (control) were living in Lisbon; in this group managing
of NIV settings and assessment of compliance were performed
through regular office visits on admission, 2e3 weeks later and
then every 3 months. Patients included in group G2 (intervention) were living outside Lisbon and follow-up was performed
by weekly modem telemonitoring, in addition to regular office
visits at each 3 month interval. All participants were evaluated
with the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) every 3 months
by a physician blinded to the study group. Respiratory functional tests were performed every 6 months by a technician
unaware of the study. All received a helpline number, in addition
to regular office visits.[27 28] Trial duration was established from
NIV adaptation to a follow-up period of 3 years or death.

ALS patients were ventilated in accordance with a set of
criteria that included clinical symptoms, conventional respiratory function tests, as recommended by the American Academy
of Neurology[2] (including FVC and maximal inspiratory pressure),
neurophysiological studies and nocturnal pulse oximetry.[9 10] NIV
was indicated as early as patients agreed after the first symptoms and signs of changes, in an office based setting. NIV is
optimised to improve clinical symptoms and nocturnal pulse
oximetric changes. The procedure includes slow increments in
inspiratory positive air pressure (IPAP) in order to achieve
a steady state with normal breathing patterns, normal pulse rate
and SpO2 >95%, with the backup rate slightly lower than the
patient’s own respiratory frequency.

For NIV compliance follow-up and flexible parameter settings
changes, all participants received a helpline to clarify any doubts
or to seek medical advice whenever difficulties arose. Patients in
G1 were, in addition, also observed 2e3 weeks after entry and
patients in G2 had a modem pre-installation programmed to
communicate every week. Anticipating difficulties and
constraints imposed by continuously monitoring and storing
data, patients in G2 were further instructed to activate the
system once a week or whenever they felt uncomfortable with
the device, after phoning the physician in charge, and were
instructed to call the helpline when needed.
A crucial element of the telemedicine instrument functionality is the remote transmission of data. The instrument is
equipped with an internal modem, allowing direct access to the
internet via a TCP/IP protocol along with data storing at the
patient’s home. The bidirectionality of the system allowed us
not only to register compliance data but also to introduce
modifications in parameter settings, thus permitting real time
evaluation of its impact on ventilatory mechanics. Regarding the
device used in this study, the bi-level instrument included
backup rate/assist control as well as patented FlowSens technology that allow the physician to customise the inspiratory
and expiratory settings for greater patient comfort and
synchronicity.
In addition, an intermediate level of care was set up to detect
and flag alarm signs requiring an immediate revision of settings.
This monitoring was performed by one of the authors (JP) who,
after reviewing the synthesis report or night calendar, was
instructed to send a message to the physician who would then
decided on possible setting changes, schedule an office visit,
schedule a phone call or conduct a real time communication. As


ventilation in rapidly progressive neuromuscular disorders, we
considered all data that were 61 SD of the mean values of IPAP,
expiratory positive air pressure, inspiratory/expiratory ratio,
backup rate, inspiratory sensitivity, expiratory sensitivity and
rise time as alert signs. These limits were defined by data analysis of 67 ALS patients with regular NIV use $6 h a day
followed in our unit (unpublished data). In addition, we also
considered as an alert sign all data conflicting with the preceding
ventilation profile of the patient.

Primary outcome
We considered two primary outcomes measurements: (1) the
number of office and emergency room visits, and hospital
admissions during the entire period of NIV use; and (2) the
number of parameter setting changes during the period (number
of days, DTC) needed to achieve full compliance (defined as NIV
use >6 h) and throughout all periods of NIV use.

Secondary outcomes
As secondary outcome measures we considered clinical and
functional disease progression, as defined by ALSFRS total score,
respiratory, spinal and bulbar subscores (every 3 months),
respiratory functional tests (very 6 months), total survival (total
number of days from symptoms onset to death or the end of the
study), survival from first visit (total number of days from
diagnosis to death or the end of the study) and survival with
NIV (total number of days from NIV adaptation to death or the
end of the study). In addition, we also recorded the type of
parameter setting change and compliance, assessed by the
number of hours of usage a day; percentage of spontaneous
breathing; backup respiratory rate; average, minimum and
maximal respiratory rates; and percentage of attained predetermined pressures.
In this study, all patients gave written informed consent after
protocol approval by the local ethics committee. As this was
a pilot study, sample size considerations were not based on
a predefined clinically significant difference in health resource
utilisation and survival probability but rather on studying the
minimum number of subjects (20 per group) that would allow
the application of large sample statistical methods.

Statistical analysis
Demographic and baseline clinical and respiratory function data
were analysed for homogeneity between groups with two
sample t tests and Fisher’s exact test. Event count data, such as
healthcare utilisation data (number of office visits, hospital
admissions and emergency room admissions, number of
parameters changes and number of DTC) were analysed with
the person years method and reported as incidence rate ratios
with exact Poisson confidence intervals and significance tests.
Repeated measurements data (panel data) on parameters
settings and patient compliance were analysed with random
effects regression. Survival was analysed with the KaplaneMeier
method and survivor functions were compared with the log rank
test. Student’s t tests and Fisher’s exact test were used
throughout as appropriate. Differences were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. All tests are two tailed. Statistical
analysis was performed with STATA 10 (Stata Corporation).

RESULTS
Of 155 consecutive home ventilated ALS patients, 51 were
excluded because they were ventilated with devices that did not
allow compliance analysis through modem communication. A

FVC values lower than 75% of the predicted value. Among the
42 eligible patients, two refused to participate and were
excluded. The final analysis set comprised 20 patients in the
control group (G1) and 20 patients in the intervention group
(G2), but one patient in G2 was lost to follow-up and hence was
excluded from the analysis. (figure 1) No difference was found in
terms of demographic data, clinical characteristics and respiratory function tests between the groups at diagnosis or at NIV
adaptation, except for FVC which was significantly higher in G1
at diagnosis (p¼0.04) (tables 1 and 2). Moreover, mean values for
the initial parameter settings of NIV at the time of non-invasive
ventilation onset were not different, showing that the procedure
was similar in both groups.

Primary outcome
Table 3 shows the incidence data regarding the number of office
and emergency room visits and inhospital admissions. The
incidence rate was 3e6 lower in G2 patients (p<0.0001).
Random effects regression analysis of the overall difference in
the type of parameter setting changes throughout the ventilation period showed no differences between the groups. The same
negative results were observed in comparison of compliance data
although a trend towards a greater number of daily hours of NIV
use in group G2 was observed (p¼0.17).

Secondary outcomes
The number of changes in parameter settings during DTC and
over the entire period of NIV showed a slightly higher incidence
rate in G2 during the initial period of adaption (20%, p<0.01%)
but a clearly lower rate over the entire period of NIV (50%,
p<0.0001) (table 4).
The clinical progression rate prior to NIV adaption showed no
differences between the groups for total ALSFRS score or for
bulbar and spinal subscores. Respiratory subscore tended to

the random effects general linear model regression analysis did
not show statistically significant differences in clinical progression, despite a trend for slower progression of the spinal subscore
in G2 (p¼0.15).
For survival evaluation, at the end of the study, 12 patients
were still alive in each group and differences did not reach
statistical significance at the 5% level. However, patients in G2
tended to have a longer survival (table 5, figure 2).

ALS is a devastating neurological condition with a low incidence
of 2e4/100 000 inhabitants, a short survival and low prevalence

of 5e7/100 000, according to different epidemiological studies.[29]

The relatively small number of patients supports some difficulties in the randomisation of patients based on computer generation in a single centre in our country. Thus the present study is
a prospective single blinded quasi randomised clinical trial that
included consecutive patients, aimed at testing the feasibility,
efficacy and efficiency of telemedicine for home monitoring NIV.
In addition, patient selection based on geographical residence
was not considered biased and was probably appropriate for our
purpose.

The feasibility of telemedicine for home monitoring patients
with chronic respiratory failure discharged from hospital with
a mean follow-up time of 176 days has been assessed and it was
found that home monitoring was feasible and useful for titration of ventilation settings.[30]

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first
trial of NIV compliance using a new technical method that
enabled us to monitor remotely registered data in the equipment
software.
Before the present trial, in the run-in period, we had an
exploratory phase to test safety, acceptance and accuracy. The
system was suitable, worked well and served our investigational
purposes. The main limitations were related to the need for
a fixed telephone line and speed of data extraction.
Our study supports the role and use of telemonitoring in
eliminating difficulties imposed by geographical distances and
lack of resources. We observed objective gains in terms of
healthcare utilisation (table 3), reflecting the efficiency of the
system.
Cost analysis is underway but our preliminary data indicate
significant cost reduction using telemonitoring (approximately
50%), as expected from the lower number of hospital visits and
admissions. Therefore, in view of the limited resources of health
systems,[31 32] this study strongly supports the fact that frequent
virtual visits to the patients by modem communications may
become current practice, as an alternative to the office based
control of compliance to NIV.

Indeed, the control of compliance is a critical issue because,
despite recommendations, the rate of NIV use is poor and highly
variable (range 0e70%) in European and American ALS centres.
Chiò et al showed that the use of NIV ranged from 50% to 70%

depending on the size of the ALS clinics. More recently, Jackson
reported 36% use in ALS patients with FVC lower than 50% of
the predicted value, and correlated tolerance with respiratory
symptoms. Other factors such as age, race, type of insurance,
forced vital capacity, disease duration, ALSFRS, caregiver burden
or quality of life were not predictors of compliance.[17 33][e][36]

Other factors may influence the possible relationship of
compliance to settings of the ventilators. The possible role of
setting changes through modem communications in increasing
compliance was not confirmed in the present study, probably
due to the identical procedures that took place in both groups,
all performed by one of the authors (AP), or the small sample
size. However, our results showed a trend towards a greater
number of hours of NIV use in G2, suggesting a marginal effect
on compliance. Probably associated with this marginal effect, we
observed a trend towards survival benefit (p¼0.17) in G2
(table 5).
In addition, in G2 we were able to show a 50% reduction in
the number of parameter setting changes during the survival
period with NIV, but a 20% increase during the DTC period
(exact Poisson p<0.001). This result represents a tighter followup during the initial period of NIV adaptation, thus driving
a reduction in the total time needed to adjust settings over the
whole period of ventilation.
Regarding the functional and survival outcome measures,
median survival with NIV was 334 days in G1 versus 865 days in
G2 (p¼0.13). Considering survival from symptom onset, the
benefit in median survival time was >1500 days (figure 2).
Further calculations of the sample needed to achieve 90%
statistical power indicated that 40 patients in each arm would
be needed to show a significant survival impact.
Moreover, a trend was also observed towards improved
functional outcomes in G2 patients in terms of the ALSFRS
spinal subscore (p¼0.15). This was not anticipated, as ALS
patients in G1 had a closer follow-up provided by physiotherapy
in our specialised centre. Exercise was suggested to all patients,
included to the limits of perceived fatigue (Borg scale), simultaneously with NIV if needed,[14] but patients in G1 were
supervised by physiotherapists with special training in ALS. We

hypothesised that timed and adequate intervention due to early
detection of alert signs might allow patients to perform more
daily physical activities. Ventilation subtleties may be not fully
understood without quantifying measurements related to lung
mechanics, meaning that clinical judgement may not be sensitive enough to early detect deviations from a ventilation profile
otherwise detected by the regular observation of the night
calendar. The increased speed of these communications with
faster data transmission and improved alarm signs would
certainly reassure patients, caregivers and physicians, with
benefits to all.[37]

Whether our positive results are related to closer vigilance and
faster correction of respiratory changes or to other undisclosed
factors remains to be clarified. Future studies should evaluate the
impact of telemonitoring on the quality of life of patients and
caregivers.
