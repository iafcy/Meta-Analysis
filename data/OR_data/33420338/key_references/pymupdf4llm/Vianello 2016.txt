Abstract

Background: Although a number of studies have suggested that the use of Telemonitoring (TM) in patients with
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can be useful and efficacious, its real utility in detecting Acute
Exacerbation (AE) signaling the need for prompt treatment is not entirely clear. The current study aimed to
investigate the benefits of a TM system in managing AE in advanced-stage COPD patients to improve their HealthRelated Quality of Life (HRQL) and to reduce utilization of healthcare services.

Methods: A 12-month Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in the Veneto region (Italy). Adult patients
diagnosed with Class III-IV COPD in accordance with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) classification were recruited and provided a TM system to alert the clinical staff via a trained operator
whenever variations in respiratory parameters fell beyond the individual’s normal range. The study’s primary
endpoint was HRQL, measured by the Italian version of the two Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF36v2). Its
secondary endpoints were: scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the number and duration
of hospitalizations; the number of readmissions; the number of appointments with a pulmonary specialist; the
number of visits to the emergency department; and the number of deaths.
Results: Three hundred thirty-four patients were enrolled and randomized into two groups for a 1 year period. At
its conclusion, changes in the SF36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores did not significantly differ
between the TM and control groups [(-2.07 (8.98) vs -1.91 (7.75); p = 0.889 and -1.08 (11.30) vs -1.92 (10.92); p = 0.
5754, respectively]. Variations in HADS were not significantly different between the two groups [0.85 (3.68) vs 0.62
(3.6); p = 0.65 and 0.50 (4.3) vs 0.72 (4.5); p = 0.71]. The hospitalization rate for AECOPD and/or for any cause was not
significantly different in the two groups [IRR = 0.89 (95% CI 0.79–1,04); p = 0.16 and IRR = 0.91 (95% CI 0,75 – 1.04);
p = 0.16, respectively]. The readmission rate for AECOPD and/or any cause was, however, significantly lower in
the TM group with respect to the control one [IRR = 0.43 (95% CI 0.19–0.98); p = 0.01 and 0.46 (95% CI 0.24–0.89); p = 0.01,
respectively].

Background
A common, preventable disease characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and reduced exercise capacity, Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading
cause of death and disability in high, middle, and low income countries [1–4]. Despite international standardized
guidelines, improved pharmacotherapy, integrated care,
and pulmonary rehabilitation, patients with COPD typically worsen over time and experience episodes of acute
exacerbation (AE) [1] which are crucially important in
patient management in view of their negative effect on
Quality of Life (QoL) and prognosis and the fact that
they often lead to hospitalization. Exacerbations of
COPD are estimated to result in approximately 110,000
deaths and more than 500,000 hospitalizations per year
and have been calculated to account for approximately
70% of COPD-related direct medical costs, with over 18
billion spent in direct costs worldwide annually [5–8].
Telemonitoring (TM) (or remote monitoring) involves
the use of telecommunication technology to transmit
data regarding patients’ vital signs, symptoms, and medications to an operator at a monitoring station who will,
in turn, transmit them to a specialist who can recommend treatment variations or new interventions to avoid
deterioration in a patient’s medical condition [9]. Although a number of studies have suggested that TM in
patients with chronic diseases can be safe, reliable, and
cost effective, systematic reviews have reported inconclusive results regarding its impact on the management
of COPD patients, and evidence is still insufficient to
draw firm conclusions about its clinical and/or cost effectiveness as far as AE is concerned [9–13].
Acute Exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is a major
public health problem in the geographic area serviced by
our hospital, located in the Veneto region (Italy), and led
[to approximately 6400 hospitalization in 2009 (http://](http://www.ser-veneto.it/)
[www.ser-veneto.it/). In view of conflicting results on TM](http://www.ser-veneto.it/)
utility in COPD patients, the current study set out to
clarify the utility of TM in detecting early signs of AE
episodes in advanced-stage COPD patients to permit
specialists to take timely, appropriate measures to improve patients’ Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL)
and to reduce the utilization of healthcare services. In
this trial, TM was integrated into existing clinical services, and monitoring was provided by teams of


pulmonary specialists who already knew the patients
who were recruited. Both the intervention and control
groups had access to the same conventional clinical care:
the only difference was that patients in the study group
also had TM.

Methods
A pragmatic, unblinded, parallel-group, two arm, 12month Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was carried
out in the Veneto region (Italy); participants were recruited between 1[st] November 2011 and 31[st] July 2012.
The study was part of the “RENEWING HEALTH” project, a research initiative involving a Consortium of nine
European regions. The trial was registered at Clinical[Trials.gov as NCT01513980 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01513980?term=renewing+health&rank=3)
[ct2/show/NCT01513980?term=renewing+health&rank=](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01513980?term=renewing+health&rank=3)
[3) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of all of](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01513980?term=renewing+health&rank=3)
the participating centres.
All potential participants were provided with written
information about the aims and the procedures of the
study, and those willing to participate signed informed
consent forms.

Subjects
Adults at the time of discharge from hospital after an
AE episode or attending the outpatient Pulmonary
Clinics of the City Hospitals of Padova, Treviso, Venice
and Verona (Veneto region of Italy) were recruited.
Eligibility criteria for the study were: diagnosis of Class
III-IV COPD according to the Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification [14]; age ≥
18 years; life expectancy > 12 months according to Multiparametric Prognostic Index (MPI) [15]; and capability
of using, alone or assisted, the TM equipment. Exclusion
criteria were: concomitant significant lung disease; unwillingness to provide informed consent or to use the
TM technology; the negative advice of the general practitioner (GP), and/or other serious social problems, including lack of adequate family support and/or other
social support networks.

Randomisation
Randomisation was performed following standard procedures and checked for incorrect imbalances or meaningful baseline differences in variables using a dedicated


-----

algorithm provided by PASS 2008 software that took
into account patient’s age and gender [16]. Patients were
randomised to the intervention or control groups using
a 2:1 allocation; unequal allocation was preferred for
ethical reasons as the patients in the TM group was expected to show improvement in HRQL. Each participating center implemented randomization locally using the
same methodology.

Baseline assessment
The baseline characteristics of the TM and control
groups are outlined in Tables 1 and 2. The data collected


at baseline included the following: demographic, smoking status, level of education, marital and employment
status; the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC)
dyspnoea score [17]; the COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
score [18]; scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS, which is an extensively validated measure used to assess the severity of symptoms
of mood disorders in hospital or primary care patients
and in the general population, consisting of two subscales: anxiety and depression [19, 20]. Another measure
taken into consideration was the Short Form Health
Survey, Italian version 2 (SF36v2) [21]. The SF36 is a

Two summary scores, a physical component summary
(PCS) and a mental component one (MCS) can, in
addition, be calculated on the basis of the subscale
scores [22–25]. The presence of cardiovascular comorbidity, the patient’s routine medication and long-term
use of Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) were also registered. In
addition, baseline Forced Expiratory Volume in the first
second (FEV1), PaO2 and PaCO2, and Walking Distance
(WD), data gathered from a Pulmonary Function Test


(PFT), an Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis, and the 6minute Walking Test (6-min WT), which were all taken
at the time the patients were randomised, were registered.
The complete battery of testing was carried out at the
various centres taking part in the study.

Trial intervention: telemonitoring
Patients in the intervention group were provided a TM
system consisting of a finger pulse-oxymeter (Wrist
Clinic [TM] – Medical Concierge, Medic 4 all Italia, Italy)
and a gateway device for data transmission over a telephone line to a central data management unit located at
the Veneto Regional e-Health Centre. It was possible for


-----

a patient/proxy to communicate with the trained operators manning the unit from 08:00–18:00 Monday
through Friday. At enrollment, the clinical team responsible for that particular patient explained how to use the
TM kit and provided self-management education materials. Additional training was provided by the technician
who installed the TM kit at the patient’s home.
Using the TM equipment, patients transmitted their
monitored Heart Rate (HR) and Oxygen Saturation
(SpO2) values to the operator every other day and/or
in the event of subjective clinical worsening. A ‘spot
check’ or single measurement of SpO2 was also performed once a day, usually in the morning. The operators daily (Monday–Friday) reviewed the online data
of each patient and if the HR and/or SpO2 values
that were transmitted were outside of the patient’s
“normal” range, they contacted the patient and asked
for a second measurement. If the second measurement was also outside of the patient’s normal range,
the operator alerted the clinical staff. Values considered out-of-range were customized for every patient
depending on his/her individual clinical situation. For
patients recruited at discharge from hospital, alarm
limits were set on the basis of baseline values obtained from pulmonary function testing carried out
before the hospitalization during routine visit with a
pulmonary specialist. All patients’ registered data were
available to the reference pulmonary specialist on a
web-based platform. Once alerted, the specialist him/


herself called the patient by telephone to verify if
symptoms had stabilized or worsened or if new symptoms had arisen. In the latter event, the patient’s adherence to therapy was checked and, if unsatisfactory,
interventions promoting adherence were prescribed. If
adherence to treatment proved satisfactory, the diagnosis of AECOPD was confirmed and, the specialist
undertook one of the following actions: 1. Modified
the patient’s usual medication by telephone. 2. Sent a
district nurse (a nurse employed by the National
Health Service specialized in making home visits) for
a home visit who made a report on the situation. The
nurse assessed the subject’s clinical status and adherence to treatment and decided if the patient required
an examination by a pulmonary specialist. 3. Set up
an office appointment with a pulmonary specialist. 4.
Decided that the patient should be taken to the
Emergency Department (ED). According to our protocol, the time between when the measurement was
outside of the patient’s normal range and the specialist’s recommendation was registered and between
when the recommendation was registered and the district nurse or pulmonary specialist actually examined
the patient was within 30 min and 48 h, respectively.
The specialist made his/her decision on the best
course of action depending on the data registered by
the TM system, the patients’ symptoms, and his/her
clinical judgment. Figure 1 illustrates how the home
TM system works.

Control group
The participants in the two groups received the same
clinical care and had access to the same healthcare services. If there were any variations in the clinical status of
patients in the control group, he/she directly called/went
to see the GP who decided if the patient required an urgent appointment with a pulmonary specialist or a visit
to the ED; the former was arranged by the GP. The only
difference between the intervention and control groups
was that the former also had the TM service. Pharmacologic therapy was provided following international standardized guidelines [14].

Study end points
The study’s primary endpoint was HRQL, defined as the
extent to which the individual’s usual or expected physical, emotional, and social well-being was affected by a
medical condition or its treatment [26], which was measured using the Italian version of the SF36v2 [21]. This
particular questionnaire was chosen because it covers a
broad range of domains of health related issues and
seems to capture a subject’s perception of his/her general health; it also acquires a lot of information that is
not exclusively related to his/her baseline disease [27].
The study’s secondary end points were:

– Emotional distress, which was measured using the
Italian version of the HADS [19];
– the number and duration of hospitalizations due to
AECOPD;
– the number and duration of any cause
hospitalizations;
– the number of readmissions due to AECOPD.
Readmission was defined as a re-hospitalization
within 30 days of discharge from hospital due to an
AECOPD-related admittance [26].
– the number of any cause readmissions;
– the number of appointments with a pulmonary
specialist;
– the number of Emergency Department (ED) visits;
– the number of deaths.

The number and duration of hospitalizations and of
readmissions was calculated.

Data collection
The questionnaires were administered online by a
trained operator at baseline and at the end of the 12month study period. Data on hospital admissions,
healthcare service use including consultations with a
pulmonary specialist and visits to the ED service, and
mortality were extracted from regional records at the
end of the trial. The causes of hospital admission were


assessed on the basis of the hospital discharge summary.
Data were exported to a MySQL database.

Sample size and statistical analysis
Based on previous studies, we estimated that 196 participants in the intervention group and 99 participants in
the control group would be necessary to detect a difference of five points (minimal clinically important difference) in the SF36v2 score between the intervention and
control groups at the end of the 1-year study period with
0.5 size effect, 20% drop-out rate, >95% power, using a
significance level of 5%. Data analysis was performed on
a “per protocol” approach. All the participants who were
randomised to the treatment group and began the study
were monitored and included in the analysis regardless
of their compliance to treatment. Data available concerning deceased patients were included in the analysis.
Standard descriptive statistics, including means with
standard deviations and/or numbers with associated percentages, were used to analyze the patients’ demographic
and clinical characteristics at baseline. Student’s t-test or
chi-squared test were used to compare continuous or
categorical variables, as appropriate. Non-normally distributed variables were compared using the WilcoxonMann-Whitney test. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to
test for data normality. The Central Limit Theorem’s
normal approximation was assumed when the SF36 data
were assessed since it is a standardized approach used to
analyze large patient populations [28]. SF36 scores are
expressed as means and standard deviations with a 95%
confidence interval (CI) for the difference between two
means. Results with regard to hospitalizations, readmissions and visits to the ED are expressed as Incidence
Rate per year (IR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and a
95% CI. IR was calculated by dividing the number of
events by the number of days of the study and multiplying the result by 365. Groups were compared using the
Poisson test. Deaths are expressed as numbers, percentages, Risk Ratio (RR) and the related 95% CI. Two-tailed
p values of <0.05 were considered significant for all analyses. All statistical analyses were conducted using the
statistical software R version 3.2.2 (Free Software Foundation Inc, Boston, USA).

Results
Recruitment
Out of 458 patients originally assessed for eligibility, 334
(73%) were deemed eligible and enrolled in the study
and 124 (27%) were excluded; the primary reasons for
exclusion were: failure to comply with the eligibility criteria (n = 92); decline to participate (n = 25); and withdrawal of consent (n = 7). The 334 eligible participants
were thus randomly assigned to one of two groups: 230
(69%) were assigned to the TM group and 104 (31%) to


-----

the control one. Out of the 230 patients allocated to the
study group, 19 did not actually participate in the study
(and did not receive the TM equipment) for the following reasons: death (n = 1), withdrawal of consent (n = 9),
administrative problems (n = 7), moving to a nursing
home (n = 1), and another reason (n = 1). By the end of
the one year study period, 30 patients had dropped out
of the TM group for the following reasons: death (n =
25), withdrawal of consent during the course of the trial
(n = 3), moving to a nursing home (n = 1), and another
reason (n = 1). At the end of the study, the data of 181
patients who had been randomized to the TM group and
actively participated in the study were available for
analysis.
Out of the 104 patients assigned to the control group, 23
dropped out due to death (n = 13), withdrawal of consent
during the course of the trial (n = 5), moving to a nursing
home (n = 4), and another reason (n = 1). At the end of the
study period the data of 81 control patients were analyzed.
Figure 2 illustrates the study’s flow diagram.

Contacts with TM service
There were a total of 2747 TM alerts from the 181 telemonitored patients, meaning an average of 15 contacts
per patient over the one year of the trial (approximately
one contact every month). No technical problems
linked to data transmission between the patients and
the e-Health Service were registered.

Baseline characteristics
The baseline characteristics of the study and control
groups are outlined in Tables 1 and 2. There were no


differences in the main characteristics of the participants
in the two groups, although the controls had slightly
worse PaCO2 values.

HRQL
Variations in HRQL are outlined in Table 3. At the end
of the study period, changes in the PCS and MCS scores
were not significantly different in the two groups [(-2.07
(8.98) vs -1.91 (7.75); p = 0.889 and -1.08 (11.30) vs -1.92
(10.92); p = 0.5754] and the mean PCS and MCS scores
were similar in the two groups (37.11 ± 9.07 vs 36.48 ±
8.64; p = 0.59; and 44.56 ± 10.95 vs 43.06 ± 10.95; p =
0.31, respectively). There were no significant differences
in the scores on the eight subscales of the SF36 between
the two groups. The PCS scores at the end of the study
were significantly lower with respect to baseline values
in both groups (39.18 ± 9.73 vs 37.11 ± 9.07; p = 0.002
and 38.39 ± 8.98 vs 36.48 ± 8.64; p = 0.02, respectively).

Emotional distress
Variations in HADS are outlined in Table 4. At the end
of the study period, changes in the “Anxiety” and “Depression” scores were not significantly different in the
two groups [0.85 (3.68) vs 0.62 (3.6); p = 0.65 and 0.50
(4.3) vs 0.72 (4.5); p = 0.71].

Hospitalizations, appointments with specialists, and
deaths
Data on the utilization of healthcare services are outlined in Table 4. The hospitalization rate per year due to
AECOPD and/or to any cause in the TM group was
similar to that in the control group [IRR = 0.89 (95% CI

Discussion
The study’s primary finding was that utilization of TM
over a one year period had no significant effect on HRQL


in the study population. Although TM could theoretically
improve HRQL by facilitating early recognition and
prompt response to AECOPD, conclusions from previous
studies proved controversial. Our results were consistent
with those reported by a number of trials suggesting that
TM has little effect on HRQL. Nine published studies on
home telehealth for COPD evaluated in a systematic
review by Polisena et al., in fact, concluded that TM does
not improve HRQL when it is compared to usual care

[11]. A number of reasons have been advanced to explain
the lack of improvement in HRQL and in psychological
well-being in TM-monitored patients; these include the
burden of self-monitoring, concerns raised by intrusive
surveillance, a perceived lack of user-friendliness, and a
reduction in the frequency of traditional face-to-face visits

[29].
Other studies have, instead, reported that the use of
TM can greatly improve HRQL in COPD patients.
Bourbeau et al.’s study focusing on a program that included telephone consultations with the treating physician demonstrated a significant improvement in the

activity and impact subscales and total scores of St
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [30]. Likewise, in a RCT conducted by Koff et al. who focused on
a TM system similar to ours but including a web-based
platform for the transmission of patient’s data and telephone calls by the care coordinator in the event of clinical changes, the TM group showed a significant
improvement in the SGRQ score when it was compared
with that of the usual care group [31].
Controversial results can at least in part be explained by the considerable heterogeneity in the studies with regard to methodological aspects, such as
primary outcome measures, number of participants,
disease severity in the study population, and the instruments to measure health status. It is also true
that the data obtained in our study based on the
summary composite scores of the generic SF36 (physical and mental) are not fully comparable to those
utilized by previous trials based on the diseasespecific SGRQ. While SGRQ seems to be more sensitive
in detecting differences/changes in HRQL linked to the
clinical severity of COPD, the SF36 appears to capture
additional information that is not exclusively related to
the baseline disease, supporting the opinion that the two
indexes should be considered complementary [32].


In line with lack of evidence of improved HRQL, TM
did not seem to have a positive impact on patients’ emotional distress, in particular on the severity of depression
and/or anxiety: indeed, although the aetiology of mood
disturbances in COPD patients is multifactoral, HRQL
has been considered a stronger determinant with respect
to other clinical and/or physiological risk factors [33].
Our healthcare related secondary outcomes did not
show that TM had any real effect in preventing
AECOPD or other cause-related hospitalisations. A
Cochrane systematic review of telehealthcare for COPD
including only high-quality evidence from RCTs found,
instead, a significant reduction in the number of patients
requiring hospital admissions and ED attendances [13].
Most of the programs evaluated had, however, introduced an enhanced clinical service to support the
technological arm of the trial that included case management by a nurse as well as other interventions making it
difficult to isolate the effect of the TM component. Indeed, our results are consistent with those of a recent
RCT by Pinnock et al. who investigated the impact of a
TM service that was integrated into existing clinical services for COPD patients. The investigators concluded
that it was ineffective in postponing admissions and in
improving patients’ QoL and advanced the hypothesis


-----

that the positive effect of TM demonstrated in previous
studies could have been due to the enhancement of the
underpinning clinical service [34].
Some hypotheses explaining why TM did not reduce
hospitalization in our study population can be advanced.
First, the number of hospital admissions was very low
even in the control group [IR: 1,20 (95% CI 0,99–1,45)]
and this is not surprising given the health authorities’ efforts to potentiate an integrated care model for chronic
COPD patients aiming to provide enhanced long-term
home services to reduce need for hospitalization. In this
context, there is not much leeway for further reduction in
hospitalization as a result of a TM intervention. Second,
although variations in HR and SpO2 that were used as
markers of an unstable clinical condition are regarded as
reliable predictors of AECOPD [35], it is reasonable to assume that these physiological parameters cannot always
reflect changes in patients’ health status, leading to underestimation and treatment delay of AE episodes. COPD
has, in fact, shown high clinical and functional intraindividual variability [36] which may reduce the ability of
one-dimensional models to recognize a wide range of
events (i.e., worsening dyspnea, reduced number of steps
per day, etc) associated to an AECOPD. Third, our trial
was not powered for the outcome of hospitalization.
The study produced an interesting result in that it demonstrated that the use of TM was associated with a lower
rate of hospital readmission for AECOPD and/or any
cause during the first 30 days after hospitalisation [IRR:
0,43 (0,19–0,98); p = 0.04 and 0,46 (0,24–0,89); p = 0.02,
respectively]. In view of the fact that early readmissions
are a common occurrence in patients with COPD, which
are estimated between 8 and 21.8% of the total number of
hospitalizations, and reducing their frequency is considered a high priority of health care organizations [37, 38],
study results suggest that TM could be used as an early
follow-up care after hospital discharge of COPD patients
until the risk of readmission has receded.
A number of limitations pertaining to this study should
be mentioned. First, although COPD has been recently
regarded as a heterogeneous disease characterized by high
phenotype variability [37], phenotypic distinctions in the
patients were not considered during the randomization
process. In particular, since patients’ history of previous
exacerbations was unavailable, we cannot exclude the possibility that the distribution of “frequent exacerbators” was
unbalanced between the groups, with a confounding effect
on the impact of TM on HRQL. “Frequent exacerbators”
have, in fact, been recognized as a distinct clinical subgroup characterized by poorer HRQL as a result of a high
exacerbation rate irrespective of the degree of airflow limitation [39]. Second, it was impossible to blind the study
population and personnel to treatment allocation, given
the intervention’s interactive nature.


Conclusions
Despite its limitations, the study provides useful information for healthcare professionals who are examining
the possibility of utilizing TM to optimize AECOPD
management. The study’s most important findings and
conclusions can be summarized as follows:

– Adding TM to usual care does not significantly
improve patients’ HRQL in a health care context
where care standards are high and medical services
are well established;
– In this type of situation, TM intervention is not
effective in reducing hospitalizations, which is the
major factor driving up the healthcare cost of COPD
patients;
– TM can nevertheless facilitate continuity of care
during the hospital-to-home transition, improving
outcomes among patients discharged after an AE
episode.

In the light of these findings, we would conclude that
use of TM to manage AE should not be generalized
across of the entire population of COPD patients and
efforts should be made to identify specific subgroups
that could most benefit from telehealthcare.
