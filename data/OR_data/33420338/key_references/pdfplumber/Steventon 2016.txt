conditions.17 18 As these conditions are considered man-
ageable in primary care, we would have hoped that tele-
health would reduce them, but instead we observed a
pattern that was consistent with our overall findings of
increased utilisation.
Telehealth and control patients were matched such
that they were similar at baseline in respect to estab-
lished predictors of hospital use. However, as in any
observational study of this type, we cannot entirely rule
out the possibility that the groups at baseline differed in
terms of variables that were also predictive of the
outcome. Our study was designed to minimise the risk
of confounding by: applying similareligibility criteria for
telehealth and control groups; selecting controls locally
from within the North Yorkshire area15; using a match-
