Abstract
Background: Telehealth based on advanced information technology is an emerging health care strategy for managing chronic
diseases. However, the cost-effectiveness and clinical effect of synchronous telehealth services in older patients with cardiovascular
diseases has not yet been studied. Since 2009, the Telehealth Center at the National Taiwan University Hospital has provided a
range of telehealth services (led by a cardiologist and staffed by cardiovascular nursing specialists) for cardiovascular disease
patients including (1) instant transmission of blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiography, oximetry, and glucometry for
analysis, (2) mutual telephone communication and health promotion, and (3) continuous analytical and decision-making support.
Objective: To evaluate the impact of a synchronous telehealth service on older patients with cardiovascular diseases.
Methods: Between November 2009 and April 2010, patients with cardiovascular disease who received telehealth services at
the National Taiwan University Hospital were recruited. We collected data on hospital visits and health expenditures for the
6-month period before and the 6-month period after the opening of the Telehealth Center to assess the clinical impact and
cost-effectiveness of telehealth services on cardiovascular patients.
Results: A total of 141 consecutive cardiovascular disease patients were recruited, including 93 aged ≥65 years (senior group)
and 48 aged <65 years (nonsenior group). The telehealth intervention significantly reduced the all-cause admission rate per month
per person in the nonsenior group (pretelehealth: median 0.09, IQR 0-0.14; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P=.002) and the
duration (days per month per person) of all-cause hospital stay (pretelehealth: median 0.70, IQR 0-1.96; posttelehealth: median
0, IQR 0-0; P<.001) with increased all-cause outpatient visits per month per person (pretelehealth: median 0.77, IQR 0.20-1.64;
posttelehealth: mean 1.60, IQR 1.06-2.57; P=.002). In the senior group, the telehealth intervention also significantly reduced the
all-cause admission rate per month per person (pretelehealth: median 0.10, IQR 0-0.18; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P<.001)
and the duration (days per month per person) of all-cause hospital stay (pretelehealth: median 0.59, IQR 0-2.24; posttelehealth:
median 0, IQR 0-0; P<.001) with increased all-cause outpatient visits per month per person (pretelehealth: median 1.40, IQR
0.52-2.63; posttelehealth: median 1.76, IQR 1.12-2.75; P=.02). In addition, telehealth intervention reduced the inpatient cost in
the nonsenior group from $814.93 (SD 1000.40) to US $217.39 (SD 771.01, P=.001) and the total cost per month from US
$954.78 (SD 998.70) to US $485.06 (SD 952.47, P<.001). In the senior group, the inpatient cost per month was reduced from
US $768.27 (SD 1148.20) to US $301.14 (SD 926.92, P<.001) and the total cost per month from US $928.20 (SD 1194.11) to
US $494.87 (SD 1047.08, P<.001).

Conclusions: Synchronous telehealth intervention may reduce costs, decrease all-cause admission rates, and decrease durations
of all-cause hospital stays in cardiovascular disease patients, regardless of age.
