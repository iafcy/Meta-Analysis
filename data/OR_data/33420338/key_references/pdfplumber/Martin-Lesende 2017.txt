KEYMESSAGES
(cid:1) This small-sample exploratory study suggests that primary care-based home telemonitoring of complex
chronic patients may be a promising technology that which might reduce hospital admissions and the
length of hospital stays.
(cid:1) Moreover, this study suggests a reduction of the number of emergency department attendances while
patients were telemonitored.

Results: For the 28 patients who completed the follow-up (out of 42 included, 13 patients died
and 1 discontinued the intervention), a significant reduction in hospitalizations, from 2.6 admis-
sions/patient in the previous year (standard deviation, SD: 1.6) to 1.1 (SD: 1.5) during the one-
year telemonitoring follow-up (P<0.001), and emergency department attendances, from
4.2 (SD: 2.6) to 2.1 (SD: 2.6) (P<0.001) was observed. The length of hospital stay was reduced
