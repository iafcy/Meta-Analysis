Abstract
Background: Although a number of studies have suggested that the use ofTelemonitoring (TM) inpatients with
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can be useful and efficacious,its real utility indetecting Acute
Exacerbation (AE) signaling the need for prompt treatment is not entirely clear. The current study aimed to
investigate the benefits ofa TM system inmanaging AE inadvanced-stage COPD patientsto improve their Health-
Related Quality ofLife (HRQL) and to reduce utilization of healthcare services.
Methods: A 12-monthRandomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was conductedin the Veneto region (Italy). Adult patients
diagnosed with Class III-IV COPD in accordancewith theGlobal Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) classification were recruited and provided a TM system to alert the clinical staff via a trained operator
whenever variations inrespiratory parameters fell beyond theindividual’snormal range. The study’sprimary
endpoint was HRQL, measuredby theItalian version of thetwo Short Form36-item Health Survey (SF36v2). Its
secondary endpoints were: scores on theHospitalAnxietyand Depression Scale (HADS); thenumber and duration
ofhospitalizations; the number ofreadmissions; the number ofappointments with a pulmonary specialist; the
number ofvisits to the emergency department;and thenumberof deaths.
Results: Three hundred thirty-four patientswere enrolled and randomized intotwo groups for a 1 year period. At
itsconclusion,changes in the SF36Physical and Mental Component Summary scores did not significantly differ
between the TM and control groups [(-2.07 (8.98) vs -1.91 (7.75); p=0.889 and -1.08 (11.30) vs -1.92 (10.92); p=0.
5754,respectively]. Variationsin HADS were not significantly different between the two groups [0.85 (3.68) vs 0.62
(3.6); p=0.65 and 0.50 (4.3) vs 0.72 (4.5); p=0.71]. The hospitalization rate for AECOPD and/or for any cause was not
