Abstract
Home telemonitoring is becoming more important to home medical care for patients with heart failure. Since there are no
data on home telemonitoring for Japanese patients with heart failure, we investigated its effect on cardiovascular outcomes.
The HOMES-HF study was the first multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to elucidate the effective-
ness of home telemonitoring of physiological data, such as body weight, blood pressure, and pulse rate, for Japanese patients
with heart failure (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry 000006839). The primary end-point was a composite of all-cause death or
rehospitalization due to worsening heart failure. We analyzed 181 recently hospitalized patients with heart failure who were
randomly assigned to a telemonitoring group (n = 90) or a usual care group (n = 91). The mean follow-up period was 15
(range 0–31) months. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary end-point between groups [hazard ratio
(HR), 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.548–1.648; p = 0.572]. Home telemonitoring for Japanese patients with heart
failure was feasible; however, beneficial effects in addition to those of usual care were not demonstrated. Further investigation
of more patients with severe heart failure, participation of home medical care providers, and use of a more integrated home
telemonitoring system emphasizing communication as well as monitoring of symptoms and physiological data are required.
