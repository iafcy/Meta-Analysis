Heart failure (HF) is a highly prevalent disease with substantial mor- 
bidity and mortality. Consequently, the disease is an important 
healthcare issue with the majority of costs attributed to HF hospita- 
lizations.1 Efforts continue to detect ﬂuid accumulation early to 
prevent hospitalization for acute cardiac decompensation. As clinical 
signs of HF deterioration are often unreliable, device-based sensors 
have been developed for the continuous monitoring of the patients’ 
HF status. One such approach is the continuous measurement of 
intrathoracic impedance with an implanted cardiac arrhythmia 
device. While ﬁrst investigations showed promising results,2 – 4 
larger and randomized trials revealed disappointing outcomes.5,6 A 
valid option for improving the ﬂuid monitoring (FM) feature might 
be additional use of remote monitoring (RM), as timely measures 
of wireless ﬂuid overload alerts may avert cardiac decompensation 
and HF hospitalization. So far, only limited comparative data exist 
on the beneﬁts of wireless FM regarding morbidity and mortality of 
HF patients.

Only limited comparative data exist on the beneﬁts of ﬂuid monitoring (FM) combined with remote monitoring (RM) 
regarding morbidity and mortality of heart failure (HF) patients. This prospective single-centre randomized pilot study 
aimed to estimate the inﬂuence of RM in combination with FM on HF hospitalizations as well as ventricular tachyarrhyth- 
mias and mortality.

Methods 
Patients with standard indication for implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy 
and results 
and deﬁbrillator were implanted with devices capable of RM and FM, and were followed for 15 months. Subjects were 
randomly allocated to RM including OptiVol and predeﬁned management of alerts (remote group), or standard in- 
ofﬁce visits every 3 months (control group). A total of 176 patients (77% male; 66 + 12 years; left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) 32 + 11%; ischemic cardiomyopathy 50%; CRT device 50%; primary prevention 85%) were analysed. 
Cox proportional hazard analysis on the time to ﬁrst HF-related hospitalization showed a hazard ratio of 1.23 [0.62 – 
2.44] (P ¼ 0.551) favouring the control group. In the remote group, 13 patients (15%) experienced ICD shocks vs. 10 
patients (11%) in the control group (P ¼ 0.512). The average time to ﬁrst ICD shock was 212 + 173 days in the 
remote arm and 212 + 143 days in the control arm (P ¼ 0.994). The Kaplan–Meier estimate of mortality after 1 year 
was 8.6% (eight deaths) in the remote group vs. 4.6% in the control group (six deaths; P ¼ 0.502).

HF-related hospitalization as well as tachyarrhythmia occurrences 
and mortality when compared with standard clinical care. 

Patient selection 
A detailed description of the study design has been published previously.7 
In brief, patients aged .18 years in need for an implantable cardioverter 
deﬁbrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy and deﬁbrillator 
(CRT-D) according to current guidelines or patients with a previously 
implanted device without FM feature and a replacement indication for 
battery depletion were included in the study after written informed 
consent. Heart failure or a history of decompensated HF hospitalization 
was not a prerequisite for inclusion. Medtronic devices with telemonitor- 
ing capabilities and OptiVol alert (Concerto or Consulta CRT-D, Virtu- 
oso or Secura ICD-DR) were used. Exclusion criteria were permanent 
atrial ﬁbrillation, a life expectancy ≤15 months, pregnancy, and participa- 
tion in another study. 
OptiVol ﬂuid index 
The OptiVol ﬂuid index has been described in detail elsewhere.4,8 In brief, 
the device determines a representative impedance daily and compares 
this with a roving reference value. Whenever daily impedance drops 
below the reference, a cumulative, absolute difference is calculated, 
and called ﬂuid index. Crossing a programmable threshold indicates a 
possible ﬂuid overload of the patient, and an OptiVol alert is triggered. 
Study design and protocol 
This randomized, single-centre, prospective pilot study complies with the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the In- 
stitutional Ethics Committee. All patients gave their written informed 
consent. Patients receiving CRT-D or DR-ICD implants or replacements 
were randomized to RM including OptiVol ON (remote arm) vs. RM OFF 
(standard arm) and followed for 15 months. In both groups, the audible 
OptiVol alert was disabled. Patients in the remote arm, however, 
were connected to the Medtronic CareLink network. The OptiVol 
ﬂuid index threshold was set to the nominal 60 V at implantation and 
remained unchanged during follow-up. In case of an automatic alert trans- 
mission, a pre-speciﬁed clinical decision routine was activated as detailed 
in Figure 1. Evaluation of the clinical status of the patients included assess- 
ment of symptoms such as dyspnoea, weight gain, oedema, activity status, 
and fatigue. 


Aims 
The aim of this study was to estimate the inﬂuence of RM in combination 
with FM using OptiVol alerts on the time to ﬁrst HF-related hospitaliza- 
tion as well as tachyarrhythmia occurrence and mortality when com- 
pared with standard clinical care. 
Data analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed using commercial software. Unless 
otherwise noted, all data are reported as mean + SD. Differences 
in baseline characteristics were evaluated using a Student’s t-test, a x2 
test, or a Fisher’s exact test, where appropriate. For time to ﬁrst 
HF-related hospitalization, time to ﬁrst ICD shock, and time to death a 
Cox proportional hazard analysis, and a Kaplan– Meier survival analysis 
with log-rank test were performed. A P-value of ,0.05 was considered 
statistically signiﬁcant. 

Patient characteristics 
Between December 2007 and April 2011, a total of 180 patients were 
included. Two patients were not randomized because the planned 
device was eventually not implanted. Another two patients withdrew 
their consent soon after implantation. Thus, after exclusion of the 
described 4 patients, a total of 176 patients were analysed. Baseline 
characteristics are summarized in Table 1. At inclusion, there were 
73 patients (83.9%) in the remote arm in functional NYHA class II 
or higher, comparing with 82 patients (93.2%) in the control arm, re- 
spectively. A CRT device was implanted in half of the patients in both 
groups. 
OptiVol alerts, urgent visits, and 
hospitalizations 
A total of 174 OptiVol alerts (94 in CRT patients and 80 in ICD 
patients) in 68 patients (35 patients with CRT and 33 patients with 
ICD) occurred in the remote group (i.e. 78% of the remote group 
patients). Of these, 93 alerts (54 in CRT patients and 39 in ICD 
patients) were classiﬁed as true positive based on clinical assessment 
of the circumstances but not on the basis of a later required hospital- 
ization. In 74 of these cases, ambulatory patient management was 
clinically possible, whereas in 19 cases hospitalization was required. 
All decisions were made by the investigators. 
One additional hospitalization occurred without prior OptiVol 
alert. Thus, in total, 20 patients in the remote group and 22 patients 
in the control group were hospitalized for worsened HF during 
the follow-up period. As shown in Figure 2, Cox proportional 
hazard analysis on the time to ﬁrst HF-related hospitalization 
showed a hazard ratio of 1.231 ([0.621– 2.438]; P ¼ 0.551). The 
mean number of emergency department visits was not signiﬁcantly 
different between the two groups (RM group 0.10 + 0.25 vs. 
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias and 
mortality 
In the remote group, 13 patients (15%) experienced ICD shocks vs. 
10 patients (11%) in the control group. Inappropriate shocks were 
delivered in four cases in two patients (2%) in the remote arm and 
in two cases in two patients (2%) in the control arm. Reasons for in- 
appropriate therapy were atrial ﬁbrillation with fast ventricular rate 
(n ¼ 3), sinus tachycardia (n ¼ 1), lead failure (n ¼ 1), and electro- 
cauterization upon non-cardiac surgery (n ¼ 1). The average time 
to ﬁrst ICD shock was 212 + 173 days in the RM arm and 212 + 
143 days in the control arm (P ¼ 0.994). Kaplan–Meier analysis for 
time to ﬁrst ICD shock revealed no signiﬁcant difference between 
the two groups (P ¼ 0.512) (Figure 3). 
A total of eight patients in the remote arm when compared with six 
patients in the control arm died during follow-up. In each group, one 
death was classiﬁed as sudden cardiac and three deaths as non- 
sudden cardiac death. Non-cardiac deaths occurred once in the 
remote group and twice in the control group. Three deaths in the 
remote group could not reliably be classiﬁed. The Kaplan –Meier 
estimate of all-cause mortality after 1 year was 8.6% in the remote 
group vs. 4.6% in the control group. No signiﬁcant difference 
could be observed for time to death between the two groups 
(P ¼ 0.502) (Figure 4). 

The main ﬁnding of our study is that device-based FM combined with 
RM has no favourable effect when compared with standard clinical 
care on the time to ﬁrst HF-related hospitalization as well as tachyar- 
rhythmia occurrences, or mortality. 
control group 0.10 + 0.23; P ¼ 0.7295). The mean number of urgent 
care visits, however, differed statistically signiﬁcant with 0.30 + 0.50 
visits in the remote group and 0.10 + 0.30 visits in the control group 
(P ¼ 0.0332).

Another study investigating the alert algorithm was able to demon- 
strate a reduction of HF hospitalizations9 in a non-randomized com- 
parison. However, these positive results could not be conﬁrmed in 
subsequent trials. 
In the prospective observational SENSE-HF 
study, sensitivity and positive predictive value of impedance monitor- 
ing were considerably low.5 In the randomized controlled DOT-HF 
study, the use of impedance measurement did not reduce deaths 
and HF hospitalizations.6 
Importantly, all of the investigations mentioned above have not 
combined FM (without audible alert) with RM for the timely detec- 
tion of HF deterioration. This combination may overcome shortcom- 
ings of the impedance measurement with the audible alert, such as 
frequent unnecessary outpatient clinic visits due to inadequate 
alerts, or some overreaction of the treating physician faced with 
the patients’ expectation, who may be concerned by an audible alert. 
Another important advantage of additional RM might be a further re- 
duction of the time from the device alert to the clinical action taken to 
prevent manifest decompensation with hospitalization.10,11 Import- 
antly, larger studies investigating remote telemedical support for HF 
management but not involving automatic transmissions could not 
show a beneﬁt.12,13 Very recently, preliminary data of the IN-TIME 
study revealed a signiﬁcant reduction of all-cause mortality and cardio- 
vascular mortality in the RM arm when compared with controls.14 The 
combined use of impedance measurement and RM was investigated in 
the EVOLVO study, demonstrating reduced emergency department 
or urgent in-ofﬁce visits by 35% without affecting hospitalizations.10 
In our study, we were not able to show a beneﬁt of impedance 
monitoring combined with RM when compared with a control 
group despite a predeﬁned management routine of alerts. In contrast 
to the EVOLVO study,10 our study showed more urgent care visits in 
the remote group when compared with the controls. Although we 
classiﬁed 93 OptiVol alerts as true positive, and ≈80% of these 
alerts were manageable without the need for hospitalization, this 
did not translate into a reduction of HF-related hospitalizations 
when compared with standard treatment. Several reasons may 
account for this. First, as HF hospitalizations could not be used 
anymore as a gold standard when aiming to avoid them, not all 
alerts may have been correctly classiﬁed. Secondly, the natural 
course of impending HF deterioration may not always lead to mani- 
fest cardiac decompensation, but also to spontaneous improvement 
of HF and return to stable conditions. In this context, the aim of the 
study of an early intervention to prevent hospitalization might have 
been counteracted by early detections of HF decompensation neces- 
sitating in-patient treatment in the remote group. The same patient 
in the control group might have spontaneously improved without 
the need for hospitalization and unnoticed by a physician. Finally, 
cardiac decompensation may be more complex than the assumption 
of a prolonged subclinical period of linear HF deterioration be- 
fore manifest decompensation, thus measurable with intrathoracic 
impedance.15 Indeed, in our study 19 of the positive alert patients 
were clinically diagnosed as an already manifest cardiac decompensa- 
tion that required hospitalization. These cases suggest a shorter sub- 
clinical period before decompensation without a genuine chance to 
intervene. 
Results reported by Singh et al.16 suggested that worsening clinical 
conditions such as hospitalization for HF are associated with an 
While the ﬁrst small or observational studies investigating 
intrathoracic impedance measurement revealed a sensitivity of 
60–77% for detection of a HF related ﬂuid accumulation, they also

increased risk of ICD shock delivery. Furthermore, an increased risk 
for ﬁrst and recurrent HF events after ICD discharge has been 
found.17 Several investigations have also shown that appropriate as 
well as inappropriate ICD discharges negatively impact on mortal- 
ity.18 Thus, improvement of HF status as well as early detection of 
device-related problems using telemonitoring should be capable of 
impacting on the rate of inappropriate and appropriate ICD shock de- 
liveries on the one hand. On the other hand, a reduction of ICD dis- 
charges could positively inﬂuence HF-related hospitalization and 
mortality. In the present study, however, we were not able to see a 
signiﬁcant difference of ICD shock deliveries between the remote 
and the control arms. This is in line with previously published data 
from Landolina et al.10. However, in their study as well as in ours, 
the number of events might not have been high enough for sufﬁcient 
discrimination. 
So far, only limited data are available concerning mortality and 
intrathoracic impedance monitoring or telemonitoring use. Previous 
studies investigating the impact of impedance monitoring or telemo- 
nitoring on HF hospitalizations or death revealed no signiﬁcant differ- 
ences between the control and treatment groups.6,12 These studies 
are in line with our data, as we were unable to demonstrate mortality 
differences between the treatment and control groups. As men- 
tioned earlier, recently results from the IN-TIME trial14 were pre- 
sented. A total of 664 patients with implanted cardiac arrhythmia 
devices were randomly assigned to telemonitoring or standard 
care and followed for 12 months. A signiﬁcant reduction of total mor- 
tality and cardiovascular mortality of (cid:4)65% between the two groups 
was observed. This risk reduction during 12 months of follow-up is 
difﬁcult to comprehend in the light of our results, even if our study 
included only about a quarter of the patients and was as a pilot 
study not powered for mortality analysis. Currently, two large trials 
aimed at further elucidating the role of RM combined with FM are 
under way.19,20 
Limitations 
The main limitation of our study is the number of patients included. As 
no signiﬁcant differences between the treatment groups were found, 
our results should be interpreted with the caution that they may be 
due to under-powering. However, we have conducted a uniform 
single-centre prospective, randomized pilot study with (cid:4)180 
patients included, thus hypothesis generating conclusions may be 
drawn from our data. Another potential limitation is the single-centre 
design of our study. However, the uniform response by a small 
experienced study group reduces the risk of heterogenous response 
to OptiVol alerts, which is unavoidable in a multicentre trial. This way, 
risk of a heterogeneous response as reason for the negative result can 
be substantially reduced. 

The data of this single-centre prospective randomized pilot trial do 
not support the use of RM combined with intrathoracic impedance 
monitoring in patients implanted with cardiac arrhythmia devices 
for the reduction of hospitalizations, tachyarrhythmia occurrence 
or mortality. This data need to be conﬁrmed in large randomized 
trials.
