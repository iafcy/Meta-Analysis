Methods 
A total of 312 patients with VVI- or DDD-ICD implants from 17 centres in six EU countries were randomised to HM ON 
and results 
or OFF, of which 303 were eligible for data analysis. For all contacts (in-ofﬁce, calendar- or alert-triggered web-based 
review, discussions, calls) time-expenditure was tracked. Country-speciﬁc cost parameters were used to convert 
resource use into monetary values. Remote FU equipment itself was not included in the cost calculations. Given only 
two patients from Finland (one in each group) a monetary valuation analysis was not performed for Finland. Average 
age was 62.4 + 13.1 years, 81% were male, 39% received a DDD system, and 51% had a prophylactic ICD. Resource 
use with HM ON was clearly different: less FU visits (3.79 + 1.67 vs. 5.53 + 2.32; P , 0.001) despite a small increase 
of unscheduled visits (0.95 + 1.50 vs. 0.62 + 1.25; P , 0.005), more non-ofﬁce-based contacts (1.95 + 3.29 vs. 
1.01 + 2.64; P , 0.001), more Internet sessions (11.02 + 15.28 vs. 0.06 + 0.31; P , 0.001) and more in-clinic discus- 
sions (1.84 + 4.20 vs. 1.28 + 2.92; P , 0.03), but with numerically fewer hospitalizations (0.67 + 1.18 vs. 0.85 + 1.43, 
P ¼ 0.23) and shorter length-of-stay (6.31 + 15.5 vs. 8.26 + 18.6; P ¼ 0.27), although not signiﬁcant. For the 
whole study population, the total FU cost for providers was not different for HM ON vs. OFF [mean (95% CI): E204

Remote follow-up (FU) of implantable cardiac deﬁbrillators (ICDs) allows for fewer in-ofﬁce visits in combination with 
earlier detection of relevant ﬁndings. Its implementation requires investment and reorganization of care. Providers 
(physicians or hospitals) are unsure about the ﬁnancial impact. The primary end-point of this randomized prospective 
multicentre health economic trial was the total FU-related cost for providers, comparing Home Monitoring facilitated 
FU (HM ON) to regular in-ofﬁce FU (HM OFF) during the ﬁrst 2 years after ICD implantation. Also the net ﬁnancial 
impact on providers (taking national reimbursement into account) and costs from a healthcare payer perspective 
were evaluated. 



Over the last years remote monitoring of implanted devices like 
implantable deﬁbrillators (ICD) has been introduced. All stake- 
holders see potential beneﬁts: physicians and hospitals (the ‘provi- 
ders’) may optimize performance by reducing the number of 
in-hospital visits, while specialist nurses and/or technicians can 
ﬁlter alerts from the remote system, hence possibly saving physician 
time.1 For patients, the technology provides a more continuous 
follow-up (FU) and saves time for visits to outpatient clinics that 
often do not result in speciﬁc actions.2,3 Many studies have shown 
that remote technology results in patient care that is non-inferior 
to classical FU with in-ofﬁce visits.1,4 – 8 Especially daily remote mon- 
itoring results in earlier detection of device and patient-related pro- 
blems which translate into earlier clinical decision-making, 
less 
inappropriate shocks and improved device longevity.7 – 9 The 
CONNECT trial also showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the length 
of cardiovascular hospitalizations9 and the IN-TIME trial even 
showed a mortality beneﬁt in ICD patients with heart failure.10 
Some trials have looked as secondary end-points at the cost impact 
from the perspective of the healthcare payer.6,11 There is data indi- 
cating that healthcare payers may have a dominant strategy option 
with remote ICD monitoring, since costs may be reduced and out- 
comes improved with remote FU. 
While investigators have evaluated the time needed from physi- 
cians and nurses/technicians for remote monitoring,12 – 14 a formal 
cost analysis from the provider viewpoint has never been performed. 
Nevertheless, the net ﬁnancial impact on providers will inﬂuence 
their willingness to change care models from reimbursed in-hospital 
visits to remote evaluation, especially when the latter is not reim- 
bursed and given the investments needed to train nurses and 
employ those for the FU activities.15 Industry has to provide addition- 
al hardware (transmitters), set up infrastructure (servers) and take 
care of communication costs, which are not covered separately 
from the device price. If all stakeholders want to stimulate a reorgan- 
ization of FU for ICD patients towards remote monitoring, they need 
to know its cost structure to ensure proper ﬁnancing for the future. 
Therefore, the primary objective of this EuroEco trial was to evaluate 
the impact on the cost for providers when relying on Home Monitor- 
ing (HM)-based FU compared with classical FU with only in-ofﬁce 
visits. Since reimbursement systems are very heterogeneous in differ- 
ent European countries, secondary objectives were to study the 
impact on the providers’ net clinical income for FU, and the costs 
for ICD FU with or without remote monitoring from a healthcare 
payer perspective. Further secondary end-points were the rate of 
in-ofﬁce FU visits with relevant ﬁndings and patient-reported 
quality-of-life assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire. 

Study design 
The European Health Economic Trial on HM in ICD Therapy was a ran- 
domized, non-blinded, parallel-design trial in which 17 centres from six 
European countries (Belgium 3 centres, Finland 1, Germany 4, UK 3, 
Spain 4, The Netherlands 1) participated. To be enrolled, patients had 
to meet the standard indication for a new or replacement VVI- or 
DDD-ICD enabled with HM technology capable of electrogram trans- 
mission (Biotronik ICDs models Lumos, n ¼ 3, or Lumax, all others). 
There were no further clinical in- or exclusion criteria except age ≥18 
years. A CRT-cohort was started as an extension and is still enrolling. 
Patients were enrolled prior to ICD implantation, after which they 
were randomized 1 : 1 to receive regular in-ofﬁce FU visits (HM OFF 
group) or a HM facilitated FU regime (HM ON group) for the next 
2 years. Three in-ofﬁce FUs were mandatory for all the patients (within 
6 weeks after discharge, 12 + 1 and 24 + 2 months after discharge) 
(see Figure 1). Further in-ofﬁce FU visits were scheduled according to 
each centre’s individual routine for the HM OFF patients only. Unsched- 
uled in-ofﬁce FU visits initiated by the physician or the patient could occur 
in both patient groups at any time during the study. Patients randomized 
to HM ON were under continuous, automatic remote monitoring during 
the entire study. The frequency of HM data analysis and the response to 
HM alerts was left to the investigators’ discretion. 
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of all par- 
ticipating institutions and the trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov 
under identiﬁer NCT00776087. All the patients gave their written 
informed consent to participate in the trial. 
Medical and resource use data collection 
All medical contacts of the patients were recorded over the course of the 
trial from paper or electronic charts, including contacts with the provider 
(in-ofﬁce, planned or web-based data review following alerts, internal dis- 
cussions, phone calls) as well as visits to other physicians, additional 
medical examinations, and hospital admissions. All actions taken were 
evaluated for clinical relevance by an investigator blinded to group assign- 
ment and based on pre-speciﬁed criteria. A second blinded scientist 
(169 –238) vs. E213 (182 –243); range for difference (E236 to 54), NS]. From a payer perspective, FU-related costs 
were similar while the total cost per patient (including other physician visits, examinations, and hospitalizations) was nu- 
merically (but not signiﬁcantly) lower. There was no difference in the net ﬁnancial impact on providers [proﬁt of E408 
(327 –489) vs. E400 (345– 455); range for difference (E2104 to 88), NS], but there was heterogeneity among countries, 
with less proﬁt for providers in the absence of speciﬁc remote FU reimbursement (Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands) 
and maintained or increased proﬁt in cases where such reimbursement exists (Germany and UK). Quality of life (SF-36) 
was not different.

Conclusion 
For all the patients as a whole, FU-related costs for providers are not different for remote FU vs. purely in-ofﬁce FU, 
despite reorganized care. However, disparity in the impact on provider budget among different countries illustrates 
the need for proper reimbursement to ensure effective remote FU implementation.

double-checked the decisions. Patients self-reported their quality-of-life 
using SF-36 at randomization, and after 1 and 2 years of FU. 
For all provider contacts (including internal discussions between staff 
members, phone calls, and unscheduled visits), staff time consumption 
(type of staff and duration) was tracked, often using purpose-built elec- 
tronic documentation tools (web-based time-tracking software that 
was activated at the opening and closure of any contact; dedicated chron- 
ometers; automatic logging of calls on mobile phones of nurses and/or

physicians). All study personnel was trained to log time on contacts for 
EuroEco patients. Data were later entered in paper-based case report 
forms. The hospital charts of the patients were clearly labelled to 
remind study personnel about the patient’s inclusion in the trial and the 
need for time logging. 
Monetary valuation: healthcare costs 
Cost analysis was conducted from the provider perspective and from the 
healthcare payer perspective. Provider net income was calculated as the 
difference between payer reimbursement for FU services and provider 
cost related to FU. Country-speciﬁc tariffs and staff costs were used to 
convert measured resource use into monetary values and calculate the 
costs per patient. Non-medical costs (overhead) were derived from cal- 
culated staff time and estimated ofﬁce space, based on nationally 
accepted percentages. Given only two patients from Finland (one in 
each group) cost calculations were not performed for this country. 
Remote monitoring equipment itself was not included in the cost calcula- 
tions because of its arbitrary values; we rather opted for an analysis that 
shows payers possible margins for reimbursement of the technology 
based on their overall budget impact. 
Payer costs were based on diagnosis-related groups tariffs, national or 
regional fee-for-service tariffs, public general hospital tariffs, or publica- 
tions at the end of 2013. If geographic differences were noted within a 
single country, a mid-point estimate of the various observed tariffs was 
taken. All costs were expressed in Euro (E). If not available, 2013 costs 
were estimated by applying an appropriate inﬂation factor to previous 
year costs using the country-speciﬁc consumer price index. 
A stratiﬁed exploratory analysis comparing countries with different 
reimbursement systems was pre-speciﬁed as a secondary end-point. 
The challenges of an appropriate method for analysing healthcare data 
from different jurisdictions have been discussed by others.16 – 18 A recom- 
mended method to calculate the costs for a given country is to consider 
the resource use of all patients in the sample and then apply to these 
resources cost data for that country. However, this method can only 
be applied if resource use is homogeneous within the sample. Key 
resource utilization data from the different countries (number of FU 
visits, time spent by healthcare workers, hospitalization data) were there- 
fore analysed using generalized linear modelling to verify whether they 
were sufﬁciently homogeneous to be a valid basis for calculating country- 
speciﬁc costs. Overall heterogeneity in resource use was detected. Two 
sets of countries with homogeneous utilization (mainly based on the 
number of FU visits to the provider centre) were identiﬁed, comprising 
Belgium, The Netherlands, and the UK in one group and Finland, 
Germany, and Spain in another. 
Statistical methods 
The sample size estimate was based on an anticipated reduction of total 
time needed for FU by 14.5 min over 2 years, derived from early non- 
randomized trials and investigator databases. For a two-sided signiﬁcance 
level of 5% to detect this difference and a power of 80%, 312 patients 
were needed. Ahead of database closure, statistical analysis plans were 
developed for the clinical and the health economic evaluation, respect- 
ively, deﬁning all analytical details. The SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., 
USA) was used to evaluate utilization data and to undertake cost calcula- 
tions. Categorical variables were described by number and frequency of 
the non-missing data and compared between arms using the Fisher`s exact 
test. Continuous variables such as number of FU visits were not normally 
distributed and were therefore compared between arms using the non- 
parametric Mann–Whitney U test. All tests were interpreted two-sided, 
at a 5% level of signiﬁcance. 
For the analysis of the SF-36v2 questionnaires, Health Outcomes 
Scoring Software 4.5 (QualityMetric Incorporated, Lincoln, RI, USA) 
was used. Thereby, raw data of the SF36-items were transformed into 
eight subscores by using the QualityMetric’s Missing Score Estimator. 
These variables were transformed in subscores based on 2009 US 
norms, from which the mental health sum-score MCS and physical 
health sum-score (PCS) were calculated. In addition to both sum-scores, 
subscores before norm-basing were analysed with respect to any differ- 
ence between HM ON vs. HM OFF to rule out any bias caused by using 
the standard US norm for European patients. For the purpose of com- 
parative analysis, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was 
applied here as well. 
Cost per patient was described by mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, maximum, and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI). Conﬁdence 
intervals were generated using the non-parametric bootstrapping 
method with 1000 replicates. If the 95% CI for difference excluded 
zero, the cost differences was considered statistically signiﬁcant at the 
P ¼ 0.05 level. The data were bootstrapped by study arm to ensure 
the treatment balance remained constant. Costs were calculated for 
the whole mix of patients as enrolled in the study, and also by country 
based on its corresponding grouping of resource utilization data (see 
above). 
Pre-speciﬁed subgroups were evaluated in a multivariate analysis for 
their impact on provider and payer costs. These subgroups were 
single- vs. dual-chamber ICD, primary vs. secondary prevention indica- 
tion, NYHA class ≤II and ≥III, and age below vs. above median, apart 
from HM ON vs. OFF and country. 

Patient characteristics and study execution 
Of 312 patients enrolled between July 2008 and July 2011, 303 were 
eligible for FU data analysis and constituted the actual sample size 
(159 randomized to HM ON, 144 randomized to HM OFF) since 
nine patients terminated the study prematurely without providing 
any data after randomization (BE n ¼ 87, FI n ¼ 2, DE n ¼ 88, UK 
n ¼ 47, ES n ¼ 54, NL n ¼ 25). The baseline characteristics of the 
two study groups were similar (Table 1) except for the rate of patients 
with a primary prophylactic indication, which was higher in the HM 
ON group. 
Six patients crossed over from HM OFF to ON for medical 
reasons. In four cases, the investigator stopped study participation 
for these patients, while the other two were analysed according to 
the intention-to-treat principle. A total of 61 patients (20.1%) termi- 
nated the study before the pre-speciﬁed 24-month FU visit, mainly 
due to death or other clinical end-points (Figure 1). The remaining 
242 patients terminated the study as planned at the 24-month FU. 
The median FU duration after randomization was 24.0 months 
(IQR: 23.1–24.5) in those patients and 11.9 months (IQR: 5.1 – 
in patients with early termination, without differences 
19.4) 
between study groups. 
Resource utilization during follow-up 
During the whole study period, HM ON patients had signiﬁcantly less 
scheduled in-ofﬁce FU visits than HM OFF patients (Table 2). Despite 
a signiﬁcantly higher number of unscheduled in-ofﬁce FU visits in the 
HM ON group, the total number of FU visits was still signiﬁcantly 
lower with HM ON (3.79 + 1.67 vs. 5.53 + 2.32, P , 0.001). On 


the other hand, the HM ON group had signiﬁcantly more FU contacts 
outside of FU visits (i.e. phone calls) and internal discussions among 
staff (Table 2). There were no signiﬁcant changes in the utilization 
of other healthcare services, although there were numerically 
fewer cardiovascular hospitalizations and shorter length-of-stay in 
the HM ON patients (Table 2). 
The average time spent on each of the above-mentioned contacts 
was not signiﬁcantly different for HM ON vs. OFF patients, neither for 
physicians, nurses nor technicians (Table 2). Figure 2 shows the cumu- 
lative time spent on every patient for all contacts combined: HM did 
not change the total time needed for follow-up, nor the cumulative 
time for all types of personnel combined: over the study period, 
176 min of staff time per patient were required for HM ON vs. 
178 min in HM OFF patients (NS). Only physicians spent signiﬁcantly 
less time for patients in HM ON, but the difference was small (64 vs. 
73 min, P ¼ 0.028). 
Costs for follow-up 
Figure 3A shows the monetary valuation of the time needed by differ- 
ent provider personnel during FU and the non-medical costs (mainly 
overhead): from a provider perspective, the average cost for FU 
during 2 years was not different for the HM ON and OFF groups 
[mean (95% CI): E204 (169 –238) vs. E213 (182–243); range for 
difference (E236 to 54), NS], without differences in either direct 
medical or non-medical costs. For the average trial patient, also the 
FU-related reimbursement was identical, leading to an unaffected 
net clinical income for the provider [proﬁt of E408 (327– 489) vs. 
E400 (345 –455); range for difference (E2104 to 88), NS]. 
From a payer perspective (Figure 3 B), there was a small albeit not 
statistically signiﬁcant decrease in total costs over a 2-year period 
(excluding the cost of the device and of any remote monitoring equip- 
ment or communication costs). The main cost driver for payers is the 
number of hospitalization days for patients: in line with numerically 
fewer hospitalizations and a shorter length-of-hospital stay, there 
was a numerical (non-signiﬁcant) reduction in hospitalization costs. 
There was no difference in the costs related to non-provider physician 
visits or examinations. 
Multivariable testing showed that the cost for providers was only 
signiﬁcantly dependent on the country (P , 0.001), while for total 
payer cost only the type of ICD (VVI vs. DDD) had a signiﬁcant 
impact (P , 0.001). Costs were not dependent on primary or 
secondary indication for implant (Table 3). 
Figure 4 illustrates the heterogeneity among countries, with less 
proﬁt for providers in the absence of speciﬁc remote FU reim- 
bursement (left side: Belgium, Netherlands, and Spain) vs. main- 
tained or increased proﬁt in case such reimbursement exists

(right side: Germany and UK). Nevertheless, the overall costs from 
the payer perspective were numerically lower in countries without 
reimbursement, and were similar in those with reimbursement 
(Figure 5). 
Other secondary end-points 
There were no differences between HM ON and OFF in any of the 
SF-36 patient-reported quality of life measures, not at baseline, and 
not at 1 year or 2 years of FU, and there were no changes during 
the course of the study in any of the measures: PCS at enrolment 
was 44.7 + 9.3 for HM ON vs. 45.2 + 9.7 for HM OFF, with respect- 
ive values at 1 year 43.9 + 11.1 vs. 45.1 + 10.2, and at 2 years 44.4 + 
11.0 vs. 45.4 + 10.6; MCS at enrolment 48.8 + 10.6 for HM ON vs. 
46.8 + 11.3 for HM OFF, and at 1 and 2 years 49.3 + 10.2 vs. 48.9 + 
10.2 and 48.0 + 11.5 vs. 47.8 + 10.8, respectively (all inter- and 
intragroup comparisons non-signiﬁcant). 
In the HM ON group, 
32.0% of in-ofﬁce FU visits (193/603) resulted in a clinically relevant 
ﬁnding/action (‘actionable visits’) compared with 26.8% (213/795) in 
the HM OFF group (P , 0.05). 

Although remote monitoring technology of cardiac implantable 
devices entered the clinical ﬁeld (cid:4)10 years ago, EuroEco is the ﬁrst 
trial estimating the cost for providers in setting up an organization 
based on such technology. Prior trials have shown that such FU is 
non-inferior clinically from a major events perspective, and even 
has clinical advantages like earlier actionability on clinical- or 
device-related ﬁndings, fewer and shorter hospitalizations, fewer 
inappropriate shocks, 
longer battery longevity, and even lower 
mortality.1,6,7,9,10,14 Taken together with data on the existing 
reimbursement situation (deﬁning provider income) and on the 
costs from a payer perspective, EuroEco also allowed to estimate 
the impact on the net income of physicians and hospitals. The ﬁnancial 
impact is an important determinant for physicians and hospitals when 
considering adoption of a remote monitoring-based FU. The ﬁndings 
in the overall EuroEco population showed no change in provider cost 
of HM based vs. classical FU, nor on their net income. The HM ON 
arm included signiﬁcantly more patients with a primary prophylaxis 
indication (who could be expected to require less intensive FU or 
have less complications), but multivariate analysis did not show a sig- 
niﬁcant impact of this variable on provider costs. Although the sample 
size calculation was based on time investment ﬁndings, cost valuation 
was not used as basis for the power calculations. The aspect of het- 
erogeneity in cost between the countries was underestimated. This 
may have decreased the initially calculated power. Nevertheless, 
the very close values for both arms for total time investment and 
for the primary end-point make it very unlikely that a higher sample 
size might have found different overall results. 
In contrast to the overall trial population result, the patterns of 
provider net income in individual countries are of most relevance 
when interpreting the study data. In countries that have already 
implemented reimbursement for remote monitoring (like the UK 
and Germany), provider net income will increase, thus leading to 
an incentive to use remote monitoring. It is very plausible that in 
other countries (like Belgium, The Netherlands, or Spain in our 


study), there may be more incentives to maintain classic in-ofﬁce FUs, 
since that is the only way to get reimbursement for FU activities, costs 
being similar. 
An interesting observation is that the total cost for the insurance 
payer decreases, albeit not signiﬁcantly, and does not even increase 
implemented remote FU 
in countries 

Figure 2 Staff time spent during 2 years of implantable cardiac deﬁbrillator follow-up. The time needed to follow-up the average patient for 2 years 
did not change with HM. Over the study period, 178 min of staff time per patient were required for HM OFF vs. 176 min in HM ON patients. Sig- 
niﬁcant changes are indicated by an asterisk, and the P-value is mentioned. Left: the time saved by the reduction of in-clinic follow-ups is re-directed to 
performing remote monitoring, call patients more frequently and discuss patient data more often. Right: only physician time was signiﬁcantly lower 
with HM ON, albeit to a small extent.

reimbursement, showing that there is room for such proper compen- 
sation of providers. EuroEco observed numerically fewer and shorter 
hospitalizations, ﬁndings that corroborate with similar results from 
other ICD trials such as ECOST (with non-signiﬁcant lower hospital 
costs) and CONNECT (showing a signiﬁcantly shorter length of 
stay)9,11 as well as from pacemaker trials such as COMPAS and 
Oedipe.7,19 EuroEco did not make any cost-effectiveness calcula- 
tions, since the payer perspective was not the primary one, and 
since the trial was not powered to detect signiﬁcant differences in 
clinical outcome parameters. As the SF-36 measurements indicated, 
we could also not detect a signiﬁcant difference in health-related 
quality-of-life, although prior trials have shown a high level of 
patient acceptance and satisfaction.3 
In our cost analysis, we deliberately did not take into account any 
remote monitoring equipment itself, nor did we include communica- 
tion costs, because such costs could be criticized as being arbitrary 
since mainly based on unilateral estimates by the manufacturer. 
Nevertheless, given the overall lower costs for payers with remote 
monitoring, EuroEco will allow informed discussions between all 
parties (payers, providers, and manufacturers) to come to balanced 
reimbursement scenarios for all. Scientiﬁc organizations and industry 
have already developed frameworks on how to provide appropriate 
reimbursement for device telemonitoring, with general principles 
and country-speciﬁc measures.20,21 The EuroEco data may certainly 
serve to specify these recommendations further. 
While we are conﬁdent about the direction of the ﬁndings on 
income impact of remote monitoring in different countries, we 
want to raise caution about the absolute values of the calculated 
costs and reimbursements which should not be taken for granted. 
First, there was no statistical signiﬁcance in any of the cost compari- 
sons HM ON vs. OFF in the individual country scenarios, which may 
be related to the smaller groups as result of the splitting of the whole 
population due to heterogeneity of utilization data. Second, cost data 
were derived from country-based national databases and tariffs, 
which may not always be fully representative of a speciﬁc hospital’s 
situation. Third, only a few centres per country participated and 
these centres do not necessarily represent the average practice in 
each country. Also, there may have some underreporting of the util- 
ization data in the trial. In contrast to other clinical trials, in which a 
pre-speciﬁed regimen is guiding data gathering, 
investigators and 
nurses in EuroEco had to develop a reﬂex of documenting all contacts 
and their timing when dealing with study ICD patients, often unex- 
pectedly (alerts, phone calls, . . .). Although we developed speciﬁc 
tools to facilitate this work, some contacts may have gone undocu- 
mented. Nevertheless, our time measurements found higher time 
consumption for FU in EuroEco compared with some previous 
trials. For example, the total nurse + technician time for remote 
FU (i.e. excluding the in-ofﬁce visits) documented in EuroEco was 
59 min per patient over 2 years, which would equal to (cid:4)246 min 
per month for 100 patients followed. Earlier trials estimated this 
cumulative time (cid:4)43, 59,14,22 and 660 min,13 a difference which 
may be related to the different tasks included in the analysis. 
The saving in physician time was only modest in EuroEco (73 vs. 
64 min over 2 years; P ¼ 0.028) and total physician time was higher 
than in other trials,13,22 despite a similar signiﬁcant reduction of 
in-ofﬁce visits. This may be due to a learning curve, where physicians 
tended to do more of the HM work in the early phase of adoption, 
while relaying more to trained nurses in a later phase. EuroEco was 
started in 2008, i.e. short after HM technology was adopted in the clin- 
ical ﬁeld. Also, our trial did a much more detailed and diverse time 
tracking of physician commitments during FU than other studies, 
including internal discussions, phone calls and unscheduled visits. 
This can also explain why other trials also reported a much lower 
physician- than nurse-time (10–25%) while both were comparable 
over the full trial period in our study.13,14 Nevertheless, our data indi- 
cate that HM allows reducing physician time and shifting it to other 
competent staff members, which is one of the prime drivers of health- 
care reform all over the world. The disparity between nurse and tech- 
nician time, as seen in EuroEco, may reﬂect country-based differences 
that in essence might not be fundamental: both nurses and technicians 
were speciﬁcally qualiﬁed personnel for device FU in all centres. 
Hence, the activities performed by a study nurse in one centre 


could be regarded interchangeable with the responsibilities of techni- 
cians in other practices/countries. Also the EHRA report on resource 
use during device FU revealed these regional differences.23 
This EuroEco report only deals with VVI- and DDD-ICD patients. 
The study has been extended by also including heart failure patients 
with a cardiac resynchronization ICD (CRT-D), for whom a more 
complex and time-intensive clinical and device FU can be anticipated. 
It needs to be seen in how far the health-economic results reported 
here can be extended to the CRT-D population. 

For all the patients as a whole in the EuroEco trial, FU-related costs 
for providers were not different for FU based on remote monitoring 
vs. purely in-ofﬁce FU of VVI- or DDD-ICD patients, despite reorga- 
nized care with clearly different utilization patterns. The costs for the 
payers of healthcare were also statistically similar, although with 
numerically decreased costs if HM ON, related to numerically 
fewer and shorter hospitalizations. Disparity in the impact on 
Figure 4 Country-dependent variations in provider costs and income. Although provider costs for follow-up are similar for HM ON or OFF 
patients in all countries, the net income impact of either follow-up strategy is dependent on the existing reimbursement provision for remote 
monitoring-related activities by the provider (physicians, nurses, and technicians): in countries without such provisions (and usually only a 
fee-for-service for in-person visits), net income of the providers decreases, while it increases if remote monitoring reimbursement is available 
(UK and Germany). 


provider budget among different countries illustrates the need 
for proper reimbursement to ensure effective implementation of 
remote FU.
