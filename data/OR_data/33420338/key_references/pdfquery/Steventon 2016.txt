ABSTRACT 
Objectives: To assess the effects of a home-based 
telehealth intervention on the use of secondary 
healthcare and mortality. 
Design: Observational study of a mainstream telehealth 
service, using person-level administrative data. Time to 
event analysis (Cox regression) was performed 
comparing telehealth patients with controls who were 
matched using a machine-learning algorithm. 
Setting: A predominantly rural region of England 
(North Yorkshire). 
Participants: 716 telehealth patients were recruited from 
community, general practice and specialist acute care, 
between June 2010 and March 2013. Patients had chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure or 
diabetes, and a history of associated inpatient admission. 
Patients were matched 1:1 to control patients, also 
selected from North Yorkshire, with respect to 
demographics, diagnoses of health conditions, previous 
hospital use and predictive risk score. 
Interventions: Telehealth involved the remote exchange 
of medical data between patients and healthcare 
professionals as part of the ongoing management of the 
patient’s health condition. Monitoring centre staff alerted 
healthcare professionals if the telemonitored data 
exceeded preset thresholds. Control patients received 
usual care, without telehealth. 
Primary and secondary outcome measures: Time to 
the first emergency (unplanned) hospital admission or 
death. Secondary metrics included time to death and time 
to first admission, outpatient attendance and emergency 
department visit. 
Results: Matched controls and telehealth patients were 
similar at baseline. Following enrolment, telehealth 
patients were more likely than matched controls to 
experience emergency admission or death (adjusted HR 
1.34, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.56, p<0.001). They were also 
more likely to have outpatient attendances (adjusted 
HR=1.25, 1.11 to 1.40, p<0.001), but mortality rates were 
similar between groups. Sensitivity analyses showed that 
we were unlikely to have missed reductions in the 
likelihood of an emergency admission or death because of 
unobserved baseline differences between patient groups. 
Conclusions: Telehealth was not associated with a 
reduction in secondary care utilisation. 
INTRODUCTION 
Telehealth has been proposed as a way to 
improve 
long-term 
the management of 
health conditions such as diabetes, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease and heart 
failure.1 It involves the regular and remote 
transmission of medical information (such as 
blood oxygen or weight) between patients 
and healthcare professionals. The hope is 
that, by encouraging patients to monitor 
aspects of their own health and by providing 
timely 
tele- 
feedback from professionals, 
health might 
lead to better patient out- 
comes. 
In turn, policymakers hope that 
telehealth will avoid unnecessary unplanned 


▪ We evaluated the effect of a large telehealth 
service on emergency hospital 
admissions, 
within an observational study of routine clinical 
practice, using hospital administrative data. 
▪ The effectiveness of telehealth might be different, 
in routine practice, to clinical trials, as healthcare 
professionals can tailor the telehealth services to 
the local context over time and might also recruit 
patients with different characteristics than those 
in trials. 
▪ We compared telehealth patients with local 
patients who were eligible for telehealth but were 
receiving usual care. These were matched to the 
characteristics of telehealth patients (demograph- 
ics, diagnoses of health conditions, previous 
hospital use and predictive risk score) using a 
machine-learning algorithm. 
▪ We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess

whether 
altered our findings. 
▪ The retrospective nature of the study avoided the 
risk of a Hawthorne effect, but we had to exclude 
approximately 22% of telehealth patients whose 
diagnosis we could not confirm within the hos- 
pital administrative data. 



(‘emergency’) hospital admissions, which are costly as 
well as undesirable to patients.2 
Early meta-analyses about the effect of telehealth were 
positive,3 but recent, large randomised controlled trials 
have tended to be ambiguous or negative about the 
effects of telehealth on hospital utilisation. The largest 
trial, the Whole Systems Demonstrator, compared tele- 
health with usual care in over 3000 patients with dia- 
betes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart 
failure. This showed lower rates of emergency hospital 
admissions and deaths among telehealth patients than 
controls, but these ﬁndings may have been linked to 
unexpected patterns among controls.4 Other large trials 
found no effects on time to hospital admission following 
an exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease,5 and no change in readmissions 
for heart 
failure.6 Randomisation is used to produce comparable 
treatment groups, but randomised controlled trials can 
have limited applicability to medical decision-making, as 
either the treatments or patient groups might differ to 
routine practice.7 This has now been conﬁrmed in a 
formal analysis of 
the Whole 
Systems Demonstrator trial.8 

In this study, we assess the effect of telehealth on hos- 
pital utilisation and mortality when delivered in routine 
practice. Although our study was not randomised, we 
used machine-learning methods to select, from a wider 
pool of potential controls, a matched subset of patients 
that was similar to the telehealth group with respect to 
observed baseline characteristics.9 These methods have 
been proposed for evaluative studies of telehealth,10 but 
the few existing matching studies in this area11–13 have 
not subjected their ﬁndings to rigorous sensitivity testing 
to explore whether the reported treatment effects might 
be attributable to unobserved differences in the baseline 
characteristics of intervention and control groups.14 
METHODS 
The North Yorkshire and York Primary Care Trust 
commissioned a telehealth programme for patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure or 
diabetes, in July 2010, making it an early adopter of tel- 
ehealth in England.2 We conducted a retrospective 
study that linked telehealth patients to hospital adminis- 
trative data, and selected a matched control group of 
patients from within North Yorkshire. Local controls 
were preferred as this minimises bias in studies of hos- 
pital admissions compared with strategies that select 
from similar geographical areas.15 Controls 
controls 
were matched for important prognostic variables includ- 
ing predictive risk score, demographic characteristics, 
diagnoses of health conditions and prior hospital util- 
isation. The study was conducted in line with the ori- 
ginal evaluation protocol (see online supplementary 
material) except that general practice data were not 
available, thus limiting the number of secondary end- 
points that could be assessed. 
Telehealth intervention 
The patient’s clinician determined if 
telehealth was 
appropriate for the patient based on a number of con- 
siderations (box 1). The telehealth equipment consisted 
of the home-based Tunstall mymedic monitoring ‘hub’, 
and a set of peripheral devices that measured aspects of 
a patient’s health. Which peripheral devices were used 
depended on the patient’s diagnosis but could include: 
weighing scales; pulse oximeters; blood pressure moni- 
thermometers; blood glucose metres; peak-ﬂow 
tors; 
monitors or spirometres; coagulation metres; and 1-lead 
ECG. Standard conﬁgurations for patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease are shown as an example 
in the online supplementary table S1. In addition, an 
automated health questionnaire was delivered through 
mymedic. This asked patients about their general health 
status. 
Referring clinicians gave patients personal schedules 
for telemonitoring, which were coded into mymedic. 
Tuition was provided to patients in the use of the equip- 
ment when it was 
installed. Typically, patients were 
required to use the telehealth peripherals once a day, 
although some patients took readings more often. The 
recordings were transmitted automatically to a triage 
centre, operated by Tunstall. If a recording exceeded a 
threshold set by the referring clinician, then an agent at 
the triage centre contacted the patient to ask them to 


Eligible patients could be referred into the telehealth programme 
from community teams, general practice, or on discharge from a 
secondary care facility, such as a cardiology department. The 
referral criteria were broad and overlapping, and also changed 
over time. The service recruited patients: 
▸ Diagnosed with one of 
the targeted chronic conditions 
failure and 
(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart 
diabetes) 
▸ With one of the targeted chronic conditions and two or more 
emergency (unplanned) hospital admissions in the previous 
12 months 
▸ Deemed to be at risk of having an emergency admission in 
through identification by the Adjusted 

future, 
Clinical Groups predictive risk model44 
▸ With high anxiety levels who usually defer to unplanned or 
emergency services and who could benefit from this level of 
support 



from telehealth 
In addition, patients had to be considered capable of using the 
equipment 
(this included understanding instructions and the 
patient informed consent form). Patients were not eligible for tele- 
health if their home was not suitable for it, for example, if there 
was no regular telephone line or no access to a mobile (cellular) 
telephone for transmission of the telemonitored data and for com- 
munication with the monitoring centre. 


repeat the measurement. The agent also asked further 
questions regarding the patient’s health. If the reading 
continued to exceed the threshold or if the intervention 
of a healthcare professional was required, then the situ- 
ation was escalated to the monitoring clinician. 
Study populations 
We studied patients enrolled in the North Yorkshire tele- 
health programme between the time it started ( July 
2010) and the time it was decommissioned following a 
reorganisation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 
England (31 March 2013). We restricted our attention to 
patients with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmon- 
ary disease, congestive heart failure or diabetes recorded 
in inpatient administrative data within the three previous 
years. This was done so that we could standardise our 
criteria across our intervention and control groups. The 
matching algorithm described below aimed to adjust for 
other characteristics 
that might be associated with 
receipt of telehealth beyond these criteria. 
We excluded a small number of intervention patients 
who did not 
transfer telehealth readings. We also 
excluded (from both intervention and control groups) 
participants in the initial pilot programme that ran from 
September 2009 to May 2010 and those in another tele- 
health service for residents of care homes. 
Study endpoints and sample size calculation 
The main hypothesis was that telehealth affected (in 
either direction) the time to the ﬁrst emergency hospital 
admission or death following enrolment in telehealth. 
The study reﬂected events up until 
the service was 
decommissioned on 31 March 2013. 
At the outset of this study, we conducted a sample size 
calculation to check whether we were likely to have data 
on a sufﬁciently large number of telehealth patients to 
draw robust conclusions. In line with other studies in 
this area,16 we wanted to be able to detect a 15–20% 
relative change in the time to ﬁrst emergency admission 
or death (as measured by the hazard ratio (HR)), at 
power 90% and two-sided p value <0.05. Sample size cal- 
culations assumed: individuals were recruited into the 
telehealth service at a uniform rate; 25% of matched 
control patients experienced an emergency admission 
or death each year; and 95% of telehealth patients were 
linked to administrative data for this study. The calcula- 
tion determined that 715 telehealth patients were 
needed to detect a relative change of 20% in the 
primary endpoint. 
Secondary endpoints were time to death; and time to 
the ﬁrst emergency admission, elective admission, out- 
patient attendance, emergency department (ie, accident 
and emergency) visit, and admission for an ambulatory 
care-sensitive 
care-sensitive 
conditions are those conditions for which admissions 
are considered preventable by primary care services.17 18 
We could not assess 
impacts on general practice 
contacts, as these data were not available. 


Data sources and linkage 
Tunstall transferred identiﬁable data for telehealth partici- 
pants (including the national unique patient identiﬁer or 
‘NHS number’, sex, date of birth and postcode) to the 
NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre 
(HSCIC). HSCIC acted as a trusted third party and linked 
telehealth participants to national administrative data on 
secondary care activity (the Hospital Episode Statistics, or 
HES).19 The data linkage method required an exact or 
partial match on several of the identiﬁable ﬁelds at once. 

After the data had been linked, HSCIC transferred 
pseudonymised HES identiﬁers for the telehealth parti- 
cipants 
the 
Nufﬁeld Trust, together with the date of patient enrol- 
ment in the telehealth programme, year of birth, sex 
and small geographical area code. Thus, the evaluation 
team had no access to identiﬁable patient data. The 
Ethics and Conﬁdentiality Committee of the National 
Information Governance Board conﬁrmed that data 
could be linked in this way without explicit patient 
consent for the purposes of studies of this nature. 
Baseline variables 
Baseline variables were derived for intervention and 
potential control patients using HES data. For telehealth 
patients, these were calculated at the date of registration 
in the telehealth system. For matched controls, variables 
were calculated at certain index dates that were produced 
by the matching algorithm (described below, box 2). 
The set of baseline variables was based on an estab- 
lished predictive risk model 
for emergency hospital 
admissions.20 These variables were: age band; sex; small 
area-based socioeconomic deprivation score;21 16 indi- 
vidual health conditions; 
long-term 
health conditions; and previous emergency, elective and 
outpatient hospital use. The 16 individual health condi- 
tion variables were formed from the primary and sec- 
ondary diagnosis codes 
in the previous 3 years of 
inpatient data (table 1). We used the deﬁnitions from 
previous studies to derive admissions for ambulatory 
care-sensitive conditions.17 18 

In addition to these baseline variables, we also esti- 
mated the baseline risk of emergency hospital admission 
in the 12 months following enrolment. The models were 
based on the variables used in the published predictive 
risk model,20 but reweighted to reﬂect patterns of hos- 
pital utilisation observed for non-telehealth residents of 
North Yorkshire. Models were constructed using logistic 
regression on a monthly basis throughout the enrolment 
period and validated on split samples. The estimated β 
coefﬁcients 
from the validated models were then 
applied to telehealth patients to produce their baseline 
risk scores, as is recommended practice when using pre- 
dictive risk scores in matching studies.22 
Selecting matched controls 
The matching algorithm (box 2) aimed to select, from 
the wider population of potential controls, a subgroup 



of matched controls who were similar to the patients in 
the telehealth group with respect to baseline variables.9 
Our main diagnostic was ‘balance’, or the similarity of 
the distribution of baseline variables between telehealth 
and matched control groups. We assessed balance using 
the standardised difference, deﬁned as the difference in 
means as a proportion of the pooled standard devi- 
ation.23 It is not recommended to use formal statistical 
tests because they depend on the size of the groups as 
well as on their similarity, and thus can be misleading.24 
Although the standardised difference would ideally be 
minimised without limit, 10% is often used as a thresh- 
old to denote meaningful imbalance.25 As the standar- 
dised difference only measures a difference in means, 
we also assessed the ratio of variances 
in the two 
groups.26 


Statistical approach 
Comparisons of the time-to-event endpoints were made 
graphically using Kaplan-Meier charts,27 and then analyt- 
ically using Cox regression28 with robust 
standard 
errors29 to account 
the 
data.23 Unadjusted and adjusted analysis was carried out, 
with the adjustment using the baseline variables consid- 
ered for the matching algorithm. All patients were cen- 
sored on 31 March 2013, when the telehealth service 
was terminated. For secondary endpoints not involving 

mortality, we considered patients who died as being cen- 
sored at their date of death. 
The use of national administrative data to deﬁne vari- 
ables meant that we considered there was a limited 
amount of missing data, because patients could be 
tracked even if they moved out of the North Yorkshire 
area, provided that they remained within England. 
Secondary analysis 
The main threat 
to the validity of non-randomised 
studies is confounding due to intervention and control 
groups differing at baseline in terms of variables that are 
also predictive of outcome. While intervention and 
matched control groups appeared similar, we were con- 
cerned that some differences might be unobserved. 
Therefore, we conducted two secondary analyses. First, 
for the subset of patients enrolled before 30 September 
2012 (for whom we had at least 6 months’ of follow-up 
data), we performed difference-in-difference analysis.30 
This was expected to remove the impact of confounding 
variables provided that the association between these 
confounding variables and the outcome is constant over 
time.31 In this analysis, we calculated the differences in 
for example, 
the number of emergency admissions, 
between the 6 months prior to enrolment and the subse- 
quent 6 months, 
and compared these differences 
between intervention and matched control groups using 
mixed multiple linear regression models, with adjust- 
ment for baseline variables. 
Second, we conducted sensitivity analysis to test the 
robustness of our ﬁndings to time varying, unobserved 
confounding.32 This involved simulating a hypothetical 
unobserved confounder, which was assumed to be 
binary valued. We assumed a range of values for the 
associations between the unobserved confounder and 
intervention status (telehealth or not telehealth) and 
between the unobserved confounder and outcome 
(emergency admissions). We used a method developed 
by Carnegie et al33 to determine how strong these asso- 
ciations would have to be for our ﬁndings to be altered. 
RESULTS 
Study populations 
Of the 1261 patients ever enrolled into the telehealth 
programme, 754 patients passed the inclusion and exclu- 
sion criteria for this 
study and 716 patients were 
matched to controls (ﬁgure 1). A total of 32 865 local 
residents were included in the pool of potential controls 
(leading to 763 858 observations after assigning multiple 
index dates). 

telehealth patients had higher 
average predictive risk scores than potential controls 
(0.33 vs 0.22) and more emergency admissions in the 
previous year on average (1.34 vs 0.77 per patient) 
(table 1). After matching, 
the controls had similar 
characteristics to the telehealth patients (table 1). For 
example, both groups had an average predictive risk 


Rather than include each potential control patient only once in the 
matching process, we calculated predictive risk scores for each 
potential control patient at 33 ‘index dates’, corresponding to 
months spanning the enrolment period ( July 2010–March 2013). 
Thus, there were up to 33 possible ‘observations’ of each poten- 
tial control patient, with the baseline variables and risk score cal- 
culated with respect to each index date. Such replication meant 
that an individual could contribute observations that were more 
closely matched to a telehealth patient than if the individual was 
only included once. We removed observations for which the 
potential control patient had died before the index date or where 
there did not exist an inpatient hospital admission that resulted in 
a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive 
heart failure or diabetes within 3 years prior to the index date. 
Having assembled a data set containing telehealth patients and 
up to 33 observations for each of the potential controls, the data 
set was stratified by age.20 Within each age strata, we used a calli- 
per approach whereby the pool of potential matches of similar 
age for a given telehealth patient was narrowed down to those 
patients with a similar predictive risk score (within 20% of 1 
standard deviation).22 From within this restricted set, individual 
matches were selected using genetic matching,44 a computer- 
intensive search algorithm that can produce more closely 
matched control groups than traditional matching approaches.8 
One matched control was selected per intervention patient, with 
replacement. 


score of 0.33. All standardised differences were below 
the targeted 10% threshold, except for the number of 
elective admissions in the month prior to enrolment, for 
which the standardised difference was 14.0%. 
Comparisons of hospital utilisation and mortality 
Patients were followed up for an average of 10.4 months for 
the primary endpoint (618.8 person-years) (table 2). 
During this period, telehealth patients were at higher 
risk of an emergency admission or death than matched 
controls, with 68.5% of telehealth patients experiencing 
an emergency admission or death (95% CI 62.3% to 
75.4%), compared with 50.1% of matched controls 
(95% CI 45.1% to 55.7%) (table 2). Cox regression con- 
ﬁrmed this difference as statistically signiﬁcant, with an 
adjusted HR of 1.34 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.56), p<0.001). 
Of the other secondary endpoints, there was evidence of 
a higher risk of (ﬁgure 2): 
▸ Emergency admission (adjusted HR 1.40, 95% CI 

▸ Admission for an ambulatory care-sensitive condition 
(adjusted HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.90, p<0.001);

towards more emergency admissions among interven-

the effect size was 
smaller than in the primary analysis and did not reach

variables (such as age) and plot these on the ﬁgure as

variables are clustered well below the blue and green 
contours. This suggests that, for our ﬁndings to have 
been signiﬁcantly biased by an unobserved confounder, 
this confounder would have to be much more strongly 
associated with intervention status and outcome than 
seems reasonable, given the variables we observed. 
DISCUSSION 
Statement of findings 
We compared a sample of patients enrolled in a large 
telehealth programme in a predominately rural area in 
England to a well-balanced matched control group using 
person-level data. We found that, contrary to the aims of 
the programme, telehealth patients had a higher likeli- 
hood of an emergency admission, and accident and 
emergency department attendance, than matched con- 
trols. The secondary analysis showed that, while unob- 
served confounding might explain some of the increase 
in emergency admissions, it is unlikely that we missed 
reductions in these admissions. 
Strengths and weaknesses of this study 
We were able to link administrative data to the vast 
majority (95%) of telehealth patients who passed the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. A small 
proportion of patients could not be linked due to incor- 
rect or missing personal identiﬁers but, on the assump- 
tion that these data were missing at random, our sample 
was representative of the population that received tele- 
health in routine practice. While we focused on those 
patients with previous inpatient admissions, this consti- 
tuted all but a small minority (3.6%) of total referrals. 
We standardised our comparisons by restricting them to 
those patients with a record of chronic obstructive pul- 
monary disease, congestive heart 
failure or diabetes. 
This meant that we excluded 22.4% of referrals. 



conditions.17 18 As these conditions are considered man- 
ageable in primary care, we would have hoped that tele- 
health would reduce them, but instead we observed a 
pattern that was consistent with our overall ﬁndings of 
increased utilisation. 

Telehealth and control patients were matched such 
that they were similar at baseline in respect to estab- 
lished predictors of hospital use. However, as in any 
observational study of this type, we cannot entirely rule 
out the possibility that the groups at baseline differed in 
terms of variables 
the 
outcome. Our study was designed to minimise the risk 
of confounding by: applying similar eligibility criteria for 
telehealth and control groups; selecting controls locally 
from within the North Yorkshire area15; using a match- 
ing algorithm that achieved very good balance between 
the study and control groups on observed variables; and 
performing regressions to adjust for any residual imbal- 
ances on observed variables after matching. However, 
there are limits to the amount of information recorded 
in the administrative data. For example, 
it is possible 
that telehealth patients systematically had more severe 
conditions than matched controls, or different attitudes 
towards managing their conditions or using emergency 
care (though these characteristics are correlated with 
variables that we were able to include in the matching 
algorithm, such as prior planned and unplanned hos- 
pital utilisation).36 
Our secondary analyses showed that, while it is con- 
ceivable that the increases detected in emergency admis- 
sions were due to confounding, it is very unlikely that we 
missed reductions in these admissions. First, we observed 
rates between intervention and 
similar mortality 
matched control groups, which supports the notion that 
the groups were similar in terms of disease severity. 
Comparisons of endpoints that are unlikely to have been 
affected by the intervention have been recommended as 
a way to detect a lack of comparability in observational 
studies,37 and it is reassuring that no differences were 
found in mortality rates in the current study. Second, 
likewise, found a 
our difference-in-difference analysis, 
trend towards increased emergency hospital admissions 
among telehealth patients. This did not reach statistical 
signiﬁcance 
the 
the 
statistical 
difference-in-difference analysis had lower 
power than our primary analysis, since it was applied to a 
subgroup of patients (n=672/716) and examined hos- 
pital admissions over 6 months, rather than the average 
in the primary analysis. 
of 10.4 months per patient 
Finally, we performed a more sophisticated sensitivity 
analysis that directly simulated the impact of a theoret- 
ical unobserved confounder. This analysis quantiﬁed the 
level of confounding that would be needed to render 
our ﬁnding of increased hospital admissions not statistic- 
ally signiﬁcant—this seemed implausible, given the asso- 
ciations found for observed variables such as patient age. 
Compared with many randomised controlled trials in 
the advantage of 







Figure 3 Sensitivity analysis for the effect of unobserved 
confounding. The two parameters in this analysis are the 
association between a baseline variable and (log-transformed) 
time to emergency hospital admission or death (vertical axis), 
and the association between a baseline variable and selection 
into the telehealth intervention (horizontal axis). These 
parameters are known for baseline variables that were 
observed, and are shown by the crosses and triangles (the 
triangles indicate the observed baseline variables that had 
negative associations; these have been transformed to 
positive values by multiplying by −1). The various contours 
show the effect of hypothetical unobserved baseline variables. 
The green line represents the maximum amount of 
unobserved confounding that can be tolerated for our 
conclusions that telehealth reduced the time to emergency 
admission or death to remain statistically significant. The blue 
line describes those parameters resulting in a statistically 
significant finding in the opposite direction (ie, an increase in 
the time to emergency admission or death), while the red 
curve describes the parameter values for which the estimated 
effect of telehealth is zero. The degree of confounding 
required for any of these situations can be compared with that 
indicated by the observed baseline variables. The light grey 
contour represents the estimate of the observed confounder 
furthest from the origin, that is, the strongest effect of any 
observed confounder. In order to show a beneficial effect of 
the telehealth intervention, an unobserved variable would 
need to be more strongly associated with both the intervention 
and outcome than any observed variable, which includes 
strongly prognostic variables such as age and gender. 
The administrative data sets used have advantages, 
such as minimising the issue of misreporting of service 
use by patients.34 Further, we were able to construct 
complete histories of hospital care utilisation over 
several years, even if patients moved to other parts of 
England. However, 
the data quality was not directly 
under our control.35 Potential problems with administra- 
tive data include inaccurate reporting due to inconsist- 
ent coding practices across hospitals,34 although this was 
mitigated by the use of local control patients and by 
combining diagnostic ﬁelds over several years. Although 
administrative data provide only limited insight into the 
quality and appropriateness of care, we were able to

reﬂecting telehealth as delivered in routine clinical prac- 
tice. Randomised designs can prevent the adaption of 
telehealth services in response to learning,38 but we, in 
contrast, reﬂected decisions about services that were 
made by local teams. The retrospective nature of the 
study also meant that we could not have inadvertently 
inﬂuenced outcomes, such as can happen in prospective 
studies through the Hawthorne effect.39 
It is possible that effects would have been observed 
over longer time periods than was possible in this study, 
or that there may have been effects on other endpoints 
not considered in this study, such as use of primary care, 
quality of life, or the control of glycated haemoglobin or 
blood pressure in patients with diabetes.40 Telehealth 
might have had a greater effect on individuals with 
certain conditions or those recruited from certain set- 
tings, although our post hoc subgroup analysis (see 
online supplementary material) did not uncover any evi- 
dence for this. 
Comparison with other studies and possible explanations 
Our ﬁndings are consistent with several 
large rando- 
mised controlled trials that have reported ambiguous or 
negative effects of telehealth.4–6 However, the large-scale 
care coordination/telehealth programme administered 
by the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has 
reported reductions in admissions. Although an early 
study of the impact of the VHA programme was uncon- 
trolled,41 a subsequent study has reported similar ﬁnd- 
ings against a matched control group.13 The VHA 
programme is a highly integrated intervention with a 
care coordination component in a setting marked by a 
strong investment in electronic patient records. Results 
from the VHA may afﬁrm that the ultimate effectiveness 
of telehealth depends on the context, targeting and 
integration of the supporting environment. 
There are a number of possible explanations for why 
telehealth was associated with higher rates, or at least 
not reduced rates, of emergency admission than usual 
care in this study. First, patients might not have adhered 
to the recommended monitoring schedule. We found 
that patients provided readings on 62% of days during 
the programme. Second, the alerts made to monitoring 
teams might not have been sufﬁciently predictive of 
deteriorations in health, or might not have given the 
monitoring clinicians sufﬁcient opportunity to deliver 
effective preventive care.42 Third, more intensive moni- 
toring might have increased patient awareness of risks to 
their health or could have led to the identiﬁcation of 
additional health needs. Fourth, telehealth might not 
have been fully integrated into the wider healthcare 
system, such that problems were escalated to secondary 
care, rather than treated in the community. NHS North 
Yorkshire and York intended to redesign care pathways 
for patients supported by the provision of telehealth. 
While some progress was made, it was beyond the scope 
of our study to assess whether the new pathways had 
evolved to an effective level by the time of the dissol- 
ution of the telehealth programme. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The North Yorkshire telehealth programme did not 
reduce emergency hospital admissions and, indeed, may 
though there may have been 
have led to increases, 
improvements 
in outcomes not analysed during the 
current study (including quality of life). Decision makers 
must consider whether to use scarce resources by investing 
in other forms of preventive care, for which there is more 
of an evidence base, or whether to pursue telehealth on 
the assumption that the beneﬁts from these new technolo- 
gies can take some time to materialise. Telehealth is an 
example of a ‘complex intervention’,37 in that there are 
several interacting components that aim to achieve mul- 
tiple outcomes through a variety of means. Thus, the 
effect of telehealth might depend on the surrounding 
context (including level of integration and ﬁnancial incen- 
tives); how the telehealth service is designed (such as the 
choice of peripheral devices, algorithm and monitoring 
system); and how users and professionals engage with tele- 
health. We could not rule out the possibility that beneﬁcial 
outcomes might have, with more time and reﬁnement, 
materialised in North Yorkshire. 
If telehealth is pursued, it may be desirable to create 
information systems to enable these services to respond 
to learning and to seek to improve their effectiveness 
over time. The methods used in this study, including 
linkage to administrative data, selection of matched 
control groups and sensitivity analysis, could be adapted 
to enable effectiveness to be tracked in close to real time.
