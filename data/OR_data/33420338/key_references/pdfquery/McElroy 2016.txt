443 adult patients (mean age, 65 (cid:1) 14, 33% female) were identiﬁed and participated in the

healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of 
the healthcare team. Pearson c2 test and the Welch’s t-test were used to assess statistical 
differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables. 
Results: During the study period, the readmission rate for the DHK and control groups were 
similar (7.4% versus 9.9%, P ¼ 0.65). The use of DHKs led to 1649 alerts and 144 interventions, 
with the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9. The majority of alerts (64%) were 
prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, and a signiﬁcant correlation was noted 
between abnormal biometrics and required intervention (r ¼ 0.62, P < 0.001). No correlation 
was seen between alerts because of health survey responses (r ¼ 0.07, P ¼ 0.71) or missed 
check-ins (r ¼ 0.06, P ¼ 0.76) and required interventions. Poststudy satisfaction surveys

showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9 (cid:1) 0.5 for DHK patients and 4.9 (cid:1) 0.2 for 
members of the care team (scale 1-5, 5 ¼ agree). 
Conclusions: In our study, adding DHKs to a formal RRP was not associated with a signiﬁcant 










based component to the RRP in reducing readmissions after 
cardiac surgery. 
Postoperative readmission reported to occur in 17.4% of cor- 
onary revascularization patients1 is associated with increased 
mortality, reduced patient satisfaction,2 and signiﬁcant in- 
creases in healthcare costs.3 With recent evidence suggesting 
that readmission rates may be correlated with quality of 
care,4,5 a Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program was 
implemented under the Affordable Care Act requiring the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services to reduce pay- 
ments to institutions with “excess readmissions.” These 
ﬁnancial penalties, which may be as high as 3% of the total 
institutional Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services 
payment, are currently applicable to the following diagnoses: 
acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease exacerbations, pneumonia, and joint 
replacements. With imminent plans to expand the list to 
include coronary artery bypass grafting in 2017, some state 
organizations such as the California Coronary Artery Bypass 
Grafting Outcomes Reporting Program have already mandated 
public reporting of readmission rates.6,7 
Innovative strategies aimed at reducing readmission rates 
have been used in the postdischarge management of patients. 
A number of studies have demonstrated the variable success 
of these programs, which have focused primarily on patient 
education, assisted medication administration, and organized 
coordination of care after discharge.8,9 Paradoxically, Kwok 
et al.10 noted higher readmission rates after implementation of 
home visits by nurses. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted 
that fragmentation of care after discharge plays a vital role in 
unplanned rehospitalizations.11,12 Wireless health technolo- 
gies including video and telemonitoring of vital signs have 
recently been used to improve continuity of care. Despite 
success in nonsurgical patients, the impact of telemonitoring 
in reducing readmissions has not been previously evaluated in 
those undergoing cardiac surgery. 
Historically, the rate of readmission after cardiac surgery 
has varied between 16% and 22%. With an initial focus 
on identifying factors contributing to readmissions,13 we 
have developed targeted interventions to reduce unplanned 
rehospitalizations at our 
institution. Our Readmissions 
Reduction Program (RRP) was developed with the purpose of 
improving patient education and the coordination of post- 
discharge care. The purpose of the present study was to 
evaluate the added beneﬁt of incorporating a telehealth- 


Patients undergoing cardiac surgery at our institution bet- 
ween March 2014 and June 2015 were eligible for inclusion in 
extracorporeal membrane 
this 
oxygenation, and ventricular assist device insertion were in- 
dications for exclusion from analysis. All patients participated 
in the RRP, which was developed by a multidisciplinary 
committee consisting of physicians, nurses, and case 
coordinators. Figure 1 provides a detailed description of the 
components included in the RRP. As part of the protocol, pa- 
tients participated in a formal preoperative education pro- 
gram consisting of face-to-face sessions with the health team. 
Topics such as preoperative preparation, expected hospital 
course, proper medication administration, and potential 
postoperative complications were discussed at these sessions, 
with educational material provided for patients and their 
caregivers. Postoperatively, patients received daily education 
and reinforcement on topics pertaining to at-home care. The 
second focus of the RRP was to improve postdischarge care. A 
plan was developed to ensure all necessary home medications 
follow-up appointments were 
were dispensed, and all 
scheduled before discharge. At last, patients were required to 
identify trusted individuals who would serve as a primary 
caregiver at home. 
In addition to the formal RRP, patients enrolled in a tele- 
health pilot study also received a digital health kits (DHK) 
consisting of a tablet linked to a Bluetooth-enabled pulse 
oximeter, heart rate monitor, blood pressure cuff, and weight 
scale. Tablets were equipped with software that provided 
patients with simple illustrated instructions on how to obtain 
real-time data of vitals including oxygen saturation, heart 
rate, blood pressure, and weight 
(Fig. 2). Patients also 
completed daily digital questionnaires aimed at identifying 
symptoms consistent with heart failure, poor wound healing, 
as well as data on ambulation and adherence to medications 
(Fig. 3). Abnormal biometrics (O2 saturation<92%, heart rate 
>95 or <60 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure >150 mm 
Hg or <90 mm Hg, or weight change greater than two pounds), 
concerning survey responses, and a missed digital check-in, 
triggered an automated notiﬁcation to the healthcare team.

Patients were subsequently contacted by a healthcare pro- 
vider via video conference or telephone prompting a potential 
intervention such as medication dosage adjustment, further 
patient education, or triaging as necessary. 
Patients who were enrolled in the telehealth program 
comprised the intervention group (DHK), whereas patients in 
the formal RRP served as a control. The primary outcome of 
this study was postoperative readmission within 30 d of sur- 
gery. In addition, surveys were administered to participants 
and members of the healthcare team to assess their satis- 
faction with the telehealth component of the program. 
For analysis, the Pearson c2 test and the Welch’s t-test were 
used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteris- 
tics and outcome variables. Correlational analyses were

length of stay was relatively similar between the two groups. 
Overall, 9.7% of patients (n ¼ 41) were readmitted within 30 d 
of surgery. No signiﬁcant difference was found in the rate of 
readmission between the RRP group and the DHK group (9.9% 
versus 7.4%, P ¼ 0.65). Reasons for readmission are noted in 
Table 3. Although patients in the RRP group were readmitted 
for a range of cardiovascular and respiratory complications 
including arrhythmias, heart failure, and effusions, the only 
two DHK readmissions were due amiodarone toxicity and for 
a syncopal episode. 

the 30-d study period, information gathered via the 
DHKs led to 1649 alerts, with a median of 49 alerts per day (IQR 
45-58) and the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9 
(Fig. 3). Per patient, this amounts to a median of 54 alerts 
during the study period (IQR 45-78). The majority of alerts 
(64%) were prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, 
whereas 25% were triggered by responses to daily survey 
questions, 6% by patient requests for additional video chat 
sessions, and 5% by notiﬁcations of patient noncompliance 
with daily monitoring. Notiﬁcations led to 144 subsequent 
interventions by the care team, amounting to an average of 
13.5 alerts per intervention when analyzed at the patient level. 
Medication adjustments were required in 14% of cases, a 
referral to a nurse practitioner or physician was required in 
10%, and additional patient education was required in 76% of 
required interventions. On analysis, a signiﬁcant correlation 
was noted between abnormal biometrics and requiring 
intervention (r ¼ 0.62, P < 0.001) as displayed Figure 5. How- 
ever, no correlation was seen between alerts due to survey 
responses (r ¼ 0.07, P ¼ 0.71) or missed check-ins (r ¼ 0.06, 
P ¼ 0.76) and requiring intervention. 

completed using Pearson’s (r) coefﬁcient to assess the rela- 
tionship between alert notiﬁcations and required inter- 
ventions. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 
12 (StataCorp LP), and results with a P value (cid:4) 0.05 were 
deemed statistically signiﬁcant. The study protocol was 
approved by the institutional review board at the University of 
California, LA. 

Of the 443 patients (mean age: 65 (cid:1) 14, 33% female) who 
underwent cardiac surgery during the study period, 27 (6.1%) 
were enrolled in the telehealth pilot study. Patient charac- 
teristics were relatively similar for the two groups, with sig- 
niﬁcant differences noted in gender and incidence of dialysis 
(Table 1). Postoperatively, patients in the RRP had signiﬁcantly 
higher rates of pneumonia and sepsis (Table 2). However, total

and provider survey responses are displayed in Figure 6 and 
Figure 7 respectively. Overall, patients and healthcare pro- 
viders reported satisfaction scores of 4.9 (cid:1) 0.5 and 4.9 (cid:1) 0.2, 
respectively. Patients also reported feeling more conﬁdent in 
the quality of care they received during the recuperation 
period. 

Although preliminary, the use of DHKs was not associated 
with an incremental decrease in 30-d readmission rates when 
added to a formal RRP. However, user satisfaction ratings were 
high among both patients and healthcare providers partici- 
pating in the telehealth program. With rapid expansion of 
mobile platforms and anticipation of widespread use of 
DHK’s, it is crucial to evaluate their incremental efﬁcacy at 
reducing postoperative readmissions. 
As the healthcare system in the United States moves 
toward value-based purchasing and cost containment, a 
number of policies including the Hospital RRP and Bundled 
Payments for Care Improvement Initiative are being imple- 
mented. All such initiatives aim at reducing the cost of care 


To assess patient and provider satisfaction with the tele- 
health component of the RRP, surveys were administered at 
the conclusion of the study using a 5-point Likert scale 
(1 ¼ disagree, 5 ¼ agree) with a 74% completion rate among 
patients and 100% among providers. A summary of patient

Unplanned readmission rate after index surgical hospitaliza- 
tion is now considered a quality metric and used by Centers 
for Medicare to levy penalties on hospitals with higher than 
expected readmission rates. With a growing body of research 
evaluating the reasons for readmission, it appears that care 
fragmentation and complications not related to the original 
procedure are major contributors to the problem of read- 
missions.14 Therefore, extended monitoring of the patients’ 
cardiopulmonary and ﬂuid status appears to be logical ad- 
juncts to programs aimed at care coordination and patient 
education. 

the present study, we used a commercially available, 
HIPAA compliant, web-based mobile system that used a tablet 
to interact with patients. In addition, parameters such as 
heart rate, blood pressure, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, 
and weights were automatically transmitted to the healthcare 
providers. Since many of the readmissions after cardiac sur- 
gery are related to mobility, surgical wounds, and the car- 
diopulmonary condition of the patient, this particular DHK

was programmed to address these issues and generate alerts 
for the healthcare team. In addition, we used providers that 
were fully trained in the postoperative care of cardiac surgery 
patients to optimize patient care. The DHK system provided 
many alerts and led to 144 interventions in 27 patients. 
However, these interventions did not translate into a signiﬁ- 
cant reduction in readmission rates at our institution. This 
ﬁnding may be explained by the fact that all patients partici- 
pate in a RRP that has signiﬁcantly reduced our readmission 
rates. 
Satisfaction with the use of DHK’s was found to be high 
among the patients and healthcare providers. This perhaps is 
a relevant ﬁnding, as patient experience and satisfaction with 
medical care may translate into improved long-term out- 
comes and adherence.2,15 The ease of use given the tablet 
platform and preconﬁgured connectivity may have enhanced 
the user experience. Perhaps, a system that could deliver 
personalized alert set points and questions would further 
enhance satisfaction. 

limitations. Due to an initially 
limited amount of DHK available, we were only able to 
monitor ﬁve patients at once. Moreover, since all patients 
participated in the RRP, we were not able to assess the inde- 
pendent value of the DHKs alone. Nevertheless, we believe 
our preliminary results provide basis for future large-scale

interventional studies to assess the beneﬁts of continued 
outpatient follow-up via wireless health technology. Infor- 
mation gathering was also disrupted when pieces of the DHK 
would malfunction and had to be replaced during the 30-d 
window. 
In summary, DHK show potential in providing a reasonable 
adjunct to postoperative care that would further improve the 
readmissions reduction program implemented at our uni- 
versity. Further adjustments to the monitoring capabilities 
and increased personalization will likely not only improve 
patient satisfaction and adherence but also quality of care.
