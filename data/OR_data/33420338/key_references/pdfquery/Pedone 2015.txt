ization of individuals with heart failure (HF),1,2 includ- 

ing telemedicine and telemonitoring. According to a 
Cochrane revision, 
for 
telemedicine has 
improving health care and reducing healthcare expendi- 
tures for individuals with HF,3 but results of more-recent 
trials have been disappointing. In the Telemedical Interven- 
tional Monitoring in Heart Failure (TIM-HF) trial, mortal- 
ity did not change despite monitoring of blood pressure, 
electrocardiogram, and body weight.4 In the Telemonitor- 
ing to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes trial, an automatic 
information about 
telephone-based daily collection of 
symptoms and body weight did not 
improve the out- 
comes,5 whereas the CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows 
Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA 
Class III Patients trial, using an implantable hemodynamic 
telemonitoring system, demonstrated a signiﬁcant decrease 
of 
trials using 
telemonitoring7–9 
implantable devices or noninvasive 
yielded inconclusive results. 


A comparative analysis of randomized clinical trials 
shows that they differ in the number and type of biological 
signals monitored, in the timing of recording, and in the 
organization of the medical support.10 Furthermore, 
in 
these trials, the attending physicians did not directly moni- 
tor the participants. The current study was planned to 
evaluate whether a telemonitoring system providing infor- 
mation directly to the physician in charge of individuals’ 
care and including telephone support could prevent hospi- 
tal readmissions and death in elderly adults with HF. It 
was hypothesized that a system directly supervised by the 
attending physician would make therapeutic interventions 
more timely and effective. 

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of an innovative 
model integrating telemonitoring of vital parameters and 
telephone support on 6-month survival and hospital admis- 
sions of elderly adults with heart failure (HF). 
DESIGN: Parallel-arm, randomized trial. 
SETTING: Geriatric acute care ward and outpatient clinic 
at Policlinico Campus Biomedico (Rome, Italy). 
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with HF aged 65 and older 
(mean age 80) randomly assigned to intervention (n = 50) 
or control (n = 46). Participants had an average ejection 
fraction of 46%. 
INTERVENTION: Telemonitoring system (receives and 
communicates oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood 
pressure readings) and ofﬁce-hours telephonic support pro- 
vided by a geriatrician. 
MEASUREMENTS: Combination of all-cause death and 
hospital admissions. 
RESULTS: The two groups were similar with the excep- 
tion of the prevalence of women and of disability (both 
more common in the control group). Three patients for 
each group were lost to follow-up (ﬁnal analyzed sample 
size: 90). Incidence of the main outcome was 42% in the 
control group and 21% in the intervention group (relative 
risk = 0.51, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) = 0.26–0.98). 
The results were unchanged after taking into account the 
setting 
(hazard 
sex, 
enrollment, 
ratio = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.19–0.94). 
CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring of elderly people with HF 
is feasible and reduces the risk of death and hospitalization. 
Further studies are needed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings and eval- 
uate the cost-efﬁcacy of the service. J Am Geriatr Soc

This was a single-center, unmasked, randomized trial with 
6 months 
comparing multiparametric 
telemonitoring plus telephonic support with standard care. 
Individuals with a ﬁrst diagnosis of HF were recruited 
from the geriatric acute care ward of a teaching hospital, 
and those with a principal diagnosis of HF were recruited 
from the outpatient clinic of the same hospital. 
HF was diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, objective 
evidence (including echocardiography when available), lab- 
oratory data (N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic 
peptide (NT-proBNP) when available), and response to 
speciﬁc therapy.11 The only inclusion parameter other than 
diagnosis of HF was age of 65 and older. The exclusion 
criterion was severe cognitive impairment. The ethical 
committee of the Campus Biomedico University in Rome 
approved the study protocol (#09/2012), which is regis- 
tered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT0191458). 

The intervention included a telemonitoring system and 
ofﬁce-hours telephonic support provided by a geriatrician 
who had access to the telemonitoring system. The telephonic 
contacts were not scheduled; participants were instructed to 
use this channel of communication to report new symptoms 
or problems with the telemonitoring system. 
The telemonitoring system consists of commercial 
measurement devices equipped with a transmitter and a 
commercial android-based smartphone that receives from 
the transmitter the readings from the measurement instru- 
ments, communicates the readings to the central compo- 
nent of the system in real time, and issues reminders to the 
patient when measurement is scheduled. The measurement 
instruments provided to participants were a sphygmoma- 
nometer (A & D Engineering, San Jose, CA), a scale (A & 
D Engineering), and a pulse oximeter (Nonin Medical Inc., 
Plymouth, MN). 
To avoid heterogeneity, the same baseline scheduling 
was used for all participants throughout the study: weight 
once a day; blood pressure and heart rate twice a day, and 
peripheral oxygen saturation three times a day. Partici- 
pants could perform additional measurements in case of 
symptoms, and the schedule of measurements could be 
remotely altered to adapt it to the changing needs of the 
participants. A monitoring system software allowed real- 
time access to the information that the devices listed above 
gathered. The monitoring system was web-based and 
accessed through a secure connection using a standard In- 
ternet browser. 
A geriatrician evaluated the data received every day. 
The monitor system displayed an alert when a measure- 
ment was outside a predeﬁned range, which could be cus- 
tomized for each participant, but the system was intended 
for monitoring only, and participants were instructed to 
contact their usual healthcare provider in case of emer- 
gency. 
In case of abnormal readings, the physician contacted 
the participant to verify whether their symptoms had wors- 
ened or new symptoms had arisen. In this event, the par- 
ticipant’s adherence to therapy was checked, and if it was 
unsatisfactory, 
interventions promoting adherence were 
administered. Based on the participant’s symptoms and 
signs, an ofﬁce appointment was scheduled or the partici- 
pant was referred to the staff of the acute care ward, who 
made the ﬁnal decision on the admission and was blinded 
to participant allocation. 



Individuals discharged from the acute care ward received 
detailed instructions about medical therapy and lifestyle 
scheduled for 
counseling, and a follow-up visit was 
1 month after discharge. A geriatrician was available on 
week days for 2 hours per day for telephonic support, and 
participants recruited from the acute care ward and the 
outpatient clinic were followed up in visits based on their 
clinical conditions and were seen by geriatricians from the 
same unit as the study researchers, who were blinded to 
their study allocation. 
Multidimensional Assessment 
Activities of daily living (ADLs, range 0–6 lost functions), 
instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs, range 0–8 
lost functions), and New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
class were rated. Comorbidity burden was expressed using 
the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS),12 which has 
two scales: a comorbidity scale indicating the number of 
systems with a clinically relevant disease (range 0–13), and 
a severity scale (range 1–5, with higher values indicating 
more-severe conditions). Serum concentration of NT-proB- 
NP was measured on admission, and the use of cardiovas- 
cular drugs 
enzyme 
(ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers 
inhibitors 
(ARB), beta-blockers, statins, nitrates) was recorded. 



Outcome measures were hospital admissions for any rea- 
son or death 180 days from enrollment. All information 
was gathered from clinical records, when available, or 
from in-person or telephone interviews. 
Sample Size 
An outcome incidence of 50% was anticipated.5 Because 
this was an exploratory study, it was decided to allow for 
a type I error rate of 10%. On these assumptions, it was 
calculated that a sample size of 50 participants per group 
would provide 80% power to detect a 25% absolute risk 
reduction. As shown in Figure 1, 186 individuals meeting 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were identiﬁed; 90 of these 
refused to participate. Of the remaining 96, 50 were ran- 
domized to the intervention group and 46 to the control 
group using a computer-generated random number list. 
Three participants in each group were lost to follow-up, 
the intervention 
and four participants dropped out of 
group, leaving a ﬁnal sample size for the analysis of 90. 






Descriptive statistics and t-tests or chi-square tests were used 
to compare groups. The risk of the composite outcome was 
calculated using the product-limit method complemented 
with the log-rank test. The adjusted relative hazard for the 
outcome was estimated using a proportional hazards 
model 
(hospital ward or 
ambulatory setting) as a random effect term. In this model, 
the number of ADLs was dichotomized using the median 
(3) as a cutoff variable to avoid the assumption of a linear 
relationship with the outcome risk. All analyses were per- 
formed using an intention-to-treat approach. The analyses 
were performed using R Statistical Software version 2.14 
for Linux. 
RESULTS 
The mean age of the sample (80 (cid:1) 7, range 60–94) was 
similar in the two groups, whereas the proportion of men 
was higher in the telemonitoring group (47%, vs 30% in 
the control group). Independence in ADLs was better pre- 
served in the telemonitoring group, but there were no dif- 
ferences in the distribution of NYHA class, comorbidity 
score, NT-proBNP serum concentration, number of drugs 
taken, or number of admissions in the preceding year. 
Ninety-one percent of participants were taking loop diuret- 
ics, and approximately half were taking ACE-Is, ARBs, or 
beta-blockers, without signiﬁcant differences between the 
two groups (Table 1). 
On average, 62% of scheduled measurements were 
completed; adherence was best for pulse oximeter (70%) 
and worst for the scale (56%). Sixty-four percent of partic- 
ipants completed at least half of the scheduled measure- 
ments. 

admissions during the 
6 months of follow-up (incidence rate 77.9/100 person- 
years, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) = 54–112.6), 20 in 
the control group (incidence rate 129/100 person-years, 
95% CI = 84–200) and eight (incidence rate 39/100 per- 
son-years, 95% CI = 20–77) 
in the intervention group 
(incidence rate ratio = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12–0.67). Half 
of the admissions were due to heart failure or related 
heart diseases (e.g., arrhythmias). More admissions were 
due to cardiac events in the telemonitoring group (62.5%) 
than in the control group (45%), although the incidence 
rate ratio for heart 
failure hospitalizations was 0.48 
(0.14–1.45). The number of observed deaths was 10, 
seven in the control group (incidence rate 37/100 person- 
years, 95% CI = 18–76) and three in the intervention

group (incidence rate 13/100 person-years, 95% CI = 5– 
39). The incidence rate for the composite outcome was 
112/100 person-years (95% CI = 82–154) in the overall 
population, 190/100 person-years in the control group, 
and 56/100 person-years in the intervention group; the 
corresponding incidence rate ratio was 0.30 (95% CI = 
0.14–0.59). 
The overall proportion of people experiencing the 
composite outcome was 42% in the control group and 
21% in the telemonitoring group (relative risk = 0.51, 
95% CI = 0.26–0.98). Figure 2 shows the event-free sur- 
vival of the two groups. The relative hazard for the com- 
posite outcome 
estimated using an unadjusted Cox 
regression model was 0.43 (95% CI = 0.20–0.93). The 
hazard ratio adjusted for sex, disability, and enrollment 
setting was 0.42 (95% CI = 0.19–0.94). Of the 10 out- 
come events recorded in the intervention group, 
two 
occurred in people who dropped out of the study and two 
in participants with poor adherence who had not used the 
telemonitoring system in the days before the event. For the 
other outcomes, a decline or instability of oxygen satura- 
tion preceded three; alteration in heart rate preceded two; 
and oxygen desaturation, decline in blood pressure, and 
weight gain preceded one. 

These data suggest that a physician-led multiparametric 
telemonitoring system integrated with telephone support 
can reduce the risk of all-cause death and hospitalization 
in elderly adults with HF. The data are in contrast to 
those from two recent trials,4,5 but there are important 
differences between these trials. One intervention5 was 
based on a telephone-based voice response system and 
was therefore hardly comparable with the current inter- 
vention. The TIM-HF trial4 tested a system that was 
similar to that used in the current study, but peripheral 
oxygen saturation was not 
included in the monitored 
parameters, and the parameters were collected only once 
the telemedical center provided 
a day. Furthermore, 
telephone support once a month, and participants could 
contact 
the telemedical centers only in case of emer- 
gency. In addition, the population in the TIM-HF trial 
was on average 13 years younger than in the current 
study. 
A peculiarity of the current trial is that a geriatrician 
led the intervention. HF prevalence increases with age,13 
with individuals with HF being on average 73 years old14 
and having multiple comorbid diseases;15 the geriatrician 
typically provides comprehensive care customized to the 
complexity of these individuals.16 Another important fea- 
ture of the model is that it included “fast track” access 
to ambulatory visits that was activated in case of abnor- 
malities in the telemonitored data or when new symp- 
toms ensued. Thus, a model of care was tested rather 
than a simple telemonitoring system. This is an important 
factor to be taken into account when evaluating tele- 
health interventions. The results of Whole Systems Dem- 
onstrator,17 a large, community-based trial of telehealth, 
indicate that the simple implementation of technologies in 
the context of usual care is not enough to obtain sizable 
beneﬁts.18 
A formal cost-effectiveness analysis was not per- 
formed. The use of a physician rather than a nurse has an 
obvious effect on costs, although this should be compared 
with the cost of hospitalization; data from the current 
study indicate that, for every 100 people with HF, the 
intervention may prevent 70 hospitalizations per year com- 





pared with standard care. In addition, the telemonitoring 
hardware is inexpensive thanks to the use of commercial 
devices, and on a large scale, this may in part offset the 
costs of the service. Nonetheless, a direct evaluation is 
needed before any conclusions can be drawn. 
This study has several strengths. First, the very old 
individuals with HF studied are representative of the real- 
world target population. Second, the core of the techno- 
logical intervention does not lie in its hardware, which is 
made up of existing, low-cost devices, but in its software 
and monitoring system, with obvious implications for costs 
on a large scale. The use of commercial devices also affects 
the acceptability of the system, because participants used 
medical devices to which they were well accustomed. 
Third, the availability of telephone contact on demand 
could reassure people that telemonitoring is an add-on to, 
not a substitute for, physician-patient contact. Finally, the 
monitoring schedule could be adapted to changing clinical 
conditions. 
Some limitations should also be taken into account. 
First, the sample was small, with some imbalance in the 
characteristics of the two groups. This may affect the 
internal validity of the study, although statistical correc- 
tion for this imbalance has been performed. Moreover, the 
prevalence of physical impairment in the sample was high, 
the results to the gen- 
which makes generalization of 
eral HF population questionable, although the results may 
indicate that telemonitoring could be more effective in the 
population for which it is intended, that is, individuals 
with difﬁculties attending frequent ambulatory visits. Sec- 
ond, results pertaining to medical outcomes were shown, 
but an evaluation of economic and societal implications is 
needed before the effectiveness of the model of telehealth 
is established. Finally, the estimated risk reduction is larger 
than found in previously published trials. Probably because 
of publication bias, small trials such as this one tend to 
overestimate the treatment effect.19 Furthermore, 
the 
favorable results might depend partly on the experience in 
HF management of the geriatrician in charge of telemoni- 
tored individuals, although the control group also received 
care from a geriatrician skilled in HF treatment. 
In conclusion, physician-led telemonitoring of elderly 
adults with HF is feasible and reduces the risk of death 
and hospitalization. Further studies are needed to test this 
model in a larger series and to assess its cost efﬁcacy.
