ABSTRACT 
Background Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an efﬁcient 
method for treating respiratory failure in patients with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it requires 
a process of adaptation not always achieved due to poor 
compliance. The role of telemonitoring of NIV is not yet 
established. 
Objectives To test the advantage of using modem 
communication in NIV of ALS patients. 
Design Prospective, single blinded controlled trial. 
Population and methods According to their residence, 
40 consecutive ventilated ALS patients were assigned to 
one of two groups: a control group (G1, n¼20) in which 
compliance and ventilator parameter settings were 
assessed during ofﬁce visits; or an intervention group 
(G2, n¼20) in which patients received a modem device 
connected to the ventilator. The number of ofﬁce and 
emergency room visits and hospital admissions during 
the entire span of NIV use and the number of parameter 
setting changes to achieve full compliance were the 
primary outcome measurements. 
Results Demographic and clinical features were similar 
between the two groups at admission. No difference in 
compliance was found between the groups. The 
incidence of changes in parameter settings throughout 
the survival period with NIV was lower in G2 (p<0.0001) 
but it was increased during the initial period needed to 
achieve full compliance. The number of ofﬁce or 
emergency room visits and inhospital admissions was 
signiﬁcantly lower in G2 (p<0.0001). Survival showed 
a trend favouring G2 (p¼0.13). 
Conclusions This study shows that telemonitoring 
reduces health care utilisation with probable favourable 
implications on costs, survival and functional status. 
INTRODUCTION 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive 
and fatal neurodegenerative disease in which 
respiratory insufﬁciency is the most common 
terminal event. Non-invasive positive pressure 
ventilation (NIV) has become 
standard 
by 
respiratory 
to 
management 
increasing quality of life and reducing the likelihood 
of resorting to tracheostomy.1e8 Improved rate of 
survival and quality of life seem to correlate with 
the earlier prescription of NIV, before diurnal signs 
of respiratory failure have been established, with 
a forced vital capacity (FVC) of >50% of the 


predicted value or at detection of early signs of 
impending nocturnal respiratory insufﬁciency.7 9e11 
NIV requires a dynamic process of adaptation 
which is achieved in an unknown proportion of 
patients. Probably, patients with severe bulbar 
weakness and marked sialorrhoea have the highest 
rate of poor compliance.12 13 In fact, compliance 
with NIV is a complex issue and a recent matter of 
debate.9 14e17 Certainly, 
improved tolerance and 
compliance can only be reached by continuous 
customised setting of the device, which depends on 
many factors, such as lung mechanics,16 18 inspira- 
breathing 
tory 
frequency,19e21 effective correction of blood gases12 22 
and different metabolic demands. Compliance with 
NIV in ALS has only been evaluated in terms of the 
number of hours of usage a day, which is very 
limited. Nevertheless, most authors have reported 
longer survival in patients using NIV for more than 
4 h per day.3 22e24 



Recent technological advances have allowed for 
more extensive control of the relevant sets in 
addition to analysis of the number of hours/day of 
utilisation. It is possible to assess breath pressures 
and volumes, the percentage of utilisation of 
a predetermined target pressure, respiratory rate, 
peak ﬂow, number of apnoeas, percentage of leaks 
and oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry. It is also 
possible to perform online checking and correction 
via modem connection, hopefully increasing 
and compliance.25 
tolerance 
patient 
Nonetheless, the advantages of these new tech- 
nologies have scarcely been evaluated in neuro- 
muscular patients.26 

To the best of our knowledge, only one study has 
compared the effectiveness of an outpatient initia- 
tion protocol with the standard inhospital model 
for NIV.22 No study has evaluated the impact on 
compliance, 
survival and healthcare 
utilisation of ALS patients submitted to wireless 
telemetry to control NIV settings, compared with 
the ofﬁce visit approach. We aimed to investigate 
this relevant problem. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS 
From January 2003 to September 2006, all consec- 
utive ALS patients ventilated with a Goodknight 
425ST bi-level device (Tyco Healthcare Group LP, 
California, USA) were screened and considered for 
inclusion in a prospective and controlled trial if at 
diagnosis they had no signs or symptoms of 








respiratory insufﬁciency with an FVC $75% of the predicted 
#45 mm Hg, and age 
value, PaO2 
between 18 and 75 years. Patients with gastrostomy, cognitive 
impairment or other signiﬁcant disorders were also excluded 
from this trial. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two 
groups according to their residential area. Patients included in 
group G1 (control) were living in Lisbon; in this group managing 
of NIV settings and assessment of compliance were performed 
through regular ofﬁce visits on admission, 2e3 weeks later and 
then every 3 months. Patients included in group G2 (interven- 
tion) were living outside Lisbon and follow-up was performed 
by weekly modem telemonitoring, in addition to regular ofﬁce 
visits at each 3 month interval. All participants were evaluated 
with the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) every 3 months 
by a physician blinded to the study group. Respiratory func- 
tional tests were performed every 6 months by a technician 
unaware of the study. All received a helpline number, in addition 
to regular ofﬁce visits.27 28 Trial duration was established from 
NIV adaptation to a follow-up period of 3 years or death. 
ALS patients were ventilated in accordance with a set of 
criteria that included clinical symptoms, conventional respira- 
tory function tests, as recommended by the American Academy 
of Neurology2 (including FVC and maximal inspiratory pressure), 
neurophysiological studies and nocturnal pulse oximetry.9 10 NIV 
was indicated as early as patients agreed after the ﬁrst symp- 
toms and signs of changes, in an ofﬁce based setting. NIV is 
optimised to improve clinical symptoms and nocturnal pulse 
oximetric changes. The procedure includes slow increments in 
inspiratory positive air pressure (IPAP) in order to achieve 
a steady state with normal breathing patterns, normal pulse rate 
>95%, with the backup rate slightly lower than the 
and SpO2 
patient’s own respiratory frequency. 
For NIV compliance follow-up and ﬂexible parameter settings 
changes, all participants received a helpline to clarify any doubts 
or to seek medical advice whenever difﬁculties arose. Patients in 
G1 were, in addition, also observed 2e3 weeks after entry and 
patients in G2 had a modem pre-installation programmed to 
communicate 
and 
constraints imposed by continuously monitoring and storing 
data, patients in G2 were further instructed to activate the 
system once a week or whenever they felt uncomfortable with 
the device, after phoning the physician in charge, and were 
instructed to call the helpline when needed. 


A crucial element of the telemedicine instrument function- 
ality is the remote transmission of data. The instrument is 
equipped with an internal modem, allowing direct access to the 
internet via a TCP/IP protocol along with data storing at the 
patient’s home. The bidirectionality of the system allowed us 
not only to register compliance data but also to introduce 
modiﬁcations in parameter settings, thus permitting real time 
evaluation of its impact on ventilatory mechanics. Regarding the 
device used in this study, the bi-level 
instrument included 
backup rate/assist control as well as patented FlowSens tech- 
nology that allow the physician to customise the inspiratory 
and expiratory settings 
for greater patient comfort and 
synchronicity. 
In addition, an intermediate level of care was set up to detect 
and ﬂag alarm signs requiring an immediate revision of settings. 
This monitoring was performed by one of the authors (JP) who, 
after reviewing the synthesis report or night calendar, was 
instructed to send a message to the physician who would then 
decided on possible setting changes, schedule an ofﬁce visit, 
schedule a phone call or conduct a real time communication. As 
there are no published or established alert signs for home 
ventilation in rapidly progressive neuromuscular disorders, we 
considered all data that were 61 SD of the mean values of IPAP, 
inspiratory/expiratory ratio, 
expiratory positive air pressure, 
backup rate, inspiratory sensitivity, expiratory sensitivity and 
rise time as alert signs. These limits were deﬁned by data anal- 
ysis of 67 ALS patients with regular NIV use $6 h a day 
followed in our unit (unpublished data). In addition, we also 
considered as an alert sign all data conﬂicting with the preceding 
ventilation proﬁle of the patient. 
Primary outcome 
We considered two primary outcomes measurements: (1) the 
number of ofﬁce and emergency room visits, and hospital 
admissions during the entire period of NIV use; and (2) the 
number of parameter setting changes during the period (number 
of days, DTC) needed to achieve full compliance (deﬁned as NIV 
use >6 h) and throughout all periods of NIV use. 
Secondary outcomes 
As secondary outcome measures we considered clinical and 
functional disease progression, as deﬁned by ALSFRS total score, 
respiratory, spinal and bulbar subscores (every 3 months), 
respiratory functional tests (very 6 months), total survival (total 
number of days from symptoms onset to death or the end of the 
study), survival from ﬁrst visit (total number of days from 
diagnosis to death or the end of the study) and survival with 
NIV (total number of days from NIV adaptation to death or the 
end of the study). In addition, we also recorded the type of 
parameter setting change and compliance, assessed by the 
number of hours of usage a day; percentage of spontaneous 
breathing; backup respiratory rate; average, minimum and 
maximal respiratory rates; and percentage of attained prede- 
termined pressures. 
In this study, all patients gave written informed consent after 
protocol approval by the local ethics committee. As this was 
a pilot study, sample size considerations were not based on 
a predeﬁned clinically signiﬁcant difference in health resource 
utilisation and survival probability but rather on studying the 
minimum number of subjects (20 per group) that would allow 
the application of large sample statistical methods. 
Statistical analysis 
Demographic and baseline clinical and respiratory function data 
were analysed for homogeneity between groups with two 
sample t tests and Fisher’s exact test. Event count data, such as 
healthcare utilisation data (number of ofﬁce visits, hospital 
admissions and emergency room admissions, number of 
parameters changes and number of DTC) were analysed with 
the person years method and reported as incidence rate ratios 
with exact Poisson conﬁdence intervals and signiﬁcance tests. 
Repeated measurements data (panel data) on parameters 
settings and patient compliance were analysed with random 
effects regression. Survival was analysed with the KaplaneMeier 
method and survivor functions were compared with the log rank 
test. Student’s t tests and Fisher’s exact test were used 
throughout as appropriate. Differences were considered statis- 
tically signiﬁcant at p<0.05. All tests are two tailed. Statistical 
analysis was performed with STATA 10 (Stata Corporation). 
RESULTS 
Of 155 consecutive home ventilated ALS patients, 51 were 
excluded because they were ventilated with devices that did not 
allow compliance analysis through modem communication. A 
group of 62 additional patients were excluded because they had 







FVC values lower than 75% of the predicted value. Among the 
42 eligible patients, two refused to participate and were 
excluded. The ﬁnal analysis set comprised 20 patients in the 
control group (G1) and 20 patients in the intervention group 
(G2), but one patient in G2 was lost to follow-up and hence was 
excluded from the analysis. (ﬁgure 1) No difference was found in 
terms of demographic data, clinical characteristics and respira- 
tory function tests between the groups at diagnosis or at NIV 
adaptation, except for FVC which was signiﬁcantly higher in G1 
at diagnosis (p¼0.04) (tables 1 and 2). Moreover, mean values for 
the initial parameter settings of NIV at the time of non-invasive 
ventilation onset were not different, showing that the procedure 
was similar in both groups. 
Primary outcome 
Table 3 shows the incidence data regarding the number of ofﬁce 
and emergency room visits and inhospital admissions. The 
incidence rate was 3e6 lower in G2 patients (p<0.0001). 
Random effects regression analysis of the overall difference in 
the type of parameter setting changes throughout the ventila- 
tion period showed no differences between the groups. The same 
negative results were observed in comparison of compliance data 
although a trend towards a greater number of daily hours of NIV 
use in group G2 was observed (p¼0.17). 
Secondary outcomes 
The number of changes in parameter settings during DTC and 
over the entire period of NIV showed a slightly higher incidence 
rate in G2 during the initial period of adaption (20%, p<0.01%) 
but a clearly lower rate over the entire period of NIV (50%, 
p<0.0001) (table 4). 
The clinical progression rate prior to NIV adaption showed no 
differences between the groups for total ALSFRS score or for 
bulbar and spinal subscores. Respiratory subscore tended to

the random effects general linear model regression analysis did 
not show statistically signiﬁcant differences in clinical progres- 
sion, despite a trend for slower progression of the spinal subscore 
in G2 (p¼0.15). 
For survival evaluation, at the end of the study, 12 patients 
were still alive in each group and differences did not reach 
statistical signiﬁcance at the 5% level. However, patients in G2 
tended to have a longer survival (table 5, ﬁgure 2).

The relatively small number of patients supports some difﬁcul- 
ties in the randomisation of patients based on computer gener- 
ation in a single centre in our country. Thus the present study is 
a prospective single blinded quasi randomised clinical trial that 
included consecutive patients, aimed at testing the feasibility, 
efﬁcacy and efﬁciency of telemedicine for home monitoring NIV. 
In addition, patient selection based on geographical residence 
was not considered biased and was probably appropriate for our 
purpose. 
The feasibility of telemedicine for home monitoring patients 
with chronic respiratory failure discharged from hospital with 
a mean follow-up time of 176 days has been assessed and it was 
found that home monitoring was feasible and useful for titra- 
tion of ventilation settings.30 
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the ﬁrst 
trial of NIV compliance using a new technical method that 
enabled us to monitor remotely registered data in the equipment 
software. 

in the run-in period, we had an 
exploratory phase to test safety, acceptance and accuracy. The 
system was suitable, worked well and served our investigational 
purposes. The main limitations were related to the need for 
a ﬁxed telephone line and speed of data extraction. 
Our study supports the role and use of telemonitoring in 
eliminating difﬁculties imposed by geographical distances and 
lack of resources. We observed objective gains in terms of 
healthcare utilisation (table 3), reﬂecting the efﬁciency of the 
system. 
Cost analysis is underway but our preliminary data indicate 
signiﬁcant cost reduction using telemonitoring (approximately 
50%), as expected from the lower number of hospital visits and 
admissions. Therefore, in view of the limited resources of health 
systems,31 32 this study strongly supports the fact that frequent 
virtual visits to the patients by modem communications may 
become current practice, as an alternative to the ofﬁce based 
control of compliance to NIV. 
Indeed, the control of compliance is a critical issue because, 
despite recommendations, the rate of NIV use is poor and highly 
variable (range 0e70%) in European and American ALS centres. 
Chiò et al showed that the use of NIV ranged from 50% to 70%

depending on the size of the ALS clinics. More recently, Jackson 
reported 36% use in ALS patients with FVC lower than 50% of 
the predicted value, and correlated tolerance with respiratory 
symptoms. Other factors such as age, race, type of insurance, 
forced vital capacity, disease duration, ALSFRS, caregiver burden 
or quality of life were not predictors of compliance.17 33e36 
Other factors may inﬂuence the possible relationship of 
compliance to settings of the ventilators. The possible role of 
setting changes through modem communications in increasing 
compliance was not conﬁrmed in the present study, probably 
due to the identical procedures that took place in both groups, 
all performed by one of the authors (AP), or the small sample 
size. However, our results showed a trend towards a greater 
number of hours of NIV use in G2, suggesting a marginal effect 
on compliance. Probably associated with this marginal effect, we 
observed a trend towards survival beneﬁt (p¼0.17) in G2 
(table 5). 
In addition, in G2 we were able to show a 50% reduction in 
the number of parameter setting changes during the survival 
period with NIV, but a 20% increase during the DTC period 
(exact Poisson p<0.001). This result represents a tighter follow- 
up during the initial period of NIV adaptation, thus driving 
a reduction in the total time needed to adjust settings over the 
whole period of ventilation. 
Regarding the functional and survival outcome measures, 
median survival with NIV was 334 days in G1 versus 865 days in 
G2 (p¼0.13). Considering survival from symptom onset, the 
beneﬁt in median survival time was >1500 days (ﬁgure 2). 
Further calculations of the sample needed to achieve 90% 
statistical power indicated that 40 patients in each arm would 
be needed to show a signiﬁcant survival impact. 
Moreover, a trend was also observed towards improved 
functional outcomes in G2 patients in terms of the ALSFRS 
spinal subscore (p¼0.15). This was not anticipated, as ALS 
patients in G1 had a closer follow-up provided by physiotherapy 
in our specialised centre. Exercise was suggested to all patients, 
included to the limits of perceived fatigue (Borg scale), simul- 
taneously with NIV if needed,14 but patients in G1 were 
supervised by physiotherapists with special training in ALS. We

hypothesised that timed and adequate intervention due to early 
detection of alert signs might allow patients to perform more 
daily physical activities. Ventilation subtleties may be not fully 
understood without quantifying measurements related to lung 
mechanics, meaning that clinical judgement may not be sensi- 
tive enough to early detect deviations from a ventilation proﬁle 
otherwise detected by the regular observation of the night 
calendar. The increased speed of these communications with 
faster data transmission and improved alarm signs would 
certainly reassure patients, caregivers and physicians, with 
beneﬁts to all.37 
Whether our positive results are related to closer vigilance and 
faster correction of respiratory changes or to other undisclosed 
factors remains to be clariﬁed. Future studies should evaluate the 
impact of telemonitoring on the quality of life of patients and 
caregivers.
