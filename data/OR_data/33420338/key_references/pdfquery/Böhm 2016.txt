Hospital admissions are frequently preceded by increased pulmonary congestion in heart failure (HF) patients. This 
study evaluated whether early automated ﬂuid status alert notiﬁcation via telemedicine improves outcome in HF 
patients.

Methods 
Patients recently implanted with an implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator (ICD) with or without cardiac resynchroniza- 
and results 
tion therapy were eligible if one of three conditions was met: prior HF hospitalization, recent diuretic treatment, or 
recent brain natriuretic peptide increase. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to have ﬂuid status alerts automatically 
transmitted as inaudible text message alerts to the responsible physician or to receive standard care (no alerts). In the 
intervention arm, following a telemedicine alert, a protocol-speciﬁed algorithm with remote review of device data and 
telephone contact was prescribed to assess symptoms and initiate treatment. The primary endpoint was a composite of 
all-cause death and cardiovascular hospitalization. We followed 1002 patients for an average of 1.9 years. The primary 
endpoint occurred in 227 patients (45.0%) in the intervention arm and 239 patients (48.1%) in the control arm [hazard 
ratio, HR, 0.87; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.72–1.04; P ¼ 0.13]. There were 59 (11.7%) deaths in the intervention 
arm and 63 (12.7%) in the control arm (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62– 1.28; P ¼ 0.52). Twenty-four per cent of alerts were not 
transmitted and 30% were followed by a medical intervention.

Heart failure is a highly prevalent syndrome, affecting over 23 million 
people worldwide.1,2 Although improvements have been made in 
the treatment of chronic HF, morbidity, and mortality remain 
high.3 In (cid:2)90% of cases, patients hospitalized for HF present with 
pulmonary congestion with increased ﬁlling pressures and volume 
overload4 often preceding the development of symptoms and 
hospitalization.5,6 A variety of strategies has been tested leveraging 
implantable technologies for the early detection of congestion, thus 
enabling intervention in an effort to avoid hospitalization.5 – 9 How- 
ever, these attempts have had mixed results. In a previous study, 
intrathoracic impedance monitoring with audible patient alert did 
not reduce all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations in the manage- 
ment of patients with HF.7 In fact, using this diagnostic information 
together with an alert audible for patients resulted in more hospita- 
lizations and outpatient visits. A proportion of hospitalizations may 
well have been driven mainly by the audible alert itself and the need 
of patients (and also physicians) to resolve the situation even in the 
absence of signs and symptoms for HF deterioration. Recently, ﬁnd- 
ings from the IN-TIME study10 showed a modest beneﬁt in a clinical 
score consisting of all-cause death, overnight hospitalization for HF, 
change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classiﬁcation, and 
change in patient global self-assessment. However, a recent system- 
atic meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials on remote 
monitoring of implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator (ICD) patients 
involving 6469 patients failed to show effects on all-cause mortality, 
cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization.11 
The OptiLink HF (Optimization of Heart Failure Management 
using OptiVolTM Fluid Status Monitoring and CareLinkTM) study 
was designed to investigate whether early detection of pulmonary 
congestion via telemedicine with a deﬁned intervention algorithm 
reduces all-cause death and cardiovascular (CV) hospitalizations in 
chronic HF patients with an ICD compared with patients without 
telemedicine access. 

Study design and participants 
Optimization of Heart Failure Management using OptiVolTM Fluid Status 
Monitoring and CareLinkTM was a prospective, multi-centre, rando- 
mized, and unblinded study conducted in Germany. Eligible patients 
were in stable NYHA class II or III HF, left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) ≤35%, and received a market-released ICD (newly implanted or 
replacement) with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy 
(CRT-D) within the preceding 3 – 21 days according to guideline recom- 
mended indications.12 Of note, CRT-D patients needed QRS ≥120 ms 
and left ventricular end diastolic diameter ≥55 mm. All patients re- 
ceived a Medtronic ICD or CRT-D with the capability of intrathoracic 
ﬂuid status monitoring and telemedicine functionality. In addition, one 
of three conditions had to be met: either HF hospitalization within 
the last 12 months, intravenous/oral diuretic treatment within 30 
days, or increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal-pro-BNP 
within 30 days. Cut-offs were .400 pg/mL for BNP and .450 pg/mL in 
patients ,50 years, .900 pg/mL in patients 50–75 years, .1800 pg/mL 
in patients .75 years for N-terminal-pro-BNP. Patients with chronic 
renal failure requiring dialysis, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, or with planned heart transplantation were ineligible. 
The study design required follow-up visits every 6 months after ran- 
domization up to 18 months. In the ﬁrst quarter of 2011, during the 
course of the trial, the protocol was revised to extend follow-up until 
all participants had reached the 18-month visit. The revision was at 
the request of the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) due to slower 
than anticipated enrolment. 
The executive committee designed and oversaw the conduct of 
the trial and data analysis in collaboration with the sponsor, Medtronic. 
The trial was monitored by an independent DSMB. Data were collected 
and managed by the sponsor and analysed according to a pre-speciﬁed 
statistical analysis plan. The trial protocol was approved by the ethical 
committees of the individual centres and is available along with the stat- 
istical analysis plan at eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org. All patients provided 
written informed consent prior to enrolment into the trial. 
Randomization 
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to have their devices set to auto- 
matically transmit ﬂuid index telemedicine alerts or to not transmit 
alerts. The randomization was done using a centralized, concealed pro- 
cess implemented by the sponsor, and stratiﬁed by NYHA class, history 
of atrial ﬁbrillation (AF), history of ventricular arrhythmia (VT/VF), and 
ischaemic status. The random allocation sequence with random blocks 
of four was computer generated. Control patients were not set up in the 
telemonitoring system so that no accidental crossover could occur. 
Intervention algorithm 
As described previously,13 patients randomized to the intervention arm 
had telemedicine alerts enabled, triggered by intrathoracic ﬂuid index 
threshold crossing (FTC), which was programmed at the investigator’s 
discretion. The ﬂuid status monitoring algorithm detects changes in 
thoracic impedance resulting from accumulation of intrathoracic ﬂuid 
as an early sign of developing cardiac decompensation. 
Alerts were automatically transmitted via text message to the re- 
sponsible physician but were ‘silent’ (inaudible) to the patient. Following 
a telemedicine alert, a protocol-speciﬁed intervention algorithm, as pre- 
viously shown in Figure 2 in the OptiLink HF design paper13 was followed 
Translational perspective 
Our study is a randomized controlled trial showing no signiﬁcant beneﬁt of a speciﬁc telemonitoring approach using implant-based 
intrathoracic impedance measurements in patients with heart failure (HF). The alert technology, inaudible to patients, did not decrease 
hospitalizations. The observed rate of telemonitor-guided medical intervention was low despite intensive instruction of patients and 
physicians. This important ﬁnding may demonstrate the situation more close to real life and clinical practice, highlighting the challenges 
associated with such a disease management approach. Given the considerable, and largely unmitigated burden of HF, the potential for 
telemonitoring to improve the management of patients with HF is substantial, provided overcoming the obstacles identiﬁed in Optimization 
of Heart Failure Management using OptiVolTM Fluid Status Monitoring and CareLinkTM, which may be an even greater barrier in clinical 
practice than in the clinical trial conditions reported herein. 


with follow-up actions being documented on Telemedicine Alert Evalu- 
ation Forms (TAEFs). Brieﬂy, the HF-speciﬁc device data were reviewed 
remotely, and the patient was contacted within 2 working days by phone 
to evaluate condition and HF status and to take appropriate measures. 
Up to 3 further telemedicine-guided remote contacts with review of de- 
vice data and HF status were scheduled in the 2 weeks following the 
alert. When contacting patients on the basis of telemonitored data, 
the investigators used a standardized telephone interview to establish 
whether the patient’s overall condition had worsened and whether 
the patient was regularly taking prescribed drugs. Patients randomized 
to the control group did not have access to telemonitoring, although 
device data could be accessed in the clinic. 
Study outcomes 
The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and CV hos- 
pitalization. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascu- 
lar mortality, composite of all-cause death and HF hospitalization, 
CV hospitalizations, HF hospitalizations, and all-cause hospitalizations 
during follow-up. 
An Event Adjudication Committee, blinded to the treatment arms, ad- 
judicated all reported events and deaths. For all events and deaths, a ﬁnal 
consensus classiﬁcation was reached. Analyses used adjudication results. 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was pre-speciﬁed in the study protocol and a statistic- 
al analysis plan. Freedom from event is illustrated with Kaplan – Meier 
curves and compared between randomized arms with a stratiﬁed log- 
rank test. The stratifying variables are device type (ICD vs. CRT-D) 
and the variables used in the randomization process, i.e. NYHA class, 
ischaemic, or non-ischaemic HF aetiology, history of VT/VF, and history 
of AF. Hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% conﬁdence intervals 
(CIs) are reported from stratiﬁed Cox proportional-hazards regression 
models. All HR estimates are for the intervention arm relative to the 
control arm. Subgroup analyses were performed with use of stratiﬁed 
cox proportional-hazards regression models, having treatment group 
and a baseline factor as covariates along with their interaction term. 
The rate of HF hospitalization per patient per year was analysed through 
a negative binomial regression with only treatment arm as covariate and 
log (follow-up time) as an offset variable to account for different follow- 
up time among the subjects. 
As re-consent was optional, long-term follow-up data were included 
in analysis only after poolability assessment. Patients in the primary ob- 
jective analysis cohort who re-consented and were followed beyond 18 
months are compared against those who survived to 18 months but did 
not re-consent and exited at the 18-month visit with respect to gender 
and the above mentioned stratifying variables. Fisher’s exact test was 
performed for each of these characteristics. 
The study was designed to include 1000 patients to ensure 80% 
power when the event-free rate at 18 months would be 72% in the con- 
trol arm and 80.4% in the intervention arm. Two interim analyses were 
scheduled when 33 and 67% of the 238 expected primary endpoints oc- 
curred, with a-levels of 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively. The ﬁnal analysis 
was done with a ¼ 0.0495 to compensate for the interim analyses, 
maintaining total type I error at 0.05. 

implanted with a single-chamber ICD (23.3%), dual-chamber ICD 
(14.2%), or CRT-D (62.6%) prior to enrolment. Mean age was 
66.3 + 10.4 years, 79.7% were male. Patients’ demographics and 
clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Based upon observed 
imbalances in gender and history of HF hospitalization, formal stat- 
istical testing was done, which conﬁrmed the imbalances. I.V. diure- 
tics prior to randomization was slightly imbalanced. 
Patients were followed for 22.9 + 18.2 months. Figure 1 shows 
the study ﬂow in CONSORT format. All patients received treatment 
per their randomized allocation, with 505 receiving an alert enabled 
system (intervention) and 497 receiving an alert disabled system (con- 
trol). The number of patients with signed re-consent and long-term 
data follow-up available was 175 (34.6%) in the intervention arm and 
167 (33.6%) in the control arm. The proportion of patients with 
extended follow-up was similar between groups. Nonetheless, 
some selection bias cannot be ruled out, and caution must be used 
upon interpretation of data beyond 18 months of follow-up. All 
1002 patients were included in the analysis per intention-to-treat. 
Endpoints 
In the intervention arm, 227 patients reached the primary endpoint, 
compared with 239 in the control arm (Table 2). Event-free survival 
at (18, 24) months was (59.0%, 52.7%) for the intervention group 
and (56.1%, 47.8%) for the control group, respectively (HR, 0.87; 
95% CI, 0.72 –1.04; P ¼ 0.13). Figure 2A displays the survival curves 
by treatment arm for the primary endpoint, which were drawn 
when the number of patients at risk was at least 50 to avoid misin- 
terpretation of estimated survival probabilities that are based on few 
patients at risk. Two interim analyses were performed as planned. 
The stopping boundaries were not crossed and the DSMB recom- 
mended continuation of the study. 
There were 59 deaths in the intervention arm and 63 in the con- 
trol arm. All-cause death incidences at (18, 24) months were (6.3%, 
11.0%) and (8.5%, 15.7%) respectively (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62–1.28; 
P ¼ 0.52). Figure 2B displays the survival curves by treatment arm for 
all-cause death. 
There were 435 patients who experienced a total of 928 CV hos- 
pitalizations post-randomization; 495 events in 214 patients in the 
intervention arm and 433 events in 221 patients in the control 
arm. Time to ﬁrst CV hospitalization was not different between 
the treatment and control groups (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73 – 1.08; 
P ¼ 0.22). Figure 2C displays the survival curves by treatment arm 
for the CV hospitalization endpoint. 
Post-randomization HF hospitalizations were also similar be- 
tween the treatment arms. More speciﬁcally, the survival probabil- 
ities from HF hospitalization at (18, 24) months were (79.2%, 75.4%) 
in the intervention arm, and (76.2%, 71.8%) in the control arm (HR, 
0.87; 95% CI, 0.67–1.12; P ¼ 0.28). Intervention vs. Control HR es- 
timates for primary and secondary objectives are shown in Table 2. 
The number of HF hospitalizations per patient per year as estimated 
from a negative binomial regression model was 0.24 for the Inter- 
vention arm and 0.30 for the Control arm (P ¼ 0.20). 
Study patients 
From 28 October 2008 through 29 April 2013, a total of 1002 sub- 
jects were recruited from 65 centres in Germany. Patients had 
NYHA class II (19.4%) or III (80.6%) HF symptoms and were

of intervention on event-free survival for the primary endpoint 
according to the baseline factors evaluated. 
Post hoc analyses 
As there was an imbalance between the two arms with respect to a 
history of HF hospitalization in the 12 months prior to randomiza- 
tion, the analysis was repeated adjusting for HF hospitalization and 
i.v.-diuretics prior to randomization (added as covariates to the 
stratiﬁed Cox regression models). None of the endpoints had a 
signiﬁcant HR, except for the composite of HF hospitalization and 
all-cause death (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61 –0.98; P ¼ 0.03). 
Alerts and compliance 
In the investigational arm, there were 1748 FTCs in 406 patients 
(80.4%). Of these, 1324 (75.7%) generated an alert that was 
wirelessly transmitted to the treating physician through telemedi- 
cine. Follow-up actions are illustrated in Figure 4. They were docu- 
mented on TAEFs in 1128 cases (64.5% of FTCs). The 
protocol-required telephone contact took place for 1074 TAEFs 
(95.2%). For 983 cases (87.1%) at least one remote check of device 
data was done, with 1, 2, and 3 interrogations in 226 (20.0%), 264 
(23.4%), and 493 (43.7%) cases, respectively. At least one subse- 
quent telephone call with the patient took place in 995 cases 
(88.2%), with 1, 2, and 3 subsequent telephone calls in 220 
(19.5%), 272 (24.1%), and 503 (44.6%) cases, respectively. 
Patients reported worsening HF symptoms at any of the tele- 
phone contacts for 425 (37.7%) of the TAEFs. For 529 (46.9%) 
TAEFs, medical actions were taken, including medication changes 
for 455 (40.3%). Therefore, of the 1748 FTCs, 30.3% led to a med- 
ical action and 26.0% altered medication. Taking into account HF 
medication changes which occurred within 30 days after a TAEF, 


excluding changes on or after a CV hospitalization, equated to 0.37 
HF medication changes per patient per 6 months as a result of TAEF 
algorithms. 
TAEFs were followed by hospitalizations adjudicated as 
CV-related within 30 days of an FTC in 72 cases (6.4% of 1128 
TAEFs). In total, there were 110 CV hospitalizations within 30 
days of an FTC for the intervention arm. Thus 38 CV hospitaliza- 
tions within 30 days of an FTC occurred which were not followed 
with a TAEF. 
Device data from in-ofﬁce visits were collected in both arms. In 
the intervention arm, data from remote telemedicine interrogations 
were also collected, which led to high completeness of device data 
in the intervention arm compared with moderate completeness in 
the control arm. Out of 554 CV hospitalizations or deaths in the 
intervention arm, 118 (21.3%) were preceded by a documented 
FTC in the preceding 30 days. In the control arm, this was the 
case for 56 of 496 events (11.3%). Restricting to events with com- 
plete device data in the 30 preceding days, 104 of 374 endpoints in

aResults from a Cox proportional-hazards regression model with history of HF hospitalization (12 months), IV-Diuretics (30 days prior enrolment), and treatment arm as 
covariates. This model is stratiﬁed by device type, NYHA, history of AF, ischaemic status, and history of VT/VF. 
bP-value based on a negative binomial model with treatment as covariate and log (follow-up time) as an offset variable. 
Figure 1 A total of 1002 patients were enrolled and randomized [505 patients to intervention (automated intrathoracic ﬂuid index alert trans- 
mission) and 497 to control (standard care only)]. Follow-up occurred every 6 months until the original study end at 18 months or until study 
completion for patients that re-consented. Longer term follow-up was not required so no attrition is counted post 18 months. 


the intervention arm (27.8%) had an FTC in the 30 preceding days; in 
the control arm, this occurred for 50 of 228 events (21.9%). These 
percentages were not statistically different (P ¼ 0.12). 
Further post hoc analyses were done to evaluate the prognostic 
importance of early ﬂuid threshold crossings (FTC), similar to the 
analysis reported by Tang et al.14 Results are presented in 
Figure 2 Kaplan– Meier curves are shown for the composite primary endpoint of all-cause death and cardiovascular hospitalization (A) and its 
components all-cause death (B) and cardiovascular hospitalization (C). 


Supplementary material online. In brief, early FTCs are associated 
with an increased incidence of primary endpoints .6 months after 
enrolment (P ¼ 0.0019). The study intervention was associated 
with a lower late event incidence in those patients that remained 
free from endpoints and FTCs in the ﬁrst 6 months (P ¼ 0.035). 
Thus, the intervention does not appear to prevent repeat events 
in patients that have an early event, but only in patients that are 
event-free at 6 months. 

In the OptiLink HF study, use of a speciﬁc intrathoracic impedance 
and telemedicine-based HF disease management strategy in patients 
with moderate-to-severe HF, severe left ventricular dysfunction, 
and prior implantation of an ICD/CRT-D device did not signiﬁcantly 
reduce the rate of all-cause death or CV hospitalization compared 
with standard clinical assessment. In addition, the secondary morbidity 
and mortality outcomes did not show a statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁt. 
The effects of telemonitoring within OptiLink HF depended upon 
multiple factors including the performance of the device, successful 
transmission of FTCs, physician follow-up, subsequent intervention/ 
medical action, and patient adherence. The intrathoracic impedance 
monitoring feature has been previously evaluated, demonstrating 
high correlation to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and net 
ﬂuid loss during hospitalization15 but with wide ranging sensitivity 
(20.7– 76.9%) and positive prediction (4.7 –60%) to HF hospitaliza- 
tion.15,16 Tang et al.14 reported an association of FTC with a 2-fold 
increase risk in mortality. The strategy to use implantable technol- 
ogy for the management of ﬂuid congestion requires medical action 
to be taken, potentially in the absence of symptoms. Within Opti- 
Link HF, the proportion of events with prior FTC is highest for 
HF-related hospitalizations, as expected. However, only one in 
three HF hospitalizations had a prior crossing. Consequently, 
assuming crossings .30 days before hospitalization are unrelated 
to the event, at best, one in three HF hospitalizations could have 
been prevented by the OptiLink HF intervention. 
While the OptiLink HF study used a prescriptive intervention 
algorithm, medication changes, and medical actions were at the 
discretion of the investigator. We observed that 30% of FTCs led 
to medical action and 26% to medication change. More speciﬁcally, 
on average, patients in the intervention arm had 0.37 HF medication 
changes per 6 months as a result of TAEF algorithms. Conversely, 
Adamson et al.17 reported an average incremental rate of 5.8 device- 
driven medication changes per 6 months for reduced EF patients 
with daily ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure monitoring 
(9.5 changes in the treatment vs. 3.7 in the control subjects). 
Figure 3 Hazard ratios and 95% conﬁdence intervals are shown for the primary outcome in each pre-speciﬁed subgroup. With exception to 
cardiovascular disease and device type, the hazard ratios of the subgroups were similar. All baseline factors did not present statistically signiﬁcant 
interactions. The dotted vertical line represents the hazard ratio using all patients (HR ¼ 0.87). The horizontal lines indicate nominal 95% con- 
ﬁdence intervals for the hazard ratio. 


From the analyses performed it must be concluded that the rate 
of telemonitor-guided medical intervention was low. Intervention 
following an FTC was 30%, and there was no record of any interven- 
tion in 38 of the 110 CV hospitalizations which occurred within 
30 days of an FTC. Since patients and investigators were carefully 
introduced to the use of the device and the application of the pre- 
deﬁned treatment algorithm at entry and during follow-up of the 
study, the reported intervention rate may more closely reﬂect 
real life practice, highlighting challenges associated with reliable 
data transmission and conﬁdence in ﬂuid index algorithms. 
The success of telemonitoring is dependent on both optimal 
physician reaction to alerts and optimal monitoring of patients. 
Centralized monitoring with an associated call centre could have 
led to an improvement of these conditions. However, OptiLink 
HF was designed to create conditions, which are practical and 
affordable in real life. Therefore, it was decided not to use a central 
monitoring unit but to rely on appropriate clinical response to 
telemonitoring. The low rate of telemonitor-guided medical inter- 
vention may reﬂect the need to invest additional effort into educa- 
tional activities to train physicians to react to telemonitoring data, 
eventually also in patients before symtoms develop. In addition, 
efforts to improve the technology of data transmission for telemo- 
nitoring are warranted. Results from our trial highlighted these 
challenges in telemonitor-guided HF disease management. 
A limitation of the study was the optional extended follow-up 
beyond 18 months. However, no differences in baseline character- 
istics were observed between patients with follow-up completed at 
18 months compared with patients continued in the study. Another 
limitation is the potential heterogenous treatment of the interven- 
tion patients, with some physicians being more aggressive than 
others in responding to alerts. However, this phenomenon is 
inﬂicted in every trial where physicians must react according to their 
usual medical practice. Also, as the study was only conducted 
in Germany the results may not apply to several other regions. In 
addition, there was an inability to mask patients and investigators 
to the treatment allocation inherent with the technology used 
creating a potential bias. 
In conclusion, OptiLink HF did not show a beneﬁt of early detection 
of congestion using a remote ﬂuid index alert system on the composite 
of all-cause death and cardiovascular hospitalizations. Physician and 
patient adherence to telemonitoring systems, which are practical and 
affordable, represents a major and underappreciated challenge.
