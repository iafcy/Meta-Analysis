Background: Although a number of studies have suggested that the use of Telemonitoring (TM) in patients with 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can be useful and efficacious, its real utility in detecting Acute 
Exacerbation (AE) signaling the need for prompt treatment is not entirely clear. The current study aimed to 
investigate the benefits of a TM system in managing AE in advanced-stage COPD patients to improve their Health- 
Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and to reduce utilization of healthcare services. 
Methods: A 12-month Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in the Veneto region (Italy). Adult patients 
diagnosed with Class III-IV COPD in accordance with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 
(GOLD) classification were recruited and provided a TM system to alert the clinical staff via a trained operator 
whenever variations in respiratory parameters fell beyond the individual’s normal range. The study’s primary 
endpoint was HRQL, measured by the Italian version of the two Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF36v2). Its 
secondary endpoints were: scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the number and duration 
of hospitalizations; the number of readmissions; the number of appointments with a pulmonary specialist; the 
number of visits to the emergency department; and the number of deaths. 
Results: Three hundred thirty-four patients were enrolled and randomized into two groups for a 1 year period. At 
its conclusion, changes in the SF36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores did not significantly differ 
between the TM and control groups [(-2.07 (8.98) vs -1.91 (7.75); p = 0.889 and -1.08 (11.30) vs -1.92 (10.92); p = 0. 
5754, respectively]. Variations in HADS were not significantly different between the two groups [0.85 (3.68) vs 0.62 
(3.6); p = 0.65 and 0.50 (4.3) vs 0.72 (4.5); p = 0.71]. The hospitalization rate for AECOPD and/or for any cause was not 
significantly different in the two groups [IRR = 0.89 (95% CI 0.79–1,04); p = 0.16 and IRR = 0.91 (95% CI 0,75 – 1.04); 
p = 0.16, respectively]. The readmission rate for AECOPD and/or any cause was, however, significantly lower in 
the TM group with respect to the control one [IRR = 0.43 (95% CI 0.19–0.98); p = 0.01 and 0.46 (95% CI 0.24–0.89); p = 0.01, 
respectively].

Conclusion: Study results showed that in areas where medical services are well established, TM does not significantly 
improve HRQL in patients with COPD who develop AE. Although not effective in reducing hospitalizations, TM can 
nevertheless facilitate continuity of care during hospital-to-home transition by reducing the need for early readmission. 


Background 
A common, preventable disease characterized by dys- 
fatigue, and reduced exercise capacity, Chronic 
pnea, 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 
is a leading 
cause of death and disability in high, middle, and low in- 
come countries [1–4]. Despite international standardized 
guidelines, improved pharmacotherapy, integrated care, 
and pulmonary rehabilitation, patients with COPD typic- 
ally worsen over time and experience episodes of acute 
exacerbation (AE) [1] which are crucially important in 
patient management in view of their negative effect on 
Quality of Life (QoL) and prognosis and the fact that 
they often lead to hospitalization. Exacerbations of 
COPD are estimated to result in approximately 110,000 
deaths and more than 500,000 hospitalizations per year 
and have been calculated to account for approximately 
70% of COPD-related direct medical costs, with over 18 
billion spent in direct costs worldwide annually [5–8]. 
Telemonitoring (TM) (or remote monitoring) involves 
the use of telecommunication technology to transmit 
data regarding patients’ vital signs, symptoms, and medi- 
cations to an operator at a monitoring station who will, 
in turn, transmit them to a specialist who can recom- 
mend treatment variations or new interventions to avoid 
deterioration in a patient’s medical condition [9]. Al- 
though a number of studies have suggested that TM in 
patients with chronic diseases can be safe, reliable, and 
cost effective, systematic reviews have reported incon- 
clusive results regarding its impact on the management 
of COPD patients, and evidence is still insufficient to 
draw firm conclusions about its clinical and/or cost ef- 
fectiveness as far as AE is concerned [9–13]. 
Acute Exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is a major 
public health problem in the geographic area serviced by 
our hospital, located in the Veneto region (Italy), and led 
to approximately 6400 hospitalization in 2009 (http:// 
www.ser-veneto.it/). In view of conflicting results on TM 
utility in COPD patients, the current study set out to 
clarify the utility of TM in detecting early signs of AE 
episodes in advanced-stage COPD patients to permit 
specialists to take timely, appropriate measures to im- 
prove patients’ Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) 
and to reduce the utilization of healthcare services. In 
this trial, TM was integrated into existing clinical ser- 
vices, and monitoring was provided by teams of 
pulmonary specialists who already knew the patients 
who were recruited. Both the intervention and control 
groups had access to the same conventional clinical care: 
the only difference was that patients in the study group 
also had TM. 
Methods 
A pragmatic, unblinded, parallel-group, two arm, 12- 
month Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was carried 
out in the Veneto region (Italy); participants were re- 
cruited between 1st November 2011 and 31st July 2012. 
The study was part of the “RENEWING HEALTH” pro- 
ject, a research initiative involving a Consortium of nine 
European regions. The trial was registered at Clinical- 
Trials.gov as NCT01513980 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ 
ct2/show/NCT01513980?term=renewing+health&rank= 
3) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of all of 
the participating centres. 
All potential participants were provided with written 
information about the aims and the procedures of the 
study, and those willing to participate signed informed 
consent forms. 
Subjects 
Adults at the time of discharge from hospital after an 
AE episode or attending the outpatient Pulmonary 
Clinics of the City Hospitals of Padova, Treviso, Venice 
and Verona (Veneto region of Italy) were recruited. 
Eligibility criteria for the study were: diagnosis of Class 
III-IV COPD according to the Global Initiative on Ob- 
structive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification [14]; age ≥ 
18 years; life expectancy > 12 months according to Mul- 
tiparametric Prognostic Index (MPI) [15]; and capability 
of using, alone or assisted, the TM equipment. Exclusion 
criteria were: concomitant significant lung disease; un- 
willingness to provide informed consent or to use the 
TM technology; the negative advice of the general prac- 
titioner (GP), and/or other serious social problems, in- 
cluding lack of adequate family support and/or other 
social support networks. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was performed following standard proce- 
dures and checked for incorrect imbalances or meaning- 
ful baseline differences in variables using a dedicated 


algorithm provided by PASS 2008 software that took 
into account patient’s age and gender [16]. Patients were 
randomised to the intervention or control groups using 
a 2:1 allocation; unequal allocation was preferred for 
ethical reasons as the patients in the TM group was ex- 
pected to show improvement in HRQL. Each participat- 
ing center implemented randomization locally using the 
same methodology. 
Baseline assessment 
The baseline characteristics of 
the TM and control 
groups are outlined in Tables 1 and 2. The data collected 
at baseline included the following: demographic, smok- 
ing status, level of education, marital and employment 
status; the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) 
dyspnoea score [17]; the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) 
score [18]; scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depres- 
sion Scale (HADS). HADS, which is an extensively vali- 
dated measure used to assess the severity of symptoms 
of mood disorders in hospital or primary care patients 
and in the general population, consisting of two sub- 
scales: anxiety and depression [19, 20]. Another measure 
taken into consideration was the Short Form Health 
Survey, Italian version 2 (SF36v2) [21]. The SF36 is a

generic measure of HRQL commonly used in studies on 
COPD and consisting of 8 subscales: general health,

Two summary scores, a physical component summary 
(PCS) and a mental component one (MCS) can, 
in 
addition, be calculated on the basis of the subscale 
[22–25]. The presence of cardiovascular co- 
scores 
morbidity, the patient’s routine medication and long-term 
use of Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) were also registered. In 
addition, baseline Forced Expiratory Volume in the first 
second (FEV1), PaO2 and PaCO2, and Walking Distance 
(WD), data gathered from a Pulmonary Function Test 
(PFT), an Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis, and the 6- 
minute Walking Test (6-min WT), which were all taken 
at the time the patients were randomised, were registered. 
The complete battery of testing was carried out at the 
various centres taking part in the study. 
Trial intervention: telemonitoring 
Patients in the intervention group were provided a TM 
system consisting of a finger pulse-oxymeter (Wrist 
Clinic TM – Medical Concierge, Medic 4 all Italia, Italy) 
and a gateway device for data transmission over a tele- 
phone line to a central data management unit located at 
the Veneto Regional e-Health Centre. It was possible for 


a patient/proxy to communicate with the trained opera- 
from 08:00–18:00 Monday 
tors manning the unit 
through Friday. At enrollment, the clinical team respon- 
sible for that particular patient explained how to use the 
TM kit and provided self-management education mate- 
rials. Additional training was provided by the technician 
who installed the TM kit at the patient’s home. 
Using the TM equipment, patients transmitted their 
monitored Heart Rate (HR) and Oxygen Saturation 
(SpO2) values to the operator every other day and/or 
in the event of subjective clinical worsening. A ‘spot 
check’ or single measurement of SpO2 was also per- 
formed once a day, usually in the morning. The oper- 
ators daily (Monday–Friday) reviewed the online data 
of each patient and if the HR and/or SpO2 values 
the patient’s 
that were transmitted were outside of 
“normal” range, they contacted the patient and asked 
for a second measurement. If the second measure- 
ment was also outside of the patient’s normal range, 
the operator alerted the clinical staff. Values consid- 
ered out-of-range were customized for every patient 
depending on his/her individual clinical situation. For 
patients recruited at discharge from hospital, alarm 
limits were set on the basis of baseline values ob- 
tained from pulmonary function testing carried out 
before the hospitalization during routine visit with a 
pulmonary specialist. All patients’ registered data were 
available to the reference pulmonary specialist on a 
web-based platform. Once alerted, the specialist him/ 
herself called the patient by telephone to verify if 
symptoms had stabilized or worsened or if new symp- 
toms had arisen. In the latter event, the patient’s ad- 
herence to therapy was checked and, if unsatisfactory, 
interventions promoting adherence were prescribed. If 
adherence to treatment proved satisfactory, the diag- 
nosis of AECOPD was confirmed and, the specialist 
undertook one of the following actions: 1. Modified 
the patient’s usual medication by telephone. 2. Sent a 
district nurse (a nurse employed by the National 
Health Service specialized in making home visits) for 
a home visit who made a report on the situation. The 
nurse assessed the subject’s clinical status and adher- 
ence to treatment and decided if the patient required 
an examination by a pulmonary specialist. 3. Set up 
an office appointment with a pulmonary specialist. 4. 
should be taken to the 
Decided that 
Emergency Department (ED). According to our proto- 
col, 
the time between when the measurement was 
outside of the patient’s normal range and the special- 
ist’s 
registered and between 
when the recommendation was registered and the dis- 
trict nurse or pulmonary specialist actually examined 
the patient was within 30 min and 48 h, respectively. 
The specialist made his/her decision on the best 
course of action depending on the data registered by 
the TM system, the patients’ symptoms, and his/her 
clinical 
judgment. Figure 1 illustrates how the home 
TM system works.

Control group 
The participants in the two groups received the same 
clinical care and had access to the same healthcare ser- 
vices. If there were any variations in the clinical status of 
patients in the control group, he/she directly called/went 
to see the GP who decided if the patient required an ur- 
gent appointment with a pulmonary specialist or a visit 
to the ED; the former was arranged by the GP. The only 
difference between the intervention and control groups 
was that the former also had the TM service. Pharmaco- 
logic therapy was provided following international stan- 
dardized guidelines [14]. 
Study end points 
The study’s primary endpoint was HRQL, defined as the 
extent to which the individual’s usual or expected phys- 
ical, emotional, and social well-being was affected by a 
medical condition or its treatment [26], which was mea- 
sured using the Italian version of the SF36v2 [21]. This 
particular questionnaire was chosen because it covers a 
broad range of domains of health related issues and 
seems to capture a subject’s perception of his/her gen- 
eral health; it also acquires a lot of information that is 
not exclusively related to his/her baseline disease [27]. 








Readmission was defined as a re-hospitalization 
within 30 days of discharge from hospital due to an 
AECOPD-related admittance [26]. 
– the number of any cause readmissions; 
– the number of appointments with a pulmonary 

– the number of Emergency Department (ED) visits; 
– the number of deaths. 


Data collection 
The questionnaires were administered online by a 
trained operator at baseline and at the end of the 12- 
month study period. Data on hospital admissions, 
healthcare service use including consultations with a 
pulmonary specialist and visits to the ED service, and 
mortality were extracted from regional records at the 
end of the trial. The causes of hospital admission were 
assessed on the basis of the hospital discharge summary. 
Data were exported to a MySQL database. 
Sample size and statistical analysis 
Based on previous studies, we estimated that 196 partici- 
pants in the intervention group and 99 participants in 
the control group would be necessary to detect a differ- 
ence of five points (minimal clinically important differ- 
ence) in the SF36v2 score between the intervention and 
control groups at the end of the 1-year study period with 
0.5 size effect, 20% drop-out rate, >95% power, using a 
significance level of 5%. Data analysis was performed on 
a “per protocol” approach. All the participants who were 
randomised to the treatment group and began the study 
were monitored and included in the analysis regardless 
of their compliance to treatment. Data available con- 
cerning deceased patients were included in the analysis. 
Standard descriptive statistics, 
including means with 
standard deviations and/or numbers with associated per- 
centages, were used to analyze the patients’ demographic 
and clinical characteristics at baseline. Student’s t-test or 
chi-squared test were used to compare continuous or 
categorical variables, as appropriate. Non-normally dis- 
tributed variables were compared using the Wilcoxon- 
Mann-Whitney test. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to 
test for data normality. The Central Limit Theorem’s 
normal approximation was assumed when the SF36 data 
were assessed since it is a standardized approach used to 
analyze large patient populations [28]. SF36 scores are 
expressed as means and standard deviations with a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the difference between two 
means. Results with regard to hospitalizations, readmis- 
sions and visits to the ED are expressed as Incidence 
Rate per year (IR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and a 
95% CI. IR was calculated by dividing the number of 
events by the number of days of the study and multiply- 
ing the result by 365. Groups were compared using the 
Poisson test. Deaths are expressed as numbers, percent- 
ages, Risk Ratio (RR) and the related 95% CI. Two-tailed 
p values of <0.05 were considered significant for all ana- 
lyses. All statistical analyses were conducted using the 
statistical software R version 3.2.2 (Free Software Foun- 
dation Inc, Boston, USA). 
Results 
Recruitment 
Out of 458 patients originally assessed for eligibility, 334 
(73%) were deemed eligible and enrolled in the study 
and 124 (27%) were excluded; the primary reasons for 
exclusion were: failure to comply with the eligibility cri- 
teria (n = 92); decline to participate (n = 25); and with- 
drawal of consent (n = 7). The 334 eligible participants 
were thus randomly assigned to one of two groups: 230 
(69%) were assigned to the TM group and 104 (31%) to 


the control one. Out of the 230 patients allocated to the 
study group, 19 did not actually participate in the study 
(and did not receive the TM equipment) for the follow- 
ing reasons: death (n = 1), withdrawal of consent (n = 9), 
administrative problems (n = 7), moving to a nursing 
home (n = 1), and another reason (n = 1). By the end of 
the one year study period, 30 patients had dropped out 
of the TM group for the following reasons: death (n = 
25), withdrawal of consent during the course of the trial 
(n = 3), moving to a nursing home (n = 1), and another 
reason (n = 1). At the end of the study, the data of 181 
patients who had been randomized to the TM group and 
actively participated in the study were available for 
analysis. 
Out of the 104 patients assigned to the control group, 23 
dropped out due to death (n = 13), withdrawal of consent 
during the course of the trial (n = 5), moving to a nursing 
home (n = 4), and another reason (n = 1). At the end of the 
study period the data of 81 control patients were analyzed. 
Figure 2 illustrates the study’s flow diagram. 
Contacts with TM service 
There were a total of 2747 TM alerts from the 181 tele- 
monitored patients, meaning an average of 15 contacts 
per patient over the one year of the trial (approximately 
one contact every month). No technical problems 
linked to data transmission between the patients and 
the e-Health Service were registered. 
Baseline characteristics 
The baseline characteristics of the study and control 
groups are outlined in Tables 1 and 2. There were no 
differences in the main characteristics of the participants 
in the two groups, although the controls had slightly 
worse PaCO2 values. 
HRQL 
Variations in HRQL are outlined in Table 3. At the end 
of the study period, changes in the PCS and MCS scores 
were not significantly different in the two groups [(-2.07 
(8.98) vs -1.91 (7.75); p = 0.889 and -1.08 (11.30) vs -1.92 
(10.92); p = 0.5754] and the mean PCS and MCS scores 
were similar in the two groups (37.11 ± 9.07 vs 36.48 ± 
8.64; p = 0.59; and 44.56 ± 10.95 vs 43.06 ± 10.95; p = 
0.31, respectively). There were no significant differences 
in the scores on the eight subscales of the SF36 between 
the two groups. The PCS scores at the end of the study 
were significantly lower with respect to baseline values 
in both groups (39.18 ± 9.73 vs 37.11 ± 9.07; p = 0.002 
and 38.39 ± 8.98 vs 36.48 ± 8.64; p = 0.02, respectively). 
Emotional distress 
Variations in HADS are outlined in Table 4. At the end 
of the study period, changes in the “Anxiety” and “De- 
pression” scores were not significantly different in the 
two groups [0.85 (3.68) vs 0.62 (3.6); p = 0.65 and 0.50 
(4.3) vs 0.72 (4.5); p = 0.71]. 
Hospitalizations, appointments with specialists, and 
deaths 
Data on the utilization of healthcare services are out- 
lined in Table 4. The hospitalization rate per year due to 
AECOPD and/or to any cause in the TM group was 
similar to that in the control group [IRR = 0.89 (95% CI

Discussion 
The study’s primary finding was that utilization of TM 
over a one year period had no significant effect on HRQL 
in the study population. Although TM could theoretically 
improve HRQL by facilitating early recognition and 
prompt response to AECOPD, conclusions from previous 
studies proved controversial. Our results were consistent 
with those reported by a number of trials suggesting that 
TM has little effect on HRQL. Nine published studies on 
home telehealth for COPD evaluated in a systematic 
review by Polisena et al., in fact, concluded that TM does 
not improve HRQL when it is compared to usual care 
[11]. A number of reasons have been advanced to explain 
the lack of improvement in HRQL and in psychological 
well-being in TM-monitored patients; these include the 
burden of self-monitoring, concerns raised by intrusive 
surveillance, a perceived lack of user-friendliness, and a 
reduction in the frequency of traditional face-to-face visits 
[29]. 
Other studies have, instead, reported that the use of 
TM can greatly improve HRQL in COPD patients. 
Bourbeau et al.’s study focusing on a program that in- 
cluded telephone consultations with the treating phys- 
ician demonstrated a significant improvement in the

activity and impact subscales and total scores of St 
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [30]. Like- 
wise, in a RCT conducted by Koff et al. who focused on 
a TM system similar to ours but including a web-based 
platform for the transmission of patient’s data and tele- 
phone calls by the care coordinator in the event of clin- 
ical changes, 
the TM group showed a significant 
improvement in the SGRQ score when it was compared 
with that of the usual care group [31]. 
least 
in part be ex- 
plained by the considerable heterogeneity in the stud- 
ies with regard to methodological aspects, such as 
primary outcome measures, number of participants, 
disease severity in the study population, and the in- 
struments to measure health status. It 
is also true 
that 
the data obtained in our study based on the 
summary composite scores of the generic SF36 (phys- 
ical and mental) are not fully comparable to those 
utilized by previous 
trials based on the disease- 
specific SGRQ. While SGRQ seems to be more sensitive 
in detecting differences/changes in HRQL linked to the 
clinical severity of COPD, the SF36 appears to capture 
additional information that is not exclusively related to 
the baseline disease, supporting the opinion that the two 
indexes should be considered complementary [32]. 
In line with lack of evidence of improved HRQL, TM 
did not seem to have a positive impact on patients’ emo- 
tional distress, in particular on the severity of depression 
and/or anxiety: indeed, although the aetiology of mood 
disturbances in COPD patients is multifactoral, HRQL 
has been considered a stronger determinant with respect 
to other clinical and/or physiological risk factors [33]. 
Our healthcare related secondary outcomes did not 
show that TM had any real effect 
in preventing 
AECOPD or other cause-related hospitalisations. A 
Cochrane systematic review of telehealthcare for COPD 
including only high-quality evidence from RCTs found, 
instead, a significant reduction in the number of patients 
requiring hospital admissions and ED attendances [13]. 
intro- 
Most of the programs evaluated had, however, 
duced an enhanced clinical service to support 
the 
technological arm of the trial that included case manage- 
ment by a nurse as well as other interventions making it 
difficult to isolate the effect of the TM component. In- 
deed, our results are consistent with those of a recent 
RCT by Pinnock et al. who investigated the impact of a 
TM service that was integrated into existing clinical ser- 
vices for COPD patients. The investigators concluded 
that it was ineffective in postponing admissions and in 
improving patients’ QoL and advanced the hypothesis 


that the positive effect of TM demonstrated in previous 
studies could have been due to the enhancement of the 
underpinning clinical service [34]. 
Some hypotheses explaining why TM did not reduce 
hospitalization in our study population can be advanced. 
First, the number of hospital admissions was very low 
even in the control group [IR: 1,20 (95% CI 0,99–1,45)] 
and this is not surprising given the health authorities’ ef- 
forts to potentiate an integrated care model for chronic 
COPD patients aiming to provide enhanced long-term 
home services to reduce need for hospitalization. In this 
context, there is not much leeway for further reduction in 
hospitalization as a result of a TM intervention. Second, 
although variations in HR and SpO2 that were used as 
markers of an unstable clinical condition are regarded as 
reliable predictors of AECOPD [35], it is reasonable to as- 
sume that these physiological parameters cannot always 
reflect changes in patients’ health status, leading to under- 
estimation and treatment delay of AE episodes. COPD 
has, 
intra- 
in fact, shown high clinical and functional 
individual variability [36] which may reduce the ability of 
one-dimensional models to recognize a wide range of 
events (i.e., worsening dyspnea, reduced number of steps 
per day, etc) associated to an AECOPD. Third, our trial 
was not powered for the outcome of hospitalization. 
The study produced an interesting result in that it dem- 
onstrated that the use of TM was associated with a lower 
rate of hospital readmission for AECOPD and/or any 
cause during the first 30 days after hospitalisation [IRR: 
0,43 (0,19–0,98); p = 0.04 and 0,46 (0,24–0,89); p = 0.02, 
respectively]. In view of the fact that early readmissions 
are a common occurrence in patients with COPD, which 
are estimated between 8 and 21.8% of the total number of 
hospitalizations, and reducing their frequency is consid- 
ered a high priority of health care organizations [37, 38], 
study results suggest that TM could be used as an early 
follow-up care after hospital discharge of COPD patients 
until the risk of readmission has receded. 
A number of limitations pertaining to this study should 
be mentioned. First, although COPD has been recently 
regarded as a heterogeneous disease characterized by high 
phenotype variability [37], phenotypic distinctions in the 
patients were not considered during the randomization 
process. In particular, since patients’ history of previous 
exacerbations was unavailable, we cannot exclude the pos- 
sibility that the distribution of “frequent exacerbators” was 
unbalanced between the groups, with a confounding effect 
on the impact of TM on HRQL. “Frequent exacerbators” 
have, in fact, been recognized as a distinct clinical sub- 
group characterized by poorer HRQL as a result of a high 
exacerbation rate irrespective of the degree of airflow limi- 
tation [39]. Second, it was impossible to blind the study 
population and personnel to treatment allocation, given 
the intervention’s interactive nature. 
Conclusions 
Despite its limitations, the study provides useful infor- 
mation for healthcare professionals who are examining 
the possibility of utilizing TM to optimize AECOPD 
management. The study’s most important findings and 
conclusions can be summarized as follows: 

improve patients’ HRQL in a health care context 
where care standards are high and medical services 
are well established; 

effective in reducing hospitalizations, which is the 
major factor driving up the healthcare cost of COPD 
patients; 

during the hospital-to-home transition, improving 
outcomes among patients discharged after an AE 
episode. 
In the light of these findings, we would conclude that 
use of TM to manage AE should not be generalized 
across of the entire population of COPD patients and 
efforts should be made to identify specific subgroups 
that could most benefit from telehealthcare.
