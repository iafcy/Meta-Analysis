Context—Lung cancer patients experience multiple, simultaneous symptoms related to their 
disease and treatment that impair functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Computer 
technology can reduce barriers to nonsystematic, infrequent symptom assessment and potentially 
contribute to improved patient care. 
Objectives—To evaluate the efficacy of technology-based symptom monitoring and reporting in 
reducing symptom burden in patients with advanced lung cancer. 
Methods—This was a prospective, multisite, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Two hundred 
fifty-three patients were enrolled at three sites and randomized to monitoring and reporting (MR) 
or monitoring alone (MA). Patients completed questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks and 
symptom surveys via interactive voice response (IVR) weekly for 12 weeks. MR patients’ 
clinically significant symptom scores generated an e-mail alert to the site nurse for management. 
The primary endpoint was overall symptom burden; secondary endpoints included HRQL, 
treatment satisfaction, symptom management barriers, and self-efficacy. 
Results—This RCT failed to demonstrate efficacy of symptom monitoring and reporting in 
reducing symptom burden compared with monitoring alone in lung cancer. HRQL declined over 
12 weeks in both groups (P<0.006 to P<0.025); at week 12, treatment satisfaction was higher in 
MA than MR patients (P<0.012, P<0.027). Adherence to weekly calls was good (82%) and patient 
satisfaction was high. 
Conclusion—Feasibility of using a technology-based system for systematic symptom 
monitoring in advanced lung cancer patients was demonstrated. Future research should focus on

telemonitoring 

Patients with advanced lung cancer face a shortened life expectancy and typically 
experience multiple, simultaneous, debilitating symptoms related to their disease and its 
treatment. In addition to impairing patients’ daily functioning and health-related quality of 
life (HRQL) (1), unrecognized or poorly controlled symptoms can cause emergency 
department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for management as well as decreased treatment 
efficacy (2, 3). Outpatient chemotherapy is usually administered over several months, with 
office visits scheduled two to four weeks apart. As a result, many symptoms emerge 
between scheduled clinic appointments (4, 5), which creates challenges for the effective and 
timely monitoring and management of symptoms. 
There are many patient, provider and health system barriers to adequate symptom 
management (1, 6). Two widely reported barriers are inadequate or nonsystematic symptom 
assessment (6–10) and limited patient-provider communication about symptoms (1, 11, 12). 
Clinicians vary in their ability to elicit information about patient symptoms (13–16) and 
systematically underestimate them (17–20). Patients often forget to report important medical 
information (21, 22) and fail to accurately report symptom levels (23). Systematic symptom 
assessment and reporting to the provider is associated with reduced symptom distress (24, 
25), better pain control (26, 27) and improved, more focused symptom communication (6, 
28, 29). 
Advances in health information technology (HIT) enable routine, systematic assessment of 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs; e.g., symptoms and HRQL) that can be conducted from 
home, between office visits, with minimal burden (5, 6, 30). Technology-based monitoring 
is feasible and well-accepted by patients (31–36), improves patient-provider communication 
(37– 39), and focuses attention on priority symptoms (39–45). 
We elected to use telephone-based interactive voice response (IVR) technology for our 
Symptom Monitoring and Reporting System for Lung Cancer (SyMon-L) because of the 
telephone’s widespread adoption and familiarity. In our observational, single institution pilot 
study (46), we found IVR monitoring to be feasible and acceptable to patients, which also 
has been demonstrated by others (47–56). This paper describes a multisite, prospective, 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating whether technology-based weekly symptom 
monitoring and automated reporting of problematic symptoms to the clinical team reduces 
on-treatment symptom burden of people with advanced lung cancer compared with 
monitoring alone (i.e., with no reporting to the clinical team). We hypothesized that SyMon- 
L monitoring and reporting, a more active intervention, would reduce symptom burden to a 
greater extent than a more passive monitoring intervention by facilitating timely care 



management realized because of early problem identification and intervention, with 
secondary benefit to HRQL, treatment satisfaction, perceived barriers to symptom 
management, and self-efficacy. 


Following approval by the research site institutional review boards, we enrolled ambulatory 
patients with advanced (Stage III or IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell 
lung cancer (SCLC) in a non-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of technology-based 
symptom monitoring with reporting (MR group) to the clinical team compared with 
symptom monitoring alone (MA group). Both groups monitored their symptoms weekly; 
they differed in two respects: (1) automated delivery of reports of clinically significant 
symptoms of the MR group to their clinical team for further assessment and/or management; 
and (2) availability of paper copies of longitudinal, graphical displays of symptom scores to 
MR patients and their clinical teams at scheduled clinic visits. 
We hypothesized that the mechanism by which symptom burden would be reduced is earlier 
reporting of clinically significant symptoms to the clinical team. Thus, we originally 
proposed also to evaluate the time-to-spontaneous reporting of any clinically significant 
symptom by MA patients to the clinical team, which required that we assess their weekly 
symptom burden, as we did with MR patients. However, discussions with nursing staff prior 
to RCT implementation indicated that this would not be feasible because of the demands of 
and delays in documenting patients’ phone calls, so this endpoint was dropped. 
The primary endpoint was symptom burden over 12 weeks, as defined by a measure of 
symptom distress. We also hypothesized that the MR intervention would result in reduced 
patient-perceived barriers to symptom management and increased patient self-efficacy, 
HRQL, and satisfaction with treatment relative to the MA condition, which were 
conceptualized as secondary endpoints. If SyMon-L was effective in reducing symptom 
burden, reductions in some types of health care utilization also might be expected, although 
some types of utilization also may increase. Thus, health care utilization was included as an 
exploratory endpoint. The clinical interventions undertaken in response to alerts (MR only) 
and scheduled clinic visits (MR and MA) were documented as an additional exploratory 
endpoint. 
After providing informed consent, participants completed baseline measures and were 
randomly assigned by computer in a 1:1 ratio to the MR or the MA group. Randomization 
was blocked, stratified by institution, with a goal of enrolling 100 participants from each of 
the three sites (total N=300), 150 in each group. 
All participants selected a day for their weekly IVR calls. After entering their study PIN, 
they completed a 13-item symptom survey (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy 
[FACT] – Lung Symptom Index [FLSI] (57) by entering a response from 1 to 5 (“not at all” 
to “very much”) using the telephone keypad. They received reminder calls on two 



consecutive days after their selected day if they failed to call. This survey was completed 
weekly for 12 weeks. 
For MR participants, any responses meeting a pre-defined threshold for a symptom “alert” 
generated an e-mail to the site nurse. Based on results from a previous standard setting 
exercise (unpublished), we set a conservative threshold of “quite a bit” or “very much” or a 
two-point worsening from the previous week. A site nurse contacted the participants within 
one business day to assess the symptom and provide clinical care as warranted. Paper copies 
of longitudinal graphs of symptom and HRQL scores were provided to physicians and MR 
participants at scheduled visits, approximately every three weeks, with the intent of 
facilitating discussion between physicians and patients, but their use was not further 
prescribed or monitored. All participants completed additional assessments at 3, 6, 9 and 12 
weeks post-baseline (see Measures). 

Clinics at the three sites participating in this study reflected differences in organization and 
staffing, but all physicians who treated lung cancer at each of the sites were enrolled along 
with one or more designated clinical staff. Provider participants at one academic medical 
center included the sole thoracic oncologist, one registered nurse (RN) and physician 
assistant; at the second academic medical center, provider participants included all three 
thoracic oncologists and one RN. At the county public hospital, five medical oncologists, 
nine oncology fellows and one RN participated in the study. 
During initial face-to-face meetings with participating providers at all sites, the study team 
provided training on all aspects of the study protocol, including providers’ roles and 
responsibilities. The training included interpretation of the symptom graphs (e.g., color- 
coded symptom “alerts”; interpreting high versus low scores) but did not include a 
prescription for how symptoms should be managed. 

Patient participants were enrolled at the three sites described above. Eligibility criteria 
included: being at least 18 years old, English-speaking, having advanced NSCLC or SCLC, 
receiving active treatment with traditional chemotherapy no later than Day 1 of Cycle 2 or 
receiving oral therapy, having access to a telephone and life expectancy of at least six 
months. 

Sociodemographic and Clinical Information—Participant sociodemographic and 
clinical information was collected at baseline. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
Performance Status Rating (ECOG PSR) (58) was obtained from participants and providers 
at baseline and each assessment. 
Primary Endpoint—Different measures were used for the primary endpoint and the 
weekly symptom measure to avoid potential training effects. Overall symptom burden was 
measured by the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS) (59, 60). Higher scores reflect greater 



distress, with scores ranging from 13 to 65. In addition to established reliability and validity 
(59, 60), brevity, and symptom congruence with the FLSI, the SDS was selected because its 
scoring yields a total symptom distress score. 
Weekly Symptom Assessment: The FLSI was developed by surveying oncologists about 
priority advanced lung cancer symptoms and concerns(57) and includes general cancer and 
pulmonary symptoms, side effect bother, emotional distress, and contentment with HRQL. 

HRQL: The FACT-General (FACT-G) (61) is a 27-item questionnaire measuring Physical 
Well-Being (PWB), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB), Emotional Well-Being (EWB), and 
Functional Well-Being (FWB). It is a well-validated and widely used measure of HRQL (61, 
62). 
Treatment Satisfaction: Satisfaction with treatment was measured with the Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Treatment Satisfaction-Patient Satisfaction (FACIT- 
TS-PS) (63, 64), with a focus on the Explanations, Interpersonal, Comprehensive Care, and 
Decision-Making subscales. 
Patient-Perceived Barriers to Symptom Management: The Symptom Management 
Barriers Questionnaire (SMBQ) is a modification of previous barriers questionnaires (11, 
15), and assesses patient attitudinal barriers to symptom management. 
Self-Efficacy: A 27-item measure was developed by study investigators to optimize its fit 
with the particular domains of interest in this study (65), specifically, self-efficacy related to 
patient-physician communication, health behaviors and knowledge about accessing care. 
Clinical Activity: Using primarily the medical record supplemented by provider query, the 
research assistant documented any of 11 clinical management activities (e.g., diagnostic test, 
referral) by symptom that were undertaken at each scheduled oncologist visit (MR and MA) 
and in response to alerts (MR only). 
Medical Care Utilization: Participants completed a checklist of medical care utilization 
episodes, including unscheduled clinic visits, ED visits, hospitalizations, and calls to 
physicians and nurses at each oncologist visit. 
Participant and Provider Perceptions of SyMon-L: End-of-study surveys of participants 
and providers captured perceptions of usability and usefulness of the SyMon-L system. 

SDS, ECOG PSR, medical utilization, and clinical activity assessments were completed at 
weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12 post-baseline; FACT-G, FACIT-TS-PS and self-efficacy assessments 
were completed at weeks 6 and 12; and SMBQ and end-of study evaluations were 
completed at week 12. Most data were collected from participants using a touchscreen tablet 
PC; some data were obtained via interview by the research assistant and entered into the 
tablet PC. 





Interim Analyses—To ensure that the intervention had not harmed patients, a blinded 
interim analysis of symptom severity and study burden data was planned after half of the 
randomized patients (N=150) had reached the Week 12 assessment, and this analysis was 
reviewed by the institutional cancer center data and safety monitoring board (DSMB). 
Main Analyses—The study was powered to detect a difference between the two study 
groups in SDS total score. For this endpoint, a standardized effect size (mean group 
difference/common standard deviation) of 0.33 has been suggested to be meaningful in the 
measurement of PROs in several different cancer populations (61, 66–71). 
Secondary endpoints included the FACT-G, FACIT-TS-PS, SMBQ, self-efficacy, and 
medical utilization counts, assessed at multiple time points. Effect sizes considered 
meaningful for the secondary PRO endpoints included 0.40 for the FACT-G (72), 0.45 for 
the FACIT-TS-PS (73, 74), and 0.33–0.45 for the barriers and self-efficacy endpoints (75). 
To achieve 80% power to detect these effects, using a two-sided significance level, α=0.05, 
a sample size of at least 146 per group was required (76, 77). Based on our pilot study with 
over 100 participants, we had a 0% refusal to participate and less than a 15% rate of 
withdrawal during the study. Thus, we projected a 17% withdrawal rate in the 12-week RCT 
and increased the accrual goal to 360 (180 in each group), 120 at each site. 
Analyses were based on intention-to-treat in all randomized participants and were not 
adjusted for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). 
The primary endpoint was estimated by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the 
total SDS score plotted over time for each participant. Interpolation between non-missing 
observations was used if intermediate assessments were missing. Study drop-outs were 
either assigned a value of the worst possible score in the case of death, or worst or last 
observed score, depending on reason for dropping out. The AUC was then divided by the 
total time to rescale back to the original units. A general linear model was used to compare 
study groups on the primary endpoint adjusted for baseline SDS. 
For secondary endpoints, t-tests were used to compare PRO scores between groups at 
baseline and subsequent time points. 


Interim analyses (N=150) showed no difference between groups in the rate of drop-out, 
sociodemographic or clinical information, FACT-G, FLSI, or SDS. Questions reflecting 
participant burden revealed no differences in satisfaction with symptom management, 



perceived benefit of participation, willingness to use SyMon-L, or frequency of preferred 
use. 
Because the rate of enrollment was slower than anticipated, we conducted futility analyses 
as part of the planned interim analyses. The conditional power was calculated under the 
original assumptions and under the observed data (78, 79). The unconditional power to 
detect a hypothesized effect size of 0.33 as statistically significant, given the sample size 
(N=150), was 51%, and the conditional power was estimated to be 3.8%. Computing the 
conditional power under the empirical treatment effect yielded an estimate of 0.3%. That is, 
if the observed trend in the data was true, we had less than a 1% chance of a statistically 
significant difference at the end of the trial (78, 79). Enrollment was continued to the extent 
permitted by funding to a final total sample size of 253. 

Fig. 1 summarizes the participant flow. Of 411 eligible participants approached, 253 were 
enrolled and randomized. The overall refusal rate was 40%, ranging from 28% at the public 
hospital to 44–45% at the other two sites. There were no significant differences in 
sociodemographic characteristics between those who agreed and those who refused to 
participate. 
The study groups were equivalent in baseline characteristics (Table 1) and PROs (Table 2). 
However, participants treated at the public hospital reported worse ECOG PSR (P<0.001) 
and were more likely to be receiving first-line chemotherapy (P=0.006) than those at the 
other two sites. 
Over the course of the study, 35 participants withdrew (13.8%; 20 MA, 15 MR, P=0.463). 
Compliance with completion of weekly symptom monitoring phone calls was 82.1% (83.4% 
MA, 80.8% MR). 

There was no difference between groups in mean SDS AUC, adjusted for baseline (MA 
mean=25.5, SD=8.3; MR mean=25.3, SD=8.5; P=0.505). 

There were no differences between groups in FACT-G subscales or total score at any time 
point, although in the combined sample (MR and MA), PWB, FWB and FACT-G total 
scores declined significantly over the 12 weeks (P<0.008, P<0.006, P<0.025, respectively). 
There was no difference between groups on the total FACIT-TS-PS score at any time point, 
but the MR group had lower scores (i.e., lower satisfaction) than the MA group on the 
Comprehensive Care (perceptions of having concerns understood; P=0.012) and Decision 
Making (receiving adequate information, time and support; P=0.027) subscales at week 12. 
There were no differences over time or between groups in self-efficacy or perceived 
barriers. 



The symptoms reported most frequently at an alert level for the combined group were 
fatigue, poor appetite, difficulty breathing, and treatment side effect bother, as displayed in 
Fig. 2. There were 6078 symptom responses meeting the alert threshold during the study. 

Medical Utilization—There were no significant differences between groups in any of the 
medical utilization variables except that MR participants reported making more phone calls 
to nurses than MA participants (P=0.022), as displayed in Table 3. 
Clinical Activity—Clinical interventions were documented for MA participants for 
scheduled clinic visits only, whereas for MR participants, interventions were documented in 
response to system-generated alerts and scheduled clinic visits. In addition, some MR alerts 
were generated the day before or day of a clinic visit and addressed at the time of the clinic 
visit, so those interventions were documented as “both.” Table 4 displays the counts of 
interventions provided for the two groups in response to visits and/or alerts. MR group 
participants received a total of 1323 interventions in response to alerts (Table 5). Over the 
course of the 12-week study, a given MR participant may have received an intervention for 
dyspnea or emotional distress up to 15 times; similarly, a given MR participant may have 
received an education/counseling or additional follow-up visit up to 32 or 48 times, 
respectively. 
Participant and Provider Study Evaluations—Ninety-two percent of the full 
participant sample reported no problems using the telephone for weekly surveys, and 86% 
indicated it was (“very much”/“quite a bit”) convenient. SyMon-L improved communication 
with their doctor (46%), helped focus on important issues (49%), and revealed additional 
issues that may not have been discussed otherwise (38%); 93% indicated they would use the 
system if it was part of their care. 
Because of missing data from providers because of schedule constraints, individual 
semistructured interviews were subsequently conducted with providers, which will be 
reported separately. 

In response to the null findings, we sought to maximize our understanding of the data and 
conducted additional, unplanned exploratory analyses. 
Given the challenge of achieving reduction in overall symptom burden in the presence of 
multiple simultaneous symptoms in advanced disease, we used AUC analyses of individual 
SDS items for which there are efficacious treatments: nausea, pain, breathing/cough. There 
were no differences in AUCs (adjusted for baseline) for these symptoms, with effect sizes 
less than one-tenth of a standard deviation (P=0.595, P=0.927, P=0.934, respectively). 
Whereas the SDS was completed approximately every three weeks, the FLSI was 
administered weekly. Because symptom burden may have changed more frequently than 
could have been detected by the SDS, and imputations for missing SDS data might have 
resulted in an underestimation of symptom burden, we examined symptom burden using the 



FLSI total score and the FLSI Pulmonary Symptom Index (PSI: sum of four pulmonary 
items). These AUC analyses indicated no difference in symptom burden between the groups 
for the total score (P=0.246) or PSI (P=0.563), again with effect sizes of one-tenth of a 
standard deviation or less. 
To examine potential responders and nonresponders to symptom management, change 
scores from baseline were calculated for the 12 FLSI time points and classified as improved, 
worsened or unchanged based on the four-point minimally important difference (80). The 
proportion of participants in each change group was compared between groups at each week 
using Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square tests for ordinal data. There were no differences between 
groups in any of the classification groups (P range=0.117 to 0.862). 

Our RCT of an active monitoring and reporting intervention failed to demonstrate efficacy 
in reducing symptom burden when compared with a more passive monitoring intervention in 
patients with advanced lung cancer. The hypotheses of benefits to HRQL, treatment 
satisfaction, self-efficacy and perceived symptom management burden also were not 
supported. However, the trial demonstrated that the SyMon-L intervention is feasible and 
well accepted by patients. 
Although the two groups did not differ in terms of their total FACIT-TS-PS scores, the MR 
group reported lower satisfaction with two elements of treatment (e.g., having concerns 
understood, receiving decision making support) than MA participants. An unexpected 
finding, one possible explanation of this is that the MR intervention may have elevated 
expectations about their symptom care beyond what patients experienced. 
There was no difference between the groups in number of hospitalizations, ED visits, 
unscheduled clinic visits or calls to physicians, but the MR group reported more calls to 
nurses. Based on anecdotal reports from research assistants, we suspect that, contrary to 
instructions, participants may have recollected calls from nurses in response to MR alerts. 
One of the exploratory endpoints in this pragmatic RCT was the symptom-focused clinical 
interventions provided to MA and MR participants. This proved to be complex, both in 
terms of implementing the data collection and in its analysis and interpretation. We were not 
able to document interventions for MA participants in response to any interactions beyond 
scheduled clinic visits (e.g., patient-initiated calls), so our count of interventions provided to 
these participants is likely an underestimate. Furthermore, it is not possible to disentangle 
MR interventions categorized as “both” (i.e., alert or visit), which limits our interpretation of 
this data. As a result, we are not able to ascertain if one group received more clinical 
interventions than the other. It does appear that the information provided by MR 
participants’ alerts was acted upon, based on the 1323 interventions (plus some unknown 
percent from “both”) provided. There is some degree of overlap between the symptom-based 
interventions provided in response to alerts (e.g., dyspnea, emotional distress, appetite, pain, 
coughing) and the symptoms generating the most alerts (fatigue, appetite, breathing easily, 
treatment side effect bother), but the overlap is not perfect. These observations, along with 



considerably higher numbers of specific types of interventions (e.g., education/counseling, 
additional follow-up visits), suggest potential areas of focus for future research. Thus, 
although this endpoint is limited in aiding interpretation of current findings, it may inform 
hypotheses for future research 
RCTs of technology-based PRO monitoring in oncology have demonstrated acceptability to 
patients (38, 81, 82); improved well-being (38); and reduced post-operative symptom 
severity (32). Our weekly call compliance rate of 82% and the findings of others (33) 
suggest that patients with advanced cancers are capable of using such symptom monitoring 
systems, contrary to the concerns of some (34, 38, 83). However, the majority of RCTs and 
other studies provide limited evidence of efficacy in achieving improvements in symptom or 
health status (36, 84). Another RCT of lung cancer patients, randomized to standard care or 
paper HRQL diaries completed over 16 weeks with encouragement to share information 
with providers, showed small but non-significant negative effects on HRQL for patients in 
the diary group and no effect on satisfaction with care or communication (85). 
A recent editorial commenting on the null findings of an RCT of telemonitoring in older 
adults at high risk for hospitalization (86), cautioned against discounting the study’s 
findings, as the effectiveness of “telehealth” programs may be context- and outcome- 
dependent, mediated by factors specific to the intervention implementation and its 
evaluation metrics (87). It is in the spirit of attempting to understand null findings from the 
perspective of context and implementation that we offer potential explanations for our study 
as a guide for future research. 
We failed to meet our accrual goal of enrolling 300 participants. Although there were early 
delays in technology development, we believe the primary reason was a much higher than 
anticipated refusal rate for the RCT (28–45%) compared with our pilot study (0%). Other 
symptom/HRQL monitoring RCTs also have found high rates of refusal and attrition (85). 
We anticipated distinct differences in patient populations between the pilot and RCT sites 
but clearly underestimated the magnitude of potential refusals, especially at the two medical 
center sites. One possibility is that a study requiring active patient participation over a 
prolonged period of time (12 weeks) represents an overwhelming burden for some who are 
struggling to cope with advanced disease. We have anecdotal reports that clinic wait-times 
at the public hospital are considerably longer than at the academic medical center sites, 
possibly accounting for the lower refusal rate at that site. No other explanation for the 
discrepancy is immediately apparent, but requirements for successfully implementing such 
studies, such as an expanded data collection period, warrant further evaluation and 
consideration in future studies. 
Our intervention failed to impact symptom burden over the 12-week study period. 
Sensitivity and frequency of administration of the outcome measure are two possible 
explanations. However, evaluation of the endpoint using a different, weekly symptom 
measure also found no differences. Some have suggested that patients with advanced lung 
cancer experience symptom variability warranting daily assessment (88), but we have no 
data to support this as an explanation for our findings. It may be unrealistic to achieve 
reduction in symptom burden in advanced lung cancer, where some disease or treatment 



symptoms are controlled as others emerge with disease progression (89). Whereas some 
symptoms lack effective treatment (e.g., fatigue), we also did not find evidence of reduced 
burden when we examined symptoms for which there is efficacious treatment. Finally, the 
threshold for generating an alert was standardized across symptoms, whereas some have 
suggested that each symptom threshold should be set and validated independently (88). As 
designed, the system generated a significant number of alerts (>1323) for MR participants, 
which could have resulted in alert “fatigue,” distraction or being overwhelmed with 
information without prescriptive guidelines. Further research that obtains clinicians’ input 
on preferences for clinically actionable symptom alert thresholds may inform the design of 
future symptom monitoring studies. This also may argue for simple, straightforward, 
targeted interventions augmented with practice-changing recommendations (37, 38, 90, 91). 
For weekly symptom data collection, we used telephone-based technology because of 
widespread accessibility (92). An auditory-based assessment also offers advantages for those 
with limited reading skills. Nevertheless, measurement error could have been introduced 
through patients’ mishearing or misremembering response choices or misentering responses. 
It also is possible that some patients were not comfortable communicating about their 
symptoms using technology, as opposed to a live conversation. 
The review of interim analyses suggested no harm to study participants, but we cannot 
exclude this possibility, given that the MA group reported more favorable treatment 
satisfaction. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons, so there is no way to know if these 
results are artifacts of multiple comparisons or real differences, and they should be 
interpreted cautiously until replicated in other studies. 
Whereas a strength of this study was randomization to intervention groups, a limitation was 
the lack of a placebo control group, which has been criticized as a shortcoming of most 
studies in HRQL/symptom management (89). This trial was originally designed to allow us 
to test whether using technology to initiate and accelerate the reporting of problematic 
symptoms could reduce symptom burden. Unfortunately, we were not able to capture data 
on the time of first report by MA participants of any clinically significant symptom to the 
team. Our experience from a previous RCT of mixed cancer patients (including lung), 
demonstrated that assessment alone had no impact on HRQL or treatment satisfaction (91). 
Other similar findings (37, 38) have suggested that information obtained by assessment 
without direct, immediate feedback to clinicians may not be acted upon by patients or 
utilized by the medical team, although some studies of computer-based monitoring in 
oncology have demonstrated symptom benefit in the absence of providing feedback to 
providers (38, 84, 93, 94). In the current study, even though we augmented passive 
monitoring with more active feedback to clinicians, one strong possibility is that the MA 
group experienced an enhancement of symptom awareness that may have increased the 
likelihood they would report those symptoms to the clinical team, thereby reducing the 
magnitude of a detectable benefit associated with using the full SyMon-L intervention. Our 
findings suggest that further research is required to determine if an even more active version 
of the intervention is required to effect changes in clinical endpoints, such as symptom 
management guidelines for providers and/or patients, as others have suggested is important 
for effective use of PRO data (37, 38, 90, 91). 



In addition to the limitations discussed above, we randomized at the patient level, rather than 
physician or site, because of the scope and logistical constraints, including the small number 
of physician participants. We recognize that exposure to the intervention may have affected 
physicians’ discussion/management with patients in the MA group, although they did not 
have access to the symptom reports or study data and previous research has documented the 
difficulty in changing physician behavior (7, 95–97). A cross-over design was not deemed 
practical because, with advanced disease, it seemed likely that outcomes in the first period 
would differentially affect outcomes in the second period. 
Especially as cancer treatments are increasingly delivered in outpatient and primary care 
settings, it is important to continue to develop and evaluate efficient and acceptable ways of 
monitoring patients’ symptoms and well-being while they are away from the clinic. Some 
have suggested that standard clinical cancer care should now include electronic patient 
interfaces that allow symptom reporting (98). Our data and experience support the 
conclusion that a technology-based symptom monitoring and reporting system can be easy 
to use and well-received by patients. However, this field is profoundly in need of research 
focused on identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from such a system, and the 
other patient, provider and health system contextual factors that are likely to contribute to 
successful adoption, use and improvements in clinical care (98).
