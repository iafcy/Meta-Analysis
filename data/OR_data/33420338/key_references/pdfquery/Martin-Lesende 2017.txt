The growing prevalence of chronic health problems and 
the pressing need for efficient healthcare resources are 
encouraging the adoption of new effective primary care 
models. Among such models, home telemonitoring of 
patients with chronic diseases could offer a possible 
solution. The telemonitoring of patients in a home set- 
ting involves the remote transmission of patient clinical 
data, allowing subsequent examination by healthcare 
professionals. Such flow of frequent clinical information 
may facilitate the patient follow-up and enables deci- 
sion making which in turn, could lead to faster

ABSTRACT 
Background: Recent evidence indicates that home telemonitoring of chronic patients reduces 
the use of healthcare resources. However, further studies exploring this issue are needed in pri- 
mary care. 
Objectives: To assess the impact of a primary care-based home telemonitoring intervention for 
highly unstable chronic patients on the use of healthcare resources. 
Methods: A one-year follow-up before and after exploratory study, without control group, was 
conducted. Housebound patients with heart failure or chronic lung disease, with recurrent hos- 
pital admissions, were included. The intervention consisted of patient’s self-measurements and 
responses to a health status questionnaire, sent daily from smartphones to a web-platform 
(aided by an alert system) reviewed by healthcare professionals. The primary outcome measure 
was the number of hospital admissions occurring 12 months before and after the intervention. 
Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and number of emergency department attend- 
ances. Primary care nurses were mainly in charge of the telemonitoring process and were 
assisted by the general practitioners when required. 
Results: For the 28 patients who completed the follow-up (out of 42 included, 13 patients died 
and 1 discontinued the intervention), a significant reduction in hospitalizations, from 2.6 admis- 
sions/patient in the previous year (standard deviation, SD: 1.6) to 1.1 (SD: 1.5) during the one- 
telemonitoring follow-up (P <0.001), and emergency department attendances, 
from 
year 
4.2 (SD: 2.6) to 2.1 (SD: 2.6) (P <0.001) was observed. The length of hospital stay was reduced 
non-significantly from 11.4 to 7.9 days. 
Conclusion: In this small exploratory study, the primary care-based telemonitoring intervention 
seemed to have a positive impact decreasing the number of hospital admissions and emergency 
department attendances. 


interventions and avoidance of hospital admissions and 
use of other healthcare resources. This approach has 
been most widely applied in heart failure (HF) and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Several randomized controlled trials (RCT) and sys- 
tematic reviews with or without meta-analyses [1–10] 
have been recently published regarding the utility of 
telemonitoring in reducing hospital admissions and 
mortality [1,2,4,8,9] 
in HF, and in decreasing admis- 
sions in COPD patients [7,10]. The effect in emergency 
department attendances has been less explored or 
there is less evidence regarding this outcome measure. 
Among the randomized clinical trials, the ‘whole sys- 
tem demonstrator’ (WSD) deserves a special mention, 
because of its size (3230 patients with diabetes, COPD 
or HF were included), its practical nature (179 primary 
care centres were involved) and the impact on mortal- 
ity, number of emergency department attendances, 
and number of hospital admissions, showing reduc- 
tions of 45%, 20% and 11%, 
respectively [11,12]. 
However, 
the telemonitoring experiences managed 
from primary care are still scarce [13], despite the fact 
that chronic patients can receive routine care through 
this level of assistance and implementation of such 
technology in primary care has been associated with 
higher efficiency and lower costs compared to the 
hospital level [14,15]. 
In the previous TELBIL RCT [14,16], the assessment 
of a primary care-based telemonitoring intervention 
showed a significant decrease in healthcare resources 
use [14]. 
In 2012, the TELBIL-A study was launched, 
consisting of an implementation of the previous strat- 
egy and further evaluation of the adapted telemonitor- 
ing intervention. Marked changes were made seeking 
to improve the benefits of the remote monitoring and, 
at the same time, fully integrating the process within 
actual clinical primary care practice. A high level of 
acceptance and satisfaction with the TELBIL-A inter- 
vention was observed among both patients/relatives 
and healthcare professionals [17,18]. 
The objective of the present exploratory study was 
to assess the influence of a primary care-based home 
telemonitoring intervention for highly unstable (com- 
plex) chronic patients, within routine clinical practice, 
on healthcare resource use (i.e. hospital admissions 
and emergency department attendances). 

the study (open recruitment of patients during the first 
year) was from mid-February 2012 to mid-February 
2014, with an individual follow-up per patient of one 
year, from the inclusion date up to the following year. 
Figure 1 summarizes the general project design. 
The study was conducted in the urban-based 
Bilbao-Basurto Integrated Healthcare Organization 
(IHO), with a catchment population of around 384 000 
people. This IHO included a referral hospital and 25 
primary healthcare centres (PHC), with 230 general 
practitioners (GPs) and 320 nurses. 
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee 
for Scientific Research (Basurto University Hospital, 
Bizkaia) 
(19 October 2011) and the Primary Care 
the Basque Health Service 
Research Committee of 
(Osakidetza) (18 October 2011). Patients/relatives gave 
written informed consent prior to participating in the 
study. 

Inclusion criteria. Adult housebound patients (with 
great difficulty or inability to leave their home) with 
HF and/or chronic lung disease (CLD) (mainly COPD 
and a few of them with asthma), with a history of at 
least two hospital admissions in the previous year (and 
at least one of them due to the aforementioned condi- 
tions) were included in the study. These were also the 
patient inclusion criteria in the TELBIL RCT. 
For newly included patients, those who as well as 
having HF and/or CLD, had markedly impaired func- 
index <60) due to concomitant 
tional status (Barthel 
chronic conditions and had two hospital admissions in 
the previous year or, alternatively, had several emer- 
gency department attendances or hospital admissions 
in recent years could also be included in the study. 
Owing to the specific inclusion conditions and com- 
plexity of the patients, and based on previous records 
and lists used in the TELBIL RCT, we estimated that 
there would be approximately 80 eligible patients in 
the Bilbao-Basurto IHO. According to the ambulatory 
care group-predictive modelling (ACG-PM) stratification 
[19], 27.6% of patients included in our study were 
labelled as ‘complex patients’ coinciding with the tip 
of the Kaiser Permanente pyramid. The majority of 
them, however, were above the aforementioned level, 
giving an indication of 
the high complexity and 
instability of the sample studied.

study, without a control group. The overall length of

The telemonitoring consisted of daily self-monitoring

from the patient’s home using smartphones to a spe-

ing the patient’s perception of his/her medical and

the TELBIL study [14]. A 25% loss to follow-up was

To assess the influence on healthcare resources use

assumption was met; otherwise, the Wilcoxon signed- 
rank test was used. 

A total of 42 patients were enrolled, 15 of which 
belonged to the IG of the TELBIL RCT and 27 were 
newly recruited (two patients were included by the 
APN). Two patients, out of the 27 newly recruited par- 
ticipants, had a severely impaired functional status 
index <60. These two patients had

serious deterioration of their functional status: one 
had morbid obesity and HF and the other had had a

and one had advanced mental 
impairment). Twenty- 
eight patients completed the 12-month follow-up,

coming from the IG of the TELBIL RCT and those newly 
recruited. The mean age was 78.9 (SD 7.5) years 
and 57.8% were women; 14.3% of patients had HF 
and 23.8% CLD while 57.2% had both conditions 
concurrently. 
No variable showed significant differences among 
patients lost to follow-up and patients who completed 
the study (data not shown). Homogeneity between 
participants coming from the IG of the preceding trial 
and newly recruited patients was satisfied for all base- 
line characteristics. 

The results of the before and after analysis are shown 
in Table 3. Statistically significant reductions in all- 
cause and condition-specific hospital admissions and 
emergency department attendances were found. The 
mean length of hospital stay was decreased by 3.5 
days, though statistical significance was not reached. 
Considering the specific pathologies, when both 
(CLD and HF) coexisted in the same patient who com- 
pleted the year of follow-up (n ¼ 16), there were sig- 
nificant differences in all-causes of hospital admissions, 
mean 2.8 (SD: 1.5) versus 1.1 (SD: 1.8) (P ¼ 0.017), and 
in the emergency department attendances not fol- 
lowed by hospital admissions, 2.3 (SD: 2.1) versus 0.9 
(SD: 1.4) (P ¼ 0.009); but not in condition-specific hos- 
pital admissions (P ¼ 0.091). Only a very small number 
of patients had one of the two pathologies exclusively 
(eight patients had CLD and four had HF). 


Hospital admissions. The results of this small exploratory 
study appear to show that the impact of the interven- 
tion on the reduction of hospital admissions and emer- 
gency department attendances seemed to be greater 
than in the previous TELBIL RCT [14], probably due to 
the positive influence of the modifications made to the 
intervention. The before and after analysis, showed a 
statistically significant decrease in the number of hos- 
pital admissions during the 12-month telemonitoring 
period compared to the previous year. This finding is in 
agreement with other studies [3,6–10,12,20]. 

Emergency department attendances. Moreover, a sig- 
nificant decrease in the number of emergency depart- 
ment attendances was observed. Specifically, the mean 
from 4.2 in the 
number of 
12-month period before telemonitoring to 2.1 during 
the 12-month follow-up. A similar decrease was also 
noted in other studies, such as the WSD project, which 
reported a 20% reduction [12], although there is con- 
siderably less published evidence regarding this out- 
come measure. Nevertheless, 
the percentage of 
emergency department attendances without subse- 
quent hospital admissions increased, which could be a 
positive indicator, since a higher percentage of emer- 
gency department attendances 
could have been 
solved without the need for admission. 
Length of hospital stay. A notable reduction of 
length of the hospital stays was noticed, which, des- 
pite not being statistically significant, was consistent 
with other telemonitoring studies of patients with HF 
or COPD [2,12,13]. 
In the present study, the mean 
length of stay decreased by 3.5 days after telemonitor- 
ing, which could have had a substantial impact both 
on the quality of life of the patients/relatives and on 
the costs associated with hospitalization. Such a reduc- 
tion of hospital stay could be due to the early detec- 
tion and treatment of exacerbating factors. 
Satisfaction of professionals and patients. In addition 
to the positive impact on the use of healthcare resour- 
ces, the high level of satisfaction of the healthcare 
professionals and patients/relatives with the telemoni- 
toring in the TELBIL-A study constitutes a key factor 
that may influence the successful uptake of such inter- 
ventions [17,18]. Other studies have also shown that 
healthcare professionals are generally satisfied with 
telemedicine activities when they are closely involved 
[21–23], although results are not consistent [24,25]. 

Unlike the preceding TELBIL study, a RCT focused on 
efficacy, this study closely reflects the patient baseline 
conditions, since telemonitoring was integrated within 
regular clinical practice. We consider that the complex- 
ity of the patients included in the study (which had a 
high mortality as shown in our previous publications 
[26]), focussing on the comorbidity and functionality 
more than on specific pathologies, and the control of 
telemonitoring by professionals who are usually in 
charge of these patients, are the main strengths of the 
TELBIL design. 
The main limitations of the present study are those 
inherent to before and after study designs and the 
lack of a control group. Another important limitation is 
the fact that this was an exploratory study with a small 
sample size. Such limitations should be taken into 
account when interpreting the impact observed on 
healthcare resources use. 
We included patients coming from the preceding 
TELBIL RCT, monitored for 2.5 years on average previ- 
ously, which could bias the results. Nevertheless, the 
statistical analysis applied considering the events at 
baseline in patients coming from the TELBIL RCT, the 
homogeneity analysis at baseline and the subgroup 
analysis carried out, counteracted this influence show- 
ing that 
introduced was not 
substantial. 


The present exploratory study appears to indicate the 
utility of a primary care-based telemonitoring interven- 
tion for complex chronic patients in reducing health- 
care resources use. 

implementa- 
tion of home-care telemonitoring in primary care, we 
highlight the positive acceptance and adherence to 
telemonitoring of the primary care professionals in 
charge of the patients, the promotion of the leading 
role of nursing, the institutional support for these kind 
of initiatives, the availability of human and material 
resources and the reorganization of care processes 
within a planned diffusion strategy. We believe that 
telemonitoring of complex chronic patients managed 
from primary care should be taken further, as the basic 
means to ensure coordination of the care of these 
patients across care levels. 

In the light of the findings of the present exploratory 
study, home telemonitoring of patients with HF or 
CLD implemented in real clinical practice and con- 
trolled from primary care seemed to have a positive 
impact on healthcare resources use, reducing both all-- 
and 
and condition-specific hospitalizations 
cause 


emergency department attendances, and showing a 
decreasing trend for the length of hospital stay.
