Background: Telemonitoring of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) is an emerging concept to detect early warning signs 
of impending acute decompensation in order to prevent hospitalization. 
Objective: The goal of the MOBIle TELemonitoring in Heart Failure Patients Study (MOBITEL) was to evaluate the impact 
of home-based telemonitoring using Internet and mobile phone technology on the outcome of heart failure patients after an episode 
of acute decompensation. 
Methods: Patients were randomly allocated to pharmacological treatment (control group) or to pharmacological treatment with 
telemedical surveillance for 6 months (tele group). Patients randomized into the tele group were equipped with mobile phone–based 
patient terminals for data acquisition and data transmission to the monitoring center. Study physicians had continuous access to 
the data via a secure Web portal. If transmitted values went outside individually adjustable borders, study physicians were sent 
an email alert. Primary endpoint was hospitalization for worsening CHF or death from cardiovascular cause. 
Results: The study was stopped after randomization of 120 patients (85 male, 35 female); median age was 66 years (IQR 62-72). 
The control group comprised 54 patients (39 male, 15 female) with a median age of 67 years (IQR 61-72), and the tele group 
included 54 patients (40 male, 14 female) with a median age of 65 years (IQR 62-72). There was no significant difference between 
groups with regard to baseline characteristics. Twelve tele group patients were unable to begin data transmission due to the 
inability of these patients to properly operate the mobile phone (“never beginners”). Four patients did not finish the study due to 
personal reasons. Intention-to-treat analysis at study end indicated that 18 control group patients (33%) reached the primary 
endpoint (1 death, 17 hospitalizations), compared with 11 tele group patients (17%, 0 deaths, 11 hospitalizations; relative risk 
reduction 50%, 95% CI 3-74%, P = .06). Per-protocol analysis revealed that 15% of tele group patients (0 deaths, 8 hospitalizations)

reached the primary endpoint (relative risk reduction 54%, 95% CI 7-79%, P= .04). NYHA class improved by one class in tele 
group patients only (P< .001). Tele group patients who were hospitalized for worsening heart failure during the study had a 
significantly shorter length of stay (median 6.5 days, IQR 5.5-8.3) compared with control group patients (median 10.0 days, IQR 
7.0-13.0; P= .04). The event rate of never beginners was not higher than the event rate of control group patients. 
Conclusions: Telemonitoring using mobile phones as patient terminals has the potential to reduce frequency and duration of 
heart failure hospitalizations. Providing elderly patients with an adequate user interface for daily data acquisition remains a 
challenging component of such a concept. 




Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major cause of hospitalization 
in Western countries, with a high rate of re-admission [1]. 
Despite effective therapies, patients with CHF suffer from a 
high rate of hospital re-admission and bear a high risk of death 
within the first months after an episode of acute heart failure 
[1,2]. 
Reduction of re-admissions is a major goal in the management 
of CHF patients. Therefore, both the European and the American 
guidelines on CHF recommend disease management programs 
that include telephone follow-up or home nursing [3,4]. 
Monitoring body weight, home visits by nurses, telephone 
conferences with nurses, and complete telemedical supervision 
have been tested with inconsistent results [5-20]. Simple 
interventions such as measuring body weight with telemedical 
surveillance produced conflicting results for re-hospitalization 
[5,8]. Nurse visits at home or telephone contact with nurses 
[6-7,10-12,14] inconsistently showed a benefit for the prognosis 
of heart failure patients. 
Telemedicine using transmission of vital parameters can be 
expensive and technically demanding [12,14,21]. The majority 
of reports show a positive influence on the outcome of heart 
failure patients [9,12,15], although it is not clear which system 
is best for this challenge. 
Rapid advances and the ubiquitous availability of mobile phones 
have created new perspectives toward telemedical interaction 
between patients and health care professionals [22]. Recently, 
we were able to show that mobile phone–based surveillance is 
safe and promising in cardiac patients [23]. 

Based on these promising early results using mobile phone 
technology, we designed 
(MOBIle 
TELemonitoring in heart failure patients) study in order to test 
the hypothesis that telemedical surveillance using widespread 
mobile phone technology as patient terminals improves the 
outcome of CHF patients after an episode of acute cardiac 
decompensation. 

Patients 
MOBITEL was a prospective, randomized, open-label study. 
Recruitment started on October 1, 2003, and the study was 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
closed with the sign-off of the last patient on April 29, 2008. 
Registration in a public trials registry was not performed for 
MOBITEL since it was optional at the time of study start. Local 
regulatory authorities approved the study, with the University 
Clinic Graz being the lead ethics committee. 
Patients were eligible for the study if they met all of the 
following inclusion criteria: acute worsening of heart failure 
(acute cardiac decompensation) with hospital admission lasting 
> 24 hours within the last 4 weeks, treatment according to the 
guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) with 
an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an 
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), diuretic, and beta-blocker 
(except in cases with documented intolerance to beta-blockers). 
Initially, patients older than 18 years and younger than 75 years 
were eligible; the latter was amended to 80 years after 4 months 
of recruitment. For the definition of CHF, we adopted the ESC 
guidelines [4]. 
Patients with one of the following conditions were not eligible 
for MOBITEL: unstable coronary artery disease with 
revascularization within 
last 6 months, planned 
the 
revascularization (percutaneous or surgical) for coronary artery 
disease, planned heart valve surgery, planned or completed heart 
transplantation, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, acute 
myocarditis, inability to read the display of a handheld phone, 
or malignancy. 
After receiving verbal and written study information, patients 
gave written consent to participate in the study. Patients were 
allocated randomly to pharmacological treatment (control group) 
or pharmacological treatment plus telemedical surveillance (tele 
group). The adaptive randomization procedure was stratified 
by patient age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, 
gender, and study center. 
Baseline demographics and medication were recorded for all 
patients, and an appointment for the 6-month follow-up was 
made. There was no planned interaction between study site and 
patients in the control group within the follow-up period of 6 
months. Patients in the tele group were given the telemonitoring 
equipment and an appointment for telephone or face-to-face 
technical training. 
Equipment and Data Processing 
The telemonitoring equipment consisted of three commercially 
available components: (1) a mobile phone (Nokia 3510, 
Finland), (2) a weight scale with 0.1 kg accuracy and electronic 
J Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 3 | e34 | p. 2 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


display (Soehnle creta, Germany), and (3) a sphygmomanometer 
for fully automated measurement of blood pressure and heart 
rate (BosoMedicus, Bosch&Sohn, Germany). Tele group 
patients were trained in measurement of blood pressure and 
weight using the equipment prior to discharge home. 
Furthermore, tele group patients were instructed by a study 
technician in the use of the mobile phone. 
Tele group patients were asked to measure vital parameters 
(blood pressure, heart rate, body weight) on a daily basis at the 
same time, preferably in the morning after emptying the bladder 
and before dressing and taking medication. Thereafter, patients 
were advised to enter these values as well as their dosage of 
heart failure medication into the mobile phone’s Internet browser 
and send them to the monitoring center provided by the Austrian 
Institute of Technology (AIT) – Information Management & 
eHealth, Graz. Study physicians had access to a secure website 
providing both numerical and graphical depiction of data for 
each patient. Whenever necessary, study physicians could 
contact patients using the mobile phone. Figure 1 outlines this 
process. 

At the monitoring center, data were depicted both numerically 
and graphically in an electronic case record form (CRF; Figure 
2). Study physicians had continuous access to the CRFs of their 
patients via a secure website. Physicians were advised to use 
the automated warning system for the monitoring of vital 
parameters of their patients. If transmitted values went outside 
individually adjustable borders, study physicians were sent an 
email alert. Additionally, an email alert was generated if a 
patient’s body weight increased or decreased more than 2 kg in 
2 days. After receiving an alert, study physicians could contact 
the patient directly via the mobile phone to confirm the 
parameters and, if appropriate, could ask the patient to adjust 
his or her medication. 
For technical questions, patients had access to a 24-hour hotline 
at the service center.

MOBITEL Telemedicine Platform 
The MOBITEL telemedicine platform was developed as a 
three-tier, client-server architecture 
logic, and 
representation layers) using state-of-the-art Internet technology. 
The Zope Web/application server 
(Zope 2.6.1, Zope 
Corporation, Fredericksburg, VA, USA) and the relational 
database system (Interbase 6.0, Borland Software Corporation, 
Cupertino, CA, USA) were chosen for the basic system. 

While the application server provided core logic, particular 
services were developed as independent modules in the sense 
of service-oriented architecture (SOA). Particular functionalities 
were clustered into services that were able to communicate and 
share data with each other. 


data processing and graphic service: For sophisticated data 
processing and visualization of time-series data (e.g. blood 
pressure measurements), the MatLab 6.5 environment (The 
MathWorks, Natick, MA) was used. 
notification service: The database was checked at regular 
intervals for arrival of new alerts, notifications, or reminders 
generated by the data processing service. Subsequently, a 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
personalized message was composed and sent to the 
responsible physician by text messaging, email, or both. 
The components of the MOBITEL telemedicine platform were 
designed with respect to a high level of security and 
confidentiality to comply with regulatory requirements. Data 
transfer was encrypted, and access to the data was restricted to 
authorized users. 
Outcome Parameters and Endpoint Definitions 
The combined primary endpoint of this study was cardiovascular 
mortality or re-hospitalization for worsening heart failure. 
Besides evaluation of patients’ functional status according to 
the NYHA classification and 
length of stay during 
re-hospitalizations, further secondary endpoints focused on 
cumulative 
system 
technical parameters: 
transmissions, and transmissions per patient. 

Study patients were classified as reaching the primary endpoint 
in case of hospital admission for worsening heart failure or 
cardiovascular death within the study period. 
Tele group patients who dropped out immediately after 
randomization due to inability to handle the telemonitoring 
equipment despite intensified training were classified as “never 
J Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 3 | e34 | p. 4 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


beginners.” These patients were contacted 6 months after 
randomization to obtain data for the primary endpoint. 
Study patients who stopped prematurely for personal reasons 
were classified as “early termination on patient’s request.” These 
patients were invited to an earlier follow-up (i.e. end-of-study 
visit) to obtain as much information as possible and were 
included in the final analysis according to randomization. 
Statistics 
For statistical planning, we assumed that patients in the control 
arm would show an event rate of 30% over 6 months [1]. For 
the telemedicine arm, we expected a 50% reduction of the event 
rate. To show a statistically significant difference at an error 
of .05 with a power of 80%, a sample size of 240 subjects was 
calculated. 
Randomization was stopped after 120 patients due to an 
increasing number of never beginners who were unable to 
operate the mobile phone, indicating the urgent need for a new 
technology. However, as we tried to avoid a mix of technologies 
within one study, we decided to stop randomization in 
coordination with the ethics committee of the Medical 
University Graz. Therefore, the results must be interpreted 
cautiously. 
Final data analysis was performed according to the per-protocol 
principle, including all patients except never beginners. 
Additionally, 
intention-to-treat analysis was performed, 
including all randomized patients. The log-rank test, the 
Kaplan-Meier estimation method with 95% confidence interval 
(CI), and calculation of the relative risk reduction were used to 
analyze the primary endpoint. 
With respect to the secondary endpoints, difference in functional 
NYHA class between baseline and end of study was compared 
between patients in the control and tele group. Dosage of heart 
failure medication was calculated as percentage of the 
ESC-recommended dosage and compared between both groups. 
Normally distributed values were compared using the t-test, 
while the chi-square test was used to compare nominal 
distributed values. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to 
compare independent samples and the Wilcoxon signed rank 
test to compare dependent samples when values were not 
normally distributed. 
Patients’ adherence with the telemonitoring system was 
expressed as a percentage of effectively to expected received 
datasets. Thus, the cumulative monitoring period and the total 
number of received values were calculated for all participants. 
Statistics were calculated using R statistical software, version 
2.4.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 
We considered a P-value < .05 to show a statistically significant 
difference in all comparisons. All data are given as median and 
interquartile range (IQR). 

Patients 
In the tele group, 12 patients (6 male, 6 female; median age 68 
years [IQR 64-74]) emerged unable to begin transmission of 
data and were classified as never beginners. Never beginners 
were included in the intention-to-treat analysis but not the 
per-protocol analysis. Furthermore, there were four patients 
who requested early termination of the study (4 male, median 
age 63 years [IQR 60-65]) and were included in both the 
intention-to-treat analysis and the per-protocol analysis. Figure 
3 shows the study flowchart.

Overall, 120 patients (85 male, 35 female) with a median age 
of 66 years (IQR 62-72) were randomized in eight centers: 54 
patients were randomized to the control group (39 male, 15 
female; median age 67 years [IQR 61-72]), and 66 patients were 
randomized to the tele group (46 male, 20 female; median age 
66 years [IQR 62-73]). 
For the per-protocol analysis (Table 1), the control group 
comprised 54 patients (39 male, 15 female; median age 67 years 
[IQR 61-72]) and was compared with the tele group, including 
54 patients (40 male, 14 female; median age 65 years [IQR 
62-72]). At baseline there was no statistically significant 
difference between the two groups regarding age, gender, cause 
of heart failure, NYHA functional class, left ventricular (LV) 
ejection fraction, heart failure medication, as well as frequency 
and duration of heart failure hospitalizations in the year prior 
to randomization (Table 1).

Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that 18 control group 
patients (33%) reached the primary endpoint (1 death, 17 
hospitalizations) compared with 11 tele group patients (17%, 0 
deaths, 11 hospitalizations; relative risk reduction 50%, 95% 
CI 3-74%, P= .06; Figure 4a). The number of never beginners 
reaching the primary endpoint was not higher than for control 
group patients.

Per-Protocol Analyses 
Per-protocol analysis at study end revealed that 15% of tele 
group patients (0 deaths, 8 hospitalizations) reached the primary 
endpoint (relative risk reduction 54%, 95% CI 7-79%, P= .04; 
Figure 4b). 
Median NYHA class improved from 3 to 2 in tele group patients 
only (P< .001) compared with control group patients at study 
end and compared with tele group baseline values. Ejection 
fraction showed a nonsignificant improvement in both the 
control group, from 29% (IQR 21-36) to 35% (IQR 24-40), and 
the tele group, from 25% (IQR 20-38) to 35% (IQR 25-45). 
Tele group patients who were hospitalized for worsening heart 
failure during the study had a significantly shorter length of 
hospital stay (median 6.5 days, IQR 5.5-8.3) compared with 
control group patients (median 10.0 days, IQR 7.0-13.0; P= 
.04). 
Dosage of heart failure medication was calculated as percent 
of the ESC-recommended daily dose. At baseline, tele group 
patients had a higher percentage of the ESC-recommended daily 
dose of ACE inhibitors compared to control group patients. 
However, this difference was no longer significant at study end. 
All other types of drugs were equally balanced. 
Tele group patients started transmission of data within 6.5 days 
(IQR 4-11) after randomization. During the entire study, a total 
of 7554 value sets were received from tele group patients, 
corresponding to a median of 162 transmissions per patient 
(IQR 136-173). On 7554 out of 7962 cumulative monitoring 
days, at least one set of values was sent, which indicates a 
patient adherence rate of 95%. 
There were 375 alerts sent to study physicians in cases of 
exceeding predefined thresholds for body weight or exceeding 
the dynamic threshold of ± 2 kg in 2 days. Consequently, tele 
group patients were contacted 170 times. In 55 of those times, 
an adjustment of heart failure medication was made (Table 2). 
Adverse events or side effects were not observed.

The MOBITEL study addressed important issues in the 
management of heart failure patients after discharge from 
hospital, namely the following: 



how to reduce the high risk of re-hospitalization for 
worsening heart failure and/or cardiovascular death 
to detect early warning signs of 
how 
decompensation 
how to inform the treating physician 

For this purpose, mobile phone–based patients terminals were 
used in a telemonitoring scenario. The system was developed 
and tested in 120 heart failure patients. After 6 months, there 
was a reduction of relative risk in tele group patients 
(re-admission or death) by 54%. However, the small sample 
size and the premature termination of randomization because 
of relevant technological issues with the patient terminal have 
to be considered as the main limitations when interpreting the 
results. 
Telemonitoring and Telemedical Intervention for 
Patients With Heart Failure 
Patients suffering an episode of acute heart failure are at a high 
risk of adverse events within the first months after such an 
episode [1,2]. Therefore, efforts are needed to reduce this risk 
and to look out for early warning signs of acute heart failure. 
Telemonitoring in general may provide a powerful tool to look 
for early warning signs and to reduce the high risk of adverse 
events in patients with CHF [19]. However, there are some 
uncertainties about the parameters to monitor as well as the 
proper monitoring tool. 
The simple concept of monitoring body weight with telemedical 
surveillance did not show consistent results [5,8] but led to more 
sophisticated monitoring tools. However, recently it has been 
shown that the risk for re-hospitalization for worsening heart 
failure is highest in patients with weight gain of more than 4.5 
kg within the week prior to hospitalization [24]. In our study, 
we also used increasing body weight as an early warning sign 
of fluid retention, although our limits were much closer (2 kg 
weight gain within 2 days). This stringent limit led to a 
significant number of alerts prompting communication between 
study physicians and patients, and, in some but not all cases, 
led to an adjustment of medication.

Increase in body weight often signals worsening heart failure. 
In addition, changes in blood pressure and heart rate may also 
herald worsening heart failure. To detect such episodes, we used 
a fully automated sphygmomanometer to measure both blood 
pressure and heart rate to gain information about potential 
refinement of heart failure therapy. 
Our study is also the first to investigate the ability of patients 
to transmit information on heart failure medication dose on a 
daily basis. The vast majority of patients were able to enter and 
transmit their daily doses together with vital parameters by using 
the mobile Internet browser. 
Furthermore, this study offered the unique ability to see that 
patients with CHF underwent an educational process: In many 
tele group patients who entered the study with some instability 
and who were (in response to alarms) advised by the study 
physician to adapt diuretic therapy, we saw, over time, some 
form of “self-monitoring” and, consequently, self-treatment. 
As indicated by the late separation of Kaplan-Meier curves in 
Figure 4, telemedical surveillance does not appear to be superior 
to conventional treatment in the first month of follow-up. In 
our study, the majority of re-hospitalizations of tele group 
patients was seen in the first month of patient follow-up. 
Alarms and Alarm Management 
In this study, sophisticated pre-analysis of data was not 
implemented. False-positive alarm messages sent to the 
physicians were predominately influenced by two factors: 
• Outlier and type errors were not identified. 
• 
Individual thresholds were not quickly adjusted in response 
to the slight variation of the body weight over time. 
However, alarm management in general (i.e. timely confirmation 
of an alarm) and alarm generation in particular turned out to be 
crucial factors in a home-monitoring scenario. Hence, future 
research will focus on the development of sophisticated 
algorithms for automatic data analysis of home-monitoring data. 
The algorithm should provide high sensitivity and specificity 
in order to make telemedical services effective and efficient. 
Mobile Phone–Based Patient Terminal 
MOBITEL was the first study showing a positive influence on 
outcome in CHF patients using mobile phones as patient 
terminals for daily data transmission to the monitoring center. 
J Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 3 | e34 | p. 9 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


Mobile phone technology (either GSM or 3G) is widespread in 
Europe and is a familiar tool, even in elderly patients. Hence, 
after 4 months of recruitment, we amended the upper age limit 
for inclusion up to 80 years. 
The approach of using the mobile phone as telemonitoring 
equipment is different from all other studies reported so far: 
previous trials used more sophisticated equipment to obtain and 
transmit vital parameters from heart failure patients [9,12,15,21]. 
As the 95% patient adherence to the telemonitoring system 
indicates, the system was well accepted by those who were able 
to handle the mobile phone. Contrary to our expectations, data 
entry errors were rare, and the quality of self-reported data was 
appropriate for further clinical evaluation. 
Recently, our group reported the first use of mobile phone–based 
telemedical surveillance in cardiac patients [23]. With this trial 
we were able to show that this technology can be used to 
monitor heart failure patients and to improve their outcome. 
Limitations 
Not surprisingly, our study has a number of limitations. 
Although we were careful not to include patients with visual 
impairment (this was an explicit exclusion criterion), there were 
some patients who were not able to properly handle the mobile 
phone’s Internet browser (never beginners). However, there 
was no difference at baseline between these never beginners 
and the remaining study patients, and the never beginners 
subsequently had an event rate that was not different from 
control patients. 
As a consequence, we looked for new technologies to improve 
the usability for elderly, technically unskilled patients. A 
promising solution could be the use of near field communication 
(NFC) in telemonitoring technology. Unlike Bluetooth, NFC 
supports a touch-based method for data acquisition using 
upcoming NFC-enabled mobile phones [24]. In addition to data 
acquisition from medical devices, it provides access to data 
stored on radio frequency identification (RFID) tags (eg, 
electronic barcodes), which could be embedded in future 
telemonitoring technology. However, as we did not want to mix 
two completely different technologies in one study, we decided 
to stop randomization after 120 patients. Therefore, the 
intention-to-treat analysis only revealed a trend in favor of 
telemedical surveillance, while the per-protocol analysis showed 
a significant difference between groups. This is the second major 
limitation of MOBITEL. 
Lessons Learned 
Based on the experiences from the MOBITEL study, the 
following key 
the utilization of a 
telemonitoring system in CHF management have been identified: 




an easy-to-use patient terminal to allow safe and secure 
data acquisition, especially for unskilled, elderly patients 
sophisticated alarm management with high sensitivity and 
specificity in order to focus physicians’ attention on those 
patients whose data indicate signs of worsening health status 
The development of an integrated care concept might be helpful 
to allow optimal integration of telemonitoring tasks into the 
existing workflows and processes of clinicians, general 
practitioners, and home care nurses. 
Conclusion 
The results of the MOBITEL study indicate that home-based 
telemonitoring using mobile phones improves outcome in CHF 
patients and reduces both frequency and duration of heart failure 
hospitalizations. Providing elderly patients with an adequate 
user interface for data acquisition and transmission remains a 
challenging part of this concept.
