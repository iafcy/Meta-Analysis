Background and objective: Tele monitoring (TM) of patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) has gained much interest, but studies have produced conflicting 
results. Our aim was to investigate the effect of TM with the option of video consultations on 
exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with severe COPD. 
Materials and methods: Patients with severe COPD at high risk of exacerbations were 
eligible for the study. Of 560 eligible patients identified, 279 (50%) declined to participate. 
The remaining patients were equally randomized to either TM (n=141) or usual care (n=140) 
for the 6-month study period. TM comprised recording of symptoms, saturation, spirometry, 
and weekly video consultations. Algorithms generated alerts if readings breached thresholds. 
Both groups received standard care. The primary outcome was number of hospital admissions 
for exacerbation of COPD during the study period. 
Results: Most of the enrolled patients had severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
,50%pred in 86% and $hospital admission for COPD in the year prior to enrollment in 45%, 
respectively, of the patients). No difference in drop-out rate and mortality was found between 
the groups. With regard to the primary outcome, no significant difference was found in hospital 
admissions for COPD between the groups (P=0.74), and likewise, no difference was found in 
time to first admission or all-cause hospital admissions. Compared with the control group, TM 
group patients had more moderate exacerbations (ie, treated with antibiotics/corticosteroid, 
but not requiring hospital admission; P,0.001), whereas the control group had more visits to 
outpatient clinics (P,0.001). 
Conclusion: Our study of patients with severe COPD showed that TM including video consulta- 
tions as add-on to standard care did not reduce hospital admissions for exacerbated COPD, but 
TM may be an alternative to visits at respiratory outpatient clinics. Further studies are needed 
to establish the optimal role of TM in the management of severe COPD.

Introduction 
Exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of 
hospitalization and premature death. The rate of re-admission is approximately 50% 
within the first 12 months.1 To monitor, optimize treatment, and prevent exacerbation 
in COPD, the GOLD strategy document recommends regular follow-up for patients 
suffering from COPD.2 The Danish Health Authorities recommend that patients with 
severe and very severe COPD are followed up in the outpatient clinic twice yearly and 
seen for unscheduled visits as needed, whereas patients with mild-to-moderate COPD

are expected to be managed, including regular follow-ups, 
by their general practitioner.3 
Tele monitoring (TM) has gained enormous interest 
because it is seen not only as a way of providing prompt medical 
intervention in the early phase of deterioration in the patient’s 
condition and by that prevent hospital admissions but also as a 
way of reducing costs and time spent with transportation.4 
In recent years, TM for patients with COPD has been evalu- 
ated in various designs and setups. A few studies have evaluated 
the effect of TM immediately after discharge from a hospital 
admission for COPD5,6 and some have combined TM with edu- 
cation, self-management, and/or rehabilitation,7–9 whereas only 
a few studies have included video conferences.6–8 In keeping 
with this, review articles have, not surprisingly, found it difficult 
to draw valid conclusions and have, therefore, recommended 
further research, also because the number of studies in this area 
is still very limited.10,11 The most positive results have, so far, 
been seen in studies comprising a large number of patients with 
COPD on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT).12–14 
A large British randomized study of 3,230 patients with 
diabetes, heart failure, or COPD revealed that TM was 
associated with a reduction in mortality, number of hospital 
admissions, and bed days by 4% in absolute terms.15 Unfor- 
tunately, the findings for each of the three disease groups are 
not provided in the published article.15 
Recently, Pinnock et al published their findings from a 
large randomized study with patients with COPD recruited 
through general practice and reported that TM had no effect 
on hospital admissions or quality of life,8 and in keeping with 
this, Hamad et al16 failed to establish the value of TM in the 
early detection of COPD exacerbations. However, although 
previous studies indicate that TM may not be a cost-effective 
intervention,17,18 it has been reported that TM has a positive 
effect of health-related quality of life and anxiety.18 As TM 
involves substantial health-care costs and commitment, there 
is a need for well-designed longer-term studies with appropri- 
ate follow-up prior to its more widespread application.19 
The aim of the present randomized study was to inves- 
tigate the effectiveness of TM with the option of video 
consultations on number of hospital admissions for COPD 
in patients with severe and very severe COPD recruited from 
respiratory outpatient clinics. 
Materials and methods 
Participants 
In a randomized controlled trial, we recruited patients from four 
hospitals with specialized pulmonary wards in Copenhagen 
(Hvidovre Hospital, Amager Hospital, Herlev Hospital, and 
Bispebjerg Hospital). The target population was patients with 
stable severe and very severe COPD at high risk of exacer- 
bations and hospital admissions. Patients were eligible for 
the study, if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: 
1) COPD defined according to the GOLD criteria2 (post- 
bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1)/forced vital capacity ,0.7), 2) post-bronchodilator 
FEV1 ,60% of predicted value, 3) hospital admission due 
to COPD exacerbation within the previous 36 months and/or 
treated with LTOT for at least 3 months, 4) regular scheduled 
visits to the respiratory outpatient clinics, 5) COPD judged by 
the study staff as the main cause of disability, and 6) residents 
in one of the six municipalities in the Copenhagen area and 
in the catchment area of one of the four recruiting hospitals. 
The exclusion criteria were the following: 1) an exacerbation 
of COPD within the 3 weeks prior to enrollment requiring a 
change in medical treatment, 2) not willing to give informed 
consent for participating in the study, 3) unable to use a tablet 
computer, 4) planned vacation or other stay outside the catch- 
ment area for 2 weeks or more during the study period, 5) unable 
to participate due to language barrier or cognitive disorders, and 
6) not possible to establish a working telephone line. Patients 
were withdrawn from the study, if they no longer wished to 
participate, or if they moved out of the hospitals catchment 
areas. In case of hospital admission, patients continued in the 
study immediately after discharge from the hospital 
Patient selection and randomization 
Between November 2013 and April 2014, we identified 
560 patients who met the clinical inclusion and not the exclusion 
criteria. Of the identified patients, 279 (49.8%) patients declined 
to participate. The remaining 281 patients gave informed consent 
to participate in the trial and were randomized to either TM or 
usual care (control group) with a 1:1 allocation using randomized 
blocks of four (via numbered envelopes) for 6 months. Patients 
recruited and randomized to either TM or usual care at each of 
the hospitals were divided into three groups: Group 1: $hospital 
admission for COPD in the previous year; Group 2: $hospital 
admission for COPD in the past 3 years, but not within the year 
prior to enrollment; and Group 3: LTOT regardless of the number 
of admissions for COPD in previous years. Block randomization 
was used to ensure that equal numbers of patients from the three 
groups were allocated to TM and usual care. 
standard management of COPD 
All patients enrolled in the trial were managed according to 
national and international guidelines, including outpatient 
pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with COPD with 






FEV1 ,50%pred and Medical Research Council (MRC) 
dyspnea score $320 and supported discharge to selected in- 
hospital patients to reduce the risk of early readmission.21 
Control group 
Patients on LTOT were managed either by respiratory nurses 
at home or in the outpatient clinic depending on the patient’s 
mobility. All other patients were seen for scheduled visits at 
the outpatient clinics once or twice a year and for unscheduled 
visits as required. Patients were informed that they could 
contact the staff at the outpatient clinic weekdays between 
9 am and 3 pm, if they had acute respiratory problems. 
Tele monitoring 
The TM equipment comprised a tablet computer with a 
web camera, a microphone, and measurement equipment 
(spirometer, pulse oximeter, and bathroom scale). Besides, 
patients reported changes in dyspnea, sputum color, volume, 
and purulence. The observations were transferred to a call 
center at each participant’s local hospital and automatically cat- 
egorized and prioritized (ie, green–yellow–red-coded). The call 
centers were open weekdays between 9 am and 3 pm and were 
staffed by a specially trained respiratory nurse. The nurse could 
confer the patients with a specialist in respiratory medicine at 
the hospital if values were alarming (a single measurement with 
red code or two consecutive measurements with yellow code); 
the patient was contacted by the respiratory nurse. 
Measurements without video consultation were taken 
three times a week for the first 4 weeks and afterward once 
weekly. Video consultation with spirometry was performed 
once a week during the first 4 weeks of the study period and 
then once monthly. Patients were free to perform additional 
measurements at any time or phone the call center during 
opening hours, if they considered it necessary. Depending 
on the situation, an unscheduled video consultation could be 
arranged if necessary. The measurements were recorded in a 
secured database to which the patient’s general practitioner 
and the municipal’s social and health workers had access. 
Patients randomized to the TM group were not seen 
at regular scheduled visits at the outpatient clinics, but 
unscheduled visits were arranged if the TM consultation was 
considered inadequate by the health care professional. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome was the number of hospital admissions 
for COPD in the 6-month study period. 
Secondary effect parameters were number of all-cause 
hospital admissions, time to first hospital admission, time to 
first hospital admission caused by exacerbation in COPD, 
number of visits to emergency rooms, number of visits to 
the outpatient clinic (respiratory departments and nonrespira- 
tory departments, respectively), number of exacerbations in 
COPD requiring treatment with systemic steroid and/or anti- 
biotics but not admission to hospital (according to the patient 
and patient’s medical record, including prescriptions), length 
of hospital admissions (days), and all-cause mortality. 
The Danish National Registry of Patients and the Danish 
National Registry of Deaths provided information on all hospital 
admissions, visits to emergency rooms, and vital status during 
the 6-month study period (tracked by each individual’s unique 
personal number from the Danish Central Person Register). 


sample size calculations 
We estimated that 125 participants in each arm would allow 
us to detect a difference in the primary outcome variable, that 
is, number of hospital admissions for COPD in the 6-month 
study period, of 40% with a 90% power, using a significance 
level of 5%. 
Measurements 
The self-reported MRC dyspnea score that rates breathless- 
ness on a scale from 1 (no dyspnea) to 5 (breathless while 
washing and dressing or too breathless to leave the house) 
was used for assessing breathlessness.20 
We used Charlson Comorbidity Index scores to assess 
level and severity of comorbidity in the study cohort.22 
The Charlson Comorbidity Index score is calculated as the 
sum of points (on a scale from 1 to 6) assigned to each of 
19 diseases.22 Information on comorbid diseases was obtained 
from the Danish National Patient Registry. 
statistics 
Data were analyzed with the statistical package SPSS 
version 19.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics). The χ2, two sample 
t-test and Mann–Whitney U-test were used, as appropriate, 
for comparisons between groups. A two-sided P-value 
of ,0.05 was considered significant. Kaplan–Meier analysis 
with log-rank statistics was applied to estimate a model for 
time to first event of interest, for example, hospitalization 
due to exacerbation in COPD. 
subgroup analyses 
For the outcomes of interest, subgroup analyses were performed 
based on sex, current smoking, LTOT, and hospital admission 






for COPD exacerbation in the year prior to enrollment, as these 
factors may possibly affect the impact of the intervention.23,24 
Results 
Baseline characteristics 
The majority of patients enrolled in the study had severe 
COPD, with 207 patients (85.7%) having an FEV1 ,50%pred, 
148 patients (52.7%) with MRC score .3, 126 patients 
(44.9%) having at least one hospital admission for COPD in 
the year prior to enrollment, and 75 patients (26.7%) on LTOT 
(Table 1). More females were allocated to TM, whereas more 
never smokers were allocated to the control group. Compar- 
ing other baseline characteristics between the two treatment 
groups revealed no significant differences (Table 1). 
study completion and withdrawals 
Four patients (three in the TM group) withdrew their con- 
sent within the first 2 weeks of the study period. Seventeen 
patients died during the study period, and another 12 patients 
dropped out for various reasons (Figure 1). No significant 
differences in drop-out rates (P=0.79) or mortality were 
found between the groups (P=0.87). 
hospital admissions for COPD 
Analyzing the data with regard to the primary outcome did 
not reveal any significant difference in number of hospital 
admissions for COPD in the two groups, that is, TM vs 
control group (Table 2), and likewise, no significant differ- 
ence was found in the proportion of patients experiencing an 
acute exacerbation of COPD in the two groups (Figure 2) or 
time to first hospitalization for COPD. 
all-cause hospital admissions 
Comparing the two groups revealed no significant difference 
in the total number of hospital admissions (Figure 3), number 
of patients having any admission to hospital, time to first 
hospitalization, or visits to the emergency room during the 
study period (Table 2). 
exacerbations of COPD not requiring 
hospital admission 
The mean number of exacerbations not requiring hospitaliza- 
tion but treated with a course of oral corticosteroid and/or 
antibiotics was significantly higher for the patients in the TM 
group compared with the control group (P,0.001), whereas the 
control group had more visits to outpatient clinics (Table 2). 
subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses stratified by sex, current smoking, LTOT, 
or hospital admission for COPD exacerbation in the year 
prior to randomization revealed no statistical significant dif- 
ferences the two groups.

to standard care on hospital admissions for COPD. 
Characteristics at the end of the study 
period 
At the end of the study period, significantly more patients in 
the TM groups were nonsmokers (76.6% vs 58.1%, P=0.002), 
whereas the proportion of patients having participated in 
a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the study period 
only reached borderline significance (38.0% vs 27.0%,

Communication with patients assigned 
to telemedicine 
Each patient was scheduled for seven video consultations 
during the study period, and 100 (82.6%) patients participated 
in at least six consultations. Data on unscheduled commu- 
nication with the health care professionals during the study 
period was missing for three of 124 patients who completed 
the study. A total of 12 patients had unscheduled video

have we included the right patients? 
Similar to other studies, a significant number of eligible 
patients refused to participate in our study.14,25 However, we 
did manage to include the planned number of patients with the 
a priori expected number of exacerbations in COPD leading 
to hospital admission during the 6-month study period. 
Vitacca et al have previously shown that TM was effec- 
tive in preventing hospital admissions in severe and frail 
chronic respiratory failure patients requiring home oxygen 
therapy and/or mechanical ventilation.14 In addition, a ten- 
dency toward reduced hospitalization rate has been reported 
from two small studies comprising a high proportion of 
patients on LTOT.12,13 Although close to 30% of the patients 
included in the present study were on LTOT, we were unable 
to demonstrate an effect of TM on hospital admissions in 
this subgroup of patients. 
Did we have all important components 
in our intervention? 
In addition to early identification of exacerbations, and by 
that facilitating early treatment and prevention of hospital 
admissions, the aim of TM is to support patient empower- 
ment and to optimize the management of COPD, also to 
encourage and help patients to quit smoking and do daily 
physical exercising. 
Although not a predefined outcome of interest, we found 
that significantly more patients in the TM group were non- 
smokers and a tendency toward more patients having partici- 
pated in pulmonary rehabilitation compared with controls at 
the end of the study period. 
TM combined with pulmonary rehabilitation has been 
associated with a reduction in hospital admissions.7,26 
However, as the positive effect of pulmonary rehabilitation in 
patients with COPD is well established, we believe that par- 
ticipation in such a program should be offered to all patients 
with more severe COPD, and referral or not for pulmonary 
rehabilitation was therefore not part of the intervention in 
the present trial. Furthermore, education in disease self- 
management in addition to treatment action plans was not 
part of the intervention, as we believe that studies addressing 
this intervention have produced too conflicting results, and, 
therefore, that a clinical trial addressing this aspect of COPD 
management may seem more appropriate.26–28 
general practitioners involvement in TM 
for COPD 
To include patients with high risk of hospitalization, we recruited 
patients from our outpatient clinics, and general practitioners

consultations (more than one in only one patient). Phone 
or email was used for communication in 91 (75.2%) of the 
patients (mean 3.3 contacts per patient). 
Discussion 
The present randomized clinical trial revealed that TM with 
close contact between the patient and the health care pro- 
viders at the hospital and the possibility of monitoring for 
early signs of COPD exacerbations leads to an increase in 
number of exacerbations treated outside the hospital setting, 
whereas TM had no significant impact on hospitalizations 
or mortality.

were not a part of the TM intervention. In contrast, two British 
studies have recruited patients from general practitioners.8,15 
The Whole System Demonstration included 3,154 patients, 
where 1,525 had COPD and the remaining patients had either 
diabetes or chronic heart failure. After 1 year, the admission 
rate was significantly lower in the TM group compared with 
controls (1.17 vs 0.96). Unfortunately, analyses are not given 
for the subgroup of patients with COPD, and besides, the 
positive effect of TM was almost entirely caused by an abrupt 
increase in hospitalization among the controls.15 
The Scottish study by Pinnock et al enrolled 256 patients 
with COPD with characteristics closely resembling our 
patients, also with regard to hospital admissions during the 
study period.8 Similar to our study, Pinnock et al were unable 
to demonstrate any positive effect of TM on hospitaliza- 
tions. In contrast to the Scottish study,8 video consultations 
were planned regularly in our study to improve the clinical 
assessment and, also, to make the patient comfortable with 
the equipment so it could be used if the patient experienced 
a worsening of their disease. However, the preferred com- 
munication for the patients in our study was either phone or 
email and not video consultations. As stated previously by 
Pinnock et al,8 the positive effect of TM seen in previous 
trials could thus be due to enhancement of the underpinning 
clinical service rather than the TM. 
strengths and limitations 
The strengths of our study include that we have included a 
large number of patients with a sufficient number of admis- 
sions to see a clinically relevant effect of an intervention, 
and that no patients were lost to follow-up. 
The limitations of our study are the fact that our call cen- 
ters were only operating Monday to Friday in the daytime, 
and that we do not have data on the enrolled patients’ number 
of visits to their GP during the study period. 
Conclusion 
We found that TM in addition to usual care in outpatient 
clinics did not reduce hospital admissions, but TM may be an 
alternative to visits at the respiratory outpatient clinic. More 
studies are needed to establish the optimal follow-up strategy 
of patients with COPD including the role of TM.
