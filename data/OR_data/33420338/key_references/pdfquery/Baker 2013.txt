OBJECTIVES: To evaluate mortality and healthcare utili- 
zation effects of an intervention that combined care man- 
agement 
individuals with 
congestive heart 
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, or diabetes mellitus. 
DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study. 
SETTING: Northwest United States. 
PARTICIPANTS: High-cost Medicare fee-for-service ben- 
eﬁciaries (N = 1,767) enrolled in two Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services demonstration participating clinics 
and a propensity-score matched control group. 
INTERVENTION: The Health Buddy Program, which 
integrates a content-driven telehealth system with care 
management. 
MEASUREMENTS: Mortality, inpatient admissions, hos- 
pital days, and emergency department (ED) visits during 
the 2-year study period were measured. Cox-proportional 
hazard models and negative binomial regression models 
were used to assess the relationship between the interven- 
tion and survival and utilization, controlling for demo- 
graphic and health characteristics that were statistically 
different between groups after matching. 
RESULTS: At 2 years, participants offered the Health 
Buddy Program had 15% lower risk-adjusted all-cause mor- 
tality (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85, 95% conﬁdence interval 
(CI) = 0.74–0.98; P = .03) and had reductions in the num- 
ber of quarterly inpatient admissions from baseline to the 
study period that were 18% greater than those of matched 
controls during this same time period ((cid:1)0.035 vs (cid:1)0.003; 
difference-in-differences = (cid:1)0.032, 95% CI = (cid:1)0.054 to 
(cid:1)0.010, P = .005). No relationship was found between 
the Health Buddy Program and ED use or number of hos- 
pital days for participants who were hospitalized. The 
Health Buddy Program was most strongly associated with

heart failure. 
CONCLUSION: Care management coupled with content- 
driven telehealth technology has potential 
to improve 
health outcomes in high-cost Medicare beneﬁciaries. J Am 
Geriatr Soc 61:1560–1567, 2013. 
Key words: telehealth; electronic communication; care 
management 

bidity, mortality, and costs, and managing them well 
is of considerable interest.1 Barriers to effective manage- 
ment can arise because of coordination and communica- 
tion gaps when individuals have multiple providers of 
care.2 Better disease management may be a way to address 
this challenge. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) has sponsored several demonstration pro- 
jects emphasizing disease management for chronically ill 
Medicare recipients,3,4 that provide important opportuni- 
ties to investigate the effect of better disease management 
on health outcomes. One demonstration project examined 
the Health Buddy Program (HBP), which integrates care 
management with the Health Buddy device, a telehealth 
device located in an individual’s home and linked over the 
telephone, 
to facilitate information 
exchange. The current study analyzed the effect of the 
HBP on healthcare utilization and mortality. 

Previous evaluations have considered care manage- 
ment and telehealth programs separately and reported 
mixed results.5–10 Approaches 
integrating information 
technology tools with care management appear promising 
but are less well studied. Previous analyses have found an 
association between the HBP, 
lower costs, and longer 
survival in Medicare beneﬁciaries,11,12 and beneﬁts of HBP 
in a Veterans Affairs setting.13,14 
In contrast to prior publications, this article focuses 
on mortality and healthcare utilization effects, particularly

hospitalizations and emergency department 
(ED) visits. 
Hospitalizations are of interest because they can amplify 
morbidity and age-related physiological changes. Hospital- 
ization itself poses risks to elderly adults because of lack 
of mobility, lower activity levels, and iatrogenic risks.15 


The Health Buddy device is a small electronic device with 
a high-resolution screen and four large buttons designed to 
easily collect information from individuals regarding their 
signs, mental health, knowledge, and 
symptoms, vital 
health behaviors. Participants 
received daily questions 
related to their diagnoses (e.g., “Do you have more short- 
ness of breath than usual today?”) and responded using the 
buttons. Responses were uploaded to a software system 
accessible over a secure Web portal 
that risk-stratiﬁed 
responses to support daily care manager review. The sys- 
tem identiﬁed the need for intervention based on signals 
such as deteriorating clinical signs (e.g., shortness of breath 
at all times vs with activity), lack of response, or gaps in 
individuals’ knowledge and behaviors, potentially improv- 
ing coordination of appropriate services and contact with 
providers.12 It also provided appropriate feedback and edu- 
cational information to individuals about their condition 
that may have improved self-care (e.g., “Call your doctor 
today to report your increased shortness of breath” or “Be 
sure to take rest breaks in between your routine activities. 
This is called activity pacing. If this increased shortness of 
breath continues, call your doctor to report it”). 
The HBP demonstration project was implemented at 
two multispecialty clinics located in Bend, Oregon, and 
Wenatchee, Washington. The demonstration targeted indi- 
viduals with congestive heart 
failure (CHF), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or diabetes mel- 
litus (DM).12 To select intervention participants, beneﬁcia- 
ries residing in a county that the two clinics primarily 
served were identiﬁed from Medicare records. A selection 
algorithm then identiﬁed participants with the targeted 
conditions who were loyal to a study clinic (had ≥2 visits 
at the clinic or received more care from the clinic than any 
other). The algorithm selected only those who were not in 
hospice, did not have conditions that would limit interac- 
tion with HBP or its effectiveness (e.g., dementia, blind- 
ness), or had high-cost conditions unlikely to be affected 
by HBP, such as end-stage renal disease. A full list of tar- 
get exclusionary comorbidities is available upon request. 
Demonstration participants were selected at two time 
points. The ﬁrst cohort comprised 763 beneﬁciaries identi- 
ﬁed in early 2006. The second cohort consisted of 1,056 
beneﬁciaries identiﬁed in early 2007 to expand the study 
and account for attrition. Care managers from each clinic 
contacted and invited selected participants over a period of 
several months beginning in February 2006 and 2007 for 
the ﬁrst and second cohorts, respectively. 

This project examined the relationship between the HBP 
including 
healthcare 
and mortality 


inpatient admissions, hospital days for those admitted, 
and ED visits, by comparing the intervention group with 
a propensity-matched control group. An intention-to-treat 
approach was used, considering all participants offered 
HBP as the intervention group, regardless of whether they 
used it. Approximately 37% of the intervention popula- 
tion inputted information into the system at least once 
(“engaged” the system). Engaged participants used Health 
Buddy for 300 days during the demonstration, on aver- 
age. 
Changes in utilization measures for the intervention 
and control participants from a 1-year period before 
the intervention was offered (baseline) were compared 
with a 2-year period afterward (study period). Hazard 
models were used to study differences in survival for 
the intervention and control groups during the study 
period. 

Data for intervention participants came from ﬁnalized 
Medicare claims that CMS provided from the demonstra- 
tion project. Control data came from Medicare claims 
from a 5% random sample of all beneﬁciaries (CMS 5% 
sample).16 Mortality (date of death) was observable from 
enrollment ﬁles linked to Social Security Administration 
death records. 



To construct the propensity-matched control group, 
and 
Paciﬁc Northwest 
Wenatchee in terms of demographic characteristics and 
hospital markets (control county selection criteria avail- 
able upon request) 17 were identiﬁed, and Medicare bene- 
ﬁciaries in the CMS 5% sample residing in those areas 
were selected. Propensity-score matching was then used 
to select beneﬁciaries who most resembled intervention 
participants18 using probit regression models for each 
cohort. Being offered HBP was the dependent variable, 
characteristics, diagnoses, Medicare 
and demographic 
risk scores,19 
Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) 
and baseline utilization were independent variables. Con- 
trol and intervention participants were matched 1:1 with 
replacement based on closest propensity scores, requiring 
scores within 0.01. A sufﬁciently close match could not 
be found for 52 intervention participants, and they were 
excluded (propensity score distribution available upon 
request). 

Mortality was based on validated date of death. Quarterly 
measures of the number of inpatient admissions, hospital 
days for those admitted, and ED visits were constructed 
for each beneﬁciary. Quarters (3-month intervals) 
for 
intervention participants were aligned to match the Febru- 
ary 1 start date of the intervention. Participant age and 
sex and presence of CHF, COPD, or DM were coded 
based on information available in claims data. Other com- 
orbidities were used to construct the Elixhauser index,20 
excluding CHF, COPD, and DM because they were 
included in the matching model. Disease conditions were 
identiﬁed based on diagnosis codes using Medicare claims 
(codes available upon request). 






SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc,. Cary, NC) and Stata 10.1 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX) were used for analyses. 
Unadjusted survival rates in the study period were 
evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. 
To adjust for potential differences in participant characteris- 
tics, Cox proportional hazard models were used, in which 
the dependent variable was time from the ﬁrst day of HBP 
availability until death or the end of the study period, 
controlling for demographic and health characteristics 
from the propensity-score matching algorithm that were 
statistically different between the groups after matching 
(P < .10) (full regression results available upon request). 
Utilization was studied using the year before HBP began 
as a baseline and comparing changes in utilization over the 
study period.13 Utilization analyses presented here include 
only quarters in which the participant was alive and enrolled 
in Medicare Part A and B for the whole quarter and exclude 
quarters immediately before and after HBP became available 
to account for uncertainty in the effective intervention start 
time.12 For participants who died, the utilization analyses 
also excluded data from the quarter of death. In multivariate 
analyses, panel negative binomial models in which the 
dependent variable was quarterly utilization were used. 
Important explanatory variables were intervention status, a 
study period indicator, and the interaction of these two 
indicators. The models also controlled for relevant demo- 
graphic and health characteristics. Results from the model 
were used to compute predicted quarterly utilization esti- 
mates, holding control characteristics ﬁxed at their sample 
means. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using t-tests 
for continuous variables, chi-square tests for categorical vari- 
ables in univariate analysis, and bootstrapped conﬁdence 
intervals (CIs) for the multivariate predictions.21 

All members of the intervention group were initially ana- 
lyzed regardless of their active participation in the program. 
Results for participants who ever used the system (engaged) 
and those who never did (non-engaged) were compared sep- 
arately with those of controls with closest propensity-score 
matches. Separate models were used to explore the interven- 
tion and control group members with each targeted health 
condition because these conditions are diverse, and the sys- 
tem may have inﬂuenced disease groups differently. 

Sensitivity analyses were performed including quarters sur- 
rounding program implementation and including the quar- 
ter of death for participants who died. Whether the use of 
propensity-score matching with replacement biased ﬁnd- 
ings was also investigated by creating another control 
group using matching without replacement. 

Participant demographics and clinical characteristics were 
similar between intervention (n = 1,767) and matched 
control (n = 1,767) participants (Table 1). 




Health Buddy Program was associated with lower risk of 
(P = .01) 
mortality 
(Figure 1). In Cox proportional hazard models, HBP was 
associated with a 15% lower risk-adjusted probability of 
death (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74–0.98, 
P = .03). Subgroup analyses found that the lower proba- 
bility of death was 
in individuals with CHF 
(HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.57–0.85, P < .001) and engaged 
participants (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.39–0.68, P < .001). 


In the intervention group, there were an average of 0.179 
admissions per quarter during baseline and 0.144 in the 
study period, a reduction of 0.035 per member per quarter 
(Table 2). Average quarterly hospitalizations for the con- 
trol group decreased by 0.002 visits per member per quar- 
ter, suggesting a net decline of 0.032 (18%) associated 
with HBP (95% CI = (cid:1)0.054 to (cid:1)0.010, P = .005) and a 
number needed to treat to avoid one hospitalization per 
quarter of 32 participants. No signiﬁcant relationship was 
found for quarterly number of hospital days conditional 
on hospitalization or for ED visits. 






Adjusted results for hospitalizations were consistent 
with univariate ﬁndings, with a decline of 0.034 more in 
the 
(95% 
CI = (cid:1)0.057 to (cid:1)0.016, P < .001) (Table 2). Addition- 
ally, 
in reductions between inpatient 
admissions of participants with COPD and engaged par- 
ticipants and the reductions of 
their matched controls 
(COPD subgroup, P = .03; engaged subgroup, P = .003) 
were larger than difference in reductions between the 
overall 
their 
intervention group and the reductions of 
matched controls. 

Results were 
similar when additional quarters were 
included. Including the two quarters surrounding program 
implementation resulted in an estimated net reduction of 
0.018 (95% CI = (cid:1)0.037 to 0.001, P = .06) in average 
quarterly admissions. Including the quarter of death for 
participants who died resulted in an estimated reduction 
(95% CI = (cid:1)0.057 to (cid:1)0.014, 
of 0.035 admissions 
P = .001). 
Utilization and Cox proportional hazard model results 
using matching without replacement (n = 1,480 HBP and 
1,480 control participants) were generally consistent with 
the main analyses. Although the lower mortality trend was 
statistically insigniﬁcant in the overall sample (HR = 0.88, 
95% CI = 0.74–1.03, P = .11), the lower mortality associ- 
ated with HBP in the subgroup with CHF (HR = 0.71, 
95% CI = 0.56–0.91, P = .006) and the engaged subgroup 
(HR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.34–0.65, P < .001) was still evi- 
dent. Matching without replacement was not the preferred 
approach because it reduced the precision of matches, 
potentially accounting for the higher P-value, although 
similarity of the estimates conﬁrmed that matching some 
control observations multiple times did not drive the main 
result.

aUnivariate comparisons of central tendencies used Wilcoxon tests for con- 
tinuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. 
b Baseline comorbidities were diagnosed based upon at least two claims 
with the related International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
codes, excluding laboratory or radiology claims. 

The growing prevalence of chronic conditions poses chal- 
lenges to the healthcare system. This study evaluated an 
intervention integrating telehealth with care management 
in participants with chronic disease. Two-year mortality 
for HBP was 15% lower than propensity score–matched 
controls, and admissions were 18% lower, but an effect 
on ED visits and hospital days was not found. 
This study was designed to investigate overall relation- 
ships between HBP, utilization, and mortality. It did not 
provide sufﬁcient data to identify underlying mechanisms 
for the observed effect, but several possibilities warrant 
further research. HBP includes components that could 
facilitate 
in areas 
including exercise, diet, medication adherence, and com- 
munication with providers.22 Use of HBP may lead partici- 
to better understand their health conditions, 
pants 
improving self-care and reducing hospitalizations.23 



Health Buddy Program may also improve the ability 
of care managers to respond quickly to changes in patient 
conditions, which may be associated with better out- 
comes.24 Some literature also links hospitalization itself 
with new and worsening geriatric health conditions 25 in 
addition to a subsequent greater mortality risk.26,27 An 
intervention that reduces hospitalizations, as this interven- 
tion appears to do, may be able to reduce mortality 
through this mechanism. 
These ﬁndings 
that effects of HBP vary 
according to disease subgroup. Individuals with CHF expe- 
rienced the strongest survival effect, consistent with previ- 
ous work showing an effect of remote telemonitoring 
on mortality for individuals with CHF.28 The largest 
reduction in hospitalizations was found for the COPD 
subgroup. COPD is progressive; 
lung function typically 
worsens over time even with the best available care.29 
Pharmacotherapy is typically used to control symptoms 
and reduce severity and frequency of exacerbations.29 
Because exacerbations are the main cause of healthcare 
utilization,30 it seems plausible that a care management 
program aimed at improving medication adherence and 
timely access to care could reduce exacerbation-related 
healthcare utilization. In a subgroup analysis, participants 
in the HBP group who engaged with the system at least 
one time had lower mortality and fewer hospital admis- 
sions than the subset of the intervention group who never

used the system. Although there may be selection effects in 
this subgroup, these ﬁndings suggest an opportunity to 
increase participation and better target the HBP selection 
toward particular groups of 
individuals who are most 
likely to use the program and beneﬁt from it. Future analy- 
ses could investigate this possibility.

Although the approaches shared certain features, the cur- 
rent study used a different approach to select a control 
group with the CMS 5% sample. Speciﬁcally, the control 
group was based on the selection algorithm used to iden- 
tify the intervention group and matched using propensity 
score methods. Disease subgroups were also evaluated, and 
different analytical methods were employed in an attempt 
to account explicitly for time trends in utilization. The 
conclusions also shared some similarities, notably the ﬁnd- 
ings toward reductions in utilization and mortality for the 
HBP group. 
Previous evaluations of the effectiveness of telehealth 
technologies have found mixed results. For example, a ran- 
domized controlled trial comparing telemonitoring with 
usual care at the Mayo Clinic in older adults with multiple 
health conditions found that telemonitoring was associated

DM = diabetes mellitus; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CHF = congestive heart failure. 
aUnivariate comparisons of central tendencies used t-tests for continuous variables. 
b Calculated as (intervention sample study period outcome–intervention sample baseline period outcome)–(control sample study period outcome–control 
sample baseline period outcome). 
cPredictions were estimated using panel negative binomial models. Control variables were those criteria with P < .10 after matching. 
dQuarterly number of inpatient admissions and emergency department visits were calculated based on the average total number of claims for that category 
in each quarter. 
eHospital days per quarter was calculated based on the claim utilization day count variable and was measured conditional on being hospitalized. 
with signiﬁcantly higher risk of mortality and nonsigniﬁcantly 
higher rates of hospitalizations, ED visits, and total hospi- 
tal days.31 This study differed from the current one, which 
found that HBP was associated with signiﬁcantly lower 
all-cause mortality for individuals with CHF and DM and 
nonsigniﬁcantly lower all-cause mortality for those with 
COPD. It also found signiﬁcantly fewer hospitalizations 
for individuals with COPD but nonsigniﬁcantly fewer for 
those with CHF and DM. There are two important differ- 
ences between these studies that may have affected the 
outcomes. First, the Health Buddy is a different telehealth 
system, which may lead to different associations with the 
individual and outcomes. Second, participants were similar 
at baseline in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and 
important resource utilization categories. Although partici- 
pants randomized to telemonitoring or usual care at the 
Mayo Clinic had similar baseline characteristics, 
there 
were substantially higher baseline rates of ED visits in the 
telemonitoring group (73%) than with usual care (40%), 
suggesting that, despite randomization, there may be some 
underlying difference between the groups.31 
By combining telehealth with care management, the 
HBP is interactive for individuals and care managers. This 
integrated approach may teach individuals to understand 
their medical conditions and improve health behaviors. 
Similarly, care managers with better information may be 
able to reinforce positive behavior by helping beneﬁciaries 
manage their conditions. Care managers may also be able 
to identify beneﬁciaries requiring attention and can intervene 
before the condition worsens. 
The main strength of this study was the use of statisti- 
cal methods to compensate for the lack of a randomized 
control trial design. Propensity score–matching methods 
improved the balance in covariates between the two 
groups, and the difference-in-differences approach allowed 
for the evaluation of an intervention effect while control- 
ling for time-invariant unobservable factors. 
The study had some limitations. First, the data did 
sociodemographic information 
not contain clinical or 
(e.g., 
income or educational attainment) because claims 
collected for administrative purposes were used. Any 
underlying differences in these characteristics could not 
be controlled for and may have affected results. Addition- 
ally, 5% Medicare data identify dates of services at the 
quarter level, making analysis of readmissions impossible. 
the demonstration project was based on sole 
Second, 
community providers in the Paciﬁc Northwest, potentially 
limiting generalizability of these ﬁndings. In addition, this 
study was designed to compare usual care with an inter- 
vention that combined telehealth and care management. 
It did not attempt to demonstrate the added value of tele- 
health over care management without telehealth. It also 
did not investigate different patterns of HBP use (e.g., 
length and frequency of engagement) and the ways in 
which these patterns affected outcomes. Further research 
into these areas is warranted. Like all studies based on 




retrospective analysis of nonrandomized settings, 
this 
analysis could not prove causality with certainty. Addi- 
tional prospective studies would be valuable to further 
verify the ﬁndings. 
These ﬁndings show that the availability of HBP was 
associated with fewer hospitalizations and longer survival 
in a group of Medicare beneﬁciaries with chronic disease 
and suggest that integrated telehealth and disease manage- 
ment could offer a valuable approach to improving care 
for high-cost Medicare beneﬁciaries with complex chronic 
conditions.
