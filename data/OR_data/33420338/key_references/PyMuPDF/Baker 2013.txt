OBJECTIVES: To evaluate mortality and healthcare utili-
zation effects of an intervention that combined care man-
agement
and
telehealth,
targeting
individuals
with
congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, or diabetes mellitus.
DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study.
SETTING: Northwest United States.
PARTICIPANTS: High-cost Medicare fee-for-service ben-
eﬁciaries (N = 1,767) enrolled in two Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services demonstration participating clinics
and a propensity-score matched control group.
INTERVENTION: The Health Buddy Program, which
integrates a content-driven telehealth system with care
management.
MEASUREMENTS: Mortality, inpatient admissions, hos-
pital days, and emergency department (ED) visits during
the 2-year study period were measured. Cox-proportional
hazard models and negative binomial regression models
were used to assess the relationship between the interven-
tion and survival and utilization, controlling for demo-
graphic and health characteristics that were statistically
different between groups after matching.
RESULTS: At 2 years, participants offered the Health
Buddy Program had 15% lower risk-adjusted all-cause mor-
tality (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85, 95% conﬁdence interval
(CI) = 0.74–0.98; P = .03) and had reductions in the num-
ber of quarterly inpatient admissions from baseline to the
study period that were 18% greater than those of matched
controls during this same time period (0.035 vs 0.003;
difference-in-differences = 0.032, 95% CI = 0.054 to
0.010, P = .005). No relationship was found between
the Health Buddy Program and ED use or number of hos-
pital days for participants who were hospitalized. The
Health Buddy Program was most strongly associated with
fewer admissions for individuals with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and mortality for those with congestive
heart failure.
CONCLUSION: Care management coupled with content-
driven telehealth technology has potential to improve
health outcomes in high-cost Medicare beneﬁciaries. J Am

C
hronic diseases are associated with considerable mor-
bidity, mortality, and costs, and managing them well
is of considerable interest.1 Barriers to effective manage-
ment can arise because of coordination and communica-
tion gaps when individuals have multiple providers of
care.2 Better disease management may be a way to address
this challenge. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) has sponsored several demonstration pro-
jects emphasizing disease management for chronically ill
Medicare recipients,3,4 that provide important opportuni-
ties to investigate the effect of better disease management
on health outcomes. One demonstration project examined
the Health Buddy Program (HBP), which integrates care
management with the Health Buddy device, a telehealth
device located in an individual’s home and linked over the
telephone,
to
care
managers
to
facilitate
information
exchange. The current study analyzed the effect of the
HBP on healthcare utilization and mortality.
Previous evaluations have considered care manage-
ment and telehealth programs separately and reported
mixed
results.5–10
Approaches
integrating
information
technology tools with care management appear promising
but are less well studied. Previous analyses have found an
association between the HBP, lower costs, and longer
survival in Medicare beneﬁciaries,11,12 and beneﬁts of HBP
in a Veterans Affairs setting.13,14
In contrast to prior publications, this article focuses
on mortality and healthcare utilization effects, particularly

hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits.
Hospitalizations are of interest because they can amplify
morbidity and age-related physiological changes. Hospital-
ization itself poses risks to elderly adults because of lack
of mobility, lower activity levels, and iatrogenic risks.15
METHODS
The Intervention
The Health Buddy device is a small electronic device with
a high-resolution screen and four large buttons designed to
easily collect information from individuals regarding their
symptoms, vital signs, mental health, knowledge, and
health
behaviors.
Participants
received
daily
questions
related to their diagnoses (e.g., “Do you have more short-
ness of breath than usual today?”) and responded using the
buttons. Responses were uploaded to a software system
accessible over a secure Web portal that risk-stratiﬁed
responses to support daily care manager review. The sys-
tem identiﬁed the need for intervention based on signals
such as deteriorating clinical signs (e.g., shortness of breath
at all times vs with activity), lack of response, or gaps in
individuals’ knowledge and behaviors, potentially improv-
ing coordination of appropriate services and contact with
providers.12 It also provided appropriate feedback and edu-
cational information to individuals about their condition
that may have improved self-care (e.g., “Call your doctor
today to report your increased shortness of breath” or “Be
sure to take rest breaks in between your routine activities.
This is called activity pacing. If this increased shortness of
breath continues, call your doctor to report it”).
The HBP demonstration project was implemented at
two multispecialty clinics located in Bend, Oregon, and
Wenatchee, Washington. The demonstration targeted indi-
viduals
with
congestive
heart
failure
(CHF),
chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or diabetes mel-
litus (DM).12 To select intervention participants, beneﬁcia-
ries residing in a county that the two clinics primarily
served were identiﬁed from Medicare records. A selection
algorithm then identiﬁed participants with the targeted
conditions who were loyal to a study clinic (had ≥2 visits
at the clinic or received more care from the clinic than any
other). The algorithm selected only those who were not in
hospice, did not have conditions that would limit interac-
tion with HBP or its effectiveness (e.g., dementia, blind-
ness), or had high-cost conditions unlikely to be affected
by HBP, such as end-stage renal disease. A full list of tar-
get exclusionary comorbidities is available upon request.
Demonstration participants were selected at two time
points. The ﬁrst cohort comprised 763 beneﬁciaries identi-
ﬁed in early 2006. The second cohort consisted of 1,056
beneﬁciaries identiﬁed in early 2007 to expand the study
and account for attrition. Care managers from each clinic
contacted and invited selected participants over a period of
several months beginning in February 2006 and 2007 for
the ﬁrst and second cohorts, respectively.
Analytical Overview
This project examined the relationship between the HBP
and
mortality
and
healthcare
utilization,
including
inpatient admissions, hospital days for those admitted,
and ED visits, by comparing the intervention group with
a propensity-matched control group. An intention-to-treat
approach was used, considering all participants offered
HBP as the intervention group, regardless of whether they
used it. Approximately 37% of the intervention popula-
tion inputted information into the system at least once
(“engaged” the system). Engaged participants used Health
Buddy for 300 days during the demonstration, on aver-
age.
Changes in utilization measures for the intervention
and control participants from a 1-year period before
the intervention was offered (baseline) were compared
with a 2-year period afterward (study period). Hazard
models were used to study differences in survival for
the intervention and control groups during the study
period.
Data Sources and Matching Controls
Data for intervention participants came from ﬁnalized
Medicare claims that CMS provided from the demonstra-
tion project. Control data came from Medicare claims
from a 5% random sample of all beneﬁciaries (CMS 5%
sample).16 Mortality (date of death) was observable from
enrollment ﬁles linked to Social Security Administration
death records.
To construct the propensity-matched control group,
Paciﬁc
Northwest
counties
similar
to
Bend
and
Wenatchee in terms of demographic characteristics and
hospital markets (control county selection criteria avail-
able upon request) 17 were identiﬁed, and Medicare bene-
ﬁciaries in the CMS 5% sample residing in those areas
were selected. Propensity-score matching was then used
to select beneﬁciaries who most resembled intervention
participants18 using probit regression models for each
cohort. Being offered HBP was the dependent variable,
and
demographic
characteristics,
diagnoses,
Medicare
Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk scores,19
and baseline utilization were independent variables. Con-
trol and intervention participants were matched 1:1 with
replacement based on closest propensity scores, requiring
scores within 0.01. A sufﬁciently close match could not
be found for 52 intervention participants, and they were
excluded (propensity score distribution available upon
request).
Measurements
Mortality was based on validated date of death. Quarterly
measures of the number of inpatient admissions, hospital
days for those admitted, and ED visits were constructed
for each beneﬁciary. Quarters (3-month intervals) for
intervention participants were aligned to match the Febru-
ary 1 start date of the intervention. Participant age and
sex and presence of CHF, COPD, or DM were coded
based on information available in claims data. Other com-
orbidities were used to construct the Elixhauser index,20
excluding CHF, COPD, and DM because they were
included in the matching model. Disease conditions were
identiﬁed based on diagnosis codes using Medicare claims
(codes available upon request).

Statistical Analysis
SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc,. Cary, NC) and Stata 10.1
(StataCorp, College Station, TX) were used for analyses.
Unadjusted survival rates in the study period were
evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.
To adjust for potential differences in participant characteris-
tics, Cox proportional hazard models were used, in which
the dependent variable was time from the ﬁrst day of HBP
availability until death or the end of the study period,
controlling for demographic and health characteristics
from the propensity-score matching algorithm that were
statistically different between the groups after matching
(P < .10) (full regression results available upon request).
Utilization was studied using the year before HBP began
as a baseline and comparing changes in utilization over the
study period.13 Utilization analyses presented here include
only quarters in which the participant was alive and enrolled
in Medicare Part A and B for the whole quarter and exclude
quarters immediately before and after HBP became available
to account for uncertainty in the effective intervention start
time.12 For participants who died, the utilization analyses
also excluded data from the quarter of death. In multivariate
analyses, panel negative binomial models in which the
dependent variable was quarterly utilization were used.
Important explanatory variables were intervention status, a
study period indicator, and the interaction of these two
indicators. The models also controlled for relevant demo-
graphic and health characteristics. Results from the model
were used to compute predicted quarterly utilization esti-
mates, holding control characteristics ﬁxed at their sample
means. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using t-tests
for continuous variables, chi-square tests for categorical vari-
ables in univariate analysis, and bootstrapped conﬁdence
intervals (CIs) for the multivariate predictions.21
Subgroup Analyses
All members of the intervention group were initially ana-
lyzed regardless of their active participation in the program.
Results for participants who ever used the system (engaged)
and those who never did (non-engaged) were compared sep-
arately with those of controls with closest propensity-score
matches. Separate models were used to explore the interven-
tion and control group members with each targeted health
condition because these conditions are diverse, and the sys-
tem may have inﬂuenced disease groups differently.
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses were performed including quarters sur-
rounding program implementation and including the quar-
ter of death for participants who died. Whether the use of
propensity-score matching with replacement biased ﬁnd-
ings was also investigated by creating another control
group using matching without replacement.
RESULTS
Participant demographics and clinical characteristics were
similar between intervention (n = 1,767) and matched
control (n = 1,767) participants (Table 1).
Mortality
Health Buddy Program was associated with lower risk of
mortality
in
unadjusted
survival
analysis
(P = .01)
(Figure 1). In Cox proportional hazard models, HBP was
associated with a 15% lower risk-adjusted probability of
death (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74–0.98,
P = .03). Subgroup analyses found that the lower proba-
bility of death was largest in individuals with CHF
(HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.57–0.85, P < .001) and engaged
participants (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.39–0.68, P < .001).
Healthcare Utilization
In the intervention group, there were an average of 0.179
admissions per quarter during baseline and 0.144 in the
study period, a reduction of 0.035 per member per quarter
(Table 2). Average quarterly hospitalizations for the con-
trol group decreased by 0.002 visits per member per quar-
ter, suggesting a net decline of 0.032 (18%) associated
with HBP (95% CI = 0.054 to 0.010, P = .005) and a
number needed to treat to avoid one hospitalization per
quarter of 32 participants. No signiﬁcant relationship was
found for quarterly number of hospital days conditional
on hospitalization or for ED visits.
Adjusted results for hospitalizations were consistent
with univariate ﬁndings, with a decline of 0.034 more in
the
intervention
group
than
in
controls
(95%
CI = 0.057 to 0.016, P < .001) (Table 2). Addition-
ally,
the
differences
in
reductions
between
inpatient
admissions of participants with COPD and engaged par-
ticipants and the reductions of their matched controls
(COPD subgroup, P = .03; engaged subgroup, P = .003)
were larger than difference in reductions between the
overall intervention group and the reductions of their
matched controls.
Sensitivity Analysis
Results
were
similar
when
additional
quarters
were
included. Including the two quarters surrounding program
implementation resulted in an estimated net reduction of
0.018 (95% CI = 0.037 to 0.001, P = .06) in average
quarterly admissions. Including the quarter of death for
participants who died resulted in an estimated reduction
of
0.035
admissions
(95%
CI = 0.057
to
0.014,
P = .001).
Utilization and Cox proportional hazard model results
using matching without replacement (n = 1,480 HBP and
1,480 control participants) were generally consistent with
the main analyses. Although the lower mortality trend was
statistically insigniﬁcant in the overall sample (HR = 0.88,
95% CI = 0.74–1.03, P = .11), the lower mortality associ-
ated with HBP in the subgroup with CHF (HR = 0.71,
95% CI = 0.56–0.91, P = .006) and the engaged subgroup
(HR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.34–0.65, P < .001) was still evi-
dent. Matching without replacement was not the preferred
approach because it reduced the precision of matches,
potentially accounting for the higher P-value, although
similarity of the estimates conﬁrmed that matching some
control observations multiple times did not drive the main
result.

DISCUSSION
The growing prevalence of chronic conditions poses chal-
lenges to the healthcare system. This study evaluated an
intervention integrating telehealth with care management
in participants with chronic disease. Two-year mortality
for HBP was 15% lower than propensity score–matched
controls, and admissions were 18% lower, but an effect
on ED visits and hospital days was not found.
This study was designed to investigate overall relation-
ships between HBP, utilization, and mortality. It did not
provide sufﬁcient data to identify underlying mechanisms
for the observed effect, but several possibilities warrant
further research. HBP includes components that could
facilitate
improvements
in
self-management
in
areas
including exercise, diet, medication adherence, and com-
munication with providers.22 Use of HBP may lead partici-
pants
to
better
understand
their
health
conditions,
improving self-care and reducing hospitalizations.23
Health Buddy Program may also improve the ability
of care managers to respond quickly to changes in patient
conditions, which may be associated with better out-
comes.24 Some literature also links hospitalization itself
with new and worsening geriatric health conditions 25 in
addition to a subsequent greater mortality risk.26,27 An
intervention that reduces hospitalizations, as this interven-
tion appears to do, may be able to reduce mortality
through this mechanism.
These
ﬁndings
suggest
that
effects
of
HBP
vary
according to disease subgroup. Individuals with CHF expe-
rienced the strongest survival effect, consistent with previ-
ous work showing an effect of remote telemonitoring
on mortality for individuals with CHF.28 The largest
reduction in hospitalizations was found for the COPD
subgroup. COPD is progressive; lung function typically
worsens over time even with the best available care.29
Pharmacotherapy is typically used to control symptoms
and reduce severity and frequency of exacerbations.29
Because exacerbations are the main cause of healthcare
utilization,30 it seems plausible that a care management
program aimed at improving medication adherence and
timely access to care could reduce exacerbation-related
healthcare utilization. In a subgroup analysis, participants
in the HBP group who engaged with the system at least
one time had lower mortality and fewer hospital admis-
sions than the subset of the intervention group who never

used the system. Although there may be selection effects in
this subgroup, these ﬁndings suggest an opportunity to
increase participation and better target the HBP selection
toward particular groups of individuals who are most
likely to use the program and beneﬁt from it. Future analy-
ses could investigate this possibility.
This study was conducted independently of a CMS-
sponsored evaluation of the demonstration program.11
Although the approaches shared certain features, the cur-
rent study used a different approach to select a control
group with the CMS 5% sample. Speciﬁcally, the control
group was based on the selection algorithm used to iden-
tify the intervention group and matched using propensity
score methods. Disease subgroups were also evaluated, and
different analytical methods were employed in an attempt
to account explicitly for time trends in utilization. The
conclusions also shared some similarities, notably the ﬁnd-
ings toward reductions in utilization and mortality for the
HBP group.
Previous evaluations of the effectiveness of telehealth
technologies have found mixed results. For example, a ran-
domized controlled trial comparing telemonitoring with
usual care at the Mayo Clinic in older adults with multiple
health conditions found that telemonitoring was associated

with signiﬁcantly higher risk of mortality and nonsigniﬁcantly
higher rates of hospitalizations, ED visits, and total hospi-
tal days.31 This study differed from the current one, which
found that HBP was associated with signiﬁcantly lower
all-cause mortality for individuals with CHF and DM and
nonsigniﬁcantly lower all-cause mortality for those with
COPD. It also found signiﬁcantly fewer hospitalizations
for individuals with COPD but nonsigniﬁcantly fewer for
those with CHF and DM. There are two important differ-
ences between these studies that may have affected the
outcomes. First, the Health Buddy is a different telehealth
system, which may lead to different associations with the
individual and outcomes. Second, participants were similar
at baseline in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and
important resource utilization categories. Although partici-
pants randomized to telemonitoring or usual care at the
Mayo Clinic had similar baseline characteristics, there
were substantially higher baseline rates of ED visits in the
telemonitoring group (73%) than with usual care (40%),
suggesting that, despite randomization, there may be some
underlying difference between the groups.31
By combining telehealth with care management, the
HBP is interactive for individuals and care managers. This
integrated approach may teach individuals to understand
their medical conditions and improve health behaviors.
Similarly, care managers with better information may be
able to reinforce positive behavior by helping beneﬁciaries
manage their conditions. Care managers may also be able
to identify beneﬁciaries requiring attention and can intervene
before the condition worsens.
The main strength of this study was the use of statisti-
cal methods to compensate for the lack of a randomized
control trial design. Propensity score–matching methods
improved the balance in covariates between the two
groups, and the difference-in-differences approach allowed
for the evaluation of an intervention effect while control-
ling for time-invariant unobservable factors.
The study had some limitations. First, the data did
not
contain
clinical
or
sociodemographic
information
(e.g., income or educational attainment) because claims
collected
for administrative
purposes were
used. Any
underlying differences in these characteristics could not
be controlled for and may have affected results. Addition-
ally, 5% Medicare data identify dates of services at the
quarter level, making analysis of readmissions impossible.
Second, the demonstration project was based on sole
community providers in the Paciﬁc Northwest, potentially
limiting generalizability of these ﬁndings. In addition, this
study was designed to compare usual care with an inter-
vention that combined telehealth and care management.
It did not attempt to demonstrate the added value of tele-
health over care management without telehealth. It also
did not investigate different patterns of HBP use (e.g.,
length and frequency of engagement) and the ways in
which these patterns affected outcomes. Further research
into these areas is warranted. Like all studies based on

DM = diabetes mellitus; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CHF = congestive heart failure.
aUnivariate comparisons of central tendencies used t-tests for continuous variables.
b Calculated as (intervention sample study period outcome–intervention sample baseline period outcome)–(control sample study period outcome–control
sample baseline period outcome).
cPredictions were estimated using panel negative binomial models. Control variables were those criteria with P < .10 after matching.
dQuarterly number of inpatient admissions and emergency department visits were calculated based on the average total number of claims for that category
in each quarter.
eHospital days per quarter was calculated based on the claim utilization day count variable and was measured conditional on being hospitalized.

retrospective
analysis
of
nonrandomized
settings,
this
analysis could not prove causality with certainty. Addi-
tional prospective studies would be valuable to further
verify the ﬁndings.
These ﬁndings show that the availability of HBP was
associated with fewer hospitalizations and longer survival
in a group of Medicare beneﬁciaries with chronic disease
and suggest that integrated telehealth and disease manage-
ment could offer a valuable approach to improving care
for high-cost Medicare beneﬁciaries with complex chronic
conditions.
