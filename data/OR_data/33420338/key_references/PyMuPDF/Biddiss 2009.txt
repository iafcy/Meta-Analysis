Summary
We have studied how well the need for a medical intervention can be predicted by a telecare monitoring system. During a
study period of about 18 months, 45 elderly individuals with congestive heart failure used a home health monitor to enter
daily information pertaining to their symptoms and health status. A total of 8576 alerts were generated by the monitoring
system, although in most cases, patient and service provider interaction was not required. When system alerts were
considered to be serious, or if symptoms persisted, the patient was contacted. A total of 171 key medical events (6 deaths;
28 hospital admissions; 59 changes in medication; 54 cases of advice given; 24 instances where immediate medical
attention was recommended) were recorded in the monitoring logs. A multivariate logistic regression model was
developed to predict these medical interventions/events. The model correctly predicted key medical events in 75% of
cases with a speciﬁcity of 74% and an overall cross-validated accuracy of 74% (95% CI, 68–80%). Key predictors included
the number of system alerts, self-rated mobility, self-rated health and self-rated anxiety. This suggests that subjective
measures are useful in addition to physiological ones for predicting health status. A multivariate decision support model
has potential to supplement practitioners and current telecare systems in identifying heart failure patients in need of
medical intervention.
Introduction
In the United States, 4.8 million people are affected by
chronic heart failure (CHF). The associated health-care costs
amount to $38.1 billion annually.1 Regular monitoring is
especially pertinent to the management of CHF where signs
of diminishing health may be subtle and difﬁcult to
recognize.1,2 Nevertheless, it has been suggested that many
of these symptoms of worsening health (i.e. oedema,
dyspnoea, weight gain) present 8 to 12 days before
hospitalization.3 Telecare systems may be a cost-effective
and patient-acceptable way of identifying the problems.3,4
Despite growing interest and investment in this area,
there remain numerous questions as to how to achieve the
greatest increase in clinical and cost effectiveness.5
For instance, questions remain about the best predictors for
a particular cardiovascular population.6 We have therefore
studied how well the need for a medical intervention can be
predicted by a telecare monitoring system based on
self-rated health-related quality of life (HQOL), physical
symptoms, lifestyle and physiological measurements in
individuals with CHF.
Methods
A review of Barnsley Hospital records identiﬁed potential
participants for the study. All participants had
echocardiographic evidence of heart failure and
conventional symptoms. The exclusion criteria were: (1)
ejection fraction .40%; (2) unstable angina; (3) age less
than 60 years; (4) debilitating dementia or psychiatric
disorder; (5) inability to comprehend words presented on
an electronic screen; (6) planned coronary revascularization
procedures; (7) on a waiting list for heart transplantation;
(8) participation in another, conﬂicting heart failure
research study within the past 6 months; (9) lack of an
operational home telephone line and a nearby electrical
socket; and (10) not living in the mainstream housing
sector (e.g. residential or nursing care).

Data collection
Participants were provided with a health monitor
(Doc@Home, Docobo Inc, Shefﬁeld, UK) through which
they entered daily information pertaining to their
symptoms and health status through a set of questions
developed by the research and clinical team. Daily
measurements of blood pressure and pulse rate were
recorded using a wireless monitor (UA-767 Plus BT, A&D
Medical). Daily weight was also measured (HCV800,
Hanson). Twice weekly, patients also completed a
health-related quality of life measure (EQ-5D)7 directly on
the health monitoring unit, giving data on self-rated health
(visual analogue scale), mobility, self-care, usual activities,
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The data were
transmitted at night through telephone lines and screened
for abnormalities. If the data fell outside user-speciﬁc limits,
clinicians were notiﬁed. This therefore provided two
additional sets of data: (a) a daily record of system alerts
generated by the home monitoring system in accordance
with the variables listed in Table 1, and (b) a qualitative log
of clinical interventions and medical events recorded by the
monitoring health-care staff. The study was approved by the
appropriate ethics committee.
Data analysis
The data analysis was conducted using standard statistical
software (SPSS 14.0). Logistic Regression (LR)8–12 was used
to predict the occurrence of key medical events/
interventions as extracted from the health-care practitioner
logs. For each week of the study, the average/median values
of predictor variables were calculated, the number of system
alerts was enumerated, and the presence of a key medical
event or intervention was noted from the logs of
monitoring health-care practitioners. The rationale for this
approach was two-fold:
(1)
Data were collected with varying frequency (either
weekly, twice a week or daily);
(2)
A time lag was evident between user-inputted data,
generated system alerts and nurse responses.
Stepwise, forward selection based on the log likelihood ratio
was used to avoid over-ﬁtting the model.8 The importance
of all potential interactions was evaluated via the likelihood
ratio test. The model’s goodness of ﬁt was assessed based on
changes in deviance (i.e. .4 indicating a poor ﬁt).12
Models were evaluated using K-fold cross validation with
K ¼ 10. Due to the large number of non-events (i.e. a
meaningful health-care intervention was not required) in
comparison to key events (i.e. a meaningful health-care
intervention was required), over-sampling13,14 was used to
obtain a balanced data set. The approximate proportion of key
events to non-events was maintained in each test set.
The sensitivity (i.e. the proportion of key events that were
correctly classiﬁed), speciﬁcity (i.e. the proportion of non-
events that were correctly classiﬁed) and overall prediction
accuracy were used to evaluate the performance of the model.
Results
Of the 45 participants, six individuals died during the
course of the study and eight returned their equipment.
The average duration of data collection was 18 months
(SD ¼ 5). The patient characteristics are summarised in
Table 2.
Predicting the need for medical intervention
A total of 8576 alerts were generated by the monitoring
system. In most cases, the response to system alerts did not
require patient and service provider interaction. When
system alerts were considered of greater severity, or if
symptoms persisted, the patient was contacted. A total of
171 key medical events (6 deaths; 28 hospital admissions;
59 changes in medication; 54 cases of advice given; 24
instances where immediate medical attention was
recommended) were recorded in the monitoring logs. There
were 154 weeks during which one or more key medical
events occurred and 2779 weeks during which no key
medical events were observed for the participants.
Generation of a system alert and subsequent response by a
health-care practitioner was not considered a key medical
event unless a speciﬁc action was actually required and
taken (i.e. false alarms were not counted as key medical
events). In order to obtain an approximately balanced
dataset, key medical events were over-sampled by a rate of
18 times. The average number of medical events
experienced per patient per year was 3.5 (with a median of
2 and an interquartile range of 1–4). The average number of
non-key alerts generated per patient per year was 49 (with a

median of 49 and an interquartile range of 47–51).
The average percentage of total alerts that were identiﬁed
as key medical events was 6.4% (with a median of 4 and
an interquartile range of 1.4–8).
Table 3 summarizes the univariate signiﬁcance of
predictor variables. All variables with a P value ,0.1 were
examined for inclusion in the logistic regression model in
accordance with the guidelines in Hosmer & Lemeshow.12
Some of the variables were highly correlated (see Table 3).
For example, self-rated mobility and self-rated pain were
highly correlated (r ¼ 0.74, P , 0.01). In these cases, the
strongest predictor in the group of correlated variables
was selected for inclusion in the model.
The best multivariate logistic regression model for
prediction of key medical interventions/events is shown in
Table 4. The number of alerts generated by the system
emerged as the primary predictor. As shown by the odds
ratio (eb ¼ 1.196) listed in Table 4, for every additional
system alert generated, the probability of a key medical
event increased by 19.6%. On its own, this variable
predicted 82% of non-events and 61% of key events with an
unadjusted coefﬁcient of b ¼ 0.183. The addition of
subjective factors (i.e. self-rated mobility, health and
anxiety) improved prediction signiﬁcantly (log likelihood
ratio, P , 0.001). The ROC (receiver-operator curve) for this
revised model is shown in Figure 1a. With a classiﬁcation
cut-off probability of 0.5, the overall cross-validated
prediction accuracy was 74% (95% CI, 68–80). Most
importantly, the sensitivity (i.e. prediction of key events)
was increased from 61% to 75% with a speciﬁcity
(prediction of non-events) of 74%. With a maximum
sensitivity of approximately 80%, the speciﬁcity dropped to
67% (cut-off ¼ 0.62). The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the
model for a range of classiﬁcation cut-off values is shown in
Figure 1b. Of the data, 100% of key medical events and 97%
of non-events were well-ﬁtted (i.e. change in deviance ,4).
Approximately 72% of poorly ﬁtted data points were
associated with four particular participants. A signiﬁcantly
higher number of daily system alerts (1.5) were associated
with these patients as compared to the average (0.5),
P , 0.001.
Finally, a breakdown of all the daily system alerts (n ¼
8576) generated by the telecare monitoring system
indicated that a large proportion of the total number of
alerts were attributable to the physiological measurements,
namely pulse rate, blood pressure and weight gain.
In response to these alerts, monitoring practitioners
typically ﬂagged the patient for elevated observation. If the
symptom persisted, a telephone call was made to ascertain
the health of the patient and possible reasons for the
physiological change (e.g. over-eating or an unrelated cold).

In approximately 86% of cases, alerts generated by these
physiological measures were not accompanied by a key
medical event/intervention. Alerts pertaining to physical
and psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, swollen
ankles and the need for extra pillows at night, were most
often correct in predicting a key event (Figure 2).
Discussion
The model predicted key medical events/interventions with
an overall accuracy of 74% (95% CI, 68–80). With a
classiﬁcation cut-off probability of 0.5, the sensitivity of the
model was 75% and the speciﬁcity was 74%. To minimize
the risk of not identifying the need for medical
intervention, a higher classiﬁcation cut-off probability
could be used. This increase in sensitivity is of course
accompanied by a decrease in speciﬁcity (i.e. more false
alarms). The strongest predictor in this model was the
cumulative number of system alerts generated in a given
week. As can be seen in Figure 2, it is the system alerts
stemming from patients’ subjective descriptions of their
symptoms as opposed to the physiological metrics that are
most indicative of the need for medical intervention.
This implies that patients are giving medically meaningful
reports of their symptoms. With additional predictors based
on subjective health perceptions (i.e. self-rated mobility,
health and anxiety), correct predictions of key medical
events were improved from 61% to 75%. Consequently,
in order to increase the effectiveness of telecare systems, it
may be important to record more than just physiological
variables. Further research to explore a wider range of
potential predictors is needed.
The performance of the model’s predictions was
compared to the clinicians’ responses. To estimate the
positive predictivity (i.e. the ratio of true key events to the

study. In approximately 15% of cases, this symptom was associated with a key medical intervention/
event, whereas in 85% of cases, it was not associated with a key medical intervention/event

total number of key events predicted) of the clinicians,
the assumption was made that contact with a patient that
ensued from a medical concern, but did not result in a key
intervention, was a false alarm (i.e. a false positive).
Thus the positive predictivity was estimated to be 39% for
clinicians as compared to 75% for the decision-support
model. Two thirds of all false alarms generated by the model
(i.e. incorrectly predicted key events) were instances where
the clinician involved also demonstrated a heightened
concern for the patient and decided to increase monitoring
of and/or contact the patient based on the information
collected. This suggests that, although incorrect in its
prediction of a key medical event in these cases, the
decision-support model did identify instances of elevated
risk in line with clinicians’ assessments.
Clinical signiﬁcance
It is important to emphasize that predictive models should
be regarded as a tool to assist, not supersede, clinical
decision making and prioritizing. Furthermore, ‘non-key
interventions’ (i.e. contact with patients that did not result
in a tangible medical intervention), may still have rendered
a meaningful health-care service by promoting patient
satisfaction, increasing conﬁdence in the quality of care
provided, alleviating feelings of social isolation, increasing
perceived social support, encouraging adherence to
treatment recommendations, addressing a co-morbidity or
other problem, and improving clinician-patient
relationships. All of these social and health-care perceptions
have been implicated as factors in hospital re-admission
rates, mortality and/or quality of life in CHF patients.1,2,15–
18 Increasingly, emphasis is being placed on patients with
CHF to self-care through initiatives such as the Expert
Patient Programme.19 It may be the case that telecare
systems with predictive modelling could complement such
initiatives. After all, early identiﬁcation of high-risk
patients, improved home care, and education on heart
failure and self-management, are fundamental strategies to
decrease morbidity and mortality among patients, and to
alleviate the economic burden of frequent hospital
re-admissions.20–22
Study limitations and future work
The present study explored the development of a
decision-support tool that incorporated physiological
measurements, physical symptoms and subjective
perspectives on health and well-being. We have identiﬁed a
few important predictors of health status and have explored
the factors framing self-rated HQOL. Larger datasets will
enable the development of more accurate, robust and
generalized models that can predict not only the occurrence
of a key medical event and/or need for intervention, but the
level of severity of the event.
Logistic regression does not account for the longitudinal
nature of the data. It is a ‘safe’ estimate in that it is more
likely to include potentially unimportant variables, rather
than excluding important predictors.23 Although the odds
ratios are likely to be similar, standard errors may be
underestimated in comparison with methods that account
for repeated measures such as generalized estimating
equations (GEE).23 The latter approach, however, requires
the assumption that missing data occur completely at
random and independently of the outcome variable. In our
study, missing data were commonly due to hospitalization
and the patient’s inability to access their home monitoring
system. For comparison purposes, a GEE model was
constructed. System alerts and self-rated mobility emerged
as the primary predictors with odds ratios similar to those of
the simple logistic regression model. As expected, the
standard errors calculated through GEE were signiﬁcantly
larger for both system alerts (SE ¼ 0.017) and self-rated
mobility (SE ¼ 0.225). The goodness-of-ﬁt measure for the
GEE model incorporating system alerts and self-rated
mobility was slightly higher than the model which also
included self-rated health and self-rated anxiety.
This implies that the latter two variables, although not
signiﬁcant predictors, may contribute to the goodness-of-ﬁt
of the GEE model.
The necessity of carrying out analyses on a weekly
basis to account for time delays between user inputs,
system response and clinical action, should also be noted.
Inconsistent adjustments of system parameters by
monitoring practitioners may also have occurred.
For example, for some individuals whose physiological
measurements had greater acceptable ﬂuctuations than
others, system limits were changed to eliminate superﬂuous
alerts, while for others, these alerts were simply ignored.
This may have affected the model ﬁt and issued a higher
number of false alarms. Differences in each individual’s
ability to self-manage (e.g. medication, diet) were not
captured in this analysis. It is also possible that some
individuals may have been more in tune with their health
needs than others and that the model could be reﬁned to
reﬂect patient variations in sensitivity or anxiety regarding
perceived symptoms.
Conclusions
Four important conclusions emerged from the study with
respect to the performance and development of telecare
systems. First, the system for health monitoring used in this
study proved useful in indicating when medical
interventions are needed. Second, the performance of the
systems could be improved by including targeted questions
relating to health outcomes. Third, self-perceived symptoms
and health status were valuable indicators. Last,
a multivariate decision support model has potential to
supplement practitioners and current telecare systems in
identifying CHF patients in need of medical intervention.
Inclusion of such systems in real time could enhance system
effectiveness, enable preventative health care and increase
practitioner efﬁciency.
