Abstract
Background: The reported efficacy of telemedicine in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is inconsistent among
studies, and data for complex IBD are lacking.
Objective: We aimed to evaluate the impact of remote monitoring using a Web system—Telemonitorización de la Enfermedad
de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa or Telemonitoring of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (TECCU)—as compared to standard
care and telephone care on health outcomes and health care in patients with complex IBD.
Methods: We performed a 3-arm randomized controlled trial. Adult patients with IBD who received immunosuppressants and
biological agents were recruited from the IBD Unit of a tertiary university hospital. The patients were randomized into groups
to receive remote monitoring (G_TECCU), nurse-assisted telephone care (G_NT), or standard care with in-person visits (G_control).
All patients completed the study visits at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks in addition to each type of intervention. The primary
outcome was the percentage of patients in remission at 24 weeks. Secondary health outcomes were quality of life, medication
adherence, adverse effects, satisfaction, and social activities. Data on the number of outpatient visits and telephone calls, emergency
visits, hospitalizations, IBD-related surgeries, and corticosteroid courses were also collected.
Results: A total of 63 patients were selected (21 patients in each group). During the study, 90.5% (19/21) of patients in G_control,
95.2% (20/21) in G_NT, and 85.7% (18/21) in G_TECCU were compliant to the intervention. After 24 weeks, the percentage of
patients in remission was higher in G_TECCU (17/21, 81%) than in G_NT (14/21, 66.7%) and G_control (15/21, 71.4%). A
higher improvement in disease activity was observed in G_TECCU than in G_control in terms of the Harvey-Bradshaw/Mayo
(odds ratio=0.12, 95% CI=0.003-2.162, P=.19) and Harvey-Bradshaw/Walmsley (odds ratio=0.11, 95% CI=0.004-1.55, P=.13)
indexes. Improvement in disease activity was associated with a larger reduction in fecal calprotectin values in G_TECCU compared

to G_control (estimated intervention effect: odds ratio=–0.90; 95% CI=–1.96 to 0.16, P=.11). All completers adhered to treatment
in G_TECCU. In addition, the quality of life, social activities, and satisfaction improved in all 3 groups. Although the number
of outpatient visits and telephone calls was lower in G_TECCU than in G_NT and G_control, the safety profile was similar in
all 3 groups.
Conclusions: This pilot clinical trial suggests that the TECCU Web-based system is a safe strategy for improving health outcomes
in patients with complex IBD and reducing the use of health care resources.

Introduction
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising ulcerative colitis
(UC) and Crohn disease (CD), is a chronic relapsing disorder
characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Its
natural progression includes flares and periods of remission,
and IBD requires continuous and personalized follow-up to
ensure long-term remission. Patients with IBD use health care
resources significantly more often than patients with other
conditions [1]. Importantly, 30%-45% of adult patients with
IBD are nonadherent to treatment [2], which increases the
probability of relapse by 4-fold and consequently increases the
health care costs [3]. The high percentage of nonadherence is
associated with behavioral and psychological factors and the
physician-patient relationship [2]. In addition, IBD is related to
high levels of school absenteeism and work disability [4],
interference with social activities, and impairment of
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [5]. Therefore, IBD has
a significant medical, social, and financial impact.
To address these difficulties, telemedicine uses information and
communication technologies (ICTs) to provide health care
services remotely. Despite the heterogeneous nature and
progress of IBD, ICTs allow tailored follow-up with better
communication between physicians and patients [6-8] and
provide 
educational 
resources 
that 
promote 
patient
empowerment [6] and optimize treatment [9,10]. ICTs were
initially used to support the management of other chronic
diseases such as congestive heart failure [11], diabetes mellitus
[12], and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [13] and
showed excellent acceptance by patients and improvement in
HRQoL. Owing to these positive results, telemedicine systems
have been evaluated in patients with IBD [14,15].
A ground-breaking evaluation of telemedicine in patients with
IBD by Cross et al. [16], who designed the Home Automated
Telemanagement system, was acceptable, increased patients’
knowledge about their disease, and facilitated greater
self-control of IBD symptoms [17]. However, in a randomized
controlled trial of 47 patients with UC in remission or with mild
UC activity, no significant differences were noted in disease
activity, HRQoL, or medication adherence between patients
who followed the telemedicine system and those who received
usual care at 12 months [18]. These results were partially
explained by a higher discontinuation rate in the Home
Automated Telemanagement group due to the platform design.
To avoid similar problems, the authors subsequently designed
a mobile phone-based Web program to determine the impact
of telemedicine on health outcomes [19]. Web programs and
mHealth interventions are increasingly used to provide
information and health care at a distance. Unlike other telehealth
systems, Web-based apps do not require home installation and
are less expensive. Web-based systems adapted to IBD are safe
and feasible for adults and adolescents [20-22], improve
medication adherence, and reduce the duration of relapses [6].
A recent multicenter, randomized controlled trial including
more than 900 patients with different subtypes of IBD showed
that compared with standard care, empowerment through these
systems reduces outpatient visits and hospital admissions, with
potential cost savings [8]. Web-based systems are currently the
most useful platforms, and their application allows development
of distance care projects aimed at providing access to health
care in remote areas [23,24]. These models promote
collaboration and knowledge exchange between specialists,
potentially reducing variability in clinical practice, and could
modify the future structure of health systems if they prove to
be cost-effective. However, the effect of telemedicine systems
on disease outcomes is inconsistent and varies across studies
according to the population and health care system in which
they are applied [6,8,18,20,22]. Moreover, no specific studies
have thus far focused on the impact of telemedicine in patients
with complex IBD.
Our research group designed a Web-based telemanagement
system known as Telemonitorización de la Enfermedad de
Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa or Telemonitoring of Crohn’s Disease
and Ulcerative Colitis (TECCU) for remote monitoring of
patients with moderate-to-severe IBD activity or who initiate
treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and
biological agents. We performed a randomized controlled trial
to assess the safety of care provided through this system and its
impact on disease activity, HRQoL, medication adherence,
satisfaction, work productivity, social activities, and use of
health care resources and compared these outcomes with those
of nurse-assisted telephone care and standard face-to-face visits.

Methods
Study Design
A 3-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was
performed to compare the impact of the Web-based
telemanagement system TECCU, nurse-assisted telephone care,
and standard face-to-face visits on health outcomes and
outpatient visits in patients with complex IBD. Neither the
patients nor the researchers were masked to the intervention,
but the results were analyzed by an independent statistician who
was blinded to group identification.
Ethical Considerations
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the local
independent ethics committee of La Fe University and
Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain; the regional independent
ethics committee (Comité Ético Autonómico de Estudios
Clínicos de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios de la
Comunitat Valenciana); and the Spanish Agency of Medicines
and Medical Devices (Agencia Española de Medicamentos y
Productos Sanitarios). According to the physicians involved in
the study, the risks did not outweigh the potential benefits, and
each participant provided informed consent without coercion
before inclusion in the study. The trial is registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT02943538.
Patient Selection
Patients were recruited from the IBD Unit of a tertiary university
hospital. All participants were diagnosed with IBD at least 6
months previously and according to the internationally accepted
criteria [25,26].
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years; initiation of therapy
with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biological agents
due to disease activity; and provision of written informed
consent to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were
inability to speak and read Spanish; inability to manage a mobile
phone or tablet or the Internet or not having a telephone line;
participation in other clinical trials during the inclusion period;
uncontrolled medical or psychiatric disease; presence of
ileorectal or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis; receipt of definitive
ileostomy; perianal disease; and pregnancy.
Recruitment
This project was funded in 2012, and the platform was installed
and configured in 2013-2014. Enrollment was started in October
2014 and ended in June 2016. The follow-up ended in December
2016. Patients were included consecutively from the Outpatient
Clinic of the IBD Unit or the Gastroenterology Department if
they were admitted for a flareup of IBD. During the visit, the
inclusion and exclusion criteria were verified, and the patient
was informed about the study through the patient-information
sheet. If the patient agreed to participate, he or she signed the
informed consent document.
Randomization
Eligible patients were randomized to 1 of the 3 groups to receive
remote monitoring (G_TECCU), nurse-assisted telephone care
(G_NT), or standard care with in-person visits (G_control) in
a 1:1:1 ratio by using a block randomization method through a
Web-based tool [27] in order to generate a random-allocation
sequence and ensure allocation concealment. Once a number
was assigned, it could not be reassigned, and members of the
research team who were in contact with patients did not have
access to the randomization tables or lists.
Study Outcomes
Participants completed study visits at the baseline, 12 weeks,
and 24 weeks, in addition to routine visits scheduled for their
clinical care. The variables measured at baseline were
sociodemographic variables, disease profile and activity,
HRQoL, adverse events, medication adherence, and patient
satisfaction.
Primary Outcome
The primary objective of the study was to determine the
percentage of patients in clinical remission at 24 weeks.
Remission was evaluated using the modified Harvey-Bradshaw
index (HBI) for patients with CD [28]. For patients with UC,
we used the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI,
also known as the Walmsley index) [29] for remote checkups
together with the partial Mayo score for face-to-face visits [30].
Patients with CD and an HBI < 5 were considered to be in
clinical remission, whereas patients with scores of 5-7, 8-16,
or >16 were considered to have mild, moderate, or severe
activity, respectively [28]. For remote checkups in patients with
UC, clinical remission was defined as a Walmsley score ≤ 2,
whereas mild-to-moderate and severe activities were defined
as scores of 3-5 and >5, respectively [31]. In the face-to-face
visits, clinical remission was defined as a partial Mayo score ≤
2 and no individual Mayo subscore > 1; scores of 2-5, 6-8, and
9 were defined as mild, moderate, and severe disease activity,
respectively [30].
Laboratory parameters were measured at baseline and each
subsequent visit according to individual patient’s schedule and
included a complete blood analysis with nutritional profile and
C-reactive protein level (mg/L). Fecal calprotectin (FC, µg/g)
was assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after inclusion.
Changes in the medication were made on the basis of the results
obtained, in association with clinical activity indexes, and were
prescribed according to specific intervention plans adapted to
the severity of each alert.
Secondary Outcomes
The HRQoL of patients at inclusion and at week 24 was
evaluated using the specific questionnaire Inflammatory Bowel
Disease Questionnaire 9 (IBDQ-9) and the generic questionnaire
EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D). IBDQ-9 is a validated questionnaire
comprising 9 items distributed in 4 dimensions: bowel
symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional function, and social
function. It correlated very well with the Spanish version of the
36-item IBDQ [32]. Each item is scored on a 7-point Likert
scale, with an overall score ranging from 7 (lowest QoL) to 63
(highest QoL) points, and calculated over 100 points. EQ-5D
is a generic questionnaire that has been used for patients with
various chronic diseases such as IBD and was previously

validated in Spain [33]. This instrument provides a global value
for HRQoL, with 5 questions related to 5 dimensions: mobility,
selfcare, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or
depression. Additionally, a visual analog scale (VAS) was used.
Each question was scored with 1, 2, or 3 points, depending on
whether impairment in the dimension assessed was nonexistent,
moderate, or extreme, respectively; subsequently, the results
were converted for each dimension according to the specific
coefficients calculated for the Spanish population [34]. The
maximum score of 1 represents the best health status, a score
of 0 represents a health state considered equivalent to death,
and negative index scores represent health states considered
worse than death. The VAS rates overall health between 0
(poorest imaginable health) and 100 (best imaginable health).
We assessed the impact of disease on work productivity and
activities of daily living using the Work Productivity and
Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire [35], which patients
completed at baseline and week 24. The questionnaire comprises
6 questions on the effect of the disease on work and activities
of daily living during the previous 7 days. A higher score on
the questionnaire indicates a more pronounced effect on work
and daily activities. The Spanish version has been validated and
is reproducible in patients with CD.
Medication adherence was evaluated using the Morisky-Green
index [36], which has been used to evaluate adherence in
patients with IBD in clinical trials [18]. We considered
adherence to be adequate when the patient answered all
questions correctly and inadequate if any answer was associated
with nonadherence.
We recorded the number of outpatient visits and telephone
consultations, as registered in the NOMHADCHRONIC app
(version V2.RC6; Connected Health Services SL, Valencia,
Spain) for patients in G_TECCU and in the Orion Clinic
information system (as part of daily clinical practice at our
hospital) for all 3 groups during the study. Patients who adhered
to >80% of checkups in the study protocol were considered to
be compliant.
The safety of each intervention was assessed by measuring the
number of visits to the emergency department, hospitalizations,
IBD-related surgeries, corticosteroid courses, and adverse effects
to medication. Finally, patient satisfaction with the care received
was evaluated at 24 weeks by using an adapted version of the
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, which comprises 6 questions
(measured on a scale of 0-10) on the quality, usefulness, and
viability of the system of care applied for each case [37].
Setting and Interventions
This pilot trial was developed at the tertiary referral center La
Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain. The
hospital serves more than 1500 patients with IBD, has 2
specialist IBD nurses, and provides an email and telephone
consultation structure for IBD patients to contact the hospital.
The trial had 3 arms and compared remote monitoring through
a Web-based telemanagement system, nursing care by telephone,
and usual care provided in our IBD Unit (Outpatient Clinic).
All patients completed the study visits at baseline and 12 and
24 weeks, in addition to routine visits to the IBD clinic,
telephone consultations, or Web telemonitoring based on group
assignment at randomization. Disease activity, HRQoL, adverse
effects, adherence, and use of health care resources were
measured at baseline and during the 24-week follow-up.
To adequately control disease activity and adverse effects of
immunosuppressants, patients treated with these drugs alone or
in combination with biological agents were monitored every
1-2 weeks during the first month, every 2-4 weeks between
months 1 to 3, and every 4 weeks from month 3 until the end
of follow-up. Patients treated with biological agents alone were
monitored every 2-4 weeks during the entire follow-up period.
Patients from all 3 arms who took the same type of drug
underwent these follow-up schedules; the schedules only
differed in terms of the monitoring: patients in G_TECCU were
monitored via the NOMHADCHRONIC app, those in G_NT
were monitored via a telephone line managed by nursing staff
from the IBD Unit, and those in G_control were monitored by
the usual face-to-face visits combined with telephone calls made
by physicians according to standard clinical practice. Moreover,
additional clinical visits were performed, if required, during
patient evolution in any of the 3 arms.
Telemonitoring Apps
In G_TECCU, follow-up and monitoring were performed
telematically using the integrated platform for management of
chronically ill patients (NOMHADCHRONIC app), which was
designed to meet the specific needs of this group. The
NOMHADCHRONIC platform is an innovative technological
system that was designed to boost the rollout of services for the
management of chronically ill patients. The telemanagement
care system was developed in collaboration with patients, the
La Fe telemedicine Unit, and Tecnologías para la Salud y el
Bienestar SA. The protocol of the Web-based telemanagement
system (TECCU) has been described elsewhere [27]. TECCU
is a secure webpage with an HTTP app for mobile phones,
tablets, and computers. Patients connected to the platform via
the Internet using a computer or an app on a mobile phone or
tablet had to self-complete questionnaires. In addition, they
received advice, reminders, educational material about their
disease, and information on prevention. This information was
received by the case managers and filtered using an intelligent
prioritization system with generation of alerts and push
notifications according to an integrated intervention protocol.
Patients monitored via the TECCU used NOMHADhome [38].
The resources of the NOMHADhome platform were also
available on the NOMHAD mobile app, which patients could
download onto their mobile phones. After inclusion, these
patients automatically received an email with a personal code
that allowed them to access the platform. Each patient profile
contained the following information: contact information, active
IBD medications, testing schedule (blood and stool tests), log
of disease activity, medication use, body weight, vital signs,
HRQoL, alerts and action plans, progress of inflammatory
activity and vital signs in the form of graphs, electronic
messaging to the study nurse coordinator and health care
provider, and educational tips.
Patients in G_TECCU had to answer several simple questions
related to their IBD symptoms and possible adverse effects since

the last evaluation via text messaging. In the main menu of the
platform, patients accessed the questionnaires by clicking on
specific icons designed for this purpose and could answer the
multiple choice and yes or no questions needed to complete
these items (Figures 1 and 2). We established individualized
alerts and action plans based on the answers to questions about
the activity index, adverse effects, and blood biochemistry
results. A scale of values was assigned for each alert depending
on the severity (green, yellow, orange, and red zone).
After receiving an alert, the specialized medical staff, in
collaboration with the nurses, used the general recommendations
of the action plans to guide medication adjustments in biological
therapy, immunomodulators, corticosteroids, and salicilates.
These treatment changes were performed with the support of
the platform messaging system in combination with telephone
calls or in-person visits when it was necessary to train patients
for the administration of medications such as subcutaneous
biological agents. Once the disease was in remission again
(green zone), the patient had to continue with the initially
programmed follow-up. All patients had access to tools that
informed them about their disease. In G_TECCU, information
was available on the NOMHADhome platform itself; in
G_control and G_NT, patients received written documents with
the same information.

Usual Care Provided in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Unit
The G_control patients received the normal care provided in
the IBD Unit (Outpatient Clinic) for patients with moderately
to highly complex IBD, based on national and European clinical
guidelines [25,26,39]. Treatment was adjusted according to the
evolution of disease activity and medication adherence, which
was measured using specific indexes and biological markers
used to report the study outcomes during office visits or
telephone calls. In addition, to measure the time in remission,
clinical activity of patients was self-recorded in a diary on paper
at home weekly during the first 12 weeks and every 2 weeks
subsequently, until the end of the follow-up.
This care was complemented by ad hoc hospital care in case of
flareups or if the patient’s health deteriorated for any reason.
Ad hoc intensive care was maintained until the patient’s
condition stabilized, at which point he or she returned to
follow-up based on standard care in the Unit. For comparability
among the 3 groups, we provided information on all available
on-paper educational materials about IBD for remotely
monitored patients as well as information on prevention and
written action plans in case of flareups. Questionnaires on
HRQoL, satisfaction, and work productivity were recorded at
baseline and at the end of the study.
Nursing Care by Telephone
The G_NT patients were asked about their health through
telephone calls by the nursing staff in the IBD Unit. We
performed telephone assessment periodically by using structured
interviews to evaluate health status, and clinical activity was
self-recorded at home, as described for the G_control patients.
The interventions depended on the results of the interview and
changes in the medication or follow-up schedule established by
nurses with the support of medical staff, according to the alerts
and action plans designed in the intervention protocol [27].
Furthermore, we provided these patients with all educational
elements made available to the other 2 groups.
Notification of Adverse Effects
TECCU is a minimum-risk system. The characteristics of the
interventions in the present study are designed such that patients
do not experience direct adverse effects. The interventions were
proposed to control and achieve long remission periods in
patients with IBD and were not expected to cause lesions or
damage to the patients’ health, since we did not test a new
experimental drug. We evaluated a Web-based telemonitoring
system designed to improve communication between patients
and health care providers, with a proactive remote follow-up
method, allowing changes in the patients’ treatment and
follow-up schedule when flareups are detected or when the
flareups increase in severity as per the alert system. In addition,
we incorporated educational elements in G_TECCU and the
other 2 groups to make them more comparable.
With respect to the platform, a risk-minimization study was
performed to ensure accomplishment of ethical norms and that
the appropriate ethics committees approved the study. We also
recorded all adverse events from the time the patient provided
consent to participate in the study until 28 days after study
completion.
Power Calculation
The most-efficient means of determining differences between
the 3 groups was by contrasting differences in activity indexes
for CD and UC. Considering the differences in the scales, the
analysis was stratified by performing a comparison of patients
with UC and another comparison of patients with CD. The
sample size was calculated by estimating the size required to
detect a difference of 3 points in the HBI; considering an SD
of 4, a power of 80%, and an alpha significance level of .05, a
total of 30 patients with CD (10 per arm) was required. In
addition, for a 2-point difference in the Mayo index, an SD of
2.5, a power of 80%, and an alpha significance level of .05, a
total of 30 patients with UC (10 per arm) was required.
Therefore, the overall sample size was 60 patients (20 per arm).
We also stratified patients globally (CD and UC) by comparing

patients in remission or with inflammatory activity, irrespective
of disease severity (mild, moderate, or severe).
Statistical Analysis
First, we described the characteristics of patients in the test and
control groups by applying appropriate estimators (means,
medians, or proportions) according to the type of variables and
evaluated possible differences between the groups in the main
and secondary outcomes by using regression models to assess
differences in these measures. We evaluated the effects of the
different treatment groups on the probability of remission using
mixed-effects logistic regression models including an interaction
between week and treatment groups. Individuals were included
in the model as a random intercept to correct for the
nonindependent data. Differences in slopes for weeks 12 and
24 were evaluated by assessing the interaction between week
and treatment groups. P values were estimated using the
Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom. We used
mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models to evaluate
progress according to the IBDQ-9 and EQ-5D scores in the 3
study groups between weeks 0 and 24. However, owing to
convergence problems in assessing medication adherence
(because of the reduced sample size and the ordinal character
of the Morisky-Green test), Bayesian techniques were applied
in the ordinal logistic regression model. Differences in the
percentage of missed work hours, work impairment, and social
impairment were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression
and mixed-effects beta regression models (% work hours
missed). Profile likelihood 95% confidence intervals were
calculated for all estimations, and P<.05 was considered
statistically significant. A likelihood-based analysis for all
patients included was performed using R (version 3.5.1) with
the lme4 (version 1.1-17), lmerTest (version 3.0-1), brms
(version 2.2.0), clickR (version 0.4.04), ordinal (version
2018.4-19), and glmmADMB (0.8.3.3) packages [40].
Results
Study Sample
A total of 68 patients with complex IBD were invited to
participate in this study between October 2014 and June 2016,
of which 3 (4.4%) declined to participate owing to
inaccessibility to the Internet at home and 2 (2.9%) did not meet
the inclusion criteria. The remaining 63 eligible patients
provided informed consent and were randomly assigned to the
3 groups (21 patients in each group, Figure 3). During the study
period, all patients except 1 patient in G_TECCU (95.2%)
continued to use the Web-based telemanagement system and 2
other patients did not respond to >80% of checkups. The
remaining 18 patients (85.7%) in G_TECCU showed good
adherence to the study protocol as compared to 19 patients
(90.5%) in G_control and 20 patients (95.2%) in G_NT. We
did not observe any differences between the completers and
patients who did not adhere to the study protocol. The baseline
characteristics of the 3 study groups are shown in Table 1.
Disease Activity
According to the HBI and the partial Mayo scores, 47.6%
(10/21), 38.1% (8/21), and 57.1% (12/21) of patients were in
clinical remission at baseline in G_TECCU, G_NT, and
G_control, respectively. The baseline percentage of remission
according to the Walmsley score for UC was the same for each
group and improved progressively at 12 and 24 weeks in all 3
groups. This percentage was higher in G_TECCU, even after
considering dropouts, with 81% of patients (17/21) inactive
after 24 weeks compared with 66.7% (14/21) in G_NT and
71.4% (15/21) in G_control (using both Mayo and Walmsley
scores for evaluation of UC); therefore, the percentage of
patients in remission increased by 33.4% in G_TECCU, 28.6%
in G_NT, and 14.3% in G_control (Figure 4). In the
intention-to-treat analysis, a higher probability of remission was
observed in G_TECCU than in G_control at 12 weeks (odds
ratio (OR)=0.12, 95% CI=0.003-2.103, P=.18) and 24 weeks
(OR=0.12, 95% CI=0.003-2.162, P=.19) using the HBI-Mayo
scores. With the HBI-Walmsley scores, no differences were
observed between G_TECCU and G_control at 12 weeks
(OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.08-9.71, P=.94), but the probability of
remission was higher in G_TECCU at 24 weeks (OR=0.11,
95% CI=0.004-1.55, P=.13). The median time in remission was
17.9 weeks (interquartile range, 12-24 weeks) in G_TECCU
compared to 17.3 weeks (interquartile range, 10-24 weeks) in
G_NT and 14.3 weeks (interquartile range, 8-24 weeks) in
G_control.
Disease activity was evaluated on the basis of FC levels
throughout the study. At 24 weeks, the median FC level for
clinical activity improved progressively from a baseline value
of 490 µg/g to 137 µg/g in G_TECCU and from 526 µg/g to
115.5 µg/g in G_NT; however, this reduction was smaller in
G_control, from 330 µg/g to 230 µg/g. The improvement in FC
levels was larger in G_TECCU than in G_control, with an
estimated intervention effect of –0.76 (95% CI=–1.85 to 0.336,
P=.18) in the reduction of FC values at 12 weeks and –0.90
(95% CI=–1.96 to 0.16, P=.11) at 24 weeks. Similarly, a larger
improvement was noted in G_NT than in G_control at the same
time points, with an estimated intervention effect of –0.61 (95%
CI=–1.62 to 0.39, P=.25) at 12 weeks and –0.91 (95% CI=–1.96
to 0.15, P=.10) at 24 weeks (Figure 5).

Health-Related Quality of Life
HRQoL scores were similar between all groups at baseline, and
the HRQoL of patients from all 3 groups improved after 24
weeks. The median IBDQ-9 scores increased from 38.5 to 53
in G_control, from 37.5 to 53 in G_NT, and from 42 to 52.5 in
G_TECCU (overall intervention effect on the IBDQ-9 score:
OR=8.42, 95% CI=3.98-17.81, P<.001). The median EQ-5D
score improved from 0.816 to 1.00 in G_control and from 0.825
to 1.00 in G_NT and G_TECCU (overall intervention effect on
the EQ-5D score: OR=1.99, 95% CI=1.09-3.63, P<.001).
However, the improvement in HRQoL was not significantly
different among groups with regard to the IBDQ-9 score
(G_TECCU vs G_control: OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.49-3.15, P=.64;
G_NT vs G_control: OR=0.79, 95% CI=0.32-1.98, P=.62) and
the EQ-5D score (G_TECCU vs G_control: OR=1.42, 95%
CI=0.49-4.13, P=.52; G_NT vs G_control: OR=1.68, 95%
CI=0.59-4.81, P=.33). In addition, a significant improvement
in the HRQoL of patients from the 3 arms was evident in the
EQ-5D-VAS scores, with an increase in the median score from
60.5% to 85% in G_control, from 62.5% to 70% in G_NT, and
from 60% to 80% in G_TECCU (overall intervention effect on
the score increase: OR=3.53, 95% CI=1.79-6.95, P<.001);
however, the improvement was not significantly different
between the groups at 24 weeks (G_TECCU vs G_control:
OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.26-1.57, P=.32; G_NT vs G_control:

OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.28-1.71, P=.43; Figure 6). The HRQoL
improved in 4 patients in G_TECCU who were followed up via
mobile phone, from a median baseline IBDQ-9 score of 31.5
to 47.75 and a median baseline EQ-5D score of 0.71 to 0.94,
with an improvement in the median EQ-5D-VAS score from
50% to 70% at study completion.
Work Productivity and Social Activities
With regard to work productivity and activity impairment, we
compared the median percentage of work hours missed owing
to disease on the basis of the answers to question 2 of the WPAI
questionnaire (“During the past seven days, how many hours
did you miss from work because of problems associated with
your ulcerative colitis/Crohn’s disease?”). We found wide
variability in the percentage of hours missed in the 3 arms, with
no significant reduction in any group (OR=0.99, 95%
CI=0.43-2.29, P=.93) and no differences among the groups at
24 weeks (G_NT vs G_control: OR=0.64, 95% CI=0.21-1.99,
P=.44; G_TECCU vs G_control: OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.31-3.08,
P=.96). Moreover, the median scores of impairment in work
productivity over 12 weeks showed a larger reduction in
G_TECCU than in G_control (OR=0.14, 95% CI=0.01-1.46,
P=.10; G_NT vs G_control: OR=0.13, 95% CI=0.01-1.13,
P=.06), but this improvement was not maintained at 24 weeks
(G_TECCU vs G_control: OR=0.32, 95% CI=0.03-2.94, P=.31;
G_AT vs G_control: OR=0.21, 95% CI=0.03-1.67, P=.14).
With regard to social impairment, we found a significant
improvement in daily activities and a significant reduction in
the median score of each group at 12 weeks (OR=0.16, 95%
CI=0.05-0.49, P=.002) and 24 weeks (OR=0.26, 95%
CI=0.09-0.77, P=.02). This reduction in social impairment was
larger in G_TECCU than in G_control at 24 weeks (OR=0.27,
95% CI=0.05-1.49, P=.13).
Medication Adherence
Medication adherence was poorer in G_NT than in the other 2
groups at baseline: 33.3% (7/21) of patients adhered to
medication in G_NT; 66.7% (14/21), in G_control; and 57.1%
(12/21), in G_TECCU. Despite these differences, medication
adherence improved significantly in the 3 arms: 81% (17/21)
in G_control, 71.4% (15/21) in G_NT, and 85.7% (18/21) in
G_TECCU at 24 weeks (overall intervention effect on
Morisky-Green 
score 
reduction: 
OR=0.051, 
95%
CI=0.001-0.769). In addition, all completers adhered to
treatment in G_TECCU (Morisky-Green score=0), and the
reduction in the Morisky-Green score was significantly more
pronounced in G_TECCU than in G_control (OR=0.0001, 95%
CI=1.02e-10 to 0.517; Figure 7).
Safety Intervention
The safety of the 3 interventions was similar, and no differences
were noted among the groups for visits to the emergency
department (0 in G_TECCU, 2 in the G_NT, and 1 in the
G_control), IBD-related surgeries (1 in each group),
hospitalizations (2 in G_TECCU, 2 in G_NT, and 1 in
G_control), and corticosteroid courses (4 in G_TECCU, 4 in
G_NT, and 3 in G_control). Adverse effects of medication were
reported in 8 patients (38.1%) in G_TECCU, 7 patients (33.3%)
in G_NT, and 9 patients (42.9%) in G_control after 24 weeks
(P=.92 for G_TECCU vs G_control). No patients died during
the study, and adverse effects related to the follow-up
intervention were not reported.
Use of Health Care Resources
The total number of outpatient visits to the gastroenterologist
or nurse after 24 weeks was lower in G_TECCU (72 visits; 25%
of total) and G_NT (85 visits; 29.5% of total) than in G_control
(131 visits; 45.5% of total). Similarly, the number of telephone
calls was lower in G_TECCU (12 calls; 6.8% of total) than in
G_NT (118 calls; 66.7% of total) and G_control (47 calls; 26.5%
of total).

Patient Satisfaction
Patient satisfaction improved from a median score of 52 to 57
in G_TECCU and from 49.5 to 55 in G_control (overall
intervention effect: OR=8.93, 95% CI=2.97-26.84, P<.001) at
24 weeks; however, the satisfaction score remained unchanged
at 53 points in G_NT. Satisfaction with previous care was high
in the mobile phone subgroup of G_TECCU, with a median
score of 54.25, although this score improved to 56.25 after 24
weeks of follow-up via mobile phone.
In G_TECCU, neither the patients nor the researchers perceived
privacy breaches while using the Web platform. Only two
patients in G_TECCU reported minor technical problems with
temporary unavailability of the webpage over the follow-up
period, but technical assistants resolved the issue remotely. The
3 patients who were noncompliant to the follow-up schedule
were contacted by telephone, and 2 of them who were
insufficiently compliant specified that they forgot to follow
some remote controls because they were in acceptable health
conditions. We subsequently scheduled in-person visits, but
these patients only attended them once. The only patient who
was lost to follow-up mentioned that neither the previous
standard care nor the Web platform met her expectations;
therefore, she decided to move to another center.
All staff, including 5 gastroenterologists and 2 nurses
specializing in IBD, showed good acceptance of the platform
and considered it easy to use. However, 2 physicians thought
that the calendar included in the platform for health care
providers to survey the next controls for each patient was not
completely intuitive and would benefit from some change in its
appearance. Furthermore, 1 physician reported minor technical
problems with temporary unavailability of the webpage over
the follow-up period, but the technical assistants resolved the
issue remotely after 1 day.
Discussion
Principal Findings
We performed a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare
the impact of a Web-based telemanagement system (TECCU),
nurse-assisted telephone care, and standard face-to-face visits
on health outcomes and outpatient visits in patients with
complex IBD. Patients with IBD who start treatment with
systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biological
agents for control of inflammatory activity are considered to
have moderate-to-high complexity of disease. Our results
showed that TECCU was safe and effective for improving health
outcomes and the use of health care resources in this setting.
Comparison With Prior Work
Although telemonitoring apps are well accepted and seem to
be a safe approach for follow-up of patients in remission or with
mild activity [6,18,41], the reported efficacy of telemonitoring
on disease activity and QoL is inconsistent between studies
[14,42], and no specific trials have evaluated the impact of
telemedicine in patients with complex IBD. Therefore, we
designed a controlled 3-arm clinical trial to assess the impact
of the TECCU Web program on disease outcomes and health
care use in comparison with the main strategies applied to date
for the follow-up of patients with complex IBD (standard or
telephone support provided by a nurse).
This program was designed in collaboration with patients and
researchers to address the particular needs of patients with
complex IBD, according to national and European clinical
guidelines. As detailed elsewhere [27], this information was
structured and filtered using an intelligent prioritization system,
with generation of alerts and push notifications according to an
integrated intervention protocol, which facilitated a rapid
response from nurses and physicians for different events
occurring during follow-up in a time period according to the
severity of each alert. Furthermore, the Web platform allowed
continuous communication between patients and health

providers via electronic messaging, and we incorporated
educational elements in the platform to improve disease
knowledge among patients and empowerment through
interactive materials. With the use of the TECCU Web platform,
we found a significant improvement in HRQoL, medication
adherence, social activities, and satisfaction; in addition, disease
activity improved at the end of follow-up in each group.
Moreover, a greater improvement in disease activity and social
activities was reported with TECCU than with standard care,
but the differences were not significant, probably due to the
small sample size and the relatively short follow-up time.
In agreement with previous data [6,8], medication adherence
was better in G_TECCU compared to the other groups and
reached 100% among completers in G_TECCU, probably
because care was continuously adapted at each stage of the
disease and communication with physicians was better in this
group. Therefore, we were able to easily identify eventual
problems related to poor adherence [2]. In addition, constant
tailored monitoring with Web TECCU could reduce interference
with daily activities, as social impairment due to disease tended
to improve in G_TECCU compared with the other two arms.
Not surprisingly, the improvement in remission rates and social
functioning was associated with high patient satisfaction and
correlated directly with a significant improvement in HRQoL,
measured by the specific IDBQ-9 and the EQ-5D.
The Web TECCU and nurse-assisted telephone care were
associated with fewer outpatient visits than standard care, but
the Web-monitoring system reduced the number of telephone
calls compared with the other two groups. Our study was
performed in a referral hospital with an accredited,
well-structured IBD Unit and accessible outpatient clinics with
specialized nurses and e-mail or telephone consultations.
Therefore, the reduction of face-to-face visits suggests that the
effect of the TECCU remote-monitoring system on the
frequency of outpatient visits could be favorable in hospitals
with referral IBD Units. Although this reduction in office visits
could be influenced by the follow-up schedule used in our study,
the frequency of visits for all the 3 arms was designed according
to the standard clinical practice in our center and based on
national and European guidelines. Furthermore, our Web-based
telemanagement system was safe and well accepted by patients,
with no adverse effects related to the study intervention and no
differences among groups in terms of emergency visits,
surgeries, hospitalizations, corticosteroid courses, or medication
adverse effects, which is consistent with the findings of previous
studies [6,8].
Despite different attrition rates in the use of telemedicine apps,
our results indicate that it is important to emphasize the
feasibility of telemedicine for providing solutions for the
medical and social impact of IBD. In our study, only 3 patients
did not complete the follow-up schedule in G_TECCU (1 patient
was lost to follow-up and 2 patients were insufficiently
compliant); this low proportion is likely a result of the reminder
system integrated in the platform and the short follow-up period.
However, previous clinical trials reported high withdrawal rates
in telemedicine groups [6,8,18,22], despite adaptations in the
platform design over recent years. Consequently, telemedicine
is not suitable for all patients, and improvements in
telemonitoring apps and the patient-selection criteria are
necessary. Nevertheless, this is not necessarily a barrier to the
application of telemedicine, because the majority of patients
are adherent to remote monitoring, and the efficacy of these
follow-up methods has been reported in different populations
including patients with complex IBD, as reported in our trial.
It is important to evaluate the disease phenotype, discuss
preferences with the patient, and assess the ability to use ICTs.
Some patients such as those in the immediate postoperative
period and those with perianal disease, who require physical
examination, may not benefit from remote monitoring with the
technological tools available thus far.
Strengths
The main strength of our study was its randomized controlled
design, which allowed us to evaluate the impact of a Web
telemanagement system on disease outcomes and compare the
approach with the main strategies applied in the follow-up of
IBD patients in daily practice. In addition, allocation
concealment ensured that researchers were blinded to group
assignment during the randomization process. Furthermore, the
selection of patients with complex IBD from a referral center
provides important data on the effect of telemedicine in patients
with moderate-to-severe disease activity or initiating
administration of immunosuppressants and biological agents,
which is a specific population that has not been sufficiently
represented in previous studies. Another advantage was the
selection of the activity index and biological tools for measuring
disease activity and other outcomes remotely. The Walmsley
index was recently validated for self-administration via an online
tool [43] and correlates well with other, more complex-activity
indexes based on endoscopy [44]. Similarly, the reduced 6- and
9-point versions of the Mayo index, which are not based on
endoscopy, show clinical response to treatment, similar to the
full Mayo score [30]. Finally, as HBI may not completely reflect
the inflammatory activity of the disease [45], the use of
biological markers (C-reactive protein and FC) provided added
value to remote monitoring, because they are sufficiently
sensitive for detecting mucosal inflammation [46], and FC levels
can be easily recorded at home.
Limitations
Our study was subject to a series of limitations. First,
considering the specific study population, the sample was not
large enough to detect statistically significant differences in
clinical activity and the types of interventions assessed; as such,
neither the patients nor the researchers were masked to the
intervention. It is possible that the differences estimated among
groups in the scarce literature on the impact on health outcomes
could interfere with the sample size calculation in this pilot trial,
and the lack of blinding could improve the usual attention
provided to patients in G_control, which could also attenuate
differences in these outcomes among groups. Nonetheless, our
results were analyzed by an independent statistician who was
blinded to group identification. Second, the selection of patients
with complex IBD in a tertiary referral hospital prevented
extrapolation of our results to the entire IBD population. Third,
we did not perform colonoscopy in all cases, because it increases
costs and risks to patients and is not performed routinely in all

patients during daily practice. Instead, we used biological
markers that were highly sensitive for endoscopic activity.
Finally, the 24-week follow-up period could be considered a
short duration, because both patients and physicians need time
to learn how to interact with the platform, thus leading to
interference with the efficacy of the Web system in terms of
disease outcome in the experimental group. Therefore, trials
with longer follow-up periods are required to confirm the
efficacy of telemedicine in improving long-term disease
outcomes.
Conclusions
TECCU is a safe tool for the control of disease activity and
improves HRQoL, medication adherence, and impairment in
social activities in patients with complex IBD. In addition, it
reduces the use of health care resources and the number of
outpatient visits and telephone calls. It is important to select
patients who are willing and able to use Web programs, since
the results of this study suggest greater efficacy in health
outcomes with a consequent improvement in the HRQoL and
satisfaction of patients who adhere to telemanagement.
Web-based systems are a safe and feasible option for IBD
monitoring and could play a key role in reorganizing the
structure of health systems if they prove to be cost-effective in
the long-term. On the other hand, although telemonitoring
platforms are well accepted, thus far, they have not clearly
demonstrated their efficacy on health outcomes in patients with
complex IBD and those in remission or with mild-to-moderate
disease. Future studies with longer follow-up periods are
necessary to confirm our findings in order to determine whether
Web-based programs can improve the long-term course of IBD
in a more-complex setting.
