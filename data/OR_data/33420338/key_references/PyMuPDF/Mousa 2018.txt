Abstract: 
45 
INTRODUCTION: Post-surgical discharge complications result in increased hospital 
46 
readmissions, cost, and patient dissatisfaction. Telehealth technology to monitor patients, 
47 
especially those in geographically isolated areas, may reduce post-operative complications, 
48 
improve health and financial outcomes.    
49 
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare outcomes between patients that received 
50 
Telehealth electronic monitoring (THEM) to those with routine discharge instructions and no 
51 
monitoring, Standard Of Care (SOC).  
52 
METHODS: This was a prospective randomized study of vascular surgery patients with infra-
53 
inguinal incisions. THEM patients received a tablet and home monitoring devices that 
54 
transmitted information to care managers. Monitoring tools included image capture, weight 
55 
scales, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers and oxygen saturation monitors. Care managers used 
56 
the TeleMed 2020 Enform™ platform to review alerts, real-time patient data, and dialogue with 
57 
the care team. 
58 
RESULTS: Eighty patients were screened and thirty enrolled, of which 16 (53.3%) were 
59 
randomized to the THEM and 14 (46.7%) control groups. Average age and BMI for THEM and 
60 
control patients were similar (62.5 + 7.2 vs 65.7 + 7.3, p=0.234; and 27.7 + 4.3 vs 29.1 7.1, 
61 
p=0.487), respectively. There was a similar number of male participants in each group (THEM 
62 
62.5% versus SOC 42.9%, p=0.464). There were no significant differences in wound or 30-day 
63 
readmissions (THEM 6.3% vs SOC 7.1%, p=1.000).  Interestingly, 30-day infection rates 
64 
indicated care managers identified marginally more superficial wound problems in the THEM 
65 
group (31.3% vs 7.1%, p=0.175). Both groups reported an increase in SF8 physical summary 
66 
scores, but was more pronounced in THEM patients (p=0.076). THEM patients reported a 
67

significantly greater improvement in quality of life on three of the SF8 quality subscales 
68 
(Physical function, Role-Physical and Role-Emotional; THEM ∆ 7.5 vs Control ∆ 1.1; THEM ∆ 
69 
8.7 vs Control ∆ 1.1; and THEM ∆ 6.3 Control ∆ -0.5; all p<0.05). THEM patients reported 
70 
trends for higher satisfaction in terms of general satisfaction, technical quality and accessibility 
71 
for PSQ18 survey questions (4.2 vs 3.7,p=0.072; 4.5 vs 4.1, p=0.081; and 4.2 vs 3.8, p=0.063), 
72 
respectively.   
73 
Conclusion: THEM was technically feasible and provided some benefit to patients in 
74 
geographically disparate areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction. 
75 
Additional findings suggested THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took 
76 
advantage of increased access to health care professionals. Telehealth successfully merged 
77 
remotely generated information with care manager interaction. Presently, a larger study, 
78 
preferably multicenter, is warranted and under consideration.

Introduction: 
92 
Modern telehealth utilization has evolved from using the telephone in the 1870’s to reduce 
93 
unnecessary office visits to using tablets or other devices to transmit voice, survey questions, 
94 
email or text messages, images, and videos with or without conferencing.1-3  Telehealth 
95 
continues to progress and has grown into a larger domain in patient care that combines both 
96 
telecommunications and information technologies.  This digital approach has the potential to 
97 
provide continuous remote medical care access to different aspects of patient care from different 
98 
geographical locations for extended periods of time.  The scope of telehealth communication 
99 
may range from simple activities such as telephone consultation to more sophisticated 
100 
technology as tele- or robotic surgery.2  Feasibility of these approaches has been previously 
101 
evaluated.3-6  In one study, it was determined that there were no diagnostic errors made using 
102 
remote telemedicine compared to in-person clinic follow-up. 7  Ironically, vascular 
103 
interventionists, although currently practicing in highly technologically-laden environments, 
104 
have limited use of modern telehealth approaches.  Most large care centers and specialty 
105 
physicians are located in metropolitan areas requiring patients to travel significant distances for 
106 
simple office visits.  Further, for a myriad of reasons, areas of the country remain relatively 
107 
geographically isolated.  Telehealth Electronic Monitoring (THEM) has emerged as a valid 
108 
option to access and monitor patients within different levels of their healthcare.  Telehealth is a 
109 
vector that allows the transfer of information from the patient to the provider or vice versa.  
110 
Indeed, THEM technology can decrease the burden placed on medical resources, increase the 
111 
efficacy of health care and increase the time efficiency for both patients and physicians.  Yet, a 
112 
more comprehensive approach that includes patient satisfaction surveys and bio-sensors is 
113 
needed to better define the utilization and role of telehealth for surgical and other vascular

interventions.  The current prospective randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate 
115 
clinical outcomes, utilization, feasibility, patient satisfaction and quality of life for patients using 
116 
THEM after cut-down infra-inguinal incision (i.e., dissection of a vein or artery for insertion of a 
117 
cannula or needle) for any vascular procedure.   
118 
 
119 
Methods: 
120 
 
121 
The specific details of the current study design have previously been reported. 8 Briefly, it was a 
122 
prospective, randomized, open-label, single-center with blinded endpoints (PROBE) designed 
123 
study.9  The primary objective of the current project was to compare outcomes for patients who 
124 
received post discharge health care monitoring (which includes using Telehealth electronic 
125 
monitoring; THEM) to patients who receive standard of care (SOC), which included routine 
126 
discharge instructions with no telehealth monitoring.  The primary outcomes included 30-day 
127 
readmissions and deep surgical site infections.  Secondary outcomes included pre and post-
128 
surgery quality of life measures (SF-8), patient satisfaction, superficial surgical site infection, in-
129 
home visits from visiting nurse service (VNS), and an occurrence of any 30-day stroke, 
130 
myocardial infarction or death.  The study had three main hypotheses: 1) A smaller percentage of 
131 
THEM patients would require a 30-day unplanned readmission compared to patients who 
132 
received standard of care (SOC).  2) A smaller percentage of THEM patients would develop 
133 
deep SSIs (i.e., infections involving fascia and/or muscular layers requiring wound interventions 
134 
such as opening, debridement, etc.) compared to SOC.  3) THEM patients would report greater 
135 
post discharge satisfaction and higher quality of life measures than SOC patients.

Patients in the intervention group (THEM) received a tablet computer with the Enform® App and 
138 
set of medical devices for home monitoring.  Medical devices included weight scales, blood 
139 
pressure cuffs, thermometer and oxygen saturation monitors.  Each participant randomized to the 
140 
THEM arm was provided a take-home kit.  The kit contained (Samsung Galaxy Tab E 8” inch 
141 
tablets with Supcase/Finitie rigid cases, Prooral professional digital thermometer, A&D UC-
142 
352 BLE weight scales, TaiDoc TD-3250-C blood pressure monitor, ChoiceMMed 
143 
MD300C318T2 oxygen saturation device). (Figure 1)  Data from these Bluetooth enabled 
144 
devices along with routine wellness assessment question responses were securely transmitted and 
145 
reviewed by care managers using the web enabled Enform® clinician portal.  Clinical care 
146 
managers were both registered nurses with over 30 years of experience.  Each had experience 
147 
in ambulatory cardiovascular nursing, and remotely monitored the patients using this tool 
148 
daily.  Clinical care managers engaged with patients by phone or used the integrated Enform® 
149 
messaging based on alerts and/or data generated by the telehealth monitoring system.  
150 
Participants were instructed to monitor the tablets daily, perform their measurements (i.e., blood 
151 
pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, weight and temperature) and answer daily plus weekly 
152 
quiz questions. (Table 1)  The care manager logged into the TeleMed2020 website and 
153 
monitored values daily, however, the care manager only initiated contact with participants by 
154 
phone or internal messaging if there was a concern generated by any of the system alerts.  
155 
Patients, however, were able to contact their care manager at any time.  
156 
Based on data collected, the care manager requested the patient take a picture of the surgical site 
157 
for assessment and comparison with previously collected images.  All images as well as other 
158 
information such as, system alerts or aberrant results, when persistent, were shared with the 
159 
medical director to proactively manage the patients in between in-person visits.  The care

management team established the following thresholds for bio-sensor system alerts: high systolic 
161 
(>150 mmHG), low systolic (<90 mmHG), high diastolic (>90 mmHG), low systolic (<50 
162 
mmHG), high pulse (>100 BPM), low pulse (<60 BPM), low oxygen saturation (<90%), weight 
163 
+/- 10 lbs of baseline, and temperature > 1010 (Fahrenheit).  In addition, quiz alerts were 
164 
generated when any of the following responses were provided for the accompanying quiz 
165 
questions: “How is your pain today?”, a score of 8 or more; “To me, the surgical incision site 
166 
appears”, to be getting worse; “Discharge or leakage of fluid form any part of the surgical site”, 
167 
is yellow or green or is present but looks different from choices above; “Swelling or redness 
168 
around the surgical incision is”, worse than yesterday; “In general, how would you rate your 
169 
mental or emotional health?”, Poor.  Participants that did not have in-home Wi-Fi were provided 
170 
tablets with cellular connectivity to the internet.  Care managers had access to the website and 
171 
were required to log into the website daily, but had the ability to log in at any time.  Monitoring 
172 
equipment, tablets and website were all HIPAA- compliant.  Tablets and kits were returned at the 
173 
first follow-up visit.  Tablets and monitoring equipment were physically cleaned and data-wiped 
174 
before being distributed to the next participant. Four Wi-Fi and four cell coverage tablets were 
175 
available for distribution.    
176 
  
177 
Patients in the SOC group received the normal standard of care for vascular surgery patients, 
178 
which is to apply a sterile dressing immediately after complete closure, and the surgery site 
179 
assessed 24 hours after the procedure.  If there were no local complications, hematomas or 
180 
dehiscence, patients were discharged with the following instructions. Keep your incision dry for 
181 
24 hours. If covered, keep it covered for 24 hours. You may shower after 72 hours, pat incision 
182 
dry with soft towel, do not sit in a tub or soak wound for 1 week (swimming, hot tub included).

Sample:

195 
The population for the current study was patients with any planned vascular procedures with cut-
196 
down access to the infra-inguinal area and treated by one of the board certified vascular surgeons 
197 
in the Vascular Center of Excellence (VCOE).  Sample size estimates were based on infection 
198 
rates from previous research.10, 11 An overall sample size of 200 subjects would have 80% power 
199 
to detect a reduction in the 30-day infection/readmission rate from ~12 in the SOC group to ~2% 
200 
in the THEM group using a 2-sided α of 0.05.  We expected a 10% drop-out rate and planned to 
201 
enroll 110 patients in each group (N=220 overall).  Full enrollment, depending upon the number 
202 
of patients that agree to participate, would have taken 2 years or longer.  Based on available 
203 
funding, the study enrollment was stopped after one year.  Planned patient exclusions included 
204 
the following: (1) did not plan to do follow-up visit at the VCOE; (2) inability to sign or 
205 
understand the consent form; and (3) did not have home internet service with Wi-Fi and/or

Statistical Analysis: 
209 
 
All analyses were based on intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses.  Descriptive statistics 
210 
are expressed in terms of frequencies, percentages, or means + standard deviation (SD).  
211 
Categorical variables were tested by chi-square or Fisher exact tests and continuous 
212 
variables were tested by student t-test or paired t-test for pre/post measures, or repeated 
213 
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) where deemed appropriate.  All probability values 
214 
were 2 sided and ‘p’ values <0.05 was considered significant.  Statistical analyses will be 
215 
performed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2010. IBM SPSS Statistics for 
216 
Windows, Version 19.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).

218 
Informed consent was obtained by the research coordinator. Eligible patients were randomly 
219 
assigned to either the treatment group (THEM) or the control group (SOC).  The study protocol 
220 
was approved by our governing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted in accordance 
221 
with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements and the 
222 
prevailing ethical principles governing research.  In addition, the study was registered on 
223 
https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/;NCT02767011.12  The randomization was performed centrally 
224 
using an SPSS computer algorithm.  Treating physicians were blinded to the randomization, 
225 
although one of whom served as medical director of the care management team and was 
226 
consulted by the care managers during post-surgical treatment decisions.  Participants from 
227 
either group were scheduled for in-home visits from “visiting nurse service (VNS) based on

RESULTS:  
231 
 
232 
Eighty vascular surgery patients were screened for possible inclusion into the current study.  
233 
After the screening process, 50 patients did not meet inclusion criteria, refused to participate or 
234 
were excluded from the study results. (Table 2)   Ultimately, thirty patients were enrolled, of 
235 
which 16 (53.3%) were randomized to the THEM and 14 (46.7%) to the SOC groups.  The 
236 
average age and BMI for THEM and SOC patients were similar (62.5 + 7.2 versus 65.7 + 7.3, 
237 
p=0.234; and 27.7 + 4.3 versus 29.1 + 7.1, p=0.487).  The average driving distance from the 
238 
vascular center clinic for the THEM patients was similar to those in the SOC group (60.2 + 42.1 
239 
miles versus 48.6 + 28.5 miles; p=0.393).  THEM patients had significantly more 
240 
hypercholesterolemia 93.8 versus 50.0%, p=0.012. (Table 3) 
241 
   
242 
There were no significant differences in wound or in 30-day readmissions (6.3% versus 7.1%, 
243 
p=1.000; and 25.0% versus 14.3%, p=0.657).  Interestingly, 30-day infection rates indicated care 
244 
managers identified marginally more superficial wound problems in the THEM group (31.3% 
245 
versus 7.1%, p=0.175).  There was no difference in the number of patients that received home 
246 
nursing visits (n=3 each group, p=1.000) or in the average number of visits (THEM 1.3 + 2.9 vs 
247 
SOC 1.4 + 2.9, p=0.967).  Both groups reported an increase in SF8 physical summary scores, but 
248 
the increase was more pronounced in THEM (pre-post delta = 9.0 versus 4.5) patients (p=0.076).  
249 
There was no significant difference between the two groups for SF8 mental health summary 
250 
score.  THEM patients reported a significantly greater improvement in quality of life on three of 
251 
the SF8 quality subscales.  The difference for THEM patients on the physical-function subscale

(pre-post delta) was 7.5 versus 1.1 for the SOC group (p=0.002).  The difference for THEM 
253 
patients on the role-physical subscale (pre-post delta) was 8.7 versus 1.1 for the SOC group 
254 
(p<0.001).  The pre-post delta difference for THEM patients on the role-emotional subscale was 
255 
6.3 versus -0.5 for the SOC group (p=0.030).  THEM patients reported trends for higher 
256 
satisfaction in terms of general satisfaction, technical quality and accessibility for PSQ18 survey 
257 
questions (4.2 versus 3.7, p=0.072; 4.5 versus 4.1, p=0.081; and 4.2 versus 3.8, p=0.063), 
258 
respectively. (Table 4)  
259 
 
260 
Ancillary findings: 
261 
 
262 
Sensor data was collected by the bio-sensors, uploaded to the tablets via Bluetooth and then 
263 
synced with the care management website.  The sensor data revealed 207 blood pressure and 
264 
pulse rate measurements.  The average systolic blood pressure was (mean,+SD ) 132.4 +  18.6 
265 
mmHG.  The average diastolic blood pressure was 79.6 + 13.9 mmHG.  The average pulse rate 
266 
was 78.3 + 15.8 BPM.  There were 33 (15.9%) high systolic alerts (>150 mmHG), 37 (17.9%) 
267 
high diastolic alerts (>90 mmHG), 19 (9.2%) high pulse alerts (>100 BPM) and 24 (11.6%) low 
268 
pulse alerts (<60 BPM).  The average oxygen saturation rate was 94.8% + 3.8% with 21 (9.7%) 
269 
low (<90%) alerts.  The average weight was 167.2 + 36.2 lbs.  There were some system alerts 
270 
generated by large variations in daily weight +10 lbs.  However, it was discovered that the large 
271 
variations or discrepancies in weights were explained by non-standard methods for obtaining 
272 
weight, such as different mode of dress or at a different time of day.  Daily temperature 
273 
monitoring resulted in no alerts.

In addition, and not counting some inadvertent shutter pushes, THEM patients took 141 
276 
photographs (mean 8.8 + SD; range 0-27 9.7) to be shared with the care management team.  Four 
277 
patients in the THEM arm had superficial wound infections that were treated without the need 
278 
for an emergency room visit or an unscheduled office visit.  Anecdotally, these patients told the 
279 
care managers that they were very satisfied to take photographs and have them reviewed by a 
280 
physician.  Subsequently, the physician called in prescriptions for antibiotics to the patients’ 
281 
local pharmacies.  Interestingly, patients that took photographs indicating no infection were also 
282 
anecdotally pleased to receive reassurance from a physician.  One patient in THEM with a deep 
283 
wound infection was a redo-surgery for a graft wound infection, and in retrospect, current wound 
284 
infection should have been part of our exclusion criteria.  Another patient in THEM had a 
285 
chronic non-healing wound.  However, he had a closed bypass graft.  Ultimately, three patients 
286 
in THEM were sent to the hospital for emergency room visits, but their visits can be explained

by clinical conditions that were not associated with the cut down procedure or infection.  One 
288 
was admitted with the deep wound infection (i.e., mentioned above), one with pulmonary 
289 
embolism and the other had a non-wound related problem (urinary retention) and suspected deep 
290 
vein thrombosis which was ruled out by non-invasive duplex ultrasound testing.  
291 
 
292 
THEM patients had phone and electronic access to a care manager 7 days a week.  The majority 
293 
of THEM patients also rated the Enform™ technology easy to use (27/33 = 82%).  Often care 
294 
managers scheduled follow-up appointments, answered post-discharge questions, procured 
295 
prescriptions and consequently provided direct access to the care management team.  THEM 
296 
patients became involved in monitoring their own bio-markers.  This is evidenced by their 
297 
responses to the daily and weekly quiz questions. Tables 5a & 5b)  As you can see the quiz

question, “During the past week, would you say that information you provided to your Care 
299 
Manager(s) via Enform™ enriched the conversation or quality of care provided?” most 
300 
respondents (27/33 = 82%) selected “Definitely yes.”  In addition, there were several anecdotal 
301 
comments made to the care managers that also support this belief.  For example, one patient 
302 
reported to a care manager, “I knew you were going to call because my blood pressure was high 
303 
this morning.”   
304 
 
305 
Discussion: 
306 
 
307 
Many researchers have evaluated utilization of THEM in several evolving aspects of vascular 
308 
surgery.  Chisci et al evaluated a THEM consultation model for planning and treatment of 
309 
complex thoracoabdominal aortic disease (TAAD) and concluded that THEM may allow 
310 
inexperienced surgeon to acquire and share knowledge from experienced surgeons at larger 
311 
institutions.13  Another important aspect of using THEM in postoperative wound care is the 
312 
potential to facilitate transition of care and to decrease readmission for surgical site infections. 14  
313 
We found no significant differences in wound or 30-day readmissions (6.3% versus 7.1%, 
314 
p=1.000; and 25.0% versus 14.3%, p=0.657).  However, the central reason for not detecting any 
315 
significant difference between groups was likely due to our low enrollment numbers, which will 
316 
be discussed below.      
317 
 
318 
Despite our lack of a primary statistically significant finding, we found several instances where 
319 
our results suggested the benefit of using THEM and increased quality of life and patient 
320 
satisfaction.  THEM patients had a more pronounced change in pre/post SF-8 physical summary 
321

scores (p=0.076).  In addition, THEM patients had more pronounced effects for three of the 
322 
subscales as well (i.e., physical function, physical role and mental health; all interactions <0.05).  
323 
Besides quality of life measures, there was some evidence for THEM patients being more 
324 
satisfied with their health care.  We found marginal trends for THEM patients to have more 
325 
general satisfaction, rate technical quality and accessibility higher (p values ranged from 0.063 – 
326 
0.081).  As compared to others, 1-3, 6, 15 the current study went beyond a feasibility type of study 
327 
and provided real world evidence that suggests patients will adopt and accept remote monitoring.  
328 
THEM patients rated remote monitoring and medical device technology as easy to use and 
329 
believed that their efforts enriched the quality of care that they received. 
330 
 
331 
There are many potential uses for telehealth communications including reaching out to 
332 
communities in underserved areas, achieving better quality of patient care, avoiding 
333 
hospitalization, producing cost savings, improving surgeons’ experience, providing an 
334 
opportunity for international consultation to underdeveloped countries and expansion of medical 
335 
knowledge and techniques among health professionals. 1  In our study, THEM patients lived an 
336 
average of 60.2 miles from the vascular care center with some 31.3% more than 77 miles 
337 
requiring a two to three hour drive.  The patients that received call-in prescriptions were very 
338 
satisfied and grateful for the continuity of care and were glad that they did not have to make a 
339 
trip back to the vascular center.   
340 
 
341 
In the current study, care managers used system alerts and wound pictures to determine whether 
342 
a consultation with the medical director was necessary. Even though it was of secondary interest, 
343 
we found patients to be appreciative of the direct connection to the care management team and 
344

took advantage of this opportunity by having the care managers to schedule follow-up 
345 
appointments, answer post-discharge questions and help procure prescription medications.  
346 
Although somewhat underutilized 7, THEM can be used as a useful tool to minimize the costs 
347 
and challenges for postoperative vascular patients.  Endean et al 3 reported the efficacy and 
348 
accuracy of THEM, and concluded that the evaluation of vascular patients is accurate and as 
349 
effective as on-site evaluations for a variety of vascular problems.  Yet, important adjuncts 
350 
enhance the success of the evaluation are physician experience with the technology and the 
351 
presence of a knowledgeable on-site assistant.  This technology can be easily adapted to other 
352 
clinical situations. 
353 
 
354 
Another important aspect of THEM is the potential to improve quality of care in both outpatient 
355 
and inpatient wound care along with decreased medical cost and hospital resources by allowing 
356 
home care nurses to electronically transmit images of patients' wounds to treating surgeons. In 
357 
our study, nurse care mangers were able to have uninterrupted access to the condition of the 
358 
patient’s wounds and maintained uninterrupted access to a supervising physician 24/7.  Likewise, 
359 
THEM patients had phone and electronic access to a care manager 7 days a week.  THEM 
360 
patients rated the technology as easy to use and believed these efforts impacted their health care.  
361 
Often care managers served as the direct connection to the health care system by scheduling 
362 
follow-up appointments, answering post-discharge questions and helping to procure prescriptions  
363 
 
364 
In another vascular surgery study2, the authors concluded that wound evaluation on the basis of 
365 
viewing digital images is comparable with standard wound examination and renders similar 
366 
diagnoses and treatment in the majority of cases.  In our study, THEM patients took 141 
367

17 
 
photographs all of which were shared with the care management physician.  Four of these photos 
368 
contained elements of superficial wound infections, all of which were treated by calling in a 
369 
prescription to a local pharmacy without the need for an emergency room visit or an unscheduled 
370 
office visit.  Interestingly, patients were pleased to have their photographs reviewed by a 
371 
physician, whether antibiotic or reassurance of no infection was provided.  Although not 
372 
measured, the photographic images seemed to be high quality and easily used by the care team to 
373 
make assessments about the patients’ wound conditions.  However, it is possible that THEM 
374 
technology provided an extra level of scrutiny which, led to increased or unnecessary diagnosis, 
375 
treatment or prescription medication.  With this in mind, we believe that sharing information 
376 
among the care team members served to decrease the possibility of over utilization.   
377 
 
378 
Although we found no significant differences for wound or any readmissions, or any of the office 
379 
or home nursing visits, it was noteworthy that three THEM patients were sent to the emergency 
380 
room.  One was admitted with deep wound infection (i.e., the one that was a redo graft 
381 
infection), one for suspected PE and one with urinary retention where suspected DVT was ruled 
382 
out.  Thus, we suspect an added benefit of THEM technology is to provide better and continuous 
383 
health care, perhaps avoiding a more complicated septic course or death.    
384 
 
385 
Insurance companies are beginning to reimburse patients and providers for telehealth services, 
386 
which should help to drive health care costs down.16, 17  On the other hand, THEM technology 
387 
carries potential concerns such as availability of internet service, cost of devices or internet 
388 
service, ease of usability as some patients are typically not as device-savvy (e.g., as the newer 
389 
generation), privacy of information according to HIPAA, concerns on scams from internet and a 
390

general right to privacy.  Therefore, at a minimum, we recommend these issues to be considered 
391 
thoroughly by the hospital’s legal and information technology teams in order to provide the best 
392 
options for patients.  
393 
 
394 
Limitations: 
395 
 
396 
A major limitation of the findings for the current research study was sample size.  There were 
397 
several reasons for the lower than planned enrollment number.  First, funding was only available 
398 
for one year and thus limited the amount of time for open enrollment.  Next, it took some time to 
399 
develop a good method for identifying potential participants and providing them with the 
400 
opportunity to learn about the study.  Efforts were made to make contact with the patients during 
401 
their pre-admission testing visit to introduce the general idea of participating in the study, but 
402 
this was not always possible and in some cases contact was not before the procedure.  Lastly, and 
403 
perhaps equally important was the number of patients who refused to participate.  Although our 
404 
percentage of refusals was somewhat expected (22/80=27.5%), additional efforts in pre-study 
405 
design could have potentially increased our yield.  Nine of the 22 patients who refused did so 
406 
because of apprehension to the technology.  Perhaps a 10-15 minute video describing the study 
407 
could have reduced some of the apprehension about the technological aspects of the study.     
408 
 
409 
Conclusion:  
410 
 
411 
THEM was technically feasible and provided some benefit to patients in geographically disparate 
412 
areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction.  Additional findings suggested

THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took advantage of increased access to health 
414 
care professionals.  Telehealth successfully merged remotely generated information with care 
415 
manager interaction.  Presently, a larger study, preferably multicenter, is warranted.
