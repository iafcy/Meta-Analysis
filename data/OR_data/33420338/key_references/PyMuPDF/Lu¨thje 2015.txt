Aims
Only limited comparative data exist on the beneﬁts of ﬂuid monitoring (FM) combined with remote monitoring (RM)
regarding morbidity and mortality of heart failure (HF) patients. This prospective single-centre randomized pilot study
aimed to estimate the inﬂuence of RM in combination with FM on HF hospitalizations as well as ventricular tachyarrhyth-
mias and mortality.
Methods
and results
Patients with standard indication for implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy
and deﬁbrillator were implanted with devices capable of RM and FM, and were followed for 15 months. Subjects were
randomly allocated to RM including OptiVol and predeﬁned management of alerts (remote group), or standard in-
ofﬁce visits every 3 months (control group). A total of 176 patients (77% male; 66 +12 years; left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) 32 +11%; ischemic cardiomyopathy 50%; CRT device 50%; primary prevention 85%) were analysed.
Cox proportional hazard analysis on the time to ﬁrst HF-related hospitalization showed a hazard ratio of 1.23 [0.62–
2.44] (P ¼ 0.551) favouring the control group. In the remote group, 13 patients (15%) experienced ICD shocks vs. 10
patients (11%) in the control group (P ¼ 0.512). The average time to ﬁrst ICD shock was 212+173 days in the
remote arm and 212+ 143 days in the control arm (P ¼ 0.994). The Kaplan–Meier estimate of mortality after 1 year
was 8.6% (eight deaths) in the remote group vs. 4.6% in the control group (six deaths; P ¼ 0.502).
Conclusion
In a single-centre randomized pilot study of RM in combination with FM, no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on HF-related hospita-
lizations, ICD shocks, or mortality was found.

Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is a highly prevalent disease with substantial mor-
bidity and mortality. Consequently, the disease is an important
healthcare issue with the majority of costs attributed to HF hospita-
lizations.1 Efforts continue to detect ﬂuid accumulation early to
prevent hospitalization for acute cardiac decompensation. As clinical
signs of HF deterioration are often unreliable, device-based sensors
have been developed for the continuous monitoring of the patients’
HF status. One such approach is the continuous measurement of
intrathoracic impedance with an implanted cardiac arrhythmia
device. While ﬁrst investigations showed promising results,2–4
larger and randomized trials revealed disappointing outcomes.5,6 A
valid option for improving the ﬂuid monitoring (FM) feature might
be additional use of remote monitoring (RM), as timely measures
of wireless ﬂuid overload alerts may avert cardiac decompensation
and HF hospitalization. So far, only limited comparative data exist
on the beneﬁts of wireless FM regarding morbidity and mortality of
HF patients.
This prospective single-centre randomized pilot study aimed to
evaluate the inﬂuence of RM in combination with wireless FM using
OptiVol alerts (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) on time to ﬁrst

HF-related hospitalization as well as tachyarrhythmia occurrences

Methods
Patient selection
Adetaileddescriptionof thestudy designhasbeenpublished previously.7
In brief, patients aged .18 years in need for an implantable cardioverter
deﬁbrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy and deﬁbrillator
(CRT-D) according to current guidelines or patients with a previously
implanted device without FM feature and a replacement indication for
battery depletion were included in the study after written informed
consent. Heart failure or a history of decompensated HF hospitalization
wasnotaprerequisiteforinclusion.Medtronicdeviceswithtelemonitor-
ing capabilities and OptiVol alert (Concerto or Consulta CRT-D, Virtu-
oso or Secura ICD-DR) were used. Exclusion criteria were permanent
atrial ﬁbrillation, a life expectancy ≤15 months, pregnancy, and participa-
tion in another study.
OptiVol ﬂuid index
TheOptiVolﬂuidindexhasbeendescribedindetailelsewhere.4,8Inbrief,
the device determines a representative impedance daily and compares
this with a roving reference value. Whenever daily impedance drops
below the reference, a cumulative, absolute difference is calculated,
and called ﬂuid index. Crossing a programmable threshold indicates a
possible ﬂuid overload of the patient, and an OptiVol alert is triggered.
Study design and protocol
Thisrandomized,single-centre,prospectivepilotstudycomplieswiththe
Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the In-
stitutional Ethics Committee. All patients gave their written informed
consent. Patients receiving CRT-D or DR-ICD implants or replacements
wererandomizedtoRMincludingOptiVolON(remotearm)vs.RMOFF
(standard arm) and followed for 15 months. In both groups, the audible
OptiVol alert was disabled. Patients in the remote arm, however,
were connected to the Medtronic CareLink network. The OptiVol
ﬂuid index threshold was set to the nominal 60 V at implantation and
remainedunchangedduringfollow-up.Incaseofanautomaticalerttrans-
mission, a pre-speciﬁed clinical decision routine was activated as detailed
in Figure 1. Evaluation of the clinical status of the patients included assess-
ment of symptoms such as dyspnoea, weightgain, oedema, activity status,
and fatigue.
In the control group, standard in-ofﬁce visits were performed every 3
months.
Aims
The aim of this study was to estimate the inﬂuence of RM in combination
with FM using OptiVol alerts on the time to ﬁrst HF-related hospitaliza-
tion as well as tachyarrhythmia occurrence and mortality when com-
pared with standard clinical care.
Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using commercial software. Unless
otherwise noted, all data are reported as mean+ SD. Differences
in baseline characteristics were evaluated using a Student’s t-test, a x2
test, or a Fisher’s exact test, where appropriate. For time to ﬁrst
HF-related hospitalization, time to ﬁrst ICD shock, and time to death a
Cox proportional hazard analysis, and a Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
with log-rank test were performed. A P-value of ,0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
Results
Patient characteristics
BetweenDecember2007andApril2011,atotalof180patientswere
included. Two patients were not randomized because the planned
devicewaseventually notimplanted.Anothertwopatientswithdrew
their consent soon after implantation. Thus, after exclusion of the
described 4 patients, a total of 176 patients were analysed. Baseline
characteristics are summarized in Table 1. At inclusion, there were
73 patients (83.9%) in the remote arm in functional NYHA class II
or higher, comparing with 82 patients (93.2%) in the control arm, re-
spectively. A CRT device was implanted in half of the patients in both
groups.
OptiVol alerts, urgent visits, and
hospitalizations
A total of 174 OptiVol alerts (94 in CRT patients and 80 in ICD
patients) in 68 patients (35 patients with CRT and 33 patients with
ICD) occurred in the remote group (i.e. 78% of the remote group
patients). Of these, 93 alerts (54 in CRT patients and 39 in ICD
patients) were classiﬁed as true positive based on clinical assessment
of the circumstances but not on the basis of a later required hospital-
ization. In 74 of these cases, ambulatory patient management was
clinically possible, whereas in 19 cases hospitalization was required.
All decisions were made by the investigators.
One additional hospitalization occurred without prior OptiVol
alert. Thus, in total, 20 patients in the remote group and 22 patients
in the control group were hospitalized for worsened HF during
the follow-up period. As shown in Figure 2, Cox proportional
hazard analysis on the time to ﬁrst HF-related hospitalization
showed a hazard ratio of 1.231 ([0.621–2.438]; P ¼ 0.551). The
mean number of emergency department visits was not signiﬁcantly
different between the two groups (RM group 0.10+ 0.25 vs.
What’s new?
† So far only few tools for monitoring patients with chronic
heart failure (HF) to identify early cardiac deterioration exist.
† Continuous measurement of intrathoracic impedance with an
implanted cardiac arrhythmia device might improve the man-
agement of HF patients.
† So far data investigating the impedance measurement are
conﬂicting.
† Furthermore, only limited comparative data exist on the ben-
eﬁts of ﬂuid monitoring (FM) combinedwith remote monitor-
ing regarding morbidity and mortality of HF patients.
† This prospective randomized pilot study adds important infor-
mation to thevalue ofdevice-based FM combined with teleme-
dical support for the early detection of HF decompensation to
reduce hospitalizations.

controlgroup 0.10+0.23; P ¼ 0.7295).The mean numberof urgent
care visits, however, differed statistically signiﬁcant with 0.30+0.50
visits in the remote group and 0.10+ 0.30 visits in the control group
(P ¼ 0.0332).
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias and
mortality
In the remote group, 13 patients (15%) experienced ICD shocks vs.
10 patients (11%) in the control group. Inappropriate shocks were
delivered in four cases in two patients (2%) in the remote arm and
in two cases in two patients (2%) in the control arm. Reasons for in-
appropriate therapy were atrial ﬁbrillation with fast ventricular rate
(n ¼ 3), sinus tachycardia (n ¼ 1), lead failure (n ¼ 1), and electro-
cauterization upon non-cardiac surgery (n ¼ 1). The average time
to ﬁrst ICD shock was 212+ 173 days in the RM arm and 212 +
143 days in the control arm (P ¼ 0.994). Kaplan–Meier analysis for
time to ﬁrst ICD shock revealed no signiﬁcant difference between
the two groups (P ¼ 0.512) (Figure 3).
Atotalofeightpatientsintheremotearmwhencomparedwithsix
patients in the control arm died during follow-up. In each group, one
death was classiﬁed as sudden cardiac and three deaths as non-
sudden cardiac death. Non-cardiac deaths occurred once in the
remote group and twice in the control group. Three deaths in the
remote group could not reliably be classiﬁed. The Kaplan–Meier
estimate of all-cause mortality after 1 year was 8.6% in the remote
group vs. 4.6% in the control group. No signiﬁcant difference
could be observed for time to death between the two groups
(P ¼ 0.502) (Figure 4).
Discussion
The main ﬁnding of our study is that device-based FM combined with
RM has no favourable effect when compared with standard clinical
care on the time to ﬁrst HF-related hospitalization as well as tachyar-
rhythmia occurrences, or mortality.

While the ﬁrst small or observational studies investigating
intrathoracic impedance measurement revealed a sensitivity of
60–77% for detection of a HF related ﬂuid accumulation, they also
reported a substantial portion of false-positive detections.2–4
Another study investigating the alert algorithm was able to demon-
strate a reduction of HF hospitalizations9 in a non-randomized com-
parison. However, these positive results could not be conﬁrmed in
subsequent trials. In the prospective observational SENSE-HF
study, sensitivityand positive predictivevalue of impedance monitor-
ing were considerably low.5 In the randomized controlled DOT-HF
study, the use of impedance measurement did not reduce deaths
and HF hospitalizations.6
Importantly, all of the investigations mentioned above have not
combined FM (without audible alert) with RM for the timely detec-
tionofHFdeterioration.Thiscombinationmayovercomeshortcom-
ings of the impedance measurement with the audible alert, such as
frequent unnecessary outpatient clinic visits due to inadequate
alerts, or some overreaction of the treating physician faced with
the patients’ expectation, who may be concerned by an audible alert.
Another important advantage of additional RM might be a further re-
duction of the time from the device alert to the clinical action taken to
prevent manifest decompensation with hospitalization.10,11 Import-
antly, larger studies investigating remote telemedical support for HF
management but not involving automatic transmissions could not
show a beneﬁt.12,13 Very recently, preliminary data of the IN-TIME
study revealed a signiﬁcant reductionofall-causemortalityand cardio-
vascularmortalityinthe RMarmwhencomparedwithcontrols.14The
combined use of impedance measurement and RM was investigated in
the EVOLVO study, demonstrating reduced emergency department
or urgent in-ofﬁce visits by 35% without affecting hospitalizations.10
In our study, we were not able to show a beneﬁt of impedance
monitoring combined with RM when compared with a control
groupdespite a predeﬁned management routine of alerts. In contrast
to the EVOLVO study,10 our study showed more urgent care visits in
the remote group when compared with the controls. Although we
classiﬁed 93 OptiVol alerts as true positive, and ≈80% of these
alerts were manageable without the need for hospitalization, this
did not translate into a reduction of HF-related hospitalizations
when compared with standard treatment. Several reasons may
account for this. First, as HF hospitalizations could not be used
anymore as a gold standard when aiming to avoid them, not all
alerts may have been correctly classiﬁed. Secondly, the natural
course of impending HF deterioration may not always lead to mani-
fest cardiac decompensation, but also to spontaneous improvement
of HF and return to stable conditions. In this context, the aim of the
study of an early intervention to prevent hospitalization might have
beencounteractedbyearlydetectionsofHFdecompensationneces-
sitating in-patient treatment in the remote group. The same patient
in the control group might have spontaneously improved without
the need for hospitalization and unnoticed by a physician. Finally,
cardiac decompensation may be more complex than the assumption
of a prolonged subclinical period of linear HF deterioration be-
fore manifest decompensation, thus measurable with intrathoracic
impedance.15 Indeed, in our study 19 of the positive alert patients
were clinically diagnosed as an already manifest cardiac decompensa-
tion that required hospitalization. These cases suggest a shorter sub-
clinical period before decompensation without a genuine chance to
intervene.
Results reported by Singh et al.16 suggested that worsening clinical
conditions such as hospitalization for HF are associated with an

increased risk of ICD shock delivery. Furthermore, an increased risk
for ﬁrst and recurrent HF events after ICD discharge has been
found.17 Several investigations have also shown that appropriate as
well as inappropriate ICD discharges negatively impact on mortal-
ity.18 Thus, improvement of HF status as well as early detection of
device-related problems using telemonitoring should be capable of
impactingontherateofinappropriateandappropriateICDshockde-
liveries on the one hand. On the other hand, a reduction of ICD dis-
charges could positively inﬂuence HF-related hospitalization and
mortality. In the present study, however, we were not able to see a
signiﬁcant difference of ICD shock deliveries between the remote
and the control arms. This is in line with previously published data
from Landolina et al.10. However, in their study as well as in ours,
the number of events might not have been high enough for sufﬁcient
discrimination.
So far, only limited data are available concerning mortality and
intrathoracic impedance monitoring or telemonitoring use. Previous
studies investigating the impact of impedance monitoring or telemo-
nitoring onHF hospitalizationsor deathrevealednosigniﬁcant differ-
ences between the control and treatment groups.6,12 These studies
are in line with our data, as we were unable to demonstrate mortality
differences between the treatment and control groups. As men-
tioned earlier, recently results from the IN-TIME trial14 were pre-
sented. A total of 664 patients with implanted cardiac arrhythmia
devices were randomly assigned to telemonitoring or standard
careandfollowedfor12months.Asigniﬁcantreductionoftotalmor-
tality and cardiovascular mortality of ≏65% between the two groups
was observed. This risk reduction during 12 months of follow-up is
difﬁcult to comprehend in the light of our results, even if our study
included only about a quarter of the patients and was as a pilot
study not powered for mortality analysis. Currently, two large trials
aimed at further elucidating the role of RM combined with FM are
under way.19,20
Limitations
Themainlimitationofourstudyisthenumberofpatientsincluded.As
no signiﬁcant differences between the treatment groups were found,
our results should be interpreted with the caution that they may be
due to under-powering. However, we have conducted a uniform
single-centre prospective, randomized pilot study with ≏180
patients included, thus hypothesis generating conclusions may be
drawnfromourdata.Anotherpotentiallimitationisthesingle-centre

experienced study group reduces the risk of heterogenous response

be substantially reduced.
Conclusion
The data of this single-centre prospective randomized pilot trial do
not support the use of RM combined with intrathoracic impedance
monitoring in patients implanted with cardiac arrhythmia devices
for the reduction of hospitalizations, tachyarrhythmia occurrence
or mortality. This data need to be conﬁrmed in large randomized
trials.
