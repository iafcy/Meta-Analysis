Abstract
Context—Lung cancer patients experience multiple, simultaneous symptoms related to their
disease and treatment that impair functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Computer
technology can reduce barriers to nonsystematic, infrequent symptom assessment and potentially
contribute to improved patient care.
Objectives—To evaluate the efficacy of technology-based symptom monitoring and reporting in
reducing symptom burden in patients with advanced lung cancer.
Methods—This was a prospective, multisite, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Two hundred
fifty-three patients were enrolled at three sites and randomized to monitoring and reporting (MR)
or monitoring alone (MA). Patients completed questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks and
symptom surveys via interactive voice response (IVR) weekly for 12 weeks. MR patients’
clinically significant symptom scores generated an e-mail alert to the site nurse for management.
The primary endpoint was overall symptom burden; secondary endpoints included HRQL,
treatment satisfaction, symptom management barriers, and self-efficacy.
Results—This RCT failed to demonstrate efficacy of symptom monitoring and reporting in
reducing symptom burden compared with monitoring alone in lung cancer. HRQL declined over
12 weeks in both groups (P<0.006 to P<0.025); at week 12, treatment satisfaction was higher in
MA than MR patients (P<0.012, P<0.027). Adherence to weekly calls was good (82%) and patient
satisfaction was high.
Conclusion—Feasibility of using a technology-based system for systematic symptom
monitoring in advanced lung cancer patients was demonstrated. Future research should focus on

Introduction
Patients with advanced lung cancer face a shortened life expectancy and typically
experience multiple, simultaneous, debilitating symptoms related to their disease and its
treatment. In addition to impairing patients’ daily functioning and health-related quality of
life (HRQL) (1), unrecognized or poorly controlled symptoms can cause emergency
department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for management as well as decreased treatment
efficacy (2, 3). Outpatient chemotherapy is usually administered over several months, with
office visits scheduled two to four weeks apart. As a result, many symptoms emerge
between scheduled clinic appointments (4, 5), which creates challenges for the effective and
timely monitoring and management of symptoms.
There are many patient, provider and health system barriers to adequate symptom
management (1, 6). Two widely reported barriers are inadequate or nonsystematic symptom
assessment (6–10) and limited patient-provider communication about symptoms (1, 11, 12).
Clinicians vary in their ability to elicit information about patient symptoms (13–16) and
systematically underestimate them (17–20). Patients often forget to report important medical
information (21, 22) and fail to accurately report symptom levels (23). Systematic symptom
assessment and reporting to the provider is associated with reduced symptom distress (24,
25), better pain control (26, 27) and improved, more focused symptom communication (6,
28, 29).
Advances in health information technology (HIT) enable routine, systematic assessment of
patient-reported outcomes (PROs; e.g., symptoms and HRQL) that can be conducted from
home, between office visits, with minimal burden (5, 6, 30). Technology-based monitoring
is feasible and well-accepted by patients (31–36), improves patient-provider communication
(37– 39), and focuses attention on priority symptoms (39–45).
We elected to use telephone-based interactive voice response (IVR) technology for our
Symptom Monitoring and Reporting System for Lung Cancer (SyMon-L) because of the
telephone’s widespread adoption and familiarity. In our observational, single institution pilot
study (46), we found IVR monitoring to be feasible and acceptable to patients, which also
has been demonstrated by others (47–56). This paper describes a multisite, prospective,
randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating whether technology-based weekly symptom
monitoring and automated reporting of problematic symptoms to the clinical team reduces
on-treatment symptom burden of people with advanced lung cancer compared with
monitoring alone (i.e., with no reporting to the clinical team). We hypothesized that SyMon-
L monitoring and reporting, a more active intervention, would reduce symptom burden to a
greater extent than a more passive monitoring intervention by facilitating timely care

management realized because of early problem identification and intervention, with
secondary benefit to HRQL, treatment satisfaction, perceived barriers to symptom
management, and self-efficacy.
Methods
Study Design
Following approval by the research site institutional review boards, we enrolled ambulatory
patients with advanced (Stage III or IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) in a non-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of technology-based
symptom monitoring with reporting (MR group) to the clinical team compared with
symptom monitoring alone (MA group). Both groups monitored their symptoms weekly;
they differed in two respects: (1) automated delivery of reports of clinically significant
symptoms of the MR group to their clinical team for further assessment and/or management;
and (2) availability of paper copies of longitudinal, graphical displays of symptom scores to
MR patients and their clinical teams at scheduled clinic visits.
We hypothesized that the mechanism by which symptom burden would be reduced is earlier
reporting of clinically significant symptoms to the clinical team. Thus, we originally
proposed also to evaluate the time-to-spontaneous reporting of any clinically significant
symptom by MA patients to the clinical team, which required that we assess their weekly
symptom burden, as we did with MR patients. However, discussions with nursing staff prior
to RCT implementation indicated that this would not be feasible because of the demands of
and delays in documenting patients’ phone calls, so this endpoint was dropped.
The primary endpoint was symptom burden over 12 weeks, as defined by a measure of
symptom distress. We also hypothesized that the MR intervention would result in reduced
patient-perceived barriers to symptom management and increased patient self-efficacy,
HRQL, and satisfaction with treatment relative to the MA condition, which were
conceptualized as secondary endpoints. If SyMon-L was effective in reducing symptom
burden, reductions in some types of health care utilization also might be expected, although
some types of utilization also may increase. Thus, health care utilization was included as an
exploratory endpoint. The clinical interventions undertaken in response to alerts (MR only)
and scheduled clinic visits (MR and MA) were documented as an additional exploratory
endpoint.
After providing informed consent, participants completed baseline measures and were
randomly assigned by computer in a 1:1 ratio to the MR or the MA group. Randomization
was blocked, stratified by institution, with a goal of enrolling 100 participants from each of
the three sites (total N=300), 150 in each group.
All participants selected a day for their weekly IVR calls. After entering their study PIN,
they completed a 13-item symptom survey (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
[FACT] – Lung Symptom Index [FLSI] (57) by entering a response from 1 to 5 (“not at all”
to “very much”) using the telephone keypad. They received reminder calls on two

consecutive days after their selected day if they failed to call. This survey was completed
weekly for 12 weeks.
For MR participants, any responses meeting a pre-defined threshold for a symptom “alert”
generated an e-mail to the site nurse. Based on results from a previous standard setting
exercise (unpublished), we set a conservative threshold of “quite a bit” or “very much” or a
two-point worsening from the previous week. A site nurse contacted the participants within
one business day to assess the symptom and provide clinical care as warranted. Paper copies
of longitudinal graphs of symptom and HRQL scores were provided to physicians and MR
participants at scheduled visits, approximately every three weeks, with the intent of
facilitating discussion between physicians and patients, but their use was not further
prescribed or monitored. All participants completed additional assessments at 3, 6, 9 and 12
weeks post-baseline (see Measures).
Provider Participants
Clinics at the three sites participating in this study reflected differences in organization and
staffing, but all physicians who treated lung cancer at each of the sites were enrolled along
with one or more designated clinical staff. Provider participants at one academic medical
center included the sole thoracic oncologist, one registered nurse (RN) and physician
assistant; at the second academic medical center, provider participants included all three
thoracic oncologists and one RN. At the county public hospital, five medical oncologists,
nine oncology fellows and one RN participated in the study.
During initial face-to-face meetings with participating providers at all sites, the study team
provided training on all aspects of the study protocol, including providers’ roles and
responsibilities. The training included interpretation of the symptom graphs (e.g., color-
coded symptom “alerts”; interpreting high versus low scores) but did not include a
prescription for how symptoms should be managed.
Patient Participants
Patient participants were enrolled at the three sites described above. Eligibility criteria
included: being at least 18 years old, English-speaking, having advanced NSCLC or SCLC,
receiving active treatment with traditional chemotherapy no later than Day 1 of Cycle 2 or
receiving oral therapy, having access to a telephone and life expectancy of at least six
months.
Measures
Sociodemographic and Clinical Information—Participant sociodemographic and
clinical information was collected at baseline. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
Performance Status Rating (ECOG PSR) (58) was obtained from participants and providers
at baseline and each assessment.
Primary Endpoint—Different measures were used for the primary endpoint and the
weekly symptom measure to avoid potential training effects. Overall symptom burden was
measured by the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS) (59, 60). Higher scores reflect greater

distress, with scores ranging from 13 to 65. In addition to established reliability and validity
(59, 60), brevity, and symptom congruence with the FLSI, the SDS was selected because its
scoring yields a total symptom distress score.
Weekly Symptom Assessment: The FLSI was developed by surveying oncologists about
priority advanced lung cancer symptoms and concerns(57) and includes general cancer and
pulmonary symptoms, side effect bother, emotional distress, and contentment with HRQL.
Secondary Endpoints
HRQL: The FACT-General (FACT-G) (61) is a 27-item questionnaire measuring Physical
Well-Being (PWB), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB), Emotional Well-Being (EWB), and
Functional Well-Being (FWB). It is a well-validated and widely used measure of HRQL (61,
62).
Treatment Satisfaction: Satisfaction with treatment was measured with the Functional
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Treatment Satisfaction-Patient Satisfaction (FACIT-
TS-PS) (63, 64), with a focus on the Explanations, Interpersonal, Comprehensive Care, and
Decision-Making subscales.
Patient-Perceived Barriers to Symptom Management: The Symptom Management
Barriers Questionnaire (SMBQ) is a modification of previous barriers questionnaires (11,
15), and assesses patient attitudinal barriers to symptom management.
Self-Efficacy: A 27-item measure was developed by study investigators to optimize its fit
with the particular domains of interest in this study (65), specifically, self-efficacy related to
patient-physician communication, health behaviors and knowledge about accessing care.
Clinical Activity: Using primarily the medical record supplemented by provider query, the
research assistant documented any of 11 clinical management activities (e.g., diagnostic test,
referral) by symptom that were undertaken at each scheduled oncologist visit (MR and MA)
and in response to alerts (MR only).
Medical Care Utilization: Participants completed a checklist of medical care utilization
episodes, including unscheduled clinic visits, ED visits, hospitalizations, and calls to
physicians and nurses at each oncologist visit.
Participant and Provider Perceptions of SyMon-L: End-of-study surveys of participants
and providers captured perceptions of usability and usefulness of the SyMon-L system.
Data Collection
SDS, ECOG PSR, medical utilization, and clinical activity assessments were completed at
weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12 post-baseline; FACT-G, FACIT-TS-PS and self-efficacy assessments
were completed at weeks 6 and 12; and SMBQ and end-of study evaluations were
completed at week 12. Most data were collected from participants using a touchscreen tablet
PC; some data were obtained via interview by the research assistant and entered into the
tablet PC.

Participants were provided with nominal monetary compensation for their participation.
Statistical Analysis
Interim Analyses—To ensure that the intervention had not harmed patients, a blinded
interim analysis of symptom severity and study burden data was planned after half of the
randomized patients (N=150) had reached the Week 12 assessment, and this analysis was
reviewed by the institutional cancer center data and safety monitoring board (DSMB).
Main Analyses—The study was powered to detect a difference between the two study
groups in SDS total score. For this endpoint, a standardized effect size (mean group
difference/common standard deviation) of 0.33 has been suggested to be meaningful in the
measurement of PROs in several different cancer populations (61, 66–71).
Secondary endpoints included the FACT-G, FACIT-TS-PS, SMBQ, self-efficacy, and
medical utilization counts, assessed at multiple time points. Effect sizes considered
meaningful for the secondary PRO endpoints included 0.40 for the FACT-G (72), 0.45 for
the FACIT-TS-PS (73, 74), and 0.33–0.45 for the barriers and self-efficacy endpoints (75).
To achieve 80% power to detect these effects, using a two-sided significance level, α=0.05,
a sample size of at least 146 per group was required (76, 77). Based on our pilot study with
over 100 participants, we had a 0% refusal to participate and less than a 15% rate of
withdrawal during the study. Thus, we projected a 17% withdrawal rate in the 12-week RCT
and increased the accrual goal to 360 (180 in each group), 120 at each site.
Analyses were based on intention-to-treat in all randomized participants and were not
adjusted for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
The primary endpoint was estimated by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the
total SDS score plotted over time for each participant. Interpolation between non-missing
observations was used if intermediate assessments were missing. Study drop-outs were
either assigned a value of the worst possible score in the case of death, or worst or last
observed score, depending on reason for dropping out. The AUC was then divided by the
total time to rescale back to the original units. A general linear model was used to compare
study groups on the primary endpoint adjusted for baseline SDS.
For secondary endpoints, t-tests were used to compare PRO scores between groups at
baseline and subsequent time points.
Results
Interim Analyses
Interim analyses (N=150) showed no difference between groups in the rate of drop-out,
sociodemographic or clinical information, FACT-G, FLSI, or SDS. Questions reflecting
participant burden revealed no differences in satisfaction with symptom management,

perceived benefit of participation, willingness to use SyMon-L, or frequency of preferred
use.
Because the rate of enrollment was slower than anticipated, we conducted futility analyses
as part of the planned interim analyses. The conditional power was calculated under the
original assumptions and under the observed data (78, 79). The unconditional power to
detect a hypothesized effect size of 0.33 as statistically significant, given the sample size
(N=150), was 51%, and the conditional power was estimated to be 3.8%. Computing the
conditional power under the empirical treatment effect yielded an estimate of 0.3%. That is,
if the observed trend in the data was true, we had less than a 1% chance of a statistically
significant difference at the end of the trial (78, 79). Enrollment was continued to the extent
permitted by funding to a final total sample size of 253.
Participant Enrollment and Baseline Characteristics
Fig. 1 summarizes the participant flow. Of 411 eligible participants approached, 253 were
enrolled and randomized. The overall refusal rate was 40%, ranging from 28% at the public
hospital to 44–45% at the other two sites. There were no significant differences in
sociodemographic characteristics between those who agreed and those who refused to
participate.
The study groups were equivalent in baseline characteristics (Table 1) and PROs (Table 2).
However, participants treated at the public hospital reported worse ECOG PSR (P<0.001)
and were more likely to be receiving first-line chemotherapy (P=0.006) than those at the
other two sites.
Over the course of the study, 35 participants withdrew (13.8%; 20 MA, 15 MR, P=0.463).
Compliance with completion of weekly symptom monitoring phone calls was 82.1% (83.4%
MA, 80.8% MR).
Primary Endpoint
There was no difference between groups in mean SDS AUC, adjusted for baseline (MA
mean=25.5, SD=8.3; MR mean=25.3, SD=8.5; P=0.505).
Secondary Endpoints
There were no differences between groups in FACT-G subscales or total score at any time
point, although in the combined sample (MR and MA), PWB, FWB and FACT-G total
scores declined significantly over the 12 weeks (P<0.008, P<0.006, P<0.025, respectively).
There was no difference between groups on the total FACIT-TS-PS score at any time point,
but the MR group had lower scores (i.e., lower satisfaction) than the MA group on the
Comprehensive Care (perceptions of having concerns understood; P=0.012) and Decision
Making (receiving adequate information, time and support; P=0.027) subscales at week 12.
There were no differences over time or between groups in self-efficacy or perceived
barriers.

The symptoms reported most frequently at an alert level for the combined group were
fatigue, poor appetite, difficulty breathing, and treatment side effect bother, as displayed in
Fig. 2. There were 6078 symptom responses meeting the alert threshold during the study.
Exploratory Endpoints
Medical Utilization—There were no significant differences between groups in any of the
medical utilization variables except that MR participants reported making more phone calls
to nurses than MA participants (P=0.022), as displayed in Table 3.
Clinical Activity—Clinical interventions were documented for MA participants for
scheduled clinic visits only, whereas for MR participants, interventions were documented in
response to system-generated alerts and scheduled clinic visits. In addition, some MR alerts
were generated the day before or day of a clinic visit and addressed at the time of the clinic
visit, so those interventions were documented as “both.” Table 4 displays the counts of
interventions provided for the two groups in response to visits and/or alerts. MR group
participants received a total of 1323 interventions in response to alerts (Table 5). Over the
course of the 12-week study, a given MR participant may have received an intervention for
dyspnea or emotional distress up to 15 times; similarly, a given MR participant may have
received an education/counseling or additional follow-up visit up to 32 or 48 times,
respectively.
Participant and Provider Study Evaluations—Ninety-two percent of the full
participant sample reported no problems using the telephone for weekly surveys, and 86%
indicated it was (“very much”/“quite a bit”) convenient. SyMon-L improved communication
with their doctor (46%), helped focus on important issues (49%), and revealed additional
issues that may not have been discussed otherwise (38%); 93% indicated they would use the
system if it was part of their care.
Because of missing data from providers because of schedule constraints, individual
semistructured interviews were subsequently conducted with providers, which will be
reported separately.
Exploratory Analyses
In response to the null findings, we sought to maximize our understanding of the data and
conducted additional, unplanned exploratory analyses.
Given the challenge of achieving reduction in overall symptom burden in the presence of
multiple simultaneous symptoms in advanced disease, we used AUC analyses of individual
SDS items for which there are efficacious treatments: nausea, pain, breathing/cough. There
were no differences in AUCs (adjusted for baseline) for these symptoms, with effect sizes
less than one-tenth of a standard deviation (P=0.595, P=0.927, P=0.934, respectively).
Whereas the SDS was completed approximately every three weeks, the FLSI was
administered weekly. Because symptom burden may have changed more frequently than
could have been detected by the SDS, and imputations for missing SDS data might have
resulted in an underestimation of symptom burden, we examined symptom burden using the
Yount et al.

FLSI total score and the FLSI Pulmonary Symptom Index (PSI: sum of four pulmonary
items). These AUC analyses indicated no difference in symptom burden between the groups
for the total score (P=0.246) or PSI (P=0.563), again with effect sizes of one-tenth of a
standard deviation or less.
To examine potential responders and nonresponders to symptom management, change
scores from baseline were calculated for the 12 FLSI time points and classified as improved,
worsened or unchanged based on the four-point minimally important difference (80). The
proportion of participants in each change group was compared between groups at each week
using Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square tests for ordinal data. There were no differences between
groups in any of the classification groups (P range=0.117 to 0.862).
Discussion
Our RCT of an active monitoring and reporting intervention failed to demonstrate efficacy
in reducing symptom burden when compared with a more passive monitoring intervention in
patients with advanced lung cancer. The hypotheses of benefits to HRQL, treatment
satisfaction, self-efficacy and perceived symptom management burden also were not
supported. However, the trial demonstrated that the SyMon-L intervention is feasible and
well accepted by patients.
Although the two groups did not differ in terms of their total FACIT-TS-PS scores, the MR
group reported lower satisfaction with two elements of treatment (e.g., having concerns
understood, receiving decision making support) than MA participants. An unexpected
finding, one possible explanation of this is that the MR intervention may have elevated
expectations about their symptom care beyond what patients experienced.
There was no difference between the groups in number of hospitalizations, ED visits,
unscheduled clinic visits or calls to physicians, but the MR group reported more calls to
nurses. Based on anecdotal reports from research assistants, we suspect that, contrary to
instructions, participants may have recollected calls from nurses in response to MR alerts.
One of the exploratory endpoints in this pragmatic RCT was the symptom-focused clinical
interventions provided to MA and MR participants. This proved to be complex, both in
terms of implementing the data collection and in its analysis and interpretation. We were not
able to document interventions for MA participants in response to any interactions beyond
scheduled clinic visits (e.g., patient-initiated calls), so our count of interventions provided to
these participants is likely an underestimate. Furthermore, it is not possible to disentangle
MR interventions categorized as “both” (i.e., alert or visit), which limits our interpretation of
this data. As a result, we are not able to ascertain if one group received more clinical
interventions than the other. It does appear that the information provided by MR
participants’ alerts was acted upon, based on the 1323 interventions (plus some unknown
percent from “both”) provided. There is some degree of overlap between the symptom-based
interventions provided in response to alerts (e.g., dyspnea, emotional distress, appetite, pain,
coughing) and the symptoms generating the most alerts (fatigue, appetite, breathing easily,
treatment side effect bother), but the overlap is not perfect. These observations, along with

considerably higher numbers of specific types of interventions (e.g., education/counseling,
additional follow-up visits), suggest potential areas of focus for future research. Thus,
although this endpoint is limited in aiding interpretation of current findings, it may inform
hypotheses for future research
RCTs of technology-based PRO monitoring in oncology have demonstrated acceptability to
patients (38, 81, 82); improved well-being (38); and reduced post-operative symptom
severity (32). Our weekly call compliance rate of 82% and the findings of others (33)
suggest that patients with advanced cancers are capable of using such symptom monitoring
systems, contrary to the concerns of some (34, 38, 83). However, the majority of RCTs and
other studies provide limited evidence of efficacy in achieving improvements in symptom or
health status (36, 84). Another RCT of lung cancer patients, randomized to standard care or
paper HRQL diaries completed over 16 weeks with encouragement to share information
with providers, showed small but non-significant negative effects on HRQL for patients in
the diary group and no effect on satisfaction with care or communication (85).
A recent editorial commenting on the null findings of an RCT of telemonitoring in older
adults at high risk for hospitalization (86), cautioned against discounting the study’s
findings, as the effectiveness of “telehealth” programs may be context- and outcome-
dependent, mediated by factors specific to the intervention implementation and its
evaluation metrics (87). It is in the spirit of attempting to understand null findings from the
perspective of context and implementation that we offer potential explanations for our study
as a guide for future research.
We failed to meet our accrual goal of enrolling 300 participants. Although there were early
delays in technology development, we believe the primary reason was a much higher than
anticipated refusal rate for the RCT (28–45%) compared with our pilot study (0%). Other
symptom/HRQL monitoring RCTs also have found high rates of refusal and attrition (85).
We anticipated distinct differences in patient populations between the pilot and RCT sites
but clearly underestimated the magnitude of potential refusals, especially at the two medical
center sites. One possibility is that a study requiring active patient participation over a
prolonged period of time (12 weeks) represents an overwhelming burden for some who are
struggling to cope with advanced disease. We have anecdotal reports that clinic wait-times
at the public hospital are considerably longer than at the academic medical center sites,
possibly accounting for the lower refusal rate at that site. No other explanation for the
discrepancy is immediately apparent, but requirements for successfully implementing such
studies, such as an expanded data collection period, warrant further evaluation and
consideration in future studies.
Our intervention failed to impact symptom burden over the 12-week study period.
Sensitivity and frequency of administration of the outcome measure are two possible
explanations. However, evaluation of the endpoint using a different, weekly symptom
measure also found no differences. Some have suggested that patients with advanced lung
cancer experience symptom variability warranting daily assessment (88), but we have no
data to support this as an explanation for our findings. It may be unrealistic to achieve
reduction in symptom burden in advanced lung cancer, where some disease or treatment

symptoms are controlled as others emerge with disease progression (89). Whereas some
symptoms lack effective treatment (e.g., fatigue), we also did not find evidence of reduced
burden when we examined symptoms for which there is efficacious treatment. Finally, the
threshold for generating an alert was standardized across symptoms, whereas some have
suggested that each symptom threshold should be set and validated independently (88). As
designed, the system generated a significant number of alerts (>1323) for MR participants,
which could have resulted in alert “fatigue,” distraction or being overwhelmed with
information without prescriptive guidelines. Further research that obtains clinicians’ input
on preferences for clinically actionable symptom alert thresholds may inform the design of
future symptom monitoring studies. This also may argue for simple, straightforward,
targeted interventions augmented with practice-changing recommendations (37, 38, 90, 91).
For weekly symptom data collection, we used telephone-based technology because of
widespread accessibility (92). An auditory-based assessment also offers advantages for those
with limited reading skills. Nevertheless, measurement error could have been introduced
through patients’ mishearing or misremembering response choices or misentering responses.
It also is possible that some patients were not comfortable communicating about their
symptoms using technology, as opposed to a live conversation.
The review of interim analyses suggested no harm to study participants, but we cannot
exclude this possibility, given that the MA group reported more favorable treatment
satisfaction. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons, so there is no way to know if these
results are artifacts of multiple comparisons or real differences, and they should be
interpreted cautiously until replicated in other studies.
Whereas a strength of this study was randomization to intervention groups, a limitation was
the lack of a placebo control group, which has been criticized as a shortcoming of most
studies in HRQL/symptom management (89). This trial was originally designed to allow us
to test whether using technology to initiate and accelerate the reporting of problematic
symptoms could reduce symptom burden. Unfortunately, we were not able to capture data
on the time of first report by MA participants of any clinically significant symptom to the
team. Our experience from a previous RCT of mixed cancer patients (including lung),
demonstrated that assessment alone had no impact on HRQL or treatment satisfaction (91).
Other similar findings (37, 38) have suggested that information obtained by assessment
without direct, immediate feedback to clinicians may not be acted upon by patients or
utilized by the medical team, although some studies of computer-based monitoring in
oncology have demonstrated symptom benefit in the absence of providing feedback to
providers (38, 84, 93, 94). In the current study, even though we augmented passive
monitoring with more active feedback to clinicians, one strong possibility is that the MA
group experienced an enhancement of symptom awareness that may have increased the
likelihood they would report those symptoms to the clinical team, thereby reducing the
magnitude of a detectable benefit associated with using the full SyMon-L intervention. Our
findings suggest that further research is required to determine if an even more active version
of the intervention is required to effect changes in clinical endpoints, such as symptom
management guidelines for providers and/or patients, as others have suggested is important
for effective use of PRO data (37, 38, 90, 91).

In addition to the limitations discussed above, we randomized at the patient level, rather than
physician or site, because of the scope and logistical constraints, including the small number
of physician participants. We recognize that exposure to the intervention may have affected
physicians’ discussion/management with patients in the MA group, although they did not
have access to the symptom reports or study data and previous research has documented the
difficulty in changing physician behavior (7, 95–97). A cross-over design was not deemed
practical because, with advanced disease, it seemed likely that outcomes in the first period
would differentially affect outcomes in the second period.
Especially as cancer treatments are increasingly delivered in outpatient and primary care
settings, it is important to continue to develop and evaluate efficient and acceptable ways of
monitoring patients’ symptoms and well-being while they are away from the clinic. Some
have suggested that standard clinical cancer care should now include electronic patient
interfaces that allow symptom reporting (98). Our data and experience support the
conclusion that a technology-based symptom monitoring and reporting system can be easy
to use and well-received by patients. However, this field is profoundly in need of research
focused on identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from such a system, and the
other patient, provider and health system contextual factors that are likely to contribute to
successful adoption, use and improvements in clinical care (98).
