Abstract
Background: Previous trials of telemonitoring for heart failure management have reported inconsistent results, largely due to
diverse intervention and study designs. Mobile phones are becoming ubiquitous and economical, but the feasibility and efficacy
of a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system have not been determined.
Objective: The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system on heart
failure management and outcomes.
Methods: One hundred patients were recruited from a heart function clinic and randomized into telemonitoring and control
groups. The telemonitoring group (N = 50) took daily weight and blood pressure readings and weekly single-lead ECGs, and
answered daily symptom questions on a mobile phone over 6 months. Readings were automatically transmitted wirelessly to the
mobile phone and then to data servers. Instructions were sent to the patients’ mobile phones and alerts to a cardiologist’s mobile
phone as required.
Results: Baseline questionnaires were completed and returned by 94 patients, and 84 patients returned post-study questionnaires.
About 70% of telemonitoring patients completed at least 80% of their possible daily readings. The change in quality of life from
baseline to post-study, as measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, was significantly greater for
the telemonitoring group compared to the control group (P = .05). A between-group analysis also found greater post-study self-care
maintenance (measured with the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index) for the telemonitoring group (P = .03). Brain natriuretic peptide
(BNP) levels, self-care management, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved significantly for both groups from
baseline to post-study, but did not show a between-group difference. However, a subgroup within-group analysis using the data
from the 63 patients who had attended the heart function clinic for more than 6 months revealed the telemonitoring group had
significant improvements from baseline to post-study in BNP (decreased by 150 pg/mL, P = .02), LVEF (increased by 7.4%, P
= .005) and self-care maintenance (increased by 7 points, P = .05) and management (increased by 14 points, P = .03), while the
control group did not. No differences were found between the telemonitoring and control groups in terms of hospitalization,
mortality, or emergency department visits, but the trial was underpowered to detect differences in these metrics.
Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of improved quality of life through improved self-care and clinical management
from a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system. The use of the mobile phone-based system had high adherence and was feasible
for patients, including the elderly and those with no experience with mobile phones.

Introduction
The demand for health care resources to manage heart failure
is increasing with the aging population. Innovative methods to
help alleviate this burden and to improve the poor outcomes
from heart failure are required. Previous studies on traditional
telemonitoring of heart failure patients (ie, using dedicated
hardware as an information and transmission hub) have
determined telemonitoring has the potential to reduce mortality,
hospitalizations, and costs as well as improve quality of life,
self-care, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class [1-4].
However, the results of telemonitoring trials have been
inconsistent largely due to diverse study interventions and
variations in study design.
Little is known about the feasibility and effects of mobile
phone-based telemonitoring systems. Investigating mobile
systems is a logical next step because they enable greater
scalability of telemonitoring due to their relatively low cost
compared to traditional systems, and because they provide more
freedom for the patient due to their portability. Two recent
randomized 
controlled 
trials 
of 
mobile 
phone-based
telemonitoring for heart failure management have been reported
in literature [5,6]. The Telemedical Interventional Monitoring
in Heart Failure (TIM-HF) trial by Koehler et al (2011) found
no reductions in hospitalizations or mortality [5]. The authors
concluded their study does not rule out the potential benefits of
telemonitoring, but instead that there is a need to identify the
heart failure population that could benefit from telemonitoring
[5]. The trial by Scherr et al (2009), which required patients to
enter readings using a mobile phone’s Internet browser,
highlighted the importance of system design on the success of
the telemonitoring system [6]. Many patients found using the
Internet browser to be too difficult, resulting in 12 out of the
54 patients in the intervention group being “never beginners.”
The objective of our randomized controlled trial was to perform
an in-depth investigation of the effects of a highly automated
and user-centered mobile phone-based telemonitoring system
on self-care and clinical management, with the aim of improving
heart failure outcomes (Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT00778986). We used an extensive user-centered design
process to develop the telemonitoring system in order to ensure
it was as easy to use as possible and to meet the needs of the
clinicians and patients. User-centered design refers to a
philosophy that bases the design on information about and input
from the people who will be using the product. The
user-centered design process will be discussed in a separate
publication.
Methods
Study Participants
One hundred participants were recruited from the University
Health Network (UHN) Heart Function Clinic in Toronto,
Ontario, between September 2009 and February 2010 (Figure
1). The UHN Research Ethics Board approved the trial prior to
commencement. The primary intent of the trial was to pilot the
telemonitoring system in order to determine the impact of the
system on self-care and clinical management. A sample size
calculation was based on the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index
(SCHFI), using a population standard deviation of 20 and an
effect size of 10 (effect size represents a clinically significant
change of more than half a standard deviation) as determined
in previous studies (alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8) [7,8]. We
calculated the required sample size per group to be 34, and
recruited 50 participants for the intervention group and 50 for
the control group to compensate for the patients estimated as
lost to follow-up, including due to mortality, over the six-month
trial.
Eligible participants were ambulatory patients diagnosed with
heart failure. Other eligibility criteria included 18 years of age
or older, ability to speak and read in English, not on the heart
transplantation list, an expected survival of greater than one
year, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than
40%. During their Heart Function Clinic visit, patients who met
the inclusion criteria (as deemed by their cardiologist), were
invited to speak to the study coordinator (ES) regarding
participation in the study. Each participant provided informed
consent and received Can $24 as reimbursement for travel and
parking expenses.

Study Protocol
The 100 participants were randomized into the telemonitoring
(TM) group and standard care (SC) group using stratified
four-block randomization. Stratification was based on NYHA
classification (NYHA class II-III and NYHA class IV). There
were no participants in NYHA class I. An online
computer-generated randomization tool, Research Randomizer
[9], was used to determine the order of participants in the
telemonitoring and standard care groups. The study coordinator
was blinded to which group the patient would be assigned until
each patient consented to participate in the trial.
Each patient received a questionnaire to complete at home. The
questionnaire included demographic and clinical characteristic
questions, and the SCHFI and the Minnesota Living with Heart
Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), which are validated tools for
measuring self-care and quality of life, respectively [10-12].
The SCHFI is made up of three subscales: self-care maintenance
(choice of behaviors used to maintain physiological stability),
self-care management (response to symptoms when they occur),
and self-care confidence. The maintenance, management, and
confidence subscales consist of 5, 6, and 4 Likert questions,
respectively. A higher score on the SCHFI indicates improved
self-care. The MLHFQ consists of 21 questions that use a
6-point Likert scale. The physical dimension score for the
MLHFQ is the summation of 8 questions (eg, Did your heart
failure make you sit or lie down to rest during the day?), while
the emotional dimension score is the summation of 5 other

questions (eg, Did your heart failure make you worry?). A lower
score on the MLHFQ indicates higher quality of life.
The standard care group received standard care at the UHN
Heart Function Clinic, which includes visiting the clinic between
once every 2 weeks to once every 3 to 6 months, depending on
the severity of the patient’s heart failure condition and the need
for optimizing their medication. Standard care also includes
heart failure education during preliminary visits at the Heart
Function Clinic and the ability to telephone the clinic as
necessary. Participants in the standard care group were not
contacted again regarding the study until the end of the trial.
The participants in the telemonitoring group received the
telemonitoring system in addition to standard care. They were
asked to use the telemonitoring system for 6 months to take
daily morning weight and blood pressure readings as well as
weekly single-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) if provided with
an ECG recorder. They were also asked to answer daily morning
symptom questions on a mobile phone. Only the 17 patients
who did not have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
were provided with an ECG recorder because the recorder was
not certified for use with ICDs. Patients were also told to report
their symptoms through the mobile phone if they did not feel
well during the day. The patients in the telemonitoring group
were given an individual training session on how to use the
system during the recruitment session, and were provided with
technical support by telephone throughout the study. The daily
measurements took about 5 minutes each morning.
Six months after recruitment, all participants were mailed a
post-study questionnaire. Semi-structured interviews were
conducted with participants in the telemonitoring group to
determine their experiences with the system. Twenty-two
patients were interviewed, at which point saturation was
achieved (ie, no new themes were identified). The individual
interviews lasted between 15 and 60 minutes and took place in
a private consultation room at the Heart Function Clinic.
The five clinicians (three cardiologists and two nurse
practitioners) from the Heart Function Clinic who managed the
alerts and/or used the data from the telemonitoring system during
the trial were also interviewed post-study. Each semi-structured
interview lasted between 15 and 45 minutes. All patient and
clinician interviews were audio-recorded and later transcribed.
Telemonitoring System Overview
The weight and blood pressure readings (UA UC-321PBT
weight scale and UA-767PBT blood pressure monitor, A&D
Medical, USA) and ECG recordings (SelfCheck ECG PMP4,
CardGuard, Israel) were automatically sent wirelessly via
Bluetooth to a mobile phone (BlackBerry Pearl 8130, Research
in Motion, Canada) and then to the data repository at the
hospital. Patients also answered symptom questions (mainly
yes/no) through the mobile phones. The measurements sent to
the data repository included a study identifier. No patient names
were transmitted and no identifying information was stored on
the mobile phone. The mobile phone displayed an instruction
on what to do after taking each measurement. A final message
or alert based on the physiological and symptom information
was sent to the mobile phone (Figure 2). Clinicians were able
to modify any necessary physiological target ranges per patient
through a secure website. The alerts ranged from low priority
ones (eg, to retake the measurements if the patient feels worse)
to high priority alerts (eg, to go to the local emergency
department or call 911). The patients and the clinicians were
able to view the physiological data on a secure website in tabular
and graphic formats. All the data were also stored and accessible
on the mobile phone. If a patient did not take all the required
measurements by 10 am each morning, an automated adherence
reminder phone call was sent to their home telephone.
If measurements were outside of the target range or if the patient
reported symptoms, alerts were emailed to the cardiologist’s
mobile phone. The email alerts included the patient’s contact
information, medication list, symptom and physiological
information (including the ECG recording as an attachment, if
available), latest serum creatinine and potassium, and the alert
message sent to the patient. If the cardiologist determined
contacting the patient was warranted, they were able to call the
patient by selecting their phone number in the email. The patient
alert message also instructed them to contact the Heart Function
Clinic if they felt they should. During the trial, the cardiologist
usually called the patient within a few minutes of receiving the
alert. The cardiologist emailed the study coordinator specifying
the action resulting from each alert (eg, calling the patient,
modificaton of medications, etc) by replying to the original
email alert.

Outcome Measures
The primary outcomes of this study included a surrogate for
heart failure prognosis, specifically brain natriuretic peptide
(BNP), self-care as measured by the SCHFI, and quality of life
as measured by the MLHFQ. Hospital readmissions, number
of nights in hospital, and mortality were secondary outcome
measures because the study was underpowered to detect
differences between groups for these metrics. Other secondary
outcome measures included number of emergency department
visits and number of Heart Function Clinic visits. In addition,
LVEF, NYHA class, medication prescriptions, and blood test
results (specifically creatinine, sodium, potassium, hemoglobin,
and urate values) were also subsequently analyzed.
Data Analysis
The normality of the data for each outcome measure was
determined through Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk
tests of normality. Data that were normally distributed were
MLHFQ, SCHFI maintenance, SCHFI management, sodium,
potassium, hemoglobin, urate, and LVEF values. All other
parameters were analyzed with non-parametric tests.
Between-group analyses using independent Student t tests and
Mann–Whitney tests (for normally and not normally distributed
data, respectively) were first performed to compare the
telemonitoring group and standard care group post-study data.
Between-group analyses were also performed to compare the
change scores. Paired Student t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank
tests were then performed to compare baseline and post-study

data within the telemonitoring and standard care groups. The
statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software
application SPSS 17.0 (IBM Corporation, USA). Statistical
significance was considered at P < .05 unless otherwise
specified. All test results reported are 2-tailed.
Interview data were analyzed using a conventional content
analysis approach [13]. Two researchers (ES and CM) analyzed
the transcripts independently and coded the transcripts with the
software program NVivo version 7 (QSR International,
Doncaster, Victoria, Australia). The researchers then discussed
the themes and issues that emerged until a consensus was
reached. The qualitative results are presented in detail in an
accompanying paper [14].
Results
Twelve out of 112 patients approached to participate in this
study declined. One patient felt overwhelmed by the idea of
participating in the trial, two did not want to take measurements
every day, one said he did not have the time, and one thought
as a result of a stroke he would not be able to understand how
to perform the monitoring. The remainder did not provide
specific reasons for declining. The three patients from the
telemonitoring group who withdrew from the study included a
patient who became incapacitated during the trial due to a fall,
and two participants who decided to withdraw from the study
when they had technical difficulties with the telemonitoring
equipment. No patients in the standard care group officially
withdrew from the study (Figure 1).
Baseline Patient Data
Table 1
shows the baseline demographic and clinical
characteristics of the 100 patients who participated in the trial.
The profiles of the telemonitoring and standard care groups
were similar and representative of the patient population
attending the UHN Heart Function Clinic. A comparison of
baseline study parameters showed no statistical differences
between telemonitoring and standard care groups for any
outcome measures. Baseline questionnaires were completed
and returned by 94 patients (46 from the telemonitoring group
and 48 from the standard care group) and 84 patients returned
post-study questionnaires (39 from the telemonitoring group
and 45 from the standard care group), while 82 patients returned
both baseline and post-study questionnaires.
Telemonitoring System Utilization
Patient Adherence
Patients completed their required measurements on average
between 5 to 6 days per week throughout the six-month trial
(Figure 3). Adherence decreased only slightly from the
beginning of the trial to the end. Adherence during the first
week was relatively low because some patients had to travel for
a number of days to get home before using the system, and some
patients required technical telephone support before properly
using the system. About 42, 33, and 16 out of the 50
telemonitoring group patients (84%, 66%, and 32%) completed
at least 91 (50%), 146 (80%), and 173 (95%) of possible daily
readings 
over 
the 
six 
months, 
respectively. 
Missed
measurements were sometimes due to technical issues with the
telemonitoring system or else because of patients going on
vacation without bringing the monitoring equipment with them.
The adherence data presented are an underestimate of the true
adherence because they are based on the adherence phone calls
sent at 10 am if patients had not yet completed their daily
measurements. Occasionally, patients would take their
measurements after 10 am when the adherence reminder was
already sent because they had woken after 10 am.
Clinical Utilization of the System
Table 2 summarizes the clinical utilization of the system and
the actions the clinicians performed based on the alerts. One
cardiologist received the majority (1367) of the email alerts.
Another cardiologist received alerts (311 alerts) when covering
for the primary cardiologist for a three-week period. Low
priority alerts were more frequently generated than the more
urgent alerts. The cardiologists (and occasionally a nurse
practitioner) called patients 480 times over the 6 months, often
to provide instructions or to educate. The most common clinical
action was an instruction or change in medication (105 times).
Other actions included ordering additional blood work, moving
the patient’s clinic visit forward, or instructing the patient to
see their family physician or to go to the emergency department.

Results
Table 3 shows the results from the statistical analysis. BNP
values for both the telemonitoring and standard care groups
decreased post-study (P = .001, P = .002, respectively).
Similarly, NYHA class, LVEF, self-care maintenance, and
self-care management improved for both groups. However,
quality of life as measured with the MLHFQ significantly
improved only for the telemonitoring group (P = .02), including
the physical (P = .02) and emotional dimensions (P = .03).

A comparison of the post-study data between groups found only
a statistically significant difference in SCHFI maintenance
scores, indicating the telemonitoring group had greater self-care
maintenance (ie, a higher SCHFI maintenance score) (P = .03).
A comparison of the change scores between groups found only
a statistically significant difference in the overall MLHFQ
scores, indicating that the telemonitoring group had greater
improvement in quality of life (ie, a larger difference from
baseline to post-study MLHFQ scores) (P = .05).

Clinic would improve outcomes particularly for those patients
new to the clinic. To test if there was a clinic effect on the
outcome measures showing improvements in both groups, the
changes in outcome measures were compared for patients who
were new to the clinic (< 6 months, N = 37) versus those who
were long-term patients (> 6 months, N = 63). We chose six
months as the cut-off point because patients newly referred to
the clinic usually require three months to up-titrate medication
and a further three months to reach clinical stability. In the
telemonitoring group, 18 patients were new to the clinic versus
19 in the standard care group. Patients who were new to the
clinic improved more than those who were long-term with
respect to BNP and LVEF (Table 4). Self-care maintenance of
the new patients also improved more, but the difference was
not statistically significant.

To minimize the clinic effect, the statistical analysis was
repeated post-hoc removing the data from the 37 patients new
to clinic. Table 5 shows the subgroup statistical results for the
parameters that improved for both groups. For long-term
patients, the BNP (P = .02), LVEF (P = .005), self-care
maintenance (P = .05), and self-care management (P = .03)
significantly improved only for the telemonitoring group. A
comparison of the post-study data and change scores between
groups found only a statistically significant difference in
post-study MLHFQ emotional dimension scores, indicating the
telemonitoring group had better post-study quality of life
(emotional dimension) compared to the standard care group (P
= .05).

Mortality Results
During the trial, three patients from the telemonitoring group
died and none died from the standard care group. One patient
died from newly diagnosed cancer, the second was suspected
to have died from sepsis due to a leg ulcer, and the third died
from post-heart transplantation complications (transplant
performed prior to study enrollment).
Health Care Resource Utilization Results
Table 6 shows the results from the Mann–Whitney tests
comparing the health care resource utilization by the
telemonitoring and standard care groups during the trial. No
differences were found between the groups for number of
hospitalizations (P = .1), number of nights in hospital (P = .2),
or number of visits to the emergency room (P = .6). However,
the telemonitoring group visited the Heart Function Clinic
during the six months more often than the standard care group
(P = .04) because the cardiologist managing the alerts asked
several patients to come into clinic when their health appeared
to be deteriorating, as alerted by the telemonitoring system.

Discussion
A randomized controlled trial was performed to evaluate a
user-centered, mobile phone-based telemonitoring system.
Although the trial was underpowered to detect its impact on
hospitalization and mortality, the results suggest quality of life
improved with the use of the system through increased self-care
and improved clinical management. BNP, LVEF, and NYHA
class all improved over the course of the trial for both the
telemonitoring and standard care groups. A subgroup analysis
using only the participants who had attended the clinic for more
than 6 months showed only the telemonitoring group had
significant improvements in BNP and LVEF from baseline to
post-study. It is possible a trial with a larger sample size would
find a reduction in hospitalization and mortality in the
telemonitoring group.
One of the most significant changes in clinical management
with the telemonitoring system was the ability to optimize a
patient’s medication regimen. For example, there was a
statistically significant increase in the number of patients in the
telemonitoring group who were prescribed aldosterone
antagonist compared to the standard care group. Previous studies
have found less than a third of eligible patients receive heart
failure guideline-recommended aldosterone antagonist therapy
[15]. The benefits of aldosterone antagonist, in terms of
reductions in mortality and hospitalizations, have been well
documented. However, patients are often not prescribed this
therapy partially because of the need to closely monitor serum
potassium levels due to the risk of hyperkalemia [16]. It is
possible the increase in use of aldosterone antagonist in the
telemonitoring group can be attributed to the close monitoring
of the patients enabled by the telemonitoring system.
In terms of self-care, the telemonitoring system provided
immediate automated instructions and enabled clinical
intervention at the most appropriate time (“teachable moments”)
to help patients modify their lifestyle behaviors. For example,
many patients found their weight and blood pressure increased
after a high sodium meal. By reducing their salt intake for the
next few meals, their weight and blood pressure would return
to within their normal range. Some patients also received
automated reminders to take extra diuretic medication after a
weight gain, which confirmed taking the extra medication was
the correct course of action. Even though this group of patients
received prior instruction from their cardiologist to take extra
diuretic medication in this situation, they were still often hesitant
to take the extra medication without prior confirmation.
A 
large-scale 
(N=1653) 
randomized 
controlled 
trial,
Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes (Tele-HF),
was conducted using as a primary outcome measure a composite
of readmission for any reason or death from any cause within
180 days of enrollment [17]. That trial found no reduction in
mortality or hospital admissions from the use of a
telephone-based interactive voice-response system to record
heart failure symptoms and weight data. One of the possible
reasons no differences were found between groups is the
Tele-HF trial attempted to engage patients in self-care only in
terms of performing the daily reporting of symptoms and weight.
Real-time automated self-care advice and instructions (taking
extra diuretic medication, following salt and fluid restrictions,
etc) based on the reported symptoms and weight—as
implemented in our study—might have had a significant positive
impact. In addition, site coordinators reviewed the patient
information daily on weekdays for the Tele-HF trial and should
have contacted the patient as required. It is possible the
necessary real-time response by clinicians was not provided.
Finally, 14% of the Tele-HF patients randomized into the
intervention group never used the system, and only 55% of the
patients were using the system at least 3 times per week by the
final week. The Tele-HF trial lasted 180 days, which was similar
to our trial. However, by the final week of our trial, 89% of our
patients were taking their measurements at least 3 times per
week (excluding the 3 patients who had died). Our high rate of
adherence may be due to the perceived benefit, ongoing positive
reinforcement, and ease of use of our system even among the
very elderly (the oldest patient in the telemonitoring group was
aged 88 years). The trial by Scherr et al (2009) also found low
adherence rates due to patients having difficulty in manually
entering and sending their daily blood pressure, heart rate, body
weight, and dosage of heart failure medication through a mobile
phone’s Internet browser [6]. The differences in adherence rates

between these trials underscore the importance of system design
on the successful implementation of telemonitoring systems.
The TIM-HF trial investigated the effects of wireless medical
devices with a personal digital assistant (PDA) on health
outcomes of 710 heart failure patients randomized into
intervention and control groups. Similar to the Tele-HF trial,
this trial found no statistically significant differences between
the groups with respect to mortality, number of hospitalizations,
or days in hospital [5]. However, an exploratory subgroup
analysis suggested the efficacy of telemonitoring to improve
heart failure outcomes could be dependent on the characteristics
of the patient population. The investigators concluded further
trials were required to explore the effects of telemonitoring in
defined patient subgroups.
In our study, being newly enrolled into the Heart Function Clinic
overshadowed improvements from the telemonitoring system
in terms of the within-group analysis. In addition, many of our
participants had stable heart failure, and had not been admitted
to hospital for many years. Bowles et al (2009) also suggested
targeting higher risk patients with greater probability of being
rehospitalized in order to demonstrate the most effective
outcomes from telemonitoring [18]. Eligibility criteria for study
participation that included admission to hospital within the
previous year and being part of the Heart Function Clinic for
at least 6 months may have resulted in more significant
improvements in health outcomes.
Although the clinicians viewed the ECG recordings that were
available, the benefits of the ECG recordings compared to the
costs of the devices were not conclusive. Feedback from the
clinicians indicated they thought the ECG recordings were of
some use, but the inability to provide the devices to participants
with ICDs was a significant drawback.
Limitations
A confounder to our study was the clinic effect that caused
improvements in outcomes in both the telemonitoring and
standard care groups, as described above. Future studies should
consider recruitment of stable clinic patients. Secondly, patients
were enrolled in the winter and completed the trial in the
summer when heart failure patients are often healthier due to
reductions in respiratory illnesses. This seasonal effect may
have also contributed to the observed improvements in both the
telemonitoring and standard care groups. A third limitation was
the small sample size that did not provide adequate power to
detect the effects of the telemonitoring on mortality and
hospitalization outcomes. A future trial with a larger sample
size would help further determine the effects of the
telemonitoring system on health service utilization and its health
economic impact. In addition, the proportionate benefit of
self-care versus clinical management changes on health
outcomes could not be definitively determined. For example,
the improvements observed in the telemonitoring group may
be largely attributed to the increased prescription of aldosterone
antagonist. Furthermore, about a third of the patients in the
telemonitoring group used the telemonitoring system for a
number of weeks prior to completing the baseline questionnaire.
Although the patients were instructed to answer the
questionnaire based on information before they used the
telemonitoring system, it was clear many patients were basing
their answers on information associated with system use because
their questionnaire responses sometimes did not match the
information provided during their recruitment interviews. This
minimized the measured impact of the telemonitoring system.
Limitations to the questionnaire data also include potential recall
bias and self-reporting. Finally, the telemonitoring system was
only available in English, which limited the participant
population to patients who were able to read rudimentary
English.
Conclusions
The results from our trial suggest mobile phone-based
telemonitoring improves quality of life through improved
self-care and clinical management. A subgroup analysis using
only the participants who had attended clinic for more than 6
months showed only the telemonitoring group had significant
improvements in BNP and LVEF from baseline to post-study.
An important component to successful telemonitoring for heart
failure appears to be immediate feedback to the patients to
address any potential decompensation either through automated
messages and/or advice from a clinician who is familiar with
patients’histories. In addition, in order for patients to be willing
to integrate telemonitoring into their daily lives, the system
must be easy and quick to use. Further research with an
appropriate heart failure patient population and larger sample
size is required to determine the extent of the benefits of such
a telemonitoring system on heart failure outcomes.
