Background: Unintended rehospitalizations after surgical procedures represent a large
percentage of readmissions and have been associated with increased morbidity and cost of
care. Beginning in 2017, Medicare will expand diagnostic categories subject to ﬁnancial
penalties for excess postoperative readmissions to include coronary revascularization
procedures. Arrhythmias and pulmonary complications comprise the largest categories for
readmission after cardiac surgery. Technologic advances in remote monitoring have led to
the use of web-based digital health kits (DHK) aimed at reducing readmissions and
improving postoperative outcomes. The present study was performed to determine the
added beneﬁt of incorporating DHK’s into a formal readmissions reduction program (RRP)
in preventing 30-d readmissions and to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the
use of these devices.
Materials and methods: This was a prospective study of all adult patients who underwent
cardiac surgery at our institution from March 2014 to June 2015. During the study period,
443 adult patients (mean age, 65  14, 33% female) were identiﬁed and participated in the
formal RRP, 27 of whom also received a DHK after discharge (416 control group). In addition
to providing a live video link to a provider specializing in cardiac surgery, the DHK also
allowed for automatic daily transmission of weight, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and
blood pressure. Patients also completed a daily health survey targeting symptoms con-
cerning for heart failure, poor wound healing, poor ambulation, and nonadherence to
medications. Abnormal vitals or survey responses triggered automatic notiﬁcations to the
healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of
the healthcare team. Pearson c2 test and the Welch’s t-test were used to assess statistical
differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables.
Results: During the study period, the readmission rate for the DHK and control groups were
similar (7.4% versus 9.9%, P ¼ 0.65). The use of DHKs led to 1649 alerts and 144 interventions,
with the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9. The majority of alerts (64%) were
prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, and a signiﬁcant correlation was noted
between abnormal biometrics and required intervention (r ¼ 0.62, P < 0.001). No correlation
was seen between alerts because of health survey responses (r ¼ 0.07, P ¼ 0.71) or missed
check-ins (r ¼ 0.06, P ¼ 0.76) and required interventions. Poststudy satisfaction surveys

showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9  0.5 for DHK patients and 4.9  0.2 for
members of the care team (scale 1-5, 5 ¼ agree).
Conclusions: In our study, adding DHKs to a formal RRP was not associated with a signiﬁcant
decrease in 30-d readmission rates. We also found that notiﬁcations because of abnormal
biometric measures were signiﬁcantly correlated with required interventions. In contrast,
notiﬁcations due to abnormal health survey responses were not associated with increased
interventions. Both patients and members of the healthcare team were highly satisﬁed
with this technology. DHKs appear to extend care beyond the inpatient period and provide
a portal for telemonitoring of surgical patients. However, this modality is highly resource
intensive and may not signiﬁcantly reduce readmissions. Further studies are warranted to
evaluate the efﬁcacy of such kits in reducing readmissions and costs of care.

Introduction
Postoperative readmission reported to occur in 17.4% of cor-
onary revascularization patients1 is associated with increased
mortality, reduced patient satisfaction,2 and signiﬁcant in-
creases in healthcare costs.3 With recent evidence suggesting
that readmission rates may be correlated with quality of
care,4,5 a Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program was
implemented under the Affordable Care Act requiring the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services to reduce pay-
ments to institutions with “excess readmissions.” These
ﬁnancial penalties, which may be as high as 3% of the total
institutional Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services
payment, are currently applicable to the following diagnoses:
acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbations, pneumonia, and joint
replacements. With imminent plans to expand the list to
include coronary artery bypass grafting in 2017, some state
organizations such as the California Coronary Artery Bypass
Grafting Outcomes Reporting Program have already mandated
public reporting of readmission rates.6,7
Innovative strategies aimed at reducing readmission rates
have been used in the postdischarge management of patients.
A number of studies have demonstrated the variable success
of these programs, which have focused primarily on patient
education, assisted medication administration, and organized
coordination of care after discharge.8,9 Paradoxically, Kwok
et al.10 noted higher readmission rates after implementation of
home visits by nurses. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted
that fragmentation of care after discharge plays a vital role in
unplanned rehospitalizations.11,12 Wireless health technolo-
gies including video and telemonitoring of vital signs have
recently been used to improve continuity of care. Despite
success in nonsurgical patients, the impact of telemonitoring
in reducing readmissions has not been previously evaluated in
those undergoing cardiac surgery.
Historically, the rate of readmission after cardiac surgery
has varied between 16% and 22%. With an initial focus
on identifying factors contributing to readmissions,13 we
have developed targeted interventions to reduce unplanned
rehospitalizations
at
our
institution.
Our
Readmissions
Reduction Program (RRP) was developed with the purpose of
improving patient education and the coordination of post-
discharge care. The purpose of the present study was to
evaluate the added beneﬁt of incorporating a telehealth-
based component to the RRP in reducing readmissions after
cardiac surgery.
Materials and methods
Patients undergoing cardiac surgery at our institution bet-
ween March 2014 and June 2015 were eligible for inclusion in
this
study.
Transplantation,
extracorporeal
membrane
oxygenation, and ventricular assist device insertion were in-
dications for exclusion from analysis. All patients participated
in the RRP, which was developed by a multidisciplinary
committee
consisting
of
physicians,
nurses,
and
case
coordinators. Figure 1 provides a detailed description of the
components included in the RRP. As part of the protocol, pa-
tients participated in a formal preoperative education pro-
gram consisting of face-to-face sessions with the health team.
Topics such as preoperative preparation, expected hospital
course, proper medication administration, and potential
postoperative complications were discussed at these sessions,
with educational material provided for patients and their
caregivers. Postoperatively, patients received daily education
and reinforcement on topics pertaining to at-home care. The
second focus of the RRP was to improve postdischarge care. A
plan was developed to ensure all necessary home medications
were
dispensed,
and
all
follow-up
appointments
were
scheduled before discharge. At last, patients were required to
identify trusted individuals who would serve as a primary
caregiver at home.
In addition to the formal RRP, patients enrolled in a tele-
health pilot study also received a digital health kits (DHK)
consisting of a tablet linked to a Bluetooth-enabled pulse
oximeter, heart rate monitor, blood pressure cuff, and weight
scale. Tablets were equipped with software that provided
patients with simple illustrated instructions on how to obtain
real-time data of vitals including oxygen saturation, heart
rate, blood pressure, and weight (Fig. 2). Patients also
completed daily digital questionnaires aimed at identifying
symptoms consistent with heart failure, poor wound healing,
as well as data on ambulation and adherence to medications
(Fig. 3). Abnormal biometrics (O2 saturation<92%, heart rate
>95 or <60 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure >150 mm
Hg or <90 mm Hg, or weight change greater than two pounds),
concerning survey responses, and a missed digital check-in,
triggered an automated notiﬁcation to the healthcare team.

Patients were subsequently contacted by a healthcare pro-
vider via video conference or telephone prompting a potential
intervention such as medication dosage adjustment, further
patient education, or triaging as necessary.
Patients who were enrolled in the telehealth program
comprised the intervention group (DHK), whereas patients in
the formal RRP served as a control. The primary outcome of
this study was postoperative readmission within 30 d of sur-
gery. In addition, surveys were administered to participants
and members of the healthcare team to assess their satis-
faction with the telehealth component of the program.
For analysis, the Pearson c2 test and the Welch’s t-test were
used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteris-
tics and outcome variables. Correlational analyses were

completed using Pearson’s (r) coefﬁcient to assess the rela-
tionship between alert notiﬁcations and required inter-
ventions. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA
12 (StataCorp LP), and results with a P value  0.05 were
deemed statistically signiﬁcant. The study protocol was
approved by the institutional review board at the University of
California, LA.
Results
Of the 443 patients (mean age: 65  14, 33% female) who
underwent cardiac surgery during the study period, 27 (6.1%)
were enrolled in the telehealth pilot study. Patient charac-
teristics were relatively similar for the two groups, with sig-
niﬁcant differences noted in gender and incidence of dialysis
(Table 1). Postoperatively, patients in the RRP had signiﬁcantly
higher rates of pneumonia and sepsis (Table 2). However, total
length of stay was relatively similar between the two groups.
Overall, 9.7% of patients (n ¼ 41) were readmitted within 30 d
of surgery. No signiﬁcant difference was found in the rate of
readmission between the RRP group and the DHK group (9.9%
versus 7.4%, P ¼ 0.65). Reasons for readmission are noted in
Table 3. Although patients in the RRP group were readmitted
for a range of cardiovascular and respiratory complications
including arrhythmias, heart failure, and effusions, the only
two DHK readmissions were due amiodarone toxicity and for
a syncopal episode.
During
Q4
the 30-d study period, information gathered via the
DHKs led to 1649 alerts, with a median of 49 alerts per day (IQR
45-58) and the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9
(Fig. 3). Per patient, this amounts to a median of 54 alerts
during the study period (IQR 45-78). The majority of alerts
(64%) were prompted by abnormal biometric measurements,
whereas 25% were triggered by responses to daily survey
questions, 6% by patient requests for additional video chat
sessions, and 5% by notiﬁcations of patient noncompliance
with daily monitoring. Notiﬁcations led to 144 subsequent
interventions by the care team, amounting to an average of
13.5 alerts per intervention when analyzed at the patient level.
Medication adjustments were required in 14% of cases, a
referral to a nurse practitioner or physician was required in
10%, and additional patient education was required in 76% of
required interventions. On analysis, a signiﬁcant correlation
was noted between abnormal
biometrics
and requiring
intervention (r ¼ 0.62, P < 0.001) as displayed Figure 5. How-
ever, no correlation was seen between alerts due to survey
responses (r ¼ 0.07, P ¼ 0.71) or missed check-ins (r ¼ 0.06,
P ¼ 0.76) and requiring intervention.

To assess patient and provider satisfaction with the tele-
health component of the RRP, surveys were administered at
the conclusion of the study using a 5-point Likert scale
(1 ¼ disagree, 5 ¼ agree) with a 74% completion rate among
patients and 100% among providers. A summary of patient
and provider survey responses are displayed in Figure 6 and
Figure 7 respectively. Overall, patients and healthcare pro-
viders reported satisfaction scores of 4.9  0.5 and 4.9  0.2,
respectively. Patients also reported feeling more conﬁdent in
the quality of care they received during the recuperation
period.
Discussion
Although preliminary, the use of DHKs was not associated
with an incremental decrease in 30-d readmission rates when
added to a formal RRP. However, user satisfaction ratings were
high among both patients and healthcare providers partici-
pating in the telehealth program. With rapid expansion of
mobile platforms and anticipation of widespread use of
DHK’s, it is crucial to evaluate their incremental efﬁcacy at
reducing postoperative readmissions.
As the healthcare system in the United States moves
toward value-based purchasing and cost containment, a
number of policies including the Hospital RRP and Bundled
Payments for Care Improvement Initiative are being imple-
mented. All such initiatives aim at reducing the cost of care

while improving patient satisfaction and quality of care.
Unplanned readmission rate after index surgical hospitaliza-
tion is now considered a quality metric and used by Centers
for Medicare to levy penalties on hospitals with higher than
expected readmission rates. With a growing body of research
evaluating the reasons for readmission, it appears that care
fragmentation and complications not related to the original
procedure are major contributors to the problem of read-
missions.14 Therefore, extended monitoring of the patients’
cardiopulmonary and ﬂuid status appears to be logical ad-
juncts to programs aimed at care coordination and patient
education.
In
Q5
the present study, we used a commercially available,
HIPAA compliant, web-based mobile system that used a tablet
to interact with patients. In addition, parameters such as
heart rate, blood pressure, transcutaneous oxygen saturation,
and weights were automatically transmitted to the healthcare
providers. Since many of the readmissions after cardiac sur-
gery are related to mobility, surgical wounds, and the car-
diopulmonary condition of the patient, this particular DHK
was programmed to address these issues and generate alerts
for the healthcare team. In addition, we used providers that
were fully trained in the postoperative care of cardiac surgery
patients to optimize patient care. The DHK system provided
many alerts and led to 144 interventions in 27 patients.
However, these interventions did not translate into a signiﬁ-
cant reduction in readmission rates at our institution. This
ﬁnding may be explained by the fact that all patients partici-
pate in a RRP that has signiﬁcantly reduced our readmission
rates.
Satisfaction with the use of DHK’s was found to be high
among the patients and healthcare providers. This perhaps is
a relevant ﬁnding, as patient experience and satisfaction with
medical care may translate into improved long-term out-
comes and adherence.2,15 The ease of use given the tablet
platform and preconﬁgured connectivity may have enhanced
the user experience. Perhaps, a system that could deliver
personalized alert set points and questions would further
enhance satisfaction.
Our study has several limitations. Due to an initially
limited amount of DHK available, we were only able to
monitor ﬁve patients at once. Moreover, since all patients
participated in the RRP, we were not able to assess the inde-
pendent value of the DHKs alone. Nevertheless, we believe
our preliminary results provide basis for future large-scale

interventional studies to assess the beneﬁts of continued
outpatient follow-up via wireless health technology. Infor-
mation gathering was also disrupted when pieces of the DHK
would malfunction and had to be replaced during the 30-d
window.
In summary, DHK show potential in providing a reasonable
adjunct to postoperative care that would further improve the
readmissions reduction program implemented at our uni-
versity. Further adjustments to the monitoring capabilities
and increased personalization will likely not only improve
patient satisfaction and adherence but also quality of care.
