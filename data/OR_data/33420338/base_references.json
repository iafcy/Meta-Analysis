            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Digital technologies are increasingly directed at improved monitoring, management and treatment of mental health. However, their potential contribution to social networks and self-management support for people diagnosed with a serious mental illness has rarely been considered. This review and meta-synthesis aimed to examine the processes of engagement and perceived relevance and appropriateness of telehealth interventions for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The review addresses three key questions. How is the use of digital communications technologies framed in the professional psychiatric literature? How might the recognised benefits of telehealth translate to people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia? What is the user perspective concerning Internet information and communication technologies?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) of published findings from quantitative and qualitative studies of telehealth interventions for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Most studies were of an exploratory nature. The professional discourse about the use of different technologies was overlain by concerns with surveillance and control, focusing on the Internet as a potential site of risk and danger. The critical synthesis of findings showed that the key focus of the available studies was on the delivery of existing traditional approaches (e.g. improving medications adherence, provision of medical information about the condition, symptom monitoring and cognitive behavioural therapy). Even though it was clear that the Internet has considerable potential in terms of accessing and utilising lay support, the potential of communication technologies in mobilising of resources for personal self-management or peer support was a relatively absent or hidden a focus of the available studies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Based on an interpretive synthesis of available studies, people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis use the Internet primarily for the purposes of disclosure and information gathering. Empowerment, regulation and surveillance emerged as the key dimensions of engagement (or not) with telehealth interventions. The findings suggest that telehealth interventions are disproportionately used by particular patient groups (e.g.women, people who are employed). Further research needs to ascertain the mechanisms by which telehealth interventions may be potentially beneficial or harmful for engagement and management to people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia."

            "abstract": "Primary care is the foundation of effective and high-quality health care. The role of primary care clinicians has expanded to encompass coordination of care across multiple providers and management of more patients with complex conditions. Enabling technology has the potential to expand the capacity for primary care clinicians to provide integrated, accessible care that channels expertise to the patient and brings specialty consultations into the primary care clinic. Furthermore, technology offers opportunities to engage patients in advancing their health through improved communication and enhanced self-management of chronic conditions. This paper describes enabling technologies in four domains (the body, the home, the community, and the primary care clinic) that can support the critical role primary care clinicians play in the health care system.

            "abstract": "The effectiveness of e-health interventions varies greatly. Despite this, there has been relatively little formal consideration of how differences in the design of an intervention (i.e., how the content is delivered) may explain why some interventions are more effective than others. This review primarily examines the use of the Internet to provide educational and self-management interventions to promote health. The article develops hypotheses about how the design of these interventions may be associated with outcomes. In total, 52 published reports from both a diversity sample and a representative sample were reviewed using techniques from Critical Interpretive Synthesis. Four core interactive design features were identified that may mediate the effects of intervention design on outcomes: Social context and support, contacts with intervention, tailoring, and self-management. A conceptual framework to summarize the design of e-health interventions delivered using the Internet is proposed. The framework provides a guide for systematic research to identify the effects of specific design features on intervention outcomes and to identify the mechanisms underlying any effects. To optimize the design of e-health interventions more work is needed to understand how and why these design features may affect intervention outcomes and to investigate the optimal implementation and dosage of each design feature."

            "abstract": "Conventional outpatient services are unlikely to meet burgeoning demand for diabetes services given increasing prevalence of diabetes, and resultant impact on the healthcare workforce and healthcare costs. Disruptive technologies (such as smartphone and wireless sensors) create an opportunity to redesign outpatient services. In collaboration, the Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology at Brisbane Princess Alexandra Hospital, the University of Queensland Centre for Health Services Research and the Australian e-Health Research Centre developed a mobile diabetes management system (MDMS) to support the management of complex outpatient type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) adults. The system comprises of a mobile App, an automated text-messaging feedback and a clinician portal. Blood glucose levels (BGL) data are automatically transferred by Bluetooth-enabled glucose meter to the clinician portal via the mobile App. The primary aim of the study described here is to examine improvement in glycaemic control of a new model of care employing MDMS for patients with complex T2DM attending a tertiary level outpatient service. A two-group, 12-month, pilot pragmatic randomised control trial will recruit 44 T2DM patients. The control group will receive routine care. The intervention group will be supported by the MDMS enabling the participants to potentially better self-manage their diabetes, and the endocrinologists to remotely monitor BGL and to interact with patients through a variety of eHealth modalities. Intervention participants will be encouraged to complete relevant pathology tests, and report on current diabetes management through an online questionnaire. Using this information, the endocrinologist may choose to reschedule the appointment or substitute it with a telephone or video-consultation. This pilot study will guide the conduct of a large-scale study regarding the capacity for a new model of care. This model utilises multimodal eHealth strategies via the MDMS to primarily improve glycaemic control with secondary aims to improve patient experience, reduce reliance on physical clinics, and decrease service delivery cost."

This service requires not only biomedical digital assistant that can monitor continuously the patients' health condition regardless of time and place, but also wired and wireless communication devices and telemedicine servers that provide doctors with data on patients' present health condition. In order to implement a biomedical digital assistant that is portable and wearable to patients, the present study developed a device that minimizes size, weight and power consumption, measures ECG and PPG signals, and even monitors moving patients' state. The biomedical sensor with the function of wireless communication was designed to be highly portable and wearable, to be operable 24 hours with small-size batteries, and to monitor the subject's heart rate, step count and respiratory rate in his daily life. The biomedical signal receiving device was implemented in two forms, PDA and cellular phone. The movement monitoring device embedded in the battery pack of a cellular phone does not have any problem in operating 24 hours, but the real-time biomedical signal receiving device implemented with PDA operated up to 6 hours due to the limited battery capacity of PDA. This problem is expected to be solved by reducing wireless communication load through improving the processing and storage functions of the sensor. The developed device can transmit a message on the patient's emergency to the remote server through the cellular phone network, and is expected to play crucial roles in the health management of chronic-aged patients in their daily life."

This study describes the usability and evaluates the acceptance of the IM in the elderly, who use the smartphone for the first time. This study is a quasi-experimental design study. The study period started from October, 2012 to December, 2013. There were totally 41 elderly recruited in the study. All of them were the first time to use LINE app on the smartphones. The usability was evaluated by using the Technology Acceptance Model which consisted of four constructs: cognitive usability, cognitive ease of use, attitude and willingness to use. Overall, the elderly had the best \"attitude\" for LINE APP communication software, with the highest rating averaging 4.07 points on four constructs, followed by an average of 4 points on \"cognitive usefulness\". The socres of \"cognitive ease of use\" and \"willingness to use\" scores were equal which are an average score of 3.86. It can be interpreted that (1) the elders thought that the LINE APP as an excellent communication tool for them; (2) they found the software is useful (3) it was convenient for them to communicate. However, it was necessary to additionally assist and explain the certain functions such as the options. It would play a great role in the \"willingness to use\". The positive acceptance of LINE APP in elderly refer to the probable similar acceptance for them to use other communication software. Encouraging the willingness the elderly to explore more technology products and understanding their behavior will be the basic knowledge to develop further software."

We excluded people who had other significant lung disease, who were unable to provide informed consent or complete the study, or who had other significant social or clinical problems.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were recruited between 21 May 2009 and 28 March 2011, and centrally randomised to receive telemonitoring or conventional self monitoring. Using a touch screen, telemonitoring participants recorded a daily questionnaire about symptoms and treatment use, and monitored oxygen saturation using linked instruments. Algorithms, based on the symptom score, generated alerts if readings were omitted or breached thresholds. Both groups received similar care from existing clinical services.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was time to hospital admission due to COPD exacerbation up to one year after randomisation. Other outcomes included number and duration of admissions, and validated questionnaire assessments of health related quality of life (using St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ)), anxiety or depression (or both), self efficacy, knowledge, and adherence to treatment. Analysis was intention to treat.\n## RESULTS\nOf 256 patients completing the study, 128 patients were randomised to telemonitoring and 128 to usual care; baseline characteristics of each group were similar. The number of days to admission did not differ significantly between groups (adjusted hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.44). Over one year, the mean number of COPD admissions was similar in both groups (telemonitoring 1.2 admissions per person (standard deviation 1.9) v control 1.1 (1.6); P=0.59). Mean duration of COPD admissions over one year was also similar between groups (9.5 days per person (standard deviation 19.1) v 8.8 days (15.9); P=0.88). The intervention had no significant effect on SGRQ scores between groups (68.2 (standard deviation 16.3) v 67.3 (17.3); adjusted mean difference 1.39 (95% confidence interval -1.57 to 4.35)), or on other questionnaire outcomes. Conclusions In participants with a history of admission for exacerbations of COPD, telemonitoring was not effective in postponing admissions and did not improve quality of life. The positive effect of telemonitoring seen in previous trials could be due to enhancement of the underpinning clinical service rather than the telemonitoring communication.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nISRCTN96634935.\n## FUNDING\nThe trial was funded by an NHS applied research programme grant from the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish government (ARPG/07/03). The funder had no role in study design and the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data and the writing of the article and the decision to submit it for publication.

The system, which is attached to a shirt, consists of a piezoelectric sensor, a low-power 8-bit single chip microcontroller, EEPROM and a 2.4 GHz low-power transmitting mobile phone (PHS). The piezoelectric sensor, whose electrical polarization voltage is produced by body movements, is installed inside the shirt and closely contacts the patient's chest. The low frequency components of body movements recorded by the sensor are mainly generated by respiration. The microcontroller sequentially stores the movement signal to the EEPROM for 5 minutes and detects, by time-frequency analysis, whether the patient has breathed during that time. When the patient is apneic for 10 sseconds, the microcontroller sends the recorded respiration waveform during and one minute before and after the apnea directly to the hospital server computer via the mobile phone. The server computer then creates apnea \"filings\" automatically for every patient. The system can be used at home and be self-applied by patients. Moreover, the system does not require any extra equipment such as a personal computer, PDA, or Internet connection."

It provides an end-to-end solution; specifically, (1) physiologic parameters, including respiration rate and heart rate, are measured by wearable sensors and recorded by a mobile phone which presents the graphical interface for the user to observe his/her health status more easily; (2) it provides doctors and family members with necessary data through a web interface and enables authorized personnel to monitor the patient's condition and to facilitate remote diagnosis; and (3) it supports real-time alarming and positioning services during an urgent situation, such as a tumble or a heart attack, so that unexpected events can be handled in a timely manner. Experimental results show that the proposed system can reliably monitor the physiologic parameters and conveniently report the user's position."

Not only does it affect the elderly but is also increasingly spreading to younger sectors of the population. Treating this condition involves exhaustive monitoring of patients. The current mobile health services can be improved to perform this task more effectively.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To develop a useful, user-friendly, robust and efficient app, to monitor hypertensive patients and adapted to the particular requirements of hypertension.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This work presents BPcontrol, an Android and iOS app that allows hypertensive patients to communicate with their health-care centers, thus facilitating monitoring and diagnosis. Usability, robustness and efficiency factors for BPcontrol were evaluated for different devices and operating systems (Android, iOS and system-aware). Furthermore, its features were compared with other similar apps in the literature.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      BPcontrol is robust and user-friendly. The respective start-up efficiency of the Android and iOS versions of BPcontrol were 2.4 and 8.8 times faster than a system-aware app. Similar values were obtained for the communication efficiency (7.25 and 11.75 times faster for the Android and iOS respectively). When comparing plotting performance, BPcontrol was on average 2.25 times faster in the Android case. Most of the apps in the literature have no communication with a server, thus making it impossible to compare their performance with BPcontrol.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Its optimal design and the good behavior of its facilities make BPcontrol a very promising mobile app for monitoring hypertensive patients."

            "abstract": "This paper presents a remote healthcare patient monitoring system, called the Virtual Eye (VI), that utilises the World Wide Web infrastructure to monitor, collect, analyse and record patients' health status. The data is stored in the hospital database and can be accessed from anywhere through the internet. When a patient is in an alarming situation, the VI sends SMS messages to the mobile of the designated health personnel via the public GSM network. The novelty of the system lies in its security and its ability to use both the internet and the GSM network as communication media. Doctors can access the database server to compare the patient's current status with his/her medical history. It can be used by one physician to monitor a group of patients simultaneously, or by a group of physicians who all monitor the same patient. It allows plug-and-play of multivendor off-the-shelf hardware devices, thus avoiding proprietary standards."

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, technology has become increasingly important in the lives of adolescents. As a group, adolescents are heavy users of newer electronic communication forms such as instant messaging, e-mail, and text messaging, as well as communication-oriented Internet sites such as blogs, social networking, and sites for sharing photos and videos. Kaveri Subrahmanyam and Patricia Greenfield examine adolescents' relationships with friends, romantic partners, strangers, and their families in the context of their online communication activities. The authors show that adolescents are using these communication tools primarily to reinforce existing relationships, both with friends and romantic partners. More and more they are integrating these tools into their \"offline\" worlds, using, for example, social networking sites to get more information about new entrants into their offline world. Subrahmanyam and Greenfield note that adolescents' online interactions with strangers, while not as common now as during the early years of the Internet, may have benefits, such as relieving social anxiety, as well as costs, such as sexual predation. Likewise, the authors demonstrate that online content itself can be both positive and negative. Although teens find valuable support and information on websites, they can also encounter racism and hate messages. Electronic communication may also be reinforcing peer communication at the expense of communication with parents, who may not be knowledgeable enough about their children's online activities on sites such as the enormously popular MySpace. Although the Internet was once hailed as the savior of education, the authors say that schools today are trying to control the harmful and distracting uses of electronic media while children are at school. The challenge for schools is to eliminate the negative uses of the Internet and cell phones in educational settings while preserving their significant contributions to education and social connection."

Mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, tablets, personal digital assistants, and other wireless devices can be part of mHealth systems. With mHealth systems, glucose data can now be automatically collected, transmitted, aggregated with other physiologic data, analyzed, stored, and presented as actionable information. mHealth systems use mobile decision support software applications (or apps) to assist or direct health care professionals to make decisions, or they can assist or direct patients to make decisions without waiting for input from a clinician. With real-time decision support for patients, appropriate actions can be taken in real time without waiting to see a clinician. Decisions can be personalized if individual treatment goals and personal preferences for treatment are inputted into an app. Few mHealth apps for diabetes have been rigorously tested. Outcome studies of the use of mHealth for diabetes from the literature have shown the potential for benefits, but higher-quality studies are needed. Regulatory approval of mHealth products will require demonstration of safety and effectiveness, especially where information and trends are not just presented to patients, but used to make treatment recommendations. Three additional hurdles must be overcome to facilitate widespread adoption of this technology, including demonstration of the following: (1) privacy to satisfy regulators, (2) clinical benefit to satisfy clinicians, and (3) economic benefit to satisfy payers. mHealth for diabetes is making rapid strides and is expected to be a transforming technology that will be the next big thing."

We survey existing work on mobile M2M communications, we identify open challenges that have a direct impact on performance and resource usage efficiency, especially the impact on energy efficiency, and we review techniques to improve communications. We review the ETSI standard and application protocols, and draw considerations on the impact of their use in constrained mobile devices. Nowadays, smartphones are equipped with a wide range of embedded sensors, with varied local and wide area connectivity capabilities, and thus they offer a unique opportunity to serve as mobile gateways for other more constrained devices with local connectivity. At the same time, they can gather context data about users and environment from the embedded sensors. These capabilities may be crucial for mobile M2M applications. Finally, in this paper, we consider a scenario where smartphones are used as gateways that collect and aggregate data from sensors in a cellular network. We conclude that, in order for their use to the feasible in terms of a normal depletion time of a smartphone's battery, it is a good advice to maximize the collection of data necessary to be transmitted from nearby sensors, and maximize the intervals between transmissions.

            "abstract": "This meta-review integrates the current meta-analysis literature on the efficacy of internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) for mental disorders and somatic diseases in children and adolescents. Further, it summarizes the moderators of treatment effects in this age group. Using a systematic literature search of PsycINFO and MEDLINE/PubMed, we identified eight meta-analyses (N = 8,417) that met all inclusion criteria. Current meta-analytical evidence of IMIs exists for depression (range of standardized mean differences, SMDs = .16 to .76; 95 % CI: -.12 to 1.12; k = 3 meta-analyses), anxiety (SMDs = .30 to 1.4; 95 % CI: -.53 to 2.44; k = 5) and chronic pain (SMD = .41; 95 % CI: .07 to .74; k = 1) with predominantly nonactive control conditions (waiting-list; placebo). The effect size for IMIs across mental disorders reported in one meta-analysis is SMD = 1.27 (95 % CI: .96 to 1.59; k = 1), the effect size of IMIs for different somatic conditions is SMD = .49 (95 % CI: .33 to .64; k = 1). Moderators of treatment effects are age (k = 3), symptom severity (k = 1), and source of outcome assessment (k = 1). Quality ratings with the AMSTAR-2-checklist indicate acceptable methodological rigor of meta-analyses included. Taken together, this meta-review suggests that IMIs are efficacious in some health conditions in youths, with evidence existing primarily for depression and anxiety so far. The findings point to the potential of IMIs to augment evidence based mental healthcare for children and adolescents."

However, the usefulness of a secure, mobile telehealth application, and messaging platform has not been well described.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      A pilot study was conducted to implement a health insurance portability and accountability act (HIPAA) compliant form of communication between doctors in an orthopedic clinical setting and determine their reactions to MyDoc, a secure, mobile telehealth application, and messaging platform.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      By replacing current methods of communication through various mobile applications and text messaging services with MyDoc over a six week period, we gained feedback and determined user satisfaction with this innovative system from questionnaires handed to the program director, program coordinator, one trauma consultant, all orthopedic residents, and six non-orthopedic residents at the National University Hospital in Singapore.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Almost everyone who completed the questionnaire strongly agreed that MyDoc should replace current systems of peer to peer communication in the hospital. The majority also felt that the quality of images, videos, and sound were excellent. Almost everyone agreed that they could communicate easily with each other and would feel comfortable doing so routinely. The majority felt that virtual consults through MyDoc should be made available to inpatients as well as outpatients to potentially lessen clinic loads and provide a secure manner in which patients can communicate with their primary teams any time convenient to both. It was also agreed by most that the potential of telerounding had advantages, especially on weekends as a supplement to normal rounds.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Potential uses of MyDoc in an orthopedic clinical setting include HIPAA-compliant peer to peer communication, clinical outreach in the setting of trauma, supervision in the operating room or watching procedures being performed remotely, providing both patient and parent reassurance in pediatric orthopedic patients, and finally in the setting of outpatient clinics. With our pilot study having excellent results in terms of acceptance and satisfaction, the integration of a secure, mobile telehealth application, and messaging platform, not only in the orthopedic department but also the hospital in general, has an exciting and limitless potential. More so in this era where downsizing hospital costs is beneficial, doing so may also be mandatory in order to comply with the soon to be introduced personal data protection act."

There are opportunities for significant savings and improvements to patient care if patients can be maintained in their homes. A randomized control trial tested the impact of 3 months of telehome monitoring on hospital readmission, quality of life, and functional status in patients with heart failure or angina. The intervention consisted of video conferencing and phone line transmission of weight, blood pressure, and electrocardiograms. Telehome monitoring significantly reduced the number of hospital readmissions and days spent in the hospital for patients with angina and improved quality of life and functional status in patients with heart failure or angina. Patients found the technology easy to use and expressed high levels of satisfaction. Telehealth technologies are a viable means of providing home monitoring to patients with heart disease at high risk of hospital readmission to improve their self-care abilities."

Smokers who were unmotivated to quit were significantly less likely to own a smartphone or handheld device that connects to the Internet than smokers motivated to quit. There was a significantly lower prevalence of sending text messages among US smokers unmotivated to quit (78.2%, 179/229) versus smokers motivated to quit (95.0%, 229/241), but no significant differences between the UK groups (motivated: 96.4%, 239/248; unmotivated: 94.9%, 223/235). Smokers unmotivated to quit in both countries were significantly less likely to use a handheld device to read email, play games, browse the Web, or visit health-related websites versus smokers motivated to quit. US smokers had a high prevalence of app downloads regardless of motivation to quit, but UK smokers who were motivated to quit had greater prevalence of app downloads than smokers unmotivated to quit. US smokers were significantly more likely to have a Facebook account (87.0%, 435/500) than UK smokers (76.4%, 382/500), but smokers unmotivated to quit in both countries used Facebook less frequently than smokers motivated to quit. Smokers who were unmotivated to quit were less likely to have used eHealth or mHealth platforms to help them quit smoking in the past and less likely to say that they would use them for smoking cessation in the future.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although smokers unmotivated to quit make less use of technology than smokers motivated to quit, there is sufficient prevalence to make it worthwhile to develop eHealth and mHealth interventions to encourage cessation.

Patients receiving treatment in palliative home healthcare is geographically separated from the caregivers making symptom control a challenge, a challenge that could be met by the use of information and communication technology. Technologies of today offer different ways for patients to assess their symptoms at home and send the assessments to the healthcare provider. Examples are the use of a PC, a touch-tone telephone, and a digital pen, which require different kinds of infrastructure in the patient's home, and which differ in strengths and weaknesses. As part of an ongoing quality assurance work within the hospital-based home care clinic at Linköping University Hospital, the project has designed, developed and implemented an IT-support system for pain assessments for patients at home using digital pen and mobile Internet technology. A questionnaire study indicated that pain assessment using digital pens was accepted by patients and that problems mainly arose from the use of the visual-analogue scale."

To realize the fall detection algorithm, the angles acquired by the electronic compass (ecompass) and the waveform sequence of the triaxial accelerometer on the smart phone are used as the system inputs. The acquired signals are then used to generate an ordered feature sequence and then examined in a sequential manner by the proposed cascade classifier for recognition purpose. Once the corresponding feature is verified by the classifier at current state, it can proceed to next state; otherwise, the system will reset to the initial state and wait for the appearance of another feature sequence. Once a fall accident event is detected, the user's position can be acquired by the global positioning system (GPS) or the assisted GPS, and sent to the rescue center via the 3G communication network so that the user can get medical help immediately. With the proposed cascaded classification architecture, the computational burden and power consumption issue on the smart phone system can be alleviated. Moreover, as we will see in the experiment that a distinguished fall accident detection accuracy up to 92% on the sensitivity and 99.75% on the specificity can be obtained when a set of 450 test actions in nine different kinds of activities are estimated by using the proposed cascaded classifier, which justifies the superiority of the proposed algorithm."

In the sector of occupational health, modern acquisition systems are needed. Such systems can be used by the subject during usual daily routines without being influenced by the presence of an examiner. Moreover, the system's influence on the subject should be reduced to a minimum to receive reliable data from the examination. The acquisition system is based on a mobile handheld (or smart phone), which allows both management of the communication process and input of several dialog data (e.g., questionnaires). A sensor electronics module permits the acquisition of different physiological parameters and their online transmission to the handheld via Bluetooth. The mobile handheld and the sensor electronics module constitute a wireless personal area network. The handheld allows the first analysis, the synchronization of the data, and the continuous data transfer to a communication server by the integrated mobile radio standards of the handheld. The communication server stores the incoming data of several subjects in an application-dependent database and allows access from all over the world via a Web-based management system. The developed system permits one examiner to monitor the physiological parameters and the subjective workload of several subjects in different locations at the same time. Thereby the subjects can move almost freely in any area covered by the mobile network. The mobile handheld allows the popping-up of the questionnaires at flexible time intervals. This electronic input of the dialog data, in comparison to the manual documentation on papers, is more comfortable to the subject as well as to the examiner for an analysis.

The scarcity of high-quality studies is consistent with findings from previous systematic reviews, and highlights the need for additional investigation before applying the results in practice."

            "abstract": "The next generation of \"m-health technologies\" is a new and evolving topic in the areas of telemedical and telecare systems. These technologies involve the exploitation of mobile telecommunication and multimedia technologies to provide better access to healthcare personnel on the move, by removing the key disadvantage of trailing wires in current systems. These technologies provide equal access to medical information and expert care by overcoming the boundaries of separation that exist today between different users of such medical information. A great benefit to all users will be a more efficient use of resources and far greater location independence. In this paper we will address some notes and future trends in these emerging areas and their applications for m-health systems. Especially we will discuss the role of 4G and emerging mobile systems for future m-health systems. The new technologies can make the remote medical monitoring, consulting, and health care more flexible and convenient. But, there are challenges for successful wireless telemedicine, which are addressed in this paper."

Gait was quantified by mounting a smartphone or portable media device proximal to the lateral malleolus of the ankle joint. Attributes of the gait cycle were quantified with a considerable accuracy and reliability. The patellar tendon reflex response was quantified by using the device in tandem with a potential energy impact pendulum to evoke the patellar tendon reflex. The acceleration waveform maximum acceleration feature of the reflex response displayed considerable accuracy and reliability. By mounting the smartphone or portable media device to the dorsum of the hand through a glove, Parkinson's disease hand tremor was quantified and contrasted with significance to a non-Parkinson's disease steady hand control.

However, beyond simple text messages and app-based functions, use of these devices by pharmacies and pharmacists has not been leveraged to improve patient outcomes, such as medication adherence. Resources now exist that can facilitate more advanced mobile communication between patients and pharmacists, which can be managed and informed by data available in most pharmacies. Such tailored messaging can be personalized further by being reactive to patient behavior using real-time medication use monitoring tools, facilitating low-cost, high-reach interventions for patients in need of ongoing guidance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Mechanisms now exist for pharmacies to engage patients more proactively with their prescribed therapy using mobile communication and devices. By facilitating such engagement, pharmacists can remain connected with patients throughout their care, better interpret their needs, navigate adherence-related issues, and more holistically counsel patients based on observed behaviors. Community pharmacy leadership should pursue the use of these advanced mobile messaging techniques as another tool in their arsenal to improve patient outcomes."

During a study period of about 18 months, 45 elderly individuals with congestive heart failure used a home health monitor to enter daily information pertaining to their symptoms and health status. A total of 8576 alerts were generated by the monitoring system, although in most cases, patient and service provider interaction was not required. When system alerts were considered to be serious, or if symptoms persisted, the patient was contacted. A total of 171 key medical events (6 deaths; 28 hospital admissions; 59 changes in medication; 54 cases of advice given; 24 instances where immediate medical attention was recommended) were recorded in the monitoring logs. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to predict these medical interventions/events. The model correctly predicted key medical events in 75% of cases with a specificity of 74% and an overall cross-validated accuracy of 74% (95% CI, 68-80%). Key predictors included the number of system alerts, self-rated mobility, self-rated health and self-rated anxiety. This suggests that subjective measures are useful in addition to physiological ones for predicting health status. A multivariate decision support model has potential to supplement practitioners and current telecare systems in identifying heart failure patients in need of medical intervention.\n"

Children are the fastest growing population of smart phone users, with use often focusing around internet access, e.g., 1 in 3 internet users in the UK are under 18 years of age. Despite their widespread use, relatively little is known about the factors that underpin children's use. The home is a significant ecological context of development and recent research has highlighted the importance of the home environment in promoting and supporting the development of both safe and unsafe online behavior. Yet the importance of these influences currently remains relatively unrecognized. Therefore, in this paper we present a narrative review of evidence examining parental practices concerning digital communication technologies and applications, with a particular focus on smartphones, and how they relate to the use of technology by their children. Emerging evidence to date indicates that two important factors are at play. Firstly, parental technology use is closely related to that of their child. Secondly, that despite parents frequently voiced concerns about the nature and extent of their child's mobile phone use, parents themselves often engage in a number of unsafe internet behaviors and excessive phone use in the home environment. Our review identifies two crucial lines of enquiry that have yet to be comprehensively pursued by researchers in the field: firstly, the adoption of a psychological perspective on children's emergent behaviors with mobile devices and secondly, the influential role of context. Given parental concerns about the possible negative impact of technologies, parental awareness should be raised about the influence of their behavior in the context of internet safety along with the adoption of good digital literacy practices. It is anticipated that a comprehensive characterization of the associated contextual factors influencing smartphone use will serve as a catalyst for debate, discussion, and future research."

However, as standalone systems WBANs have many limitations due to the large amount of processed data, mobility of monitored users, and the network coverage area. Integrating WBANs with cloud computing provides effective solutions to these problems and promotes the performance of WBANs based systems. Accordingly, in this paper we propose a cloud-based real-time remote health monitoring system for tracking the health status of non-hospitalized patients while practicing their daily activities. Compared with existing cloud-based WBAN frameworks, we divide the cloud into local one, that includes the monitored users and local medical staff, and a global one that includes the outer world. The performance of the proposed framework is optimized by reducing congestion, interference, and data delivery delay while supporting users' mobility. Several novel techniques and algorithms are proposed to accomplish our objective. First, the concept of data classification and aggregation is utilized to avoid clogging the network with unnecessary data traffic. Second, a dynamic channel assignment policy is developed to distribute the WBANs associated with the users on the available frequency channels to manage interference. Third, a delay-aware routing metric is proposed to be used by the local cloud in its multi-hop communication to speed up the reporting process of the health-related data. Fourth, the delay-aware metric is further utilized by the association protocols used by the WBANs to connect with the local cloud. Finally, the system with all the proposed techniques and algorithms is evaluated using extensive ns-2 simulations. The simulation results show superior performance of the proposed architecture in optimizing the end-to-end delay, handling the increased interference levels, maximizing the network capacity, and tracking user's mobility."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Reliable home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is essential to effective hypertension management; however, manual recording is subject to underreporting and inaccuracies. Mobile health technologies hold great potential as HBPM tools, but the fidelity of a smartphone app in HBPM has not been adequately assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The primary aim of the trial was to compare the fidelity of a smartphone app to that of a handwritten logbook in making HBPM data available to clinicians at follow-up visits. Fidelity was defined as the percentage of scheduled blood pressure (BP) recordings over a 3-week period that were properly recorded and reported to the clinic. The secondary aims were to investigate patient factors associated with HBPM fidelity and to explore the effect of time on the fidelity.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A 2-arm, parallel, unblinded, randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted in a government polyclinic in Singapore. Hypertensive adults, aged 40 to 70 years, who were on antihypertensive medication and owned a smartphone were recruited and randomized by a computer-generated randomization schedule to 3 weeks of either semiautomated HBPM utilizing a Bluetooth-enabled BP monitor and a smartphone app or a fully manual process utilizing a conventional handwritten logbook. The primary outcome was home BP recording fidelity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 80 patients randomized, 79 (smartphone app: 38 and logbook: 41) were included in the final analysis. Although fidelity was higher among the app users, it did not differ significantly between study arms (smartphone app: 66.7% and logbook: 52.4%; P=.21). Chinese and Indian ethnicities were associated with higher fidelity (absolute percent and 95% CI) by 35.6% (4.27 to 66.9) and 45.0% (8.69 to 81.3), respectively, in comparison with other ethnicities (P=.03); longer smartphone ownership increased fidelity on an average of 10.5% (0.83 to 20.2) per year (P=.03); the number of apps on the smartphone decreased fidelity at a rate of -0.32% (-0.58 to -0.05) per app (P=.02); years of hypertension morbidity increased fidelity at a rate of 1.56% (0.03 to 3.09) per year (P=.046); and the number of people working in the household decreased fidelity at a rate of -8.18% (-16.3 to -0.08) per additional working person (P=.048). The fidelity of the app was significantly higher in the first week (64.4%) than the second (55.1%, P=.001) and third (58.2%, P=.03) weeks of monitoring.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Amid the increasing integration of health technologies into clinical practice, our study demonstrates the feasibility of smartphone app-assisted HBPM in hypertensive adults of Singapore. Our pilot study found no statistically significant difference in mean BP recording fidelity between a smartphone app and conventional handwritten logbook. However, the small sample size precludes definitive conclusions and highlights the need for a larger, adequately powered trial.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03209024; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03209024 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/78EVWBg0T)."

Therefore, ultrasonic waves can provide an alternative method as an information carrier for body sensor networks (BSNs). This paper presents a novel wireless communication method that uses ultrasonic sound waves as a medium for healthcare systems. We investigated the feasibility of our proposal by testing it in a real digital communication experimental setup. To find an acceptable modulation method, the functionality of the proposed ultrasound-based digital communication approach was tested involving three principal modulation methods: amplitude shift keying (ASK), frequency shift keying (FSK), and phase shift keying (PSK). The modulated digital signals obtained from the experiments were compared with the simulated signals. Analysis of the results shows that ultrasonic waves are feasible and can be used for digital communication."

This makes addressing health disparities and health inequities in minority populations increasingly more difficult. Minority populations, including those who classify themselves as African American and Hispanic, are using mobile phones to access health information via the internet more frequently than those who classify themselves as white, providing unique opportunities for those in public health and health education to reach these traditionally underserved populations using mobile health (mHealth) interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this review was to assess studies conducted in the United States that have used mHealth tools and strategies to develop and implement interventions in underserved populations.

This process involves a series of steps: conceptualization, formative research to inform the development, pretesting content, pilot study, pragmatic randomized controlled trial, and further qualitative research to inform improvement or implementation. Several themes underlie the entire process, including the integrity of the underlying behavior change theory, allowing for improvements on the basis of participant feedback, and a focus on implementation from the start. The strengths of this process are the involvement of the target audience in the development stages and the use of rigorous research methods to determine effectiveness. The limitations include the time required and potentially a less formalized and randomized approach than some other processes. This article aims to describe the steps and themes in the mHealth development process, using the examples of a mobile phone video messaging smoking cessation intervention and a mobile phone multimedia messaging depression prevention intervention, to stimulate discussion on these and other potential methods."

Although most organizations prepare thoroughly for the clinical and work flow aspect of RPM solutions, they neglect to consider the logistical resources necessary to successfully manage a broad deployment. The term \"logistics\" in this context refers to the processes and infrastructure required to enable the use of RPM technologies in the patient's home. This article has been generated from the findings and observations of several studies where logistical objectives were included in the protocol in addition to the conventional metrics of clinical outcome, satisfaction, and economic measures. These studies implemented several high-speed Internet connectivity models with the use of wired broadband, 3G wireless, or a combination. The organizations that utilized 3G to provide Internet connectivity experienced significantly fewer logistical issues and patient frustration. It was also observed that regardless of the model, each of the clinical partners in these studies were not adequately prepared to manage Internet connectivity. Because of this, all experienced some level of difficulty installing and supporting RPM devices in the home."

            "abstract": "Citizen science enables citizens to actively contribute to all aspects of the research process, from conceptualization and data collection, to knowledge translation and evaluation. Citizen science is gradually emerging as a pertinent approach in population health research. Given that citizen science has intrinsic links with community-based research, where participatory action drives the research agenda, these two approaches could be integrated to address complex population health issues. Community-based participatory research has a strong record of application across multiple disciplines and sectors to address health inequities. Citizen science can use the structure of community-based participatory research to take local approaches of problem solving to a global scale, because citizen science emerged through individual environmental activism that is not limited by geography. This synergy has significant implications for population health research if combined with systems science, which can offer theoretical and methodological strength to citizen science and community-based participatory research. Systems science applies a holistic perspective to understand the complex mechanisms underlying causal relationships within and between systems, as it goes beyond linear relationships by utilizing big data-driven advanced computational models. However, to truly integrate citizen science, community-based participatory research, and systems science, it is time to realize the power of ubiquitous digital tools, such as smartphones, for connecting us all and providing big data. Smartphones have the potential to not only create equity by providing a voice to disenfranchised citizens but smartphone-based apps also have the reach and power to source big data to inform policies. An imminent challenge in legitimizing citizen science is minimizing bias, which can be achieved by standardizing methods and enhancing data quality-a rigorous process that requires researchers to collaborate with citizen scientists utilizing the principles of community-based participatory research action. This study advances SMART, an evidence-based framework that integrates citizen science, community-based participatory research, and systems science through ubiquitous tools by addressing core challenges such as citizen engagement, data management, and internet inequity to legitimize this integration."

            "abstract": "Despite advances in the treatment of asthma the morbidity and mortality of this disease has increased significantly in the past several years. Recent studies have shown that monitoring of asthma severity in the patient home especially combined with patient education can reduce incidence of asthma exacerbation and subsequent hospitalization. The existing methods for home asthma monitoring are limited by four factors; they completely rely on a patient's ability to document and to evaluate test results; there is no easy way for a physician to review data in a timely manner; they use imprecise tools for evaluation of asthma severity and they don't provide clinical decision support tools. The goal of this study is to develop and to evaluate a telematic system for asthma severity monitoring which will minimize patients' efforts in performing self-testing at their homes and allow prompt reciprocal exchange of all relevant information between patients and health care providers. In our setting, patients use portable spirometer and pocket-sized palmtop computer for data exchange. Our system allows daily serial monitoring of asthma severity at patients' homes using Forced Vital Capacity test and symptom diary. The results of the tests become available for physicians review immediately after completion of self-testing procedures via Web browser. The results can be transmitted from patients' homes (or any other remote location) to the medical records database via landline or wireless networks in several minutes. Each time the remote server receives patient's results, it invokes the application which tests the validity of data, analyzes parameters trends and dispatches corresponding messages for the patient and, if necessary, for physicians. Such an approach provides constant feedback loop between asthma patient and physician. The system has been tested in 10 healthy volunteers and asthma patients. Patients participated in the study from two to 21 days. The test results showed that the system provides reliable reciprocal exchange of all relevant information between a physician and asthma patient in home settings. Average transmission time from the patient's palmtop to the remote central data repository was about 1 minute for 14.4 Kbps landline modem, 6 minutes for cellular network and 8 minutes for RAM Mobile network. After transmission, the test results were immediately available for review at our web site."

            "abstract": "Obtaining reliable longitudinal information about everyday functioning from individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) in natural environments is critical for clinical care and research. Despite advances in mobile health technologies, the implementation of digital outcome measures is hindered by a lack of consensus on the type and scope of measures, the most appropriate approach for data capture (eg, in clinic or at home), and the extraction of timely information that meets the needs of patients, clinicians, caregivers, and health care regulators. The Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Technology proposes the following objectives to facilitate the adoption of mobile health technologies: (1) identification of patient-centered and clinically relevant digital outcomes; (2) selection criteria for device combinations that offer an acceptable benefit-to-burden ratio to patients and that deliver reliable, clinically relevant insights; (3) development of an accessible, scalable, and secure platform for data integration and data analytics; and (4) agreement on a pathway for approval by regulators, adoption into e-health systems and implementation by health care organizations. We have developed a tentative roadmap that addresses these needs by providing the following deliverables: (1) results and interpretation of an online survey to define patient-relevant endpoints, (2) agreement on the selection criteria for use of device combinations, (3) an example of an open-source platform for integrating mobile health technology output, and (4) recommendations for assessing readiness for deployment of promising devices and algorithms suitable for regulatory approval. This concrete implementation guidance, harmonizing the collaborative endeavor among stakeholders, can improve assessments of individuals with PD, tailor symptomatic therapy, and enhance health care outcomes. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Problematic substance use in adolescence and emerging adulthood is a significant public health concern in the United States due to high recurrence of use rates and unmet treatment needs coupled with increased use. Consequently, there is a need for both improved service utilization and availability of recovery supports. Given the ubiquitous use of the internet and social media via smartphones, a viable option is to design digital treatments and recovery support services to include internet and social media platforms.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Although digital treatments delivered through social media and the internet are a possibility, it is unclear how interventions using these tools should be tailored for groups with problematic substance use. There is limited research comparing consumer trends of use of social media platforms, use of platform features, and vulnerability of exposure to drug cues online. The goal of this study was to compare digital platforms used among adolescents (Generation Zs, age 13-17) and emerging adults (Millennials, age 18-35) attending outpatient substance use treatment and to examine receptiveness toward these platforms in order to support substance use treatment and recovery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Generation Zs and Millennials enrolled in outpatient substance use treatment (n=164) completed a survey examining social media use, digital intervention acceptability, frequency of substance exposure, and substance use experiences. Generation Zs (n=53) completed the survey in July 2018. Millennials (n=111) completed the survey in May 2016.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Generation Zs had an average age of 15.66 (SD 1.18) years and primarily identified as male (50.9%). Millennials had an average age of 27.66 (SD 5.12) years and also primarily identified as male (75.7%). Most participants owned a social media account (Millennials: 82.0%, Generation Zs: 94.3%) and used it daily (Millennials: 67.6%, Generation Zs: 79.2%); however, Generation Zs were more likely to use Instagram and Snapchat, whereas Millennials were more likely to use Facebook. Further, Generation Zs were more likely to use the features within social media platforms (eg, instant messaging: Millennials: 55.0%, Generation Zs: 79.2%; watching videos: Millennials: 56.8%, Generation Zs: 81.1%). Many participants observed drug cues on social media (Millennials: 67.5%, Generation Zs: 71.7%). However, fewer observed recovery information on social media (Millennials: 30.6%, Generation Zs: 34.0%). Participants felt that social media (Millennials: 55.0%, Generation Zs: 49.1%), a mobile phone app (Millennials: 36.9%, Generation Zs: 45.3%), texting (Millennials: 28.8%, Generation Zs: 45.3%), or a website (Millennials: 39.6%, Generation Zs: 32.1%) would be useful in delivering recovery support.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Given the high rates of exposure to drug cues on social media, disseminating recovery support within a social media platform may be the ideal just-in-time intervention needed to decrease the rates of recurrent drug use. However, our results suggest that cross-platform solutions capable of transcending generational preferences are necessary and one-size-fits-all digital interventions should be avoided."

Mobile health (mHealth) may constitute an unexplored and innovative avenue for providing smoking cessation support to a population that is otherwise difficult to reach with evidence-based interventions. Female respondents aged 18-44 years (N = 10,023) were drawn from the first wave of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study (2013-2014). We examined prevalence of use of various digital forms of communication (e.g., social media, text messaging, smartphone ownership) among non-pregnant women of reproductive age, pregnant women, and among smokers versus non-smokers within these groups. Multiple logistic regression modeling was conducted to identify correlates of using each digital form adjusting for smoking status, pregnancy, and demographic characteristics. Over two thirds of women overall and within subgroups of non-pregnant and pregnant smokers reported using social media, owning a cell phone, owning a smartphone, downloading apps, and sending/receiving text messages. Current smokers and those with lower educational attainment generally had lower odds of using each digital form relative to non-smokers and those with higher educational attainment, the exception being that smokers had higher odds of using social media relative to non-smokers. The high prevalence of using various digital forms among both non-pregnant smokers of reproductive age and pregnant smokers suggests that leveraging technology to expand access to prevention, education, and treatment resources may reduce smoking-attributable adverse health effects among reproductive-aged women and their offspring."

Although there are many efforts advocating for smoking cessation, smoking is still highly prevalent. For instance, in the USA in 2015, 50% of all smokers attempted to quit smoking, and only 5-7% of them succeeded - with slight deviation depending on external assistance. Previous studies show that computer-tailored messages which support smoking abstinence are effective. The combination of health recommender systems and behavioral-change theories is becoming increasingly popular in computer-tailoring. The objective of this study is to evaluate patients's smoking cessation rates by means of two randomized controlled trials using computer-tailored motivational messages. A group of 100 patients will be recruited in medical centers in Taiwan (50 patients in the intervention group, and 50 patients in the control group), and a group of 1000 patients will be recruited on-line (500 patients in the intervention group, and 500 patients in the control group).

The first source is a clinical pilot in which a group of patients from two Taiwanese medical centers will be randomly assigned to either an intervention or a control group. The intervention group will be provided with a mobile app that sends motivational messages selected by a recommender system that takes the user profile (including gender, age, motivations, and social context) and similar users' opinions. For 6 months, the patients' smoking activity will be followed up, and confirmed as \"smoke-free\" by using a test that measures expired carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine levels. The second source will be a public pilot in which Internet users wanting to quit smoking will be able to download the same mobile app as used in the clinical pilot. They will be randomly assigned to a control group that receives basic motivational messages or to an intervention group, that receives personalized messages by the recommender system. For 6 months, patients in the public pilot will be assessed periodically with self-reported questionnaires.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study will be the first to use the I-Change behavioral-change model in combination with a health recommender system and will, therefore, provide relevant insights into computer-tailoring for smoking cessation.

Expectations range from overcoming structural barriers to access in low-income countries to more effective, interactive treatment of chronic conditions. Before medical health practice supported by mobile devices (\"mHealth\") can scale up, a number of challenges need to be adequately addressed. From a psychological perspective, high attrition rates, digital divide of society, and intellectual capabilities of the users are key issues when implementing such technologies. Furthermore, apps addressing behavior change often lack a comprehensive concept, which is essential for an ongoing impact. From a clinical point of view, there is insufficient evidence to allow scaling up of mHealth interventions. In addition, new concepts are required to assess the efficacy and efficiency of interventions. Regarding technology interoperability, open standards and low-energy wireless protocols appear to be vital for successful implementation. There is an ongoing discussion in how far health care-related apps require a conformity assessment and how to best communicate quality standards to consumers. \"Apps Peer-Review\" and standard reporting via an \"App synopsis\" appear to be promising approaches to increase transparency for end users.

A wireless ECG subsystem was built for recording ambulatory ECG in an indoor environment and for storing ECG data into the database. For testing, a WAP phone compliant with WAP 1.1 was used at GSM 1800 MHz by circuit-switched data (CSD) to connect to the content server through a WAP gateway, which was provided by a mobile phone service provider in Hong Kong. Data were successfully retrieved from the database and displayed on the WAP phone. The system shows how WAP can be feasible in remote patient-monitoring and patient data retrieval."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite the existence of adequate technological infrastructure and clearer policies, there are situations where users, mainly physicians, resist mobile health (mHealth) solutions. This is of particular concern, bearing in mind that several studies, both in developed and developing countries, showed that clinicians' adoption is the most influential factor in such solutions' success.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to focus on understanding clinicians' roles in the adoption of an oncology decision support app, the factors impacting this adoption, and its implications for organizational and social practices.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A qualitative case study of a decision support app in oncology, called ONCOassist, was conducted. The data were collected through 17 in-depth interviews with clinicians and nurses in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      This case demonstrates the affordances and constraints of mHealth technology at the workplace, its implications for the organization of work, and clinicians' role in its constant development and adoption. The research findings confirmed that factors such as app operation and stability, ease of use, usefulness, cost, and portability play a major role in the adoption decision; however, other social factors such as endorsement, neutrality of the content, attitude toward technology, existing workload, and internal organizational politics are also reported as key determinants of clinicians' adoption. Interoperability and cultural views of mobile usage at work are the key workflow disadvantages, whereas higher efficiency and performance, sharpened practice, and location flexibility are the main workflow advantages.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Several organizational implications emerged, suggesting the need for some actions such as fostering a work culture that embraces new technologies and the creation of new digital roles for clinicians both on the hospitals or clinics and on the development sides but also more collaboration between health care organizations and digital health providers to enable electronic medical record integration and solving of any interoperability issues. From a theoretical perspective, we also suggest the addition of a fourth step to Leonardi's methodological guidance that accounts for user engagement; embedding the users in the continuous design and development processes ensures the understanding of user-specific affordances that can then be made more obvious to other users and increase the potential of such tools to go beyond their technological features and have a higher impact on workflow and the organizing process."

            "abstract": "By its very nature, telehealth relies on technology. Throughout history, as new technologies emerged and afforded people the ability to send information across distances, it was not long before this capability was applied to the most basic need of all: maintaining health. While much of the early work in telehealth was driven by technology (e.g., making opportunistic use of the systems and devices that were available at the time), recent trends are beginning to push the demand for and the development of new technologies specific to the individual needs of telehealth applications. The future of telehealth will benefit greatly from this technology innovation, in particular, in areas such as home telehealth and remote monitoring, e-health and patient portal applications, personal health records, interactive Internet technologies, and robotics. Telehealth, while not a panacea for all of the challenges facing modern healthcare systems, has a substantial and ever-expanding potential to revolutionize the ways in which people receive medical care while offering the possibility to contain costs, manage chronic diseases, and prevent secondary complications. By demanding innovative solutions and speaking out in support of the field, the telehealth community can and should be leading the charge for greater attention to human factors in technology development, interoperable medical records, staff training and competencies, standards and guidelines, and support for expanded telehealth coverage at the national, state, and local levels."

Patients randomized into the tele group were equipped with mobile phone-based patient terminals for data acquisition and data transmission to the monitoring center. Study physicians had continuous access to the data via a secure Web portal. If transmitted values went outside individually adjustable borders, study physicians were sent an email alert. Primary endpoint was hospitalization for worsening CHF or death from cardiovascular cause.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study was stopped after randomization of 120 patients (85 male, 35 female); median age was 66 years (IQR 62-72). The control group comprised 54 patients (39 male, 15 female) with a median age of 67 years (IQR 61-72), and the tele group included 54 patients (40 male, 14 female) with a median age of 65 years (IQR 62-72). There was no significant difference between groups with regard to baseline characteristics. Twelve tele group patients were unable to begin data transmission due to the inability of these patients to properly operate the mobile phone (\"never beginners\"). Four patients did not finish the study due to personal reasons. Intention-to-treat analysis at study end indicated that 18 control group patients (33%) reached the primary endpoint (1 death, 17 hospitalizations), compared with 11 tele group patients (17%, 0 deaths, 11 hospitalizations; relative risk reduction 50%, 95% CI 3-74%, P = .06). Per-protocol analysis revealed that 15% of tele group patients (0 deaths, 8 hospitalizations) reached the primary endpoint (relative risk reduction 54%, 95% CI 7-79%, P= .04). NYHA class improved by one class in tele group patients only (P< .001). Tele group patients who were hospitalized for worsening heart failure during the study had a significantly shorter length of stay (median 6.5 days, IQR 5.5-8.3) compared with control group patients (median 10.0 days, IQR 7.0-13.0; P= .04). The event rate of never beginners was not higher than the event rate of control group patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Telemonitoring using mobile phones as patient terminals has the potential to reduce frequency and duration of heart failure hospitalizations.

Thus, the goal of this study was to gain insight into the real-world acceptance of mHealth approaches among high-risk people who use drugs in treatment. A convenience sample of 400 HIV-negative drug users, who reported drug- and/or sex-related risk behaviors, were recruited from a methadone clinic in New Haven, Connecticut. Participants completed standardized assessments of drug- and sex-related risk behaviors, neurocognitive impairment (NCI), and measures of communication technology access and utilization, and mHealth acceptance. We found a high prevalence of current ownership and use of mobile technologies, such as cell phone (91.5%) including smartphone (63.5%). Participants used mobile technologies to communicate mostly through phone calls (M = 4.25, SD = 1.24), followed by text messages (M = 4.21, SD = 1.29). Participants expressed interest in using mHealth for medication reminders (72.3%), receive information about HIV (65.8%), and to assess drug-related (72.3%) and sex-related behaviors (64.8%). Furthermore, participants who were neurocognitively impaired were more likely to use cell phone without internet and show considerable interest in using mHealth as compared to those without NCI. The findings from this study provide empirical evidence that mHealth-based programs, specifically cell phone text messaging-based health programs, may be acceptable to this high-risk population."

The BAN network protocol maintains dynamic ad-hoc network configuration scenarios and co-existence of multiple networks.BAN is expected to become a basic infrastructure element for electronic health services: By integrating patient-attached sensors and mobile actor units, distributed information and data processing systems, the range of medical workflow can be extended to include applications like wireless multi-parameter patient monitoring and therapy support. Beyond clinical use and professional disease management environments, private personal health assistance scenarios (without financial reimbursement by health agencies / insurance companies) enable a wide range of applications and services in future pervasive computing and networking environments."

Seven publications reporting on six studies met inclusion criteria. Five studies focused on MSM. Interventions primarily employed text messaging (n = 4), whereas two focused on smartphone apps and one on social media. Three studies measured intervention impact on adherence and found increased ART use intentions (n = 1), self-reported adherence (n = 1), and viral suppression (n = 1, no control group). Other mHealth interventions for HIV-positive MSM focused on status disclosure and reducing sexual risk.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      mHealth interventions to support ART adherence among MSM show acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy. No recent mHealth interventions for MSM measured impact on viral suppression compared with a control condition despite earlier (pre-2015) evidence for efficacy. Studies are underway that include multiple features designed to improve adherence within complex smartphone or internet-based platforms. Areas for future growth include overcoming measurement and engagement challenges, developing tools for coordinating patient and provider adherence data, testing combination interventions, and adapting efficacious interventions for new languages and geographic settings."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nPost-surgical discharge complications result in increased hospital readmissions, cost, and patient dissatisfaction. Telehealth technology to monitor patients, especially those in geographically isolated areas, may reduce post-operative complications and improve health and financial outcomes. The primary objective of this study was to compare outcomes between patients who received TeleHealth Electronic Monitoring (THEM) and those with routine discharge instructions and no monitoring, Standard Of Care (SOC).\n## METHODS\nThis is a prospective randomized study of vascular surgery patients with infrainguinal incisions. THEM patients received a tablet and home monitoring devices that transmitted information to care managers. Monitoring tools included image capture, weight scales, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, and oxygen saturation monitors. Care managers used the TeleMed 2020 Enform™ platform to review alerts, real-time patient data, and dialogue with the care team.\n## RESULTS\nEighty patients were screened and 30 enrolled, of which 16 (53.3%) were randomized to the THEM group and 14 (46.7%) to the control group. Average age and body mass index for THEM and control patients were similar (62.5 ± 7.2 vs. 65.7 ± 7.3, P = 0.234; and 27.7 ± 4.3 vs. 29.1 7.1, P = 0.487), respectively. There was a similar number of male participants in each group (THEM 62.5% vs. SOC 42.9%, P = 0.464). There were no significant differences in wound or 30-day readmissions (THEM 6.3% vs. SOC 7.1%, P = 1.000). Interestingly, 30-day infection rates indicated that care managers identified marginally more superficial wound problems in the THEM group (31.3% vs. 7.1%, P = 0.175). Both groups reported an increase in short-form-8 physical summary scores, but was more pronounced in THEM patients (P = 0.076). THEM patients reported a significantly greater improvement in quality of life on 3 of the short-form-8 quality subscales (physical function, role-physical, and role-emotional; THEM delta 7.5 versus Control delta 1.1; THEM delta 8.7 versus Control delta 1.1; and THEM delta 6.3 versus Control delta -0.5; all P < 0.05). THEM patients reported trends for higher satisfaction in terms of general satisfaction, technical quality, and accessibility for Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 survey questions (4.2 vs. 3.7, P = 0.072; 4.5 vs. 4.1, P = 0.081; and 4.2 vs. 3.8, P = 0.063), respectively.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTHEM was technically feasible and provided some benefit to patients in geographically disparate areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction. Additional findings suggested that THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took advantage of increased access to healthcare professionals. Telehealth successfully merged remotely generated information with care manager interaction. Presently, a larger study, preferably multi-center, is warranted and under consideration.\n"

Brief CBT (BCBT; eight sessions) for child anxiety is promising but may have less favorable outcomes owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential to improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage youth in learning and practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo).\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cues youth to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to engage youth in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal.

Anesthesia departments are implementing automated methods to send text messages to mobile devices for abnormal vital signs, clinical recommendations, quality of care, and compliance or billing issues. The most time-critical communications determine maximum acceptable latencies. We studied the reliability of several alphanumeric messaging systems to identify an appropriate technology for such use.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Latencies between message initiation and delivery to 3 alphanumeric paging devices were measured over weeks. Two devices used Internet pathways outside the hospital's local network with an external paging vendor (SkyTel). The third device used only the internal hospital network (Zetron). Sequential cell phone text page latencies were examined for lag-1 autocorrelation using the runs test, with results binned by hour and by day. Message latencies subsequently were batched in successive 1-week bins for calculation of the mean and 99th percentiles of latencies. We defined acceptance criteria as a mean latency <30 seconds and no more than 1 in 200 pages (0.5%) having a latency longer than 100 seconds. Cell phone texting was used as a positive control to assure that the analysis was appropriate, because such devices have (known) poor reliability during high network activity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was substantial correlation among latencies for sequential cell phone text messages when binned by hours (P < 0.0001), but not by days (P = 0.61). The 2 devices using Internet pathways outside the hospital's network demonstrated unacceptable performance, with 1.3% and 33% of latencies exceeding 100 seconds, respectively. The device dependent only on the internal network had a mean latency of 8 seconds, with 100% of 40,200 pages having latencies <100 seconds. The findings suggest that the network used was the deciding factor.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Developers of anesthesia communication systems need to measure latencies of proposed communication pathways and devices used to deliver urgent messages to mobile users. Similar evaluation is relevant for text pagers used on an ad hoc basis for delivery of time-critical notifications. Testing over a period of hours to days is adequate only for disqualification of a candidate paging system, because acceptable results are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance. Rather, weeks of testing are required, with appropriate batching of pages for analysis."

Previous studies have focused on single behaviors; however, cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a component of CHD self-management, needs to address multiple risk factors.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim was to investigate the effectiveness of a mHealth-delivered comprehensive CR program (Text4Heart) to improve adherence to recommended lifestyle behaviors (smoking cessation, physical activity, healthy diet, and nonharmful alcohol use) in addition to usual care (traditional CR).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A 2-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted in New Zealand adults diagnosed with CHD. Participants were recruited in-hospital and were encouraged to attend center-based CR (usual care control). In addition, the intervention group received a personalized 24-week mHealth program, framed in social cognitive theory, sent by fully automated daily short message service (SMS) text messages and a supporting website. The primary outcome was adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors measured using a self-reported composite health behavior score (≥3) at 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes included clinical outcomes, medication adherence score, self-efficacy, illness perceptions, and anxiety and/or depression at 6 months.

            "abstract": "Digital triggers such as text messages, emails, and push alerts are designed to focus an individual on a desired goal by prompting an internal or external reaction at the appropriate time. Triggers therefore have an essential role in engaging individuals with digital interventions delivered outside of traditional health care settings, where other events in daily lives and fluctuating motivation to engage in effortful behavior exist. There is an emerging body of literature examining the use of digital triggers for short-term action and longer-term behavior change. However, little attention has been given to understanding the components of digital triggers. Using tailoring as an overarching framework, we separated digital triggers into 5 primary components: (1) who (sender), (2) how (stimulus type, delivery medium, heterogeneity), (3) when (delivered), (4) how much (frequency, intensity), and (5) what (trigger's target, trigger's structure, trigger's narrative). We highlighted key considerations when tailoring each component and the pitfalls of ignoring common mistakes, such as alert fatigue and habituation. As evidenced throughout the paper, there is a broad literature base from which to draw when tailoring triggers to curate behavior change in health interventions. More research is needed, however, to examine differences in efficacy based on component tailoring, to best use triggers to facilitate behavior change over time, and to keep individuals engaged in physical and mental health behavior change efforts. Dismantling digital triggers into their component parts and reassembling them according to the gestalt of one's change goals is the first step in this development work."

The WIHMD also analyzes the acquired bio-signals and transmits the resultant data to a healthcare service center through a commercial cellular phone. Two different kinds of IT-based blood glucometer have been developed using a cellular phone and PDA(personal digital assistant) as a main unit. A blood glucometer was also integrated within a wrist pressure measurement module which is interfaced with a cellular phone via Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA) standard in order to provide users with easiness in measuring and handling two important health parameters. Non-intrusive bio-signal measurement systems were developed for the ease of home use. One can measure his ECG on a bed while he is sleeping; measure his ECG, body temperature, bodyfat ratio and weight on a toilet seat; measure his ECG on a chair; and estimate the degree of activity by motion analysis using a camera. Another integrated diagnostic system for home telehealthcare services has been developed to include a 12 channels ECG, a pressure meter for NIBP, a blood glucometer, a bodyfat meter and a spirometer. It is an expert system to analyze the measured health data and based on the diagnostic result, the system provides an appropriate medical consultation. The measured data can be either stored on the system or transmitted to the central server through the internet. We have installed the developed systems on a model house for the performance evaluation and confirmed the possibility of the system as an effective tool for the personalized healthcare services."

However, the effectiveness of such interventions may depend on patients' comfort with technology.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim was to describe the relationship between patient demographics and COPD disease severity and the use of communication-related technology.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We administered a structured survey about the use of communication technologies to a cohort of persons in the COPDGene study at one midwestern hospital in the United States. Survey results were combined with clinical and demographic data previously collected as part of the cohort study. A subsample of patients also completed eHealth simulation tasks. We used logistic or linear regression to determine the relationship between patient demographics and COPD disease severity and reported use of communication-related technology and the results from our simulated eHealth-related tasks.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 686 patients completed the survey and 100 participated in the eHealth simulation. Overall, those who reported using communication technology were younger (P=.005) and had higher incomes (P=.03). Men appeared less likely to engage in text messaging (P<.001) than women. Patients who spent more time on tasks in the eHealth simulation had greater odds of a COPD Assessment Test score >10 (P=.02) and walked shorter distances in their 6-minute walk tests (P=.003) than those who took less time.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Older patients, patients with lower incomes, and less healthy patients were less likely to report using communication technology, and they did not perform as well on our simulated eHealth tasks.

The increase in available technology is thought to be a contributor in the obesogenic environment, yet at the same time technology can also be used to intervene and improve health and health behaviors. This article reviews the components of effective weight management programs and the novel role that technology, such as SMS, websites, and smartphone apps, is playing to improve the success of such programs. Use of these modern technologies can now allow for individualized treatment recommendations to be delivered to individuals remotely, increased self-monitoring/tracking of health-related data, broader and more rapid dissemination of health information/recommendations, and increased patient-dietician/physician contact. The use of technology in weight management programs results in improved long-term weight management, and in most cases improved cost-effectiveness. Rather than blaming increased food intake and sedentary lifestyle on technology, rapidly developing and innovative technologies should be used to our advantage and deployed to combat the obesity epidemic."

Thus, it seems to be a fitting moment to investigate the prevalence of this issue over time. The aim of the present study was to analyze the prevalence of the perception of problematic Internet and smartphone use in young people over the period 2006-2017. To this end, a questionnaire on Internet use habits and two questionnaires on the negative consequences of Internet and smartphone use were administered to a sample of 792 university students. The scores were then compared with the results of former studies that had used these questionnaires. The perception of problematic Internet and mobile phone use has increased over the last decade, social networks are considered responsible for this increase, and females are perceived to be more affected than males. The current study shows how strong smartphone and Internet addiction and social media overlap. Participants from 2017 report higher negative consequences of both Internet and mobile phone use than those from 2006, but long-term observations show a decrease in problematic use after a sharp increase in 2013. We conclude that the diagnosis of technological addictions is influenced by both time and social and culture changes."

The current trial in progress validates the business potential of remote monitoring services and demonstrates the technical environment that enables patient-doctor interaction regardless of location and the according communication modes and protocols. The domain for applying the envisaged service is the private healthcare sector and the users groups include individual chronic patients with cardiac and pulmonary diseases. So far, from the patient's point of view, the service mainly appeals to patients with arrhythmias due to lightweight technology and easy processes involved in the transmission of 1-lead ECG. Asthma and COPD patients are also enthusiastic, as they can receive doctor advice in real time. From the health professional's point of view the service has real added value in the fields of diagnosis, prevention, monitoring and follow up. In the case of asthma and COPD the value of the service in diagnosis is even more apparent as these patients may be asymptomatic, when they visit their doctor and have exacerbations when they are at home. e-Vital in this case ensures that the healthcare professional will acquire the complete image of the patient condition.

The app allows the provision of expert clinical burn care directly in the patient's home through text and image messaging, video conferencing, and instructional videos. They retrospectively reviewed clinical outcomes and usability in pediatric partial thickness burn patients treated using the TeleBurn App compared with standard therapy alone. Standard therapy is considered to be face-to-face delivery of care. Burn wound care was provided to 32 patients via the app and 35 patients with standard therapy. Most (74%) patients offered the app, used it as their primary source of follow-up care. This group had no wound infections or unexpected returns to clinic or hospital. Both TeleBurn App and standard therapy groups had similar burn severity, age, and burn mechanism. Mean healing time was shorter in the app group (mean ± standard deviation: 11.6 ± 4.7 days versus standard therapy: 14.3 ± 5.4 [P = .03]) with fewer clinical encounters (0.93 ± 0.6 vs standard therapy: 3.3 ± 1.0 [P = .001]).

Rapid expansion of mobile technologies, including smartphone applications (apps), provides a unique opportunity for outreach and tailored health messaging. We collected electronic daily journals and conducted surveys and focus groups with 22 black MSM (age 18-30) at three sites in North Carolina to inform the development of a mobile phone-based intervention. Qualitative data was analyzed thematically using NVivo. Half of the sample earned under $11,000 annually. All participants owned smartphones and had unlimited texting and many had unlimited data plans. Phones were integral to participants' lives and were a primary means of Internet access. Communication was primarily through text messaging and Internet (on-line chatting, social networking sites) rather than calls. Apps were used daily for entertainment, information, productivity, and social networking. Half of participants used their phones to find sex partners; over half used phones to find health information. For an HIV-related app, participants requested user-friendly content about test site locators, sexually transmitted diseases, symptom evaluation, drug and alcohol risk, safe sex, sexuality and relationships, gay-friendly health providers, and connection to other gay/HIV-positive men. For young black MSM in this qualitative study, mobile technologies were a widely used, acceptable means for HIV intervention. Future research is needed to measure patterns and preferences of mobile technology use among broader samples."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Growing interest on the effects of home telemonitoring on patients with chronic heart failure (HF) has led to a rise in the number of systematic reviews addressing the same or very similar research questions with a concomitant increase in discordant findings. Differences in the scope, methods of analysis, and methodological quality of systematic reviews can cause great confusion and make it difficult for policy makers and clinicians to access and interpret the available evidence and for researchers to know where knowledge gaps in the extant literature exist.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This overview aims to collect, appraise, and synthesize existing evidence from multiple systematic reviews on the effectiveness of home telemonitoring interventions for patients with chronic heart failure (HF) to inform policy makers, practitioners, and researchers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A comprehensive literature search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library to identify all relevant, peer-reviewed systematic reviews published between January 1996 and December 2013. Reviews were searched and screened using explicit keywords and inclusion criteria. Standardized forms were used to extract data and the methodological quality of included reviews was appraised using the AMSTAR (assessing methodological quality of systematic reviews) instrument. Summary of findings tables were constructed for all primary outcomes of interest, and quality of evidence was graded by outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system. Post-hoc analysis and subgroup meta-analyses were conducted to gain further insights into the various types of home telemonitoring technologies included in the systematic reviews and the impact of these technologies on clinical outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 15 reviews published between 2003 and 2013 were selected for meta-level synthesis. Evidence from high-quality reviews with meta-analysis indicated that taken collectively, home telemonitoring interventions reduce the relative risk of all-cause mortality (0.60 to 0.85) and heart failure-related hospitalizations (0.64 to 0.86) compared with usual care. Absolute risk reductions ranged from 1.4%-6.5% and 3.7%-8.2%, respectively. Improvements in HF-related hospitalizations appeared to be more pronounced in patients with stable HF: hazard ratio (HR) 0.70 (95% credible interval [Crl] 0.34-1.5]). Risk reductions in mortality and all-cause hospitalizations appeared to be greater in patients who had been recently discharged (≤28 days) from an acute care setting after a recent HF exacerbation: HR 0.62 (95% CrI 0.42-0.89) and HR 0.67 (95% CrI 0.42-0.97), respectively. However, quality of evidence for these outcomes ranged from moderate to low suggesting that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the observed estimates of effect and may change these estimates. The post-hoc analysis identified five main types of non-invasive telemonitoring technologies included in the systematic reviews: (1) video-consultation, with or without transmission of vital signs, (2) mobile telemonitoring, (3) automated device-based telemonitoring, (4) interactive voice response, and (5) Web-based telemonitoring. Of these, only automated device-based telemonitoring and mobile telemonitoring were effective in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality and HF-related hospitalizations. More research data are required for interactive voice response systems, video-consultation, and Web-based telemonitoring to provide robust conclusions about their effectiveness.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Future research should focus on understanding the process by which home telemonitoring works in terms of improving outcomes, identify optimal strategies and the duration of follow-up for which it confers benefits, and further investigate whether there is differential effectiveness between chronic HF patient groups and types of home telemonitoring technologies."

The mobile phone, acting as a patient terminal for patients suffering from chronic diseases, provides an active link to the caregiver to transmit health status information and receive feedback. In such a concept the usability is still limited by the necessity of entering the values via the mobile phone's small keypad. The near field communication technology (NFC), a touch-based wireless interface that became available recently, may improve the usability level of such applications significantly. The focus of this paper is to describe the development of a prototype application based on this technology embedded in a home monitoring system. The feasibility and usability of this approach are evaluated and compared with concepts used in previous approaches. The high quantifier with respect to overall usability indicates that NFC may be the technology of choice for some tasks in home monitoring applications."

Telecardiology entails the use of advanced communication technologies to transmit the prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to offsite cardiologists for early triage to the cath lab; which has been shown to dramatically reduce door-to-balloon time and total mortality. However, hospitals often find adopting ECG transmission technologies very challenging. The current review identifies seven major technical challenges of prehospital ECG transmission, including: paramedics inconvenience and transport delay; signal noise and interpretation errors; equipment malfunction and transmission failure; reliability of mobile phone networks; lack of compliance with the standards of digital ECG formats; poor integration with electronic medical records; and costly hardware and software pre-requisite installation. Current and potential solutions to address each of these technical challenges are discussed in details and include: automated ECG transmission protocols; annotatable waveform-based ECGs; optimal routing solutions; and the use of cloud computing systems rather than vendor-specific processing stations. Nevertheless, strategies to monitor transmission effectiveness and patient outcomes are essential to sustain initial gains of implementing ECG transmission technologies."

The main outcomes were change in comfort level on each domain (recoded as binary measures) and an overall change score (sum of individual measures). Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess whether sociodemographics, risk factors, and VDOT perceptions were associated with change of comfort measures.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among 120 participants with complete data, mean age was 39.8 years (SD 14.8, range 18-87 years), 46.7% (56/120) were female, and 76.7% (92/120) were foreign born.

Additional research involving participants with lower baseline mobile phone experience is needed. An implication of these findings is that as patients begin to use mHealth apps for one health condition, they could acquire skills and confidence to more quickly adapt to using mHealth apps for other conditions."

There is a limited but growing body of evidence suggesting that mobile eHealth behavioral interventions, if properly designed, may be effective in promoting and sustaining successful weight loss and weight maintenance behavior changes. This paper reviews the current literature on the successes and failures of public health, provider-administered, and self-managed behavioral health interventions for weight loss. The prevailing theories of health behavior change are discussed from the perspective of how this knowledge can serve as an evidence base to inform the design of mobile eHealth weight loss interventions. Tailored informational interventions, which, in recent years, have proven to be the most effective form of conventional health behavior intervention for weight loss, are discussed. Lessons learned from the success of conventional tailored informational interventions and the early successes of desktop computer-assisted self-help weight management interventions are presented, as are design principles suggested by Social Cognitive Theory and the Social Marketing Model. Relevant computing and communications technology convergence trends are also discussed. The recent trends in rapid advancement, convergence, and public adoption of Web-enabled cellular telephone and wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) devices provide timely opportunities to deliver the mass customization capabilities, reach, and interactivity required for the development, administration, and adoption of effective population-level eHealth tailored informational interventions for obesity."

In BAN applications, due to the dynamic nature of human activity, the off-body BAN channel can be prone to deep fading caused by body shadowing and multipath fading. Using this knowledge, we present some novel practical adaptive power control protocols based on the channel deviation to simultaneously prolong the lifetime of wearable devices and reduce outage probability. The proposed schemes are both flexible and relatively simple to implement on hardware platforms with constrained resources making them inherently suitable for BAN applications. We present the key algorithm parameters used to dynamically respond to the channel variation. This allows the algorithms to achieve a better energy efficiency and signal reliability in everyday usage scenarios such as those in which a person undertakes many different activities (e.g., sitting, walking, standing, etc.). We also profile their performance against traditional, optimal, and other existing schemes for which it is demonstrated that not only does the outage probability reduce significantly, but the proposed algorithms also save up to average transmit power compared to the competing schemes."

            "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      To review the evidence supporting the use of mobile health (mHealth) apps to improve resistant hypertension self-assessment, treatment and control.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      mHealth apps have been used to directly measure blood pressure (BP) levels, either using the oscillometric method with automated inflatable cuffs or using pulse wave signals detected by smartphone technology without the need for cuffs. These app-based BP monitors tend to over or underestimate BP levels when compared to a gold standard aneroid sphygmomanometer. However, the differences in BP measurements are within the acceptable range of 5 mmHg pre-defined by the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol Revision 2010. mHealth apps are also used as tools to support physicians in improving hypertension treatment. App-based clinical decision support systems are innovative solutions, in which patient information is entered in the app and management algorithms provide recommendations for hypertension treatment. The use of these apps has been shown to be feasible and easily integrated into the workflow of healthcare professionals, and, therefore particularly useful in resource-limited settings. In addition, apps can be used to improve hypertension control by facilitating regular BP monitoring, communication between patients and health professionals, and patient education; as well as by reinforcing behaviours through reminders, including medication-taking and appointment reminders. Several studies provided evidence supporting the use of apps for hypertension control. Although some of the results are promising, there is still limited evidence on the benefits of using such mHealth tools, as these studies are relatively small and with a short-term duration. Recent research has shown that mHealth apps can be beneficial in terms of improving hypertension self-assessment, treatment and control, being especially useful to help differentiate and manage true and pseudo-resistant hypertension. However, future research, including large-scale randomised clinical trials with user-centred design, is crucial to further evaluate the potential scalability and effectiveness of such mHealth apps in the resistant hypertension context."

Conceptualization, including theoretical and technical aspects, was undertaken by experts. For the formative component, focus groups and interviews with cardiac patients were conducted to discuss their perceptions of a mHealth CR program. A general inductive thematic approach identified common themes. A preliminary library of text and video messages were then developed. Participants were recruited from CR education sessions to pre-test and provide feedback on the content using an online survey. Common responses were extracted and compiled. An iterative process was used to refine content prior to pilot testing and conduct of a randomized controlled trial.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      38 CR patients and 3 CR nurses participated in the formative research and 20 CR patients participated in the content pre-testing. Participants perceived the mHealth program as an effective approach to inform and motivate patients to exercise. For the qualitative study, 100% (n = 41) of participants thought it to be a good idea, and 11% of participants felt it might not be useful for them, but would be for others. Of the 20 participants who completed the online survey, 17 out of 20 (85%) stated they would sign up to a program where they could receive information by video messages on a website, and 12 out of 20 (60%) showed interest in a texting program. Some older CR patients viewed technology as a potential barrier as they were unfamiliar with text messaging or did not have mobile phones.

Health-care providers can remotely deliver health services to this patient population using information and communication technology, also known as home telehealth. Home telehealth may be classified into two subtypes: home telemonitoring (HTM) and telephone support (TS). The research objective was to systematically review the literature and perform meta-analyses to assess the potential benefits of home telehealth compared with usual care (UC) for patients with diabetes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An electronic literature search was conducted to identify studies on home telehealth and patients with diabetes that were published between 1998 and 2008 using Medline, Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, BIOSIS Previews and EMBASE.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-six studies (n = 5069 patients) on home telehealth for diabetes were selected.

            "abstract": "Future development of electronic health (eHealth) programs (automated Web-based health interventions) will be furthered if program design can be based on the knowledge of eHealth's working mechanisms. A promising and pragmatic method for exploring potential working mechanisms is qualitative interview studies, in which eHealth working mechanisms can be explored through the perspective of the program user. Qualitative interview studies are promising as they are suited for exploring what is yet unknown, building new knowledge, and constructing theory. They are also pragmatic, as the development of eHealth programs often entails user interviews for applied purposes (eg, getting feedback for program improvement or identifying barriers for implementation). By capitalizing on these existing (applied) user interviews to also pursue (basic) research questions of how such programs work, the knowledge base of eHealth's working mechanisms can grow quickly. To be useful, such interview studies need to be of sufficient quality, which entails that the interviews should generate enough data of sufficient quality relevant to the research question (ie, rich data). However, getting rich interview data on eHealth working mechanisms can be surprisingly challenging, as several of the authors have experienced. Moreover, when encountering difficulties as we did, there are few places to turn to, there are currently no guidelines for conducting such interview studies in a way that ensure their quality. In this paper, we build on our experience as well as the qualitative literature to address this need, by describing 5 challenges that may arise in such interviews and presenting methodological tools to counteract each challenge. We hope the ideas we offer will spark methodological reflections and provide some options for researchers interested in using qualitative interview studies to explore eHealth's working mechanisms."

Little empirical knowledge is available on prevailing online habits among healthcare personnel and whether gender matters in this context. To investigate health technology-related preferences, we conducted an online survey among a purposive sample of employees and students at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. In total, 905 participants (59.0%, 540/905, females) provided self-reported information on use of online services and mobile health applications (apps) as well as respective gender-specific internal and external apperceptions. Mann-Whitney U tests and binary regression analysis assessed respective gender differences. The structured German questionnaire was validated by principal component analysis. The study found a moderate familiarity with health technologies. As for gender differences, prevailing health app use was high among both male and female participants (39, 141/365, and 42%, 229/540, respectively), with apps for tracking activity and nutrition habits most commonly used. Approval for monitoring health and lifestyle parameters, eHealth and telemedicine knowledge levels, and online health information retrieval predicted health app use, whereas gender did not. Socio-demographic attributes including gender influence not only private online habits of users, but might also affect acceptance of health technologies and their professional use in a clinical setting. Thus, addressing the gender dimension already in concept stages of digital devices and services for healthcare and lifestyle could speed up private and public adoption of health technologies."

In this context, a pulse oximeter-based mobile biotelemetry application is developed. With this application, patients can measure own oxygen saturation and heart rate through Bluetooth pulse oximeter at home. Bluetooth virtual serial port protocol is used to send the test results from pulse oximeter to the smart phone. These data are converted into XML type and transmitted to remote web server database via smart phone. In transmission of data, GPRS, WLAN or 3G can be used. The rule based algorithm is used in the decision making process. By default, the threshold value of oxygen saturation is 80; the heart rate threshold values are 40 and 150 respectively. If the patient's heart rate is out of the threshold values or the oxygen saturation is below the threshold value, an emergency SMS is sent to the doctor. By this way, the directing of an ambulance to the patient can be performed by doctor. The doctor for different patients can change these threshold values. The conversion of the result of the evaluated data to SMS XML template is done on the web server. Another important component of the application is web-based monitoring of pulse oximeter data. The web page provides access to of all patient data, so the doctors can follow their patients and send e-mail related to the evaluation of the disease. In addition, patients can follow own data on this page. Eight patients have become part of the procedure.

Henceforth, IoT Technology has been efficiently adopted in different fields of the healthcare domain. In this paper, a framework for IoT based patient monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is presented to enhance the deliverance of curative services. Though ICUs remained a center of attraction for high quality care among researchers, still number of studies have depicted the vulnerability to a patient's life during ICU stay. The work presented in this study addresses such concerns in terms of efficient monitoring of various events (and anomalies) with temporal associations, followed by time sensitive alert generation procedure. In order to validate the system, it was deployed in 3 ICU room facilities for 30 days in which nearly 81 patients were monitored during their ICU stay. The results obtained after implementation depicts that IoT equipped ICUs are more efficient in monitoring sensitive events as compared to manual monitoring and traditional Tele-ICU monitoring. Moreover, the adopted methodology for alert generation with information presentation further enhances the utility of the system."

These were then reviewed for reference to legal, ethical issues and regulatory issues.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      68 papers met the inclusion criteria. Legal and ethical issues identified were consent, confidentiality, privacy, the doctor-patient relationship, data security, responsibility, record keeping, licensure, continuity of care, quality of care, image quality, concordance, phone stewardship and patient satisfaction.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The literature provides little guidance on how legal and ethical issues and shortcomings of selfie telemedicine should be addressed especially the responsibilities of the patient and physician for unsolicited requests. Nor does it provide advice on how records are to be kept, or how images and information stored and sent to and from mobile phones or computers are to be managed. The new issues that arise need to be addressed."

Comparable studies were included in a random-effects meta-analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Of 8593 unique references screened after de-duplication, 15 research articles and two conference abstracts met inclusion criteria, including 12 intervention and three observational studies. Only two studies were graded at low risk of bias. Only one study demonstrated an improvement in morbidity or mortality, specifically decreased risk of perinatal death in children of mothers who received SMS support during pregnancy, compared with routine prenatal care. Meta-analysis of three studies on infant feeding showed that prenatal interventions using SMS/cell phone (vs routine care) improved rates of breastfeeding (BF) within one hour after birth (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-2.75, I(2) = 80.9%) and exclusive BF for three/four months (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.26-2.50, I(2) = 52.8%) and for six months (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.46-3.68, I(2) = 0.0%). Included studies encompassed interventions designed for health information delivery (n = 6); reminders (n = 3); communication (n = 2); data collection (n = 2); test result turnaround (n = 2); peer group support (n = 2) and psychological intervention (n = 1).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Most studies of mHealth for MNCH in LMIC are of poor methodological quality and few have evaluated impacts on patient outcomes. Improvements in intermediate outcomes have nevertheless been reported in many studies and there is modest evidence that interventions delivered via SMS messaging can improve infant feeding. Ambiguous descriptions of interventions and their mechanisms of impact present difficulties for interpretation and replication. Rigorous studies with potential to offer clearer evidence are underway."

Because of the explosive growth in this field, it is of interest to examine the design, development and efficacy of various interventions as research becomes available. This systematic review examines current use of mHealth technologies in the prevention or treatment of pediatric obesity to catalogue the types of technologies utilized and the impact of mHealth to improve obesity-related outcomes in youth. Of the 4021 articles that were identified, 41 articles met inclusion criteria. Seventeen intervention studies incorporated mHealth as the primary or supplementary treatment. The remaining articles were in the beginning stages of research development and most often described moderate-to-high usability, feasibility and acceptability. Although few effects were observed on outcomes such as body mass index, increases in physical activity, self-reported breakfast and fruit and vegetable consumption, adherence to treatment, and self-monitoring were observed. Findings from this review suggest that mHealth approaches are feasible and acceptable tools in the prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity. The large heterogeneity in research designs highlights the need for more agile scientific processes that can keep up with the speed of technology development."

With approximately 5 billion mobile phone users globally, opportunities for mobile technologies to play a formal role in health services, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, are increasingly being recognized. mHealth can also support the performance of health care workers by the dissemination of clinical updates, learning materials, and reminders, particularly in underserved rural locations in low- and middle-income countries where community health workers deliver integrated community case management to children sick with diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Our aim was to conduct a thematic review of how mHealth projects have approached the intersection of cellular technology and public health in low- and middle-income countries and identify the promising practices and experiences learned, as well as novel and innovative approaches of how mHealth can support community health workers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this review, 6 themes of mHealth initiatives were examined using information from peer-reviewed journals, websites, and key reports. Primary mHealth technologies reviewed included mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones, patient monitoring devices, and mobile telemedicine devices. We examined how these tools could be used for education and awareness, data access, and for strengthening health information systems. We also considered how mHealth may support patient monitoring, clinical decision making, and tracking of drugs and supplies. Lessons from mHealth trials and studies were summarized, focusing on low- and middle-income countries and community health workers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The review revealed that there are very few formal outcome evaluations of mHealth in low-income countries. Although there is vast documentation of project process evaluations, there are few studies demonstrating an impact on clinical outcomes. There is also a lack of mHealth applications and services operating at scale in low- and middle-income countries. The most commonly documented use of mHealth was 1-way text-message and phone reminders to encourage follow-up appointments, healthy behaviors, and data gathering. Innovative mHealth applications for community health workers include the use of mobile phones as job aides, clinical decision support tools, and for data submission and instant feedback on performance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      With partnerships forming between governments, technologists, non-governmental organizations, academia, and industry, there is great potential to improve health services delivery by using mHealth in low- and middle-income countries. As with many other health improvement projects, a key challenge is moving mHealth approaches from pilot projects to national scalable programs while properly engaging health workers and communities in the process. By harnessing the increasing presence of mobile phones among diverse populations, there is promising evidence to suggest that mHealth can be used to deliver increased and enhanced health care services to individuals and communities, while helping to strengthen health systems."

Establishing a proper strategy of actuation on the home environment can require complex computational tasks on the sensed data. This is the case of activity recognition, which consists in retrieving high-level knowledge about what occurs in the home environment and about the behaviour of the inhabitants. The inherent complexity of this application domain asks for tools able to properly support the design and implementation phases. This paper proposes a framework for the design and implementation of smart home applications focused on activity recognition in home environments. The framework mainly relies on the Cloud-assisted Agent-based Smart home Environment (CASE) architecture offering basic abstraction entities which easily allow to design and implement Smart Home applications. CASE is a three layered architecture which exploits the distributed multi-agent paradigm and the cloud technology for offering analytics services. Details about how to implement activity recognition onto the CASE architecture are supplied focusing on the low-level technological issues as well as the algorithms and the methodologies useful for the activity recognition.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Technological advancements, together with the decrease in both price and size of a large variety of sensors, has expanded the role and capabilities of regular mobile phones, turning them into powerful yet ubiquitous monitoring systems. At present, smartphones have the potential to continuously collect information about the users, monitor their activities and behaviors in real time, and provide them with feedback and recommendations.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This systematic review aimed to identify recent scientific studies that explored the passive use of smartphones for generating health- and well-being-related outcomes. In addition, it explores users' engagement and possible challenges in using such self-monitoring systems.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review was conducted, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, to identify recent publications that explore the use of smartphones as ubiquitous health monitoring systems. We ran reproducible search queries on PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus online databases and aimed to find answers to the following questions: (1) What is the study focus of the selected papers? (2) What smartphone sensing technologies and data are used to gather health-related input? (3) How are the developed systems validated? and (4) What are the limitations and challenges when using such sensing systems?\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our bibliographic research returned 7404 unique publications. Of these, 118 met the predefined inclusion criteria, which considered publication dates from 2014 onward, English language, and relevance for the topic of this review. The selected papers highlight that smartphones are already being used in multiple health-related scenarios. Of those, physical activity (29.6%; 35/118) and mental health (27.9; 33/118) are 2 of the most studied applications. Accelerometers (57.7%; 67/118) and global positioning systems (GPS; 40.6%; 48/118) are 2 of the most used sensors in smartphones for collecting data from which the health status or well-being of its users can be inferred.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      One relevant outcome of this systematic review is that although smartphones present many advantages for the passive monitoring of users' health and well-being, there is a lack of correlation between smartphone-generated outcomes and clinical knowledge. Moreover, user engagement and motivation are not always modeled as prerequisites, which directly affects user adherence and full validation of such systems."

            "abstract": "A long-term care insurance law for elderly persons was put in force two years ago in Japan. The Home Helpers, who are employed by hospitals, care companies or the welfare office, provide home welfare and care services for the elderly, such as cooking, bathing, washing, cleaning, shopping, etc. We developed a web-based home welfare and care services support system using wireless Internet mobile phones and Internet client computers, which employs a pen type image sensor. The pen type image sensor is used by the elderly people as the entry device for their care requests. The client computer sends the requests to the server computer in the Home Helper central office, and then the server computer automatically transfers them to the Home Helper's mobile phone. This newly-developed home welfare and care services support system is easily operated by elderly persons and enables Homes Helpers to save a significant amount of time and extra travel."

Pediatric patients with persistent asthma were provided with home computers and Internet access and monitored biweekly over the Internet. All patients were seen in the pediatric clinic at 0, 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Half of the patients received asthma education in person and half via an interactive Web site. Adherence measures were assessed by therapeutic and diagnostic monitoring. Therapeutic monitoring included digital videos of patients using their controller medication inhaler. Diagnostic monitoring included an asthma symptom diary and a video of peak flow meter use. Videos were submitted electronically twice a week by using in-home telemonitoring with store-and-forward technology. Feedback was provided electronically to each patient. Disease control was assessed by examining quality of life, utilization of services, rescue-therapy use, symptom control, satisfaction with home telemonitoring, and retention of asthma knowledge. Patients were randomly assigned to an asthma education group (Internet versus office), and the data were analyzed by comparing results for study days 0-90 and 91-180. Ten children participated. A total of 321 videos of inhaler use and 309 videos of peak flow meter use were submitted. Inhaler technique scores improved significantly in the second study period. Submission of diagnostic monitoring videos and asthma diary entries decreased significantly. Peak flow values as a percentage of personal best values increased significantly. Overall, there was no change in quality of life reported by patients. However, the caregivers in the virtual-education group reported an increase in the patients' quality-of-life survey scores. Emergency department visits and hospital admissions for asthma were avoided. Rescue therapy was infrequent. A high rate of satisfaction with home telemonitoring was reported. Internet-based, store-and-forward video assessment of children's use of asthma medications and monitoring tools in their homes appeared effective and well accepted."

'Early signs' have been used to predict relapse, in the hope of prevention or mitigation, with moderate sensitivity and specificity. We investigated the feasibility and validity of adding 'basic symptoms' to conventional early signs and monitoring these using a smartphone app.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Individuals (n = 18) experiencing a relapse within the past year were asked to use a smartphone app ('ExPRESS') weekly for six months to report early signs, basic symptoms and psychotic symptoms.

There was excellent agreement between telephone call and face-to-face assessed psychotic symptoms. The primary relapse definition, based on telephone assessment and casenotes, compared well with a casenote-only definition but had better specificity. Mixed-effects models provided preliminary evidence of concurrent and predictive validity: early signs and basic symptoms were associated with most app-assessed psychotic symptom variables the same week and with a number of psychotic symptoms variables three weeks later; adding basic symptoms to early signs improved model fit in most of these cases.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This is the first study to test a smartphone app for monitoring early signs and basic symptoms as putative relapse predictors.

            "abstract": "Modern healthcare systems are undergoing a paradigm shift from in-hospital care to in-home monitoring, leveraging the emerging technologies in the area of bio-sensing, wireless communication, mobile computing, and artificial intelligence. In-home monitoring promises to significantly reduce healthcare spending by preventing unnecessary hospital admissions and visits to healthcare professionals. Most of the in-home monitoring systems, proposed in the literature, focus on monitoring a set of specific vital signs. However, from the perspective of caregivers it is infeasible to maintain a collection of specialized monitoring systems. In this paper, we view the problem of in-home monitoring from the perspective of caregivers and present a framework that supports various monitoring capabilities while making the complexity transparent to the end users. The essential idea of the framework is to define a 'general purpose architecture' where the system specifies a particular protocol for communication and makes it public. Then any bio-sensing system can communicate with the system as long as it conforms to the protocol. We then argue that as the system grows in terms of number of patients and bio-sensing systems, artificial intelligence technologies need to be employed for patients' risk assessment, prioritization, and recommendation. Finally, we present an initial prototype of the system designed according to the proposed framework."

At present, mobile healthcare technologies and patient care are precipitously evolving and may serve as a resource to enhance communication between the healthcare provider and patient. A mobile telephone text message (short message service [SMS]) intervention for abdominal surgical patients may foster effective education (communication) and timely self-reported physical assessment in the home environment hence preventing deleterious outcomes. The aim of this research proposal is to identify the feasibility of using a SMS intervention via smart phones to improve health outcomes via timely communication, reach large numbers of at-risk surgical patients and, establish and sustain uniform protocols in a cost-efficient manner."

However, attempts to systematically map the entirety of the research field are lacking. This gap can be filled with a bibliometric study, where publication-specific data such as citations, journals, authors, and keywords are used to provide a systematic overview of a specific field. Such analyses will help researchers better position their work.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this review was to use bibliometric data to provide an overview of the eHealth and mHealth research field related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was searched to retrieve all existing and highly cited (as defined by WoS) physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet related eHealth and mHealth research papers published in English between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016. Retrieved titles were screened for eligibility, using the abstract and full-text where needed. We described publication trends over time, which included journals, authors, and countries of eligible papers, as well as their keywords and subject categories. Citations of eligible papers were compared with those expected based on published data. Additionally, we described highly-cited papers of the field (ie, top ranked 1%).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The search identified 4805 hits, of which 1712 (including 42 highly-cited papers) were included in the analyses. Publication output increased on an average of 26% per year since 2000, with 49.00% (839/1712) of papers being published between 2014 and 2016. Overall and throughout the years, eHealth and mHealth papers related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet received more citations than expected compared with papers in the same WoS subject categories. The Journal of Medical Internet Research published most papers in the field (9.58%, 164/1712). Most papers originated from high-income countries (96.90%, 1659/1717), in particular the United States (48.83%, 836/1712). Most papers were trials and studied physical activity. Beginning in 2013, research on Generation 2 technologies (eg, smartphones, wearables) sharply increased, while research on Generation 1 (eg, text messages) technologies increased at a reduced pace. Reviews accounted for 20 of the 42 highly-cited papers (n=19 systematic reviews). Social media, smartphone apps, and wearable activity trackers used to encourage physical activity, less sedentary behavior, and/or healthy eating were the focus of 14 highly-cited papers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study highlighted the rapid growth of the eHealth and mHealth physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet research field, emphasized the sizeable contribution of research from high-income countries, and pointed to the increased research interest in Generation 2 technologies.

            "abstract": "Supporting self management of chronic disease in collaboration with primary healthcare has been a national priority in order to mitigate the emerging disease burden on the already strained healthcare system. However, in practice, the uptake of self-management programs and compliance with clinical guidelines remain poor. Time constraints due to work commitments and lack of efficient monitoring tools have been the major barrier to the uptake and compliance. In this paper, we present a newly integrated mobile health system with a clinical chronic disease management network called cdmNet, which has already been validated to facilitate General Practitioners (GPs) to provide collaborative disease management services. The newly integrated solution takes advantage of the latest mobile web and wireless Bluetooth communication techniques to enable patients to record health data entries through ubiquitous mobile phones, and allows the data to be simultaneously shared by multidisciplinary care teams. This integration would enable patients to self-manage their chronic disease conditions in collaboration with GPs and hence, improve the uptake and compliance. Additionally, the proposed integration will provide a useful framework encouraging the translation of innovative mobile health technologies into highly regulated healthcare systems."

It aims to answer several emerging problems in health services, including the increasing number of chronic diseases, high costs on national health services, and the need to provide direct access to health services, regardless of time and place. mHealth systems include the use of mobile devices and apps that interact with patients and caretakers. However, mobile devices present several constraints, such as processor, energy, and storage resource limitations. The constant mobility and often-required Internet connectivity also exposes and compromises the privacy and confidentiality of health information.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This paper presents a proposal, construction, performance evaluation, and validation of a data encryption solution for mobile health apps (DE4MHA), considering a novel and early-proposed cooperation strategy. The goal was to present a robust solution based on encryption algorithms that guarantee the best confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of users health information. In this paper, we presented, explained, evaluated the performance, and discussed the cooperation mechanisms and the proposed encryption solution for mHealth apps.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      First, we designed and deployed the DE4MHA. Then two studies were performed: (1) study and comparison of symmetric and asymmetric encryption/decryption algorithms in an mHealth app under a cooperation environment, and (2) performance evaluation of the DE4MHA. Its performance was evaluated through a prototype using an mHealth app for obesity prevention and cares, called SapoFit. We then conducted an evaluation study of the mHealth app with cooperation mechanisms and the DE4MHA using real users and a real cooperation scenario. In 5 days, 5 different groups of 7 students selected randomly agreed to use and experiment the SapoFit app using the 7 devices available for trials.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 35 users of SapoFit that participated in this study. The performance evaluation of the app was done using 7 real mobile devices in 5 different days. The results showed that confidentiality and protection of the users' health information was guaranteed and SapoFit users were able to use the mHealth app with satisfactory quality. Results also showed that the app with the DE4MHA presented nearly the same results as the app without the DE4MHA. The performance evaluation results considered the probability that a request was successfully answered as a function of the number of uncooperative nodes in the network. The service delivery probability decreased with the increase of uncooperative mobile nodes. Using DE4MHA, it was observed that performance presented a slightly worse result. The service average was also slightly worse but practically insignificantly different than with DE4MHA, being considered negligible.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This paper proposed a data encryption solution for mobile health apps, called DE4MHA. The data encryption algorithm DE4MHA with cooperation mechanisms in mobile health allow users to safely obtain health information with the data being carried securely. These security mechanisms did not deteriorate the overall network performance and the app, maintaining similar performance levels as without the encryption. More importantly, it offers a robust and reliable increase of privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of their health information. Although it was experimented on a specific mHealth app, SapoFit, both DE4MHA and the cooperation strategy can be deployed in other mHealth apps."

The Internet constituted the highest usage rate as a source of information about malignant diseases (74.3%, 162/218) regardless of age (P<.001). With regard to the preferences on how patients would like to use ICTs to receive information about diseases, WhatsApp (66.5%, 145/218) and short message service (SMS) text messaging (61.0%, 133/218) were widely reported as interesting communication channels. Similarly, WhatsApp (72.0%, 157/218) followed by SMS (63.8%, 139/218) were reported as the preferred ICTs through which patients would like to ask physicians about diseases. Adjusted regression analysis showed that patients aged between 40 and 64 years were more likely to be interested in receiving information through SMS (odds ratio, OR 5.09, 95% CI 1.92-13.32), as well as for asking questions to physicians through this same media (OR 9.78, CI 3.45-27.67) than the oldest group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      WhatsApp, SMS, and email are effective and widely used ICTs that can promote communication between cancer patients and physicians. According to age range, new ICTs such as Facebook are still emerging. Future studies should investigate how to develop and promote ICT-based resources more effectively to engage the outcomes of cancer patients. The widespread use of ICTs narrows the gap between cancer patients with restricted socioeconomic conditions and those with wealth and easily available technological means, thereby opening up new possibilities in low-income countries."

To assist patients with CVDs in recovering from cardiac events and mediating cardiac risk factors, a home based cardiac rehabilitation program, known as the Care Assessment Platform (CAP), was developed. In the CAP program, patients are required to manually enter health information into their mobile phones on a daily basis. The manual operation is often subject to human errors and is inconvenient for some elderly patients. To improve this, an automated wireless solution has been desired. The objectives of this paper are to investigate the feasibility of implementing the newly released Bluetooth 4.0 (BT4.0) for the CAP program, and practically evaluate BT4.0 communications between a developed mobile application and some emulated healthcare devices. The study demonstrated that BT4.0 addresses usability, interoperability and security for healthcare applications, reduces the power consumption in wireless communication, and improves the flexibility of interface for software development. This evaluation study provides an essential mobile BT4.0 framework to incorporate a large range of healthcare devices for clinical assessment and intervention in the CAP program, and hence it is useful for similar development and research work of other mobile healthcare solutions."

            "abstract": "The current advances in cloud-based services have significantly enhanced individual satisfaction in numerous modern life areas. Particularly, the recent spectacular innovations in the wireless body area networks (WBAN) domain have made e-Care services rise as a promising application field, which definitely improves the quality of the medical system. However, the forwarded data from the limited connectivity range of WBAN via a smart device (e.g., smartphone) to the application provider (AP) should be secured from an unapproved access and alteration (attacker) that could prompt catastrophic consequences. Therefore, several schemes have been proposed to guarantee data integrity and privacy during their transmission between the client/controller (C) and the AP. Thereby, numerous effective cryptosystem solutions based on a bilinear pairing approach are available in the literature to address the mentioned security issues. Unfortunately, the related solution presents security shortcomings, where AP can with ease impersonate a given C. Hence, this existing scheme cannot fully guarantee C's data privacy and integrity. Therefore, we propose our contribution to address this data security issue (impersonation) through a secured and efficient remote batch authentication scheme that genuinely ascertains the identity of C and AP. Practically, the proposed cryptosystem is based on an efficient combination of elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) and bilinear pairing schemes. Furthermore, our proposed solution reduces the communication and computational costs by providing an efficient data aggregation and batch authentication for limited device's resources in WBAN. These additional features (data aggregation and batch authentication) are the core improvements of our scheme that have great merit for limited energy environments like WBAN."

            "abstract": "An amalgamated concept of Internet of m-health Things (m-IoT) has been introduced recently and defined as a new concept that matches the functionalities of m-health and IoT for a new and innovative future (4G health) applications. It is well know that diabetes is a major chronic disease problem worldwide with major economic and social impact. To-date there have not been any studies that address the potential of m-IoT for non-invasive glucose level sensing with advanced opto-physiological assessment technique and diabetes management. In this paper we address the potential benefits of using m-IoT in non-invasive glucose level sensing and the potential m-IoT based architecture for diabetes management. We expect to achieve intelligent identification and management in a heterogeneous connectivity environment from the mobile healthcare perspective. Furthermore this technology will enable new communication connectivity routes between mobile patients and care services through innovative IP based networking architectures."

            "abstract": "## PURPOSE\nThere is growing interest to enhance symptom monitoring during routine cancer care using patient-reported outcomes, but evidence of impact on clinical outcomes is limited.\n## METHODS\nWe randomly assigned patients receiving routine outpatient chemotherapy for advanced solid tumors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to report 12 common symptoms via tablet computers or to receive usual care consisting of symptom monitoring at the discretion of clinicians. Those with home computers received weekly e-mail prompts to report between visits. Treating physicians received symptom printouts at visits, and nurses received e-mail alerts when participants reported severe or worsening symptoms. The primary outcome was change in health-related quality of life (HRQL) at 6 months compared with baseline, measured by the EuroQol EQ-5D Index. Secondary endpoints included emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and survival.\n## RESULTS\nAmong 766 patients allocated, HRQL improved among more participants in the intervention group than usual care (34% v 18%) and worsened among fewer (38% v 53%; P < .001). Overall, mean HRQL declined by less in the intervention group than usual care (1.4- v 7.1-point drop; P < .001). Patients receiving intervention were less frequently admitted to the ER (34% v 41%; P = .02) or hospitalized (45% v 49%; P = .08) and remained on chemotherapy longer (mean, 8.2 v 6.3 months; P = .002). Although 75% of the intervention group was alive at 1 year, 69% with usual care survived the year (P = .05), with differences also seen in quality-adjusted survival (mean of 8.7 v. 8.0 months; P = .004). Benefits were greater for participants lacking prior computer experience. Most patients receiving intervention (63%) reported severe symptoms during the study. Nurses frequently initiated clinical actions in response to e-mail alerts.\n## CONCLUSION\nClinical benefits were associated with symptom self-reporting during cancer care.\n"

            "abstract": "Recently, smart mobile devices and wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, third generation (3G), and long-term evolution (LTE) have been rapidly deployed. Many smart mobile device users can access the Internet wirelessly, which has increased mobile traffic. In 2014, more than half of the mobile traffic around the world was devoted to satisfying the increased demand for the video streaming. In this paper, we propose a scalable video streaming relay scheme. Because many collisions degrade the scalability of video streaming, we first separate networks to prevent excessive contention between devices. In addition, the member device controls the video download rate in order to adapt to video playback. If the data are sufficiently buffered, the member device stops the download. If not, it requests additional video data. We implemented apps to evaluate the proposed scheme and conducted experiments with smart mobile devices. The results showed that our scheme improves the scalability of video streaming in a wireless local area network (WLAN)."

A number of categories emerged from the data. The most significant category indicated that young people often liked to use communication media such as the Internet and mobile phones to communicate because these afforded them control over their interactions. In particular, the data seemed to suggest that participants felt that because some communication media such as email, text messaging and instant messaging can be used asynchronously as well as synchronously, they allow one time to stop and think before giving a response if this is desired, or, alternatively, allowed one to retain the conversational nature of interactions if this is preferred. This gave participants greater control over interactions than they would have if, say, communicating via voice calls using the telephone or face-to-face, which are necessarily synchronous."

            "title": "The behavioral intervention technology model: an integrated conceptual and technological framework for eHealth and mHealth interventions.",
            "abstract": "A growing number of investigators have commented on the lack of models to inform the design of behavioral intervention technologies (BITs). BITs, which include a subset of mHealth and eHealth interventions, employ a broad range of technologies, such as mobile phones, the Web, and sensors, to support users in changing behaviors and cognitions related to health, mental health, and wellness. We propose a model that conceptually defines BITs, from the clinical aim to the technological delivery framework. The BIT model defines both the conceptual and technological architecture of a BIT. Conceptually, a BIT model should answer the questions why, what, how (conceptual and technical), and when. While BITs generally have a larger treatment goal, such goals generally consist of smaller intervention aims (the \"why\") such as promotion or reduction of specific behaviors, and behavior change strategies (the conceptual \"how\"), such as education, goal setting, and monitoring. Behavior change strategies are instantiated with specific intervention components or \"elements\" (the \"what\"). The characteristics of intervention elements may be further defined or modified (the technical \"how\") to meet the needs, capabilities, and preferences of a user. Finally, many BITs require specification of a workflow that defines when an intervention component will be delivered. The BIT model includes a technological framework (BIT-Tech) that can integrate and implement the intervention elements, characteristics, and workflow to deliver the entire BIT to users over time. This implementation may be either predefined or include adaptive systems that can tailor the intervention based on data from the user and the user's environment. The BIT model provides a step towards formalizing the translation of developer aims into intervention components, larger treatments, and methods of delivery in a manner that supports research and communication between investigators on how to design, develop, and deploy BITs."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Mobile technology to promote exercise is effective; however, most evidence is from studies of younger groups in high-income countries. Investigating if short message service (SMS) texting can affect exercise participation in older adults from an upper-middle-income country is important considering the proliferation of mobile phones in developing regions and the increased interest of older adults in using mobile phones.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The main objective was to examine the short- and long-term effects of SMS text messaging on exercise frequency in older adults. Secondary objectives were to investigate how SMS text messages impact study participants' exercise frequency and the effects of the intervention on secondary outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The Malaysian Physical Activity for Health Study (myPAtHS) was a 24-week, 2-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted in urban Malaysia. Participants were recruited via health talks in resident associations and religious facilities. Older Malaysians (aged 55-70 years) who used mobile phones and did not exercise regularly were eligible to participate in the study. Participants randomly allocated to the SMS texting arm received an exercise booklet and 5 weekly SMS text messages over 12 weeks. The content of the SMS text messages was derived from effective behavior change techniques. The non-SMS texting arm participants received only the exercise booklet. Home visits were conducted to collect outcome data: (1) exercise frequency at 12 and 24 weeks, (2) secondary outcome data (exercise self-efficacy, physical activity-related energy expenditure, sitting time, body mass index, grip and leg strength) at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks. Intention-to-treat procedures were applied for data analysis. Semistructured interviews focusing primarily on the SMS text messages and their impact on exercise frequency were conducted at weeks 12 and 24.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 43 participants were randomized into the SMS texting arm (n=22) and the non-SMS texting arm (n=21). Study-unrelated injuries forced 4 participants to discontinue after a few weeks (they were not included in any analyses). Overall retention was 86% (37/43). After 12 weeks, SMS texting arm participants exercised significantly more than non-SMS texting arm participants (mean difference 1.21 times, bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap [BCa] 95% CI 0.18-2.24). Interview analysis revealed that the SMS text messages positively influenced SMS texting arm participants who experienced exercise barriers. They described the SMS text messages as being encouraging, a push, and a reminder. After 24 weeks, there was no significant difference between the research arms (mean difference 0.74, BCa 95% CI -0.30 to 1.76). There were no significant effects for secondary outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study provides evidence that SMS text messaging is effective in promoting exercise in older adults from an upper-middle-income country.

            "abstract": "Telemedicine is the use of telecommunications technology to support health care at a distance. Technological advances have progressively increased the ability of clinicians to care for diverse patient populations in need of skin expertise. Dermatology relies on visual cues that are easily captured by imaging technologies, making it ideally suited for this care model. Moreover, there is a shortage of medical dermatologists in the United States, where skin disorders account for 1 in 8 primary care visits and specialists tend to congregate in urban areas. Even in regions where dermatologic expertise is readily accessible, teledermatology may serve as an alternative that streamlines health care delivery by triaging chief complaints and reducing unnecessary in-person visits. In addition, many patients in the developing world have no access to dermatologic expertise, rendering it possible for teledermatologists to make a significant contribution to patient health outcomes. Teledermatology also affords educational benefits to primary care providers and dermatologists, and enables patients to play a more active role in the health care process by promoting direct communication with dermatologists."

The available conventional methods of monitoring mostly perform off-line analysis and restrict the mobility of subjects within a hospital or a room. Hence, the aim of this paper is to develop a foetal e-health monitoring system using mobile phones and wireless sensors for providing advanced healthcare services in the home environment. The system is tested by recording the real-time Foetal Phonocardiography (fPCG) signals from 15 subjects with different gestational periods. The performance of the developed system is compared with the existing ultrasound based Doppler shift technique, ensuring an overall accuracy of 98% of the developed system. The developed framework is non-invasive, cost-effective and simple enough to be used in home care application. It offers advanced healthcare facilities even to the pregnant women living in rural areas and avoids their unnecessary visits at the healthcare centres."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      This report is a supplement to an earlier evidence report, Telemedicine for the Medicare Population, which was intended to help policymakers weigh the evidence relevant to coverage of telemedicine services under Medicare. That report focused on telemedicine programs and clinical settings that had been used with or were likely to be applied to Medicare beneficiaries. While we prepared that report, it became apparent that there are also telemedicine studies among non-Medicare beneficiaries--e.g., children and pregnant women--that could inform policymakers and provide more comprehensive evidence of the state of the science regarding telemedicine applications. In addition, the first evidence report only partially included a class of telemedicine applications (called self-monitoring/testing telemedicine) in which the beneficiary used a home computer or modern-driven telephone system to either report information or access information and support from Internet resources and indirectly interact with a clinician. Self-monitoring/testing applications in the first report required direct interaction with a clinician. The goal of this report is to systematically review the evidence in the clinical areas of pediatric and obstetric telemedicine as well as home-based telemedicine where there is indirect involvement of the health care professional. (In this report, we will refer to the latter as clinician-indirect home telemedicine.) Specifically, the report summarizes scientific evidence on the diagnostic accuracy, access, clinical outcomes, satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness of services provided by telemedicine technologies for these patient groups. It also identifies gaps in the evidence and makes recommendations for evaluating telemedicine services for these populations in the future. The evidence is clustered according to three categories of telemedicine service defined in our original report: store-and-forward, self-monitoring/testing, and clinician-interactive services. The three clinical practice areas reviewed in this report are defined as follows. The term pediatric applies to any telemedicine study in which the sample consisted wholly or partially of persons aged 18 or younger, including studies with neonatal samples. The term obstetric applies to any telemedicine study in which the sample consisted entirely of women seeking pregnancy-related care. The term clinician-indirect home telemedicine applies to home-based telemedicine (called self-monitoring/testing in our original report) where a telemedicine application used in the home has only indirect involvement by the health care professional. Interactive home telemedicine was applied in this report to all patient populations.\n    \n\n\n          Key questions:\n        \n      \n      The key questions that served as a guide for reviewing the literature in the evaluation of pediatric, obstetric, and clinician-indirect home telemedicine applications were derived by consensus among the evidence-review team based on the analytic framework established for the original evidence report. For the current report, the questions were applied to studies in all three practice areas as a whole group within each of the three categories of telemedicine services: store-and-forward; self-monitoring/testing; and clinician-interactive. The specific key questions were: 1. Does telemedicine result in comparable diagnosis and appropriateness of recommendations for management? 2. Does the availability of telemedicine provide comparable access to care? 3. Does telemedicine result in comparable health outcomes? 4. Does telemedicine result in comparable patient or clinician satisfaction with care? 5. Does telemedicine result in comparable costs of care and/or cost-effectiveness?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched for peer-reviewed literature using several bibliographic databases. In addition, we conducted hand searches of leading telemedicine journals and identified key papers from the reference lists of journal articles. For our original evidence report on telemedicine for the Medicare population, we designed a search to find any publications about telemedicine and used it to search the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and HealthSTAR databases for all years the databases were available. Through this process, we captured studies of pediatric, obstetric, and clinician-indirect home telemedicine; however, they were excluded from the original report since they were outside its scope. For this supplemental report, we reviewed our original search results and identified studies relevant to this report. We identified additional studies from the reference lists of included papers and from hand searching two peer-reviewed telemedicine publications, the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare and Telemedicine Journal. We critically appraised the included studies for each study area and key question and discussed the strengths and limitations of the most important studies at weekly meetings of the research team. We also developed recommendations for research to address telemedicine knowledge gaps. To match these gaps with the capabilities of specific research methods, we classified the telemedicine services according to the type of evidence that would be needed to determine whether the specific goals of covering such services had been met. We emphasized the relationship between the type and level of evidence found in the systematic review of effectiveness and the types of studies that might be funded to address the gaps in knowledge in this growing field of research.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      We identified a total of 28 eligible studies. In the new clinical areas, we found few studies in store-and-forward telemedicine. There is some evidence of comparable diagnosis and management decisions made using store-and-forward telemedicine from the areas of pediatric dental screening, pediatric ophthalmology, and neonatalogy. In self-monitoring/testing telemedicine for the areas of pediatrics, obstetrics, and clinician-indirect home telemedicine, there is evidence that access to care can be improved when patients and families have the opportunity to receive telehealth care at home rather than in-person care in a clinic or hospital. Access is particularly enhanced when the telehealth system enables timely communication between patients or families and care providers that allows self-management and necessary adjustments that may prevent hospitalization. There is some evidence that this form of telemedicine improves health outcomes, but the study sample sizes are usually small, and even when they are not, the treatment effects are small. There is also some evidence for the efficacy of clinician-interactive telemedicine, but the studies do not clearly define which technologies provide benefit or cost-efficiency. Some promising areas for diagnosis include emergency medicine, psychiatry, and cardiology. Most of the studies measuring access to care provide evidence that it is improved. Although none of these studies were randomized controlled trials, they provide some evidence of access improvement over prior conditions. Clinician-interactive telemedicine was the only area for which any cost studies were found. The three cost studies did not adequately demonstrate that telemedicine reduces costs of care (except comparing only selected costs). No study addressed cost-effectiveness.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This supplemental report covering the areas of pediatrics, obstetrics, and indirect-clinician home telemedicine echoes the findings of our initial report for the Medicare domain, which is that while the use of telemedicine is small but growing, the evidence for its efficacy is incomplete. Many of the studies are small and/or methodologically limited, so it cannot be determined whether telemedicine is efficacious. Future studies should focus on the use of telemedicine in conditions where burden of illness and/or barriers to access for care are significant. Use of recent innovations in the design of randomized controlled trials for emerging technologies would lead to higher quality studies. Journals publishing telemedicine evaluation studies must set high standards for methodologic quality so that evidence reports need not rely on studies with marginal methodologies."

Since mobile phones have limited computational resources, existing PC based complex CVD detection algorithms are often unsuitable for wireless telecardiology applications. Moreover, if the existing Electrocardiography (ECG) based CVD detection algorithms are adopted for mobile telecardiology applications, then there will be processing delays due to the computational complexities of the existing algorithms. However, for a CVD affected patient, seconds worth of delay could be fatal, since cardiovascular cell damage is a totally irrecoverable process. This paper proposes a fast and efficient mechanism of CVD detection from ECG signal. Unlike the existing ECG based CVD diagnosis systems that detect CVD anomalies from hundreds of sample points, the proposed mechanism identifies cardiac abnormality from only 5 sample points. Therefore, according to our experiments the proposed mechanism is up to 3 times faster than the existing techniques. Due to less computational burden, the proposed mechanism is ideal for wireless telecardiology applications running on mobile phones."

Within the first layer, real-time remote monitoring studies based on sensor technology for telemedicine application were reviewed and analysed to examine these technologies and provide researchers with a clear vision of security- and privacy-based sensors in the telemedicine area. An extensive search was conducted to find articles about security and privacy issues, review related applications comprehensively and establish the coherent taxonomy of these articles. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases were investigated for articles on mHealth in telemedicine-based sensor. A total of 3064 papers were collected from 2007 to 2017. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the security and privacy of sensor-based telemedicine applications. A total of 19 articles were selected and classified into two categories. The first category, 57.89% (n = 11/19), included survey on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, 42.1% (n = 8/19), included articles contributed to the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. The collected studies improved the essential need to add another taxonomy layer and review the sensor-based smartphone authentication studies. This map matching for both taxonomies was developed for this study to investigate sensor field comprehensively and gain access to novel risks and benefits of the mHealth security in telemedicine application. The literature on sensor-based smartphones in the second layer of our taxonomy was analysed and reviewed. A total of 599 papers were collected from 2007 to 2017. In this layer, we obtained a final set of 81 articles classified into three categories. The first category of the articles [86.41% (n = 70/81)], where sensor-based smartphones were examined by utilising orientation sensors for user authentication, was used. The second category [7.40% (n = 6/81)] included attack articles, which were not intensively included in our literature analysis. The third category [8.64% (n = 7/81)] included 'other' articles. Factors were considered to understand fully the various contextual aspects of the field in published studies. The characteristics included the motivation and challenges related to sensor-based authentication of smartphones encountered by researchers and the recommendations to strengthen this critical area of research. Finally, many studies on the sensor-based smartphone in the second layer have focused on enhancing accurate authentication because sensor-based smartphones require sensors that could authentically secure mHealth."

            "abstract": "Advances in smartphones and wearable biosensors enable real-time psychological, behavioural, and physiological data to be gathered in increasingly precise and unobtrusive ways. Thus, moment-to-moment information about an individual's moods, cognitions, and activities can be collected, in addition to automated data about their whereabouts, behaviour, and physiological states. In this report, we discuss the potential of these new mobile digital technologies to transform mental health research and clinical practice. By drawing on results from the INSIGHT research project, we show how traditional boundaries between research and clinical practice are becoming increasingly blurred and how, in turn, this is leading to exciting new developments in the assessment and management of common mental disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the potential risks and key challenges associated with applying mobile technology to mental health."

In general, physicians were satisfied with Internet-enabled technology, but consensus was lacking regarding whether Internet-enabled technology improved efficiency or made a difference to clinical decision-making. Internet-enabled technology can play an important role in enhancing communication among physicians, but the extent of that benefit is influenced by (1) the impact of Internet-enabled technology on existing work practices, (2) the availability of adequate resources, and (3) the nature of institutional elements, such as privacy legislation."

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of remote monitoring home telehealth on client and provider satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and cost. The project design was a pragmatic evaluation of the technology in a real-world setting at an operational scale rather than a controlled clinical trial. Patients receiving monitoring were selected by the home health agency, and a random sample of other agency clients was selected for comparative purposes. Data were collected on additional costs and benefits associated with home telehealth monitoring. Quantitative and qualitative data suggest that when remote monitoring telehealth technology was utilized in the home-care setting, both clients and providers were very satisfied with services; they felt it was easy to communicate, and that the technology was convenient and user friendly. Clients also felt that home telehealth technology had a very positive impact on the provider-client relationship and improved care. The study also suggests that home care monitoring reduces hospitalizations and decreases personnel expenses. This preliminary study provides evidence as to the value of remote monitoring home telehealth in the delivery of services to home care populations. It also provides evidence as to the positive impact that this form of technology may have on healthcare systems, provider and client satisfaction, and on the relationships that form between providers and clients."

Of the 1,468 documents identified, 1,371 documents were excluded, with the 91 included documents addressing the following: clinical outcomes, 46 documents (enhanced guideline compliance, 5; mortality and length of stay, 28; and feasibility, 13); financial sustainability, 9 documents; and ICU staff workflow and acceptance, 36 documents. We performed qualitative comparative reviews of documents addressing technology, financial sustainability, clinical outcomes, and ICU staff workflow and acceptance.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The Centralized Monitoring tele-ICU Model showed improved mortality and/or length of stay and staff acceptance, particularly in rural or specific patient populations, likely because of the presence of integrated clinical information systems and analytics. However, there are high costs and unclear savings. The Virtual Consultant Model could not be adequately evaluated for effects on clinical outcomes or staff acceptance given minimal data. This model can be both portable and implemented at a lower cost profile but cannot integrate different data streams.

This study is designed to identify the effects of remote home management on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods A comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed in January 2015. The reference listings of the included articles in this review were also manually examined. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the effects of remote home management on patients with CKD were included. Results Eight trials were identified. The results of this study suggest that the quality of life (QOL) enabled by remote home management was higher than typical care in certain dimensions. However, the effects of remote home management on blood pressure (BP) remain inconclusive. The studies that assessed health service utilization demonstrated a significant decrease in hospital readmission, emergency room visits, and number of days in the hospital. Another favorable result of this study is that regardless of their gender, age or nationality, patients tend to comply with remote home management programs and the use of related technologies. Conclusions The available data indicate that remote home management may be a novel and effective disease management strategy for improving CKD patients' QOL and influencing their attitudes and behaviors. And, relatively little is known about BP and cost-effectiveness, so future research should focus on these two aspects for the entire population of patients with CKD."

Overall adherence rates were calculated as the proportion of days patients took weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptom readings over the total number of days they were enrolled in the program up to 1 year. Monthly adherence rates were also calculated as the proportion of days patients took the same 4 readings over each 30-day period following program enrollment. Next, simple and multivariate regressions were performed to determine the influence of time, age, sex, and disease severity on adherence rates. Additional explanatory methods included questionnaires at 6 and 12 months probing patients on the perceived benefits and ease of use of the TM program, an analysis of reasons for patients leaving the program, and semistructured interviews conducted with a purposeful sampling of patients (n=24) with a range of adherence rates and demographics.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall average adherence was 73.6% (SD 25.0) with average adherence rates declining over time at a rate of 1.4% per month (P<.001). The multivariate regressions found no significant effect of sex and disease severity on adherence rates. When grouping patients' ages by decade, age was a significant predictor (P=.04) whereby older patients had higher adherence rates over time. Adherence rates were further explained by patients' perceptions with regard to the themes of (1) performance expectancy (improvements in HF management and peace of mind), (2) effort expectancy (ease of use and technical issues), (3) facilitating conditions (availability of technical support and automated adherence calls), (4) social influence (support from family, friends, and trusted clinicians), and (5) habit (degree to which taking readings became automatic).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The decline in adherence rates over time is consistent with findings from other studies.

This systematic review aims to identify and synthesise the qualitative literature on barriers and facilitators to engagement and recruitment to DHIs to inform future implementation efforts.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus and the ACM Digital Library were searched for English language qualitative studies from 2000 - 2015 that discussed factors affecting engagement and enrolment in a range of DHIs (e.g. 'telemedicine', 'mobile applications', 'personal health record', 'social networking'). Text mining and additional search strategies were used to identify 1,448 records. Two reviewers independently carried out paper screening, quality assessment, data extraction and analysis. Data was analysed using framework synthesis, informed by Normalization Process Theory, and Burden of Treatment Theory helped conceptualise the interpretation of results.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Nineteen publications were included in the review. Four overarching themes that affect patient and public engagement and enrolment in DHIs emerged; 1) personal agency and motivation; 2) personal life and values; 3) the engagement and recruitment approach; and 4) the quality of the DHI. The review also summarises engagement and recruitment strategies used. A preliminary DIgital Health EnGagement MOdel (DIEGO) was developed to highlight the key processes involved. Existing knowledge gaps are identified and a number of recommendations made for future research. Study limitations include English language publications and exclusion of grey literature.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This review summarises and highlights the complexity of digital health engagement and recruitment processes and outlines issues that need to be addressed before patients and the public commit to digital health and it can be implemented effectively. More work is needed to create successful engagement strategies and better quality digital solutions that are personalised where possible and to gain clinical accreditation and endorsement when appropriate. More investment is also needed to improve computer literacy and ensure technologies are accessible and affordable for those who wish to sign up to them.\n    \n\n\n          Systematic review registration:\n        \n      \n      International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42015029846."

The goal of this paper is to review the available evidence and assess the scope of RPM integration into standard practices for care and management of chronic disease in general and, more specifically, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      RPM has been associated with improvements in health outcomes and indicators across a broad range of chronic diseases. However, there is limited data on the effectiveness of RPM in IBD care. From the emerging literature and body of research, we found promising results about the feasibility of integrating RPM in IBD care and RPM's capacity to support IBD improvement in key process and outcome metrics. Concerns regarding privacy and provider acceptability have limited the mass integration of RPM to date. However, with the healthcare industry's move toward value-based population care and the advent of novel payment models for RPM reimbursement, the adoption of RPM into standard IBD care practices will likely increase as the technology continues to improve and become a mainstream tool for healthcare delivery in the near future."

            "abstract": "This report provides a technical overview of a Web-based telemedicine system for monitoring wounds in patients who do not have immediate access to the services of a consulting physician, including patients at home or in long-term-care facilities. Such a system would allow for the easy transmission and access of digital images of a patient's wounds and would allow multiple types of data required for comprehensive management of a patient's condition to be summarized and displayed. A store-and-forward method of data transmission was chosen for this project, rather than real-time videoconferencing, to limit the use of expensive technology and to maximize convenience for both the patient and the consulting physician. Under the store-and-forward technique, a clinician obtains wound data from the patient, then transmits these data to a Web site where the telemedicine physician can view data from multiple patients at his or her convenience."

However, the effects of most available apps have not been scientifically investigated. Within medicine, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the standard method for providing the evidence of effects. However, their rigidity and long time frame may contrast with the field of information technology research. Therefore, a systematic review of methodological challenges in designing and conducting RCTs within mobile health is needed.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This systematic review aimed to (1) identify and describe RCTs investigating the effect of smartphone-based treatment in adult patients with a psychiatric diagnosis, (2) discuss methodological challenges in designing and conducting individual trials, and (3) suggest recommendations for future trials.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic search in English was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE up to August 12, 2019. The search terms were (1) psychiatric disorders in broad term and for specific disorders AND (2) smartphone or app AND (3) RCT. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials electronic health guidelines were used as a template for data extraction. The focus was on trial design, method, and reporting. Only trials having sufficient information on diagnosis and acceptable diagnostic procedures, having a smartphone as a central part of treatment, and using an RCT design were included.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 27 trials comprising 3312 patients within a range of psychiatric diagnoses were included. Among them, 2 trials were concerning drug or alcohol abuse, 3 psychosis, 10 affective disorders, 9 anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder, 1 eating disorder, and 1 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In addition, 1 trial used a cross-diagnostic design, 7 trials included patients with a clinical diagnosis that was subsequently assessed and validated by the researchers, and 11 trials had a sample size above 100. Generally, large between-trial heterogeneity and multiple approaches to patient recruitment, diagnostic procedures, trial design, comparator, outcome measures, and analyses were identified. Only 5 trials published a trial protocol. Furthermore, 1 trial provided information regarding technological updates, and only 18 trials reported on the conflicts of interest. No trial addressed the ethical aspects of using smartphones in treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This first systematic review of the methodological challenges in designing and conducting RCTs investigating smartphone-based treatment in psychiatric patients suggests an increasing number of trials but with a lower quality compared with classic medical RCTs.

            "abstract": "Changes in thoracoabdominal motion are highly prevalent in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Home care services that use telemedicine techniques and Internet-based monitoring have the potential to improve the management of these patients. However, there is no detailed description in the literature of a system for Internet-based monitoring of patients with disturbed thoracoabdominal motion. The purpose of this work was to describe the development of a new telemedicine instrument for Internet-based home monitoring of thoracoabdominal movement. The instrument directly measures changes in the thorax and abdomen circumferences and transfers data through a transmission control protocol∕Internet protocol connection. After the design details are described, the accuracy of the electronic and software processing units of the instrument is evaluated by using electronic signals simulating normal subjects and individuals with thoracoabdominal motion disorders. The results obtained during in vivo studies on normal subjects simulating thoracoabdominal motion disorders showed that this new system is able to detect a reduction in abdominal movement that is associated with abnormal thoracic breathing (p < 0.0001) and the reduction in thoracic movement during abnormal abdominal breathing (p < 0.005). Simulated asynchrony in thoracoabdominal motion was also adequately detected by the system (p < 0.0001). The experimental results obtained for patients with respiratory diseases were in close agreement with the expected values, providing evidence that this instrument can be a useful tool for the evaluation of thoracoabdominal motion. The Internet transmission tests showed that the acquisition and analysis of the thoracoabdominal motion signals can be performed remotely. The user can also receive medical recommendations. The proposed system can be used in a spectrum of telemedicine scenarios, which can reduce the costs of assistance offered to patients with respiratory diseases."

Recently, advances in computer technology have allowed for EMA research to be conducted in a more convenient, automated, and secure manner by administering surveys on participants' telephones and storing the results directly to a central server. The present article introduces TelEMA, an easy-to-use, low-cost telephone assessment platform for clinical and research applications. A single server running TelEMA can be shared among many experimenters, studies, and participants simultaneously. TelEMA routes telephone calls and text messages through a third-party service, so experimenters may conduct studies with no up-front cost or technical expertise. TelEMA provides a secure Web interface for experimenters or clinicians to design studies, enroll participants, monitor compliance, and collate response data from anywhere. Participants complete surveys using their own telephones. Surveys may contain keypress or voice recording questions, and the timing and content of each survey may be randomized and customized. A pilot study was conducted in which individuals used the TelEMA system to complete four randomly timed surveys per day for one week; the surveys assessed state affect and social anxiety. Results indicated that participants found TelEMA easy to use and secure, and compliance rates were on par with other EMA methods using mobile devices. Overall, TelEMA is a practical and robust system that enables fast and inexpensive deployment of EMAs."

Mobile technologies, known as mHealth where they are used in health care, facilitate access and hence communication, however little is known about this area of midwifery practice.\n    \n\n\n          Research question:\n        \n      \n      Which communication modalities are used, and most frequently, by MGP midwives and clients?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A prospective, cross sectional design included a purposive sample of MGP midwives from an Australian tertiary maternity hospital.

Demographic data were also collected.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Details about 1442 midwife-client contacts were obtained. The majority of contact was via text, between the hours of 07:00 and 14:59, with primiparous women, when the primary midwife was on-call. An average of 96 contacts per fortnight occurred.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The majority of contact was between the midwife and their primary clients, reiterating a key tenet of caseload models and confirming mobile technologies as a significant and evolving aspect of practice. The pattern of contact within social (or daytime) hours is reassuring for midwives considering caseload midwifery, who are concerned about the on-call burden. The use of text as the preferred communication modality raises issues regarding data security and retrieval, accountability, confidentiality and text management during off-duty periods. The development of Australian-wide guidelines to inform local policies and best practice is recommended."

We recruited users of the website, slutta.no, an open, free, multi-component Norwegian internet-based smoking cessation program, from May 2010 until October 2012. Enrolled smokers were considered as having completed a time point regardless of their response status if it was 1, 3, 6, or 12 months post cessation. We assessed 7315 participants using the following inclusion criteria: knowledge of the Norwegian language, age 16 years or older, ownership of a Norwegian cell phone, having an email account, current cigarette smoker, willingness to set a cessation date within 14 days (mandatory), and completion of a baseline questionnaire for tailoring algorithms. Altogether, 6137 participants were eligible for the study and 4378 participants (71.33%) provided informed consent to participate in the smoking cessation trial. We calculated the response rates for participants at the completed 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post cessation. For each arm, we conducted an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis for each completed time point. The main outcome was 7-day self-reported point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at the completed 6 months post cessation.

Most studies used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess acceptability of use, barriers to use, changes in healthcare delivery, and improved health outcomes. Few papers included theory explicitly to guide development and evaluation of their mHealth programs. Overall, evidence indicated that mobile technology tools, such as smartphones and tablets, substantially benefit healthcare workers, their patients, and healthcare delivery.

The increasing availability of mobile connectivity needs to be exploited by offering healthcare through a mobile medium, popularly known as mobile health (m-health). It is essential to understand the awareness, perception, and attitude of healthcare providers (HCPs) in deploying m-health. Their outlook on new technologies influences patient adoption. Reports on attitudes regarding healthcare through mobile phones are now confined to views from the recipient.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      This study from August 1 to September 30, 2014 analyzed the views of 592 HCPs (12.3% of all HCPs) in Himachal Pradesh, India.

            "abstract": "## AIM\nRemote follow-up (FU) of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) allows for fewer in-office visits in combination with earlier detection of relevant findings. Its implementation requires investment and reorganization of care. Providers (physicians or hospitals) are unsure about the financial impact. The primary end-point of this randomized prospective multicentre health economic trial was the total FU-related cost for providers, comparing Home Monitoring facilitated FU (HM ON) to regular in-office FU (HM OFF) during the first 2 years after ICD implantation. Also the net financial impact on providers (taking national reimbursement into account) and costs from a healthcare payer perspective were evaluated.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nA total of 312 patients with VVI- or DDD-ICD implants from 17 centres in six EU countries were randomised to HM ON or OFF, of which 303 were eligible for data analysis. For all contacts (in-office, calendar- or alert-triggered web-based review, discussions, calls) time-expenditure was tracked. Country-specific cost parameters were used to convert resource use into monetary values. Remote FU equipment itself was not included in the cost calculations. Given only two patients from Finland (one in each group) a monetary valuation analysis was not performed for Finland. Average age was 62.4 ± 13.1 years, 81% were male, 39% received a DDD system, and 51% had a prophylactic ICD. Resource use with HM ON was clearly different: less FU visits (3.79 ± 1.67 vs. 5.53 ± 2.32; P < 0.001) despite a small increase of unscheduled visits (0.95 ± 1.50 vs. 0.62 ± 1.25; P < 0.005), more non-office-based contacts (1.95 ± 3.29 vs. 1.01 ± 2.64; P < 0.001), more Internet sessions (11.02 ± 15.28 vs. 0.06 ± 0.31; P < 0.001) and more in-clinic discussions (1.84 ± 4.20 vs. 1.28 ± 2.92; P < 0.03), but with numerically fewer hospitalizations (0.67 ± 1.18 vs. 0.85 ± 1.43, P = 0.23) and shorter length-of-stay (6.31 ± 15.5 vs. 8.26 ± 18.6; P = 0.27), although not significant. For the whole study population, the total FU cost for providers was not different for HM ON vs. OFF [mean (95% CI): €204 (169-238) vs. €213 (182-243); range for difference (€-36 to 54), NS]. From a payer perspective, FU-related costs were similar while the total cost per patient (including other physician visits, examinations, and hospitalizations) was numerically (but not significantly) lower. There was no difference in the net financial impact on providers [profit of €408 (327-489) vs. €400 (345-455); range for difference (€-104 to 88), NS], but there was heterogeneity among countries, with less profit for providers in the absence of specific remote FU reimbursement (Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands) and maintained or increased profit in cases where such reimbursement exists (Germany and UK). Quality of life (SF-36) was not different.\n## CONCLUSION\nFor all the patients as a whole, FU-related costs for providers are not different for remote FU vs. purely in-office FU, despite reorganized care. However, disparity in the impact on provider budget among different countries illustrates the need for proper reimbursement to ensure effective remote FU implementation.\n"

            "abstract": "Lowering blood pressure reduces cardiovascular risk, yet hypertension is poorly controlled in diabetic patients. In a pilot study we demonstrated that a home blood pressure telemonitoring system, which provided self-care messages on the smartphone of hypertensive diabetic patients immediately after each reading, improved blood pressure control. Messages were based on care paths defined by running averages of transmitted readings. The present study tests the system's effectiveness in a randomized, controlled trial in diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension. Of 244 subjects screened for eligibility, 110 (45%) were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 55) or control (n = 55) group, and 105 (95.5%) completed the 1-year outcome visit. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure, the primary end point, decreased significantly only in the intervention group by 9.1 ± 15.6 mmHg (SD; P < 0.0001), and the mean between-group difference was 7.1 ± 2.3 mmHg (SE; P < 0.005). Furthermore, 51% of intervention subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of <130/80 mmHg compared with 31% of control subjects (P < 0.05). These improvements were obtained without the use of more or different antihypertensive medications or additional clinic visits to physicians. Providing self-care support did not affect anxiety but worsened depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (baseline, 4.1 ± 3.76; exit, 5.2 ± 4.30; P = 0.014). This study demonstrated that home blood pressure telemonitoring combined with automated self-care support reduced the blood pressure of diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension and improved hypertension control. Home blood pressure monitoring alone had no effect on blood pressure. Promoting patient self-care may have negative psychological effects."

Inexpensive, unobtrusive wireless sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure-sensitive textiles, combined with Internet-based communications and machine-learning algorithms trained to recognize upper- and lower-extremity movements, have begun to fulfill this need. Continuous data from ankle triaxial accelerometers, for example, can be transmitted from the home and community via WiFi or a smartphone to a remote data analysis server. Reports can include the walking speed and duration of every bout of ambulation, spatiotemporal symmetries between the legs, and the type, duration, and energy used during exercise. For daily care, this readily accessible flow of real-world information allows clinicians to monitor the amount and quality of exercise for risk factor management and compliance in the practice of skills. Feedback may motivate better self-management as well as serve home-based rehabilitation efforts. Monitoring patients with chronic diseases and after hospitalization or the start of new medications for a decline in daily activity may help detect medical complications before rehospitalization becomes necessary. For clinical trials, repeated laboratory-quality assessments of key activities in the community, rather than by clinic testing, self-report, and ordinal scales, may reduce the cost and burden of travel, improve recruitment and retention, and capture more reliable, valid, and responsive ratio-scaled outcome measures that are not mere surrogates for changes in daily impairment, disability, and functioning."

            "abstract": "This paper introduces a cost-effective portable teletrauma system that assists health-care centers in providing prehospital trauma care. Simultaneous transmission of a patient's video, medical images, and electrocardiogram signals, which is required throughout the prehospital procedure, is demonstrated over commercially available 3G wireless cellular data service. Moreover, the physician can remotely control the information sent from the patient side. Such a technology will allow a trauma specialist to be virtually present at the remote location and participate in prehospital care, which improves the quality of trauma care and can potentially reduce mortality and morbidity. To alleviate the limited and fluctuant bandwidth barriers of the wireless cellular link, the system adapts to network conditions through media transformations, data prioritization, and application-level congestion control methods. Experimental evaluation of the system prototype over real network conditions, transmitting different media types between the trauma patient and hospital unit, is encouraging. The teletrauma system reported in this paper is the first of its kind and it provides a basis for future enhancements."

Seventy percent of reported chlamydia cases are found in people below 25 years of age, and although its spread could be controlled with proper prevention, young people are more aware of the risks of unwanted pregnancy than their risk of acquiring a STD. Information and Communication Technologies, including, the Internet, social media and/or smartphones, should be valued for sexual health promotion for their potential to engage young audiences. And in these media, avatars guarantee anonymity to users when handling sensitive information. The main objective of this project is to achieve that North Norwegian youngsters become more aware of STDs through the use of popular technologies among young people.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A Virtual Clinic for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (VCSTD) will be developed. The VCSTD will provide early guidance and reliable information sources concerning reproductive health, delivered in a novel and innovative way to the younger population. The VCSTD consists of an \"avatar\" supported intervention in a serious gaming and e-learning environment, which will bypass direct physical access (in person) to reliable medical information, as well as allowing the youngsters to share that information in social media, and thus helping the VCSTD to be disseminated to more people.Data analyses will be conducted on publically available health data relevant to STDs in Troms and Finnmark, like the absolute number of chlamydia tests, the amount of emergency contraception medication sold, and the number of abortions. Also, usage data of the system and experiences of usefulness will be explored through participants' voluntary responses to a feedback form available in the VCSTD.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study will examine the usefulness of an online public health intervention that aims to promote healthy sexual practices among North-Norwegian youngsters.

This study evaluated whether early automated fluid status alert notification via telemedicine improves outcome in HF patients.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients recently implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy were eligible if one of three conditions was met: prior HF hospitalization, recent diuretic treatment, or recent brain natriuretic peptide increase. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to have fluid status alerts automatically transmitted as inaudible text message alerts to the responsible physician or to receive standard care (no alerts). In the intervention arm, following a telemedicine alert, a protocol-specified algorithm with remote review of device data and telephone contact was prescribed to assess symptoms and initiate treatment. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and cardiovascular hospitalization. We followed 1002 patients for an average of 1.9 years. The primary endpoint occurred in 227 patients (45.0%) in the intervention arm and 239 patients (48.1%) in the control arm [hazard ratio, HR, 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-1.04; P = 0.13]. There were 59 (11.7%) deaths in the intervention arm and 63 (12.7%) in the control arm (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62-1.28; P = 0.52). Twenty-four per cent of alerts were not transmitted and 30% were followed by a medical intervention.\n## CONCLUSION\nAmong ICD patients with advanced HF, fluid status telemedicine alerts did not significantly improve outcomes. Adherence to treatment protocols by physicians and patients might be challenge for further developments in the telemedicine field.\n"

However, there is limited evidence attesting to advantageous ways of designing mHealth treatments in a manner that is apt to be well-received by emerging adult college students at large, and gender, racial, and ethnic subgroups in particular. To address these research gaps, this exploratory study examined general trends, and gender (male, female), racial (White, Black), and ethnic (Latino, non-Latino) differences, in emerging adult college students' mobile technology ownership and phone plan characteristics, technology use behaviors, and mHealth text message preferences.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants included 1,371 college students aged 18 to 25 (20.54±1.80) years. Between July 2015 and April 2016, students from three universities in the Mid-Atlantic United States completed an online survey assessing technology use. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were run to answer primary study questions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Results suggest that students frequently engage with mobile devices and inherent features. Overall, nearly all (99.5%) students owned smartphones, 89.5% had long-term phone contracts, 94.6% had unlimited texting, and 38.6% reported having unlimited data plans. Further, 96.8% reported texting, 92.0% accessing email, 97.3% accessing the internet, and 97.2% using apps on their mobile devices at least once per day. When asked about the types of text messages they would prefer to receive in the context of mHealth interventions, most students preferred messages that did not contain textese, were longer vs. shorter, contained a single vs. multiple exclamation marks, had a smiley face emoticon, used capitalization for emphatic purposes, contained a statement vs. a question, were polite in tone, and were non-directive.

The provision of services for prostate cancer survivors is often limited by resources, time constraints in traditional clinic visits, payment, and patient and provider comfort with discussion of sensitive topics including sexual and urinary health, both of which are largely impacted by treatment. Telemedicine, the remote delivery of health care services using telephone, mobile, web, and video platforms, allows for potential cost savings, in addition to ease and comfort as patients can engage in telemedicine-based resources in the comfort of their homes. Furthermore, survivors prefer to seek information online making telemedicine approaches for prostate cancer survivorship care an ideal combination. A majority of the telemedicine-based interventions used the web, followed by telephone, mobile, and video platforms. In limited studies, telemedicine delivery of survivorship care has equal efficacy to traditional care delivery. In addition, although older patients did not use the Internet regularly, they were willing to adapt to Internet usage if it had the potential to increase their quality of life. Telemedicine delivery of prostate cancer survivorship care is acceptable, feasible, cost-effective, and potentially preferred by prostate cancer survivors. Additionally, it emphasizes knowledge, self-management and self-monitoring serving to increase self-efficacy. This specialized care allows for greater access and reaches a wider catchment area compared to traditional clinic visits. This is especially important as the number of prostate cancer survivors increases and healthcare systems incorporate alternatives to traditional in-person care."

Participants largely saw the mDAWN as providing good value for the costs involved and found the program to be empowering in gaining control over their diabetes. mHealth programs have the potential to improve clinical outcomes through cost effective patient-led care for chronic illness. Further evaluation needs to examine integration of similar mHealth programs into the patient-physician relationship."

The objective of this paper is to provide an overview and the current status of mobile health care systems (mHealth) and their applications for Emergency healthcare support (eEmergency). Our paper reports on journal papers that use wireless, emergency telemedicine systems that appeared since 2000. The majority of the applications are focused on the transmission of crucial biosignals (mainly ECG) for the support of heart-related healthcare. A limited number of new studies were focused on supporting emergency healthcare for trauma by facilitating both 2D image or video transmission (eg: ultrasound). Alternatively, new studies have focused on integrated systems for specialized emergency scenaria such as stroke. This paper is an extension of work previously published by our group [1]."

            "abstract": "A new model for home care of COPD patients is investigated, as a part of a coordinated provision model across levels of care. In the Spanish pilot of the e-Vital project, relevant vital signs for COPD are closely monitored and used for early detection of deterioration in the state of the patient and all prompt treatment. This can also reduce the need for in-person check-ups and re-admission to hospital. Later analysis aims to determine whether the system has significant economic impact, and whether it will provide more convenience for patients and healthcare professionals. The present trial focuses on the impact of community based nurses visiting each patient in the home as a part of this shared care. The visits are part of the regular follow-up for patients with chronic conditions who belong to any of the home care programs currently available in our institution. In each one of these visits, the nurse performs a number of tasks in order to assess patient status. Vital signs are collected and may be transmitted to the data monitor centre automatically using 2.5-3G technology. Sensors communicate through a Body Area Network (BAN) with a PDA configured to display the data and transfer it to the server using GPRS. Patients can be trained to use the equipment on their own. Results so far are encouraging. In the previous phase, a similar set-up without monitoring facilities at the patient's home showed improvements in several clinical indicators (ER visits, SGRQ, Quality of life, LOS and costs) for a home hospitalisation program and in a prevention of exacerbation program. The current set-up aims at increasing such benefits and further extending the target population."

A relatively small number of smoking cessation interventions have been designed specifically for mobile devices such as smartphones.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study examined the efficacy and usage patterns of two internet-based best practices smoking cessation interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 1271 smokers who wanted to quit were randomly assigned to (1) MobileQuit (designed for-and constrained its use to-mobile devices, included text messaging, and embodied tunnel information architecture) or (2) QuitOnline (designed for nonmobile desktop or tablet computers, did not include text messages, and used a flexible hybrid matrix-hierarchical information architecture). Primary outcomes included self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments.

A systematic review was conducted. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies published between January 2003 and February 2016 that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. An overall estimate of the effect on mean percentage weight loss across all the interventions was initially conducted. A stratified meta-analysis was also conducted to determine estimates of the effect across the interventions classified according to whether behavioral support by counselors post-baseline was not provided, provided remotely with communication technology, or face-to-face. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, in which 26 interventions were evaluated. Samples were primarily white and college educated. Interventions included Web-based applications, mobile phone applications, text messages, DVDs, interactive voice response telephone calls, telehealth video conferencing, and video on-demand programing. Nine interventions were stand-alone, delivered post-baseline exclusively via eHealth. Seventeen interventions included additional behavioral support provided by counselors post-baseline remotely with communication technology or face-to-face. The estimated overall effect on mean percentage weight loss from baseline to up to 15months of follow-up across all the interventions was -3.98%. The subtotal estimate across the stand-alone eHealth interventions (-3.34%) was less than the estimate across interventions with behavioral support given by a counselor remotely (-4.31%), and the estimate across interventions with behavioral support given by a counselor in-person (-4.65%). There is promising evidence of the efficacy of DPP-based eHealth interventions on weight loss. Further studies are needed particularly in racially and ethnically diverse populations with limited levels of educational attainment. Future research should also focus on ways to optimize behavioral support."

We allocated practices using a minimisation algorithm, and did analyses by intention to treat.\n## SETTING\n179 general practices in three areas in England.\n## PARTICIPANTS\n3230 people with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart failure recruited from practices between May 2008 and November 2009.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nTelehealth involved remote exchange of data between patients and healthcare professionals as part of patients' diagnosis and management. Usual care reflected the range of services available in the trial sites, excluding telehealth.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nProportion of patients admitted to hospital during 12 month trial period.\n## RESULTS\nPatient characteristics were similar at baseline. Compared with controls, the intervention group had a lower admission proportion within 12 month follow-up (odds ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.97, P = 0.017). Mortality at 12 months was also lower for intervention patients than for controls (4.6% v 8.3%; odds ratio 0.54, 0.39 to 0.75, P < 0.001). These differences in admissions and mortality remained significant after adjustment. The mean number of emergency admissions per head also differed between groups (crude rates, intervention 0.54 v control 0.68); these changes were significant in unadjusted comparisons (incidence rate ratio 0.81, 0.65 to 1.00, P = 0.046) and after adjusting for a predictive risk score, but not after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Length of hospital stay was shorter for intervention patients than for controls (mean bed days per head 4.87 v 5.68; geometric mean difference -0.64 days, -1.14 to -0.10, P = 0.023, which remained significant after adjustment). Observed differences in other forms of hospital use, including notional costs, were not significant in general. Differences in emergency admissions were greatest at the beginning of the trial, during which we observed a particularly large increase for the control group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTelehealth is associated with lower mortality and emergency admission rates. The reasons for the short term increases in admissions for the control group are not clear, but the trial recruitment processes could have had an effect.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\nInternational Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register ISRCTN43002091.\n"

            "abstract": "Achieving and sustaining good blood pressure control continues to be a challenge for many reasons including nonadherence with prescribed treatment and lifestyle measures, shortage of primary care physicians especially in less populated areas, and variations in physicians' practice behaviour. Many strategies have been advocated to improve outcomes with the greatest success being achieved using nurse or pharmacist-led interventions in which they were given the authority to prescribe or alter antihypertensive treatment. However, this treatment approach, which historically involved 1-on-1 visits to a doctor's office or pharmacy, proved costly, was not scalable, and did not actively engage patients in treatment decision-making. Several electronic health interventions have been designed to overcome these limitations. Though more patient-centred and often effective, they required wired connections and a personal computer, and logging on for Internet access and navigating computer screens greatly reduced access for many older patients. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the benefits were related to better case management or technological advances. Mobile health (mHealth) technology circumvents the technical challenges of electronic health systems and provides a more flexible platform to enhance patient self-care. mHealth applications are particularly appropriate for interventions that depend on patients' sustained adherence to monitoring schedules and prescribed treatments. Studies from our group in hypertension and other chronic conditions have shown improved health outcomes using mHealth applications that have undergone rigourous usability testing. Nonetheless, the inability of most electronic medical record systems to receive and process information from mobile devices continues to be a major impediment in realizing the full potential of mHealth technology."

In this work we have expanded this system into a tele-monitoring system for measurement at home. In order to permit home monitoring, the communication chain of the data has to be designed such that home-measured signals (fHR, fECG, uterine activities) are available in the hospital in real-time. Furthermore, the data must be transferred wirelessly to any location (worldwide) for interpretation by gynaecologists. A web application helps the gynaecologist or midwife to access the signals everywhere, provided that internet access is available. We developed a webserver as the heart of the entire system; it manages the patient database, transforms the signals in a graphical representation similar to that of the cardiotocography and manages the data communication with the proper data security policy. This tele-monitoring system can be used also during home deliveries enabling prompt transfer and proper intervention in the hospital when complications occur."

We use case studies that are based in Mozambique and ground our discussion in the ethical framework for international research proposed by Emanuel et al., highlighting ethical considerations needed to guide the design and implementation of future SMS-based interventions. Such guidance is increasingly needed in countries such as Mozambique, where the local capacity for ethical study design and oversight is still limited and the scale-up and study of mHealth initiatives are still driven predominantly by international collaborators.

Instructions were sent to the patients' mobile phones and alerts to a cardiologist's mobile phone as required.\n## RESULTS\nBaseline questionnaires were completed and returned by 94 patients, and 84 patients returned post-study questionnaires. About 70% of telemonitoring patients completed at least 80% of their possible daily readings. The change in quality of life from baseline to post-study, as measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, was significantly greater for the telemonitoring group compared to the control group (P = .05). A between-group analysis also found greater post-study self-care maintenance (measured with the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index) for the telemonitoring group (P = .03). Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, self-care management, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved significantly for both groups from baseline to post-study, but did not show a between-group difference. However, a subgroup within-group analysis using the data from the 63 patients who had attended the heart function clinic for more than 6 months revealed the telemonitoring group had significant improvements from baseline to post-study in BNP (decreased by 150 pg/mL, P = .02), LVEF (increased by 7.4%, P = .005) and self-care maintenance (increased by 7 points, P = .05) and management (increased by 14 points, P = .03), while the control group did not. No differences were found between the telemonitoring and control groups in terms of hospitalization, mortality, or emergency department visits, but the trial was underpowered to detect differences in these metrics.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur findings provide evidence of improved quality of life through improved self-care and clinical management from a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system. The use of the mobile phone-based system had high adherence and was feasible for patients, including the elderly and those with no experience with mobile phones.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00778986.\n"

Mashing up mobile phones and sensors with these social environments enables the creation of people-centric sensing systems which have great potential for expanding our current social networking usage. However, such systems also have many associated technical challenges, such as privacy concerns, activity detection mechanisms or intermittent connectivity, as well as limitations due to the heterogeneity of sensor nodes and networks. Considering the openness of the Web 2.0, good technical solutions for these cases consist of frameworks that expose sensing data and functionalities as common Web-Services. This paper presents our RESTful Web Service-based model for people-centric sensing frameworks, which uses sensors and mobile phones to detect users' activities and locations, sharing this information amongst the user's friends within a social networking site.

We posit that innovations in telemedicine and mobile health (mHealth) should play a key role in closing the quality gaps in liver disease management. We highlight interventions that have been performed to date in liver disease and heart failure-from successful teleconsultation interventions in the care of veterans with cirrhosis to the use of telemonitoring to reduce hospital readmissions and decrease mortality rates in heart failure. Telemedicine and mHealth can effectively address unmet needs in the care of patients with cirrhosis by increasing preventative care, expanding outreach to rural communities, and increasing high-value care.

WiMAX technology is one of the constituent 4G wireless technologies that provides broadband wireless access (BWA). Despite the fact that WiMAX is able to provide a high data rate in a relatively large coverage; this technology has specific limitations such as: coverage, signal attenuation problems due to shadowing or path loss, and limited available spectrum. The IEEE 802.16j mobile multihop relay (MMR) technology is a pragmatic solution designed to overcome these limitations. The aim of IEEE 802.16j MMR is to expand the IEEE 802.16e's capabilities with multihop features. In particular, the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) subframe allocation in WiMAX network is usually fixed. However, dynamic frame allocation is a useful mechanism to optimize uplink and downlink subframe size dynamically based on the traffic conditions through real-time traffic monitoring. This particular mechanism is important for future WiMAX based m-health applications as it allows the tradeoff in both UL and DL channels. In this paper, we address the dynamic frame allocation issue in IEEE 802.16j MMR network for m-health applications. A comparative performance analysis of the proposed approach is validated using the OPNET Modeler(®). The simulation results have shown an improved performance of resource allocation and end-to-end delay performance for typical medical video streaming application."

On the one hand, the conceptual layer based on ontologies is proposed to unify the management procedure and integrate incoming data from all the sources involved in the telemonitoring process. On the other hand, the data and communication layer based on REST web service (WS) technologies is proposed to provide practical backup to the use of the ontology, to provide a real implementation of the tasks it describes and thus to provide a means of exchanging data (support communication tasks). A case study regarding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease data management is presented in order to evaluate the efficiency of the architecture.

            "abstract": "This paper describes an innovative architecture for the remote follow-up of the health of chronic patients, and its implementation which is called Hygehos Home. The main purpose of the system is to enhance the quality of the daily healthcare practice, by means of bringing both patient and medical professionals closer to each other and by empowering the patient in the healing process. On the one side, Hygehos Home is a platform which gives the patient access to a set of personalized e-Health services using different channels such as web or smartphone. The e-Health services currently provided are: a) health related questionnaires, b) vital sign delivery (weight, blood pressure, oxygen level in blood, temperature, etc.), c) pharmacologic treatment adherence follow-up, d) access to information about the disease, and e) direct communication with the care providers (physicians, nurses, etc.). On the other side, Hygehos Home is fully integrated in the Hospital Information System (HIS), so that the healthcare professionals can easily access all data registered by the patients, such as subjective feedback, vital signs, medication uptake, etc. In this way, the health professionals are able to conduct an efficient and continuous remote supervision of the evolution of the patient. Finally, the validation protocol being conducted is described."

We examined the impact of a six-month mobile health (mHealth) demonstration project among adults with diabetes who belonged to an academic medical center's employee health plan. In addition to pre-post improvements in glycemic control (p=0.01) and patients' satisfaction with overall care (p=0.04), we observed a net cost savings of 8.8 percent.

            "abstract": "To attain the Global End Tuberculosis (TB) goals, the treatment of persons with TB requires advancements in coordinated approaches that are low-cost and highly accessible. Treating TB successfully requires prolonged medication regimens with good adherence, which in turn requires patients to be adequately supported. Furthermore, TB care-providers often wish to monitor treatment-taking by patients in order to track the success of their programs and ensure adequate completion of therapies by individuals. The standard-of-care for treatment monitoring in TB programs often includes directly observed therapy (DOT). Video observed therapy (VOT) has emerged as a method to mimic in-person visits or observations, especially in the smartphone era with internet data connections, but remains simply inaccessible to patients in areas where TB is most endemic. Both approaches may be considered more intensive than necessary for many patients, leaving an opportunity for more affordable and acceptable approaches. The rapid increase in mobile phone penetration provides an opportunity to reach patients between clinical visits. Short message services (SMS) are available on almost every mobile phone and are supported by first generation cellular communication networks, thus providing the farthest reach and penetration globally. Evidence from non-TB conditions suggests SMS, used in a variety of ways, may support outpatients for better medication adherence and quality of care but the evidence in TB remains limited. In this paper, we discuss how basic mobile phones and SMS-related services may be used in supporting global care of persons with TB, with a focus on patient-centered approaches."

The natural result of this choice is that service providers and their customers are looking for ways to optimise costs by migrating existing services and applications onto IP as well. A good example is the medical industry, which is transitioning to Internet-based communications as the field of telemedicine broadens to preventative and self healthcare. However, technology is changing quickly and consumers face an array of choices to satisfy their healthcare needs with numerous devices from different vendors. Seamless healthcare device networking can play a major role in automating and safeguarding the process of collecting and transferring medical data, remote patient monitoring and reducing costs through remote equipment monitoring. In this scope, we describe an approach augmenting the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) with healthcare services in order to form a framework for efficient collection and storage of measurements, aiming to address the issues of the lack of a standardised data interface for consumer healthcare technologies (including hardware and protocols) and the lack of a standardised format for self-collected healthcare data (including the storage medium). In this framework, measurements can be seamlessly collected and stored as XML notes located virtually anywhere, such as the user's home or mobile device. Additionally, these notes can be accessed locally or remotely by doctors and specialists. Also, we discuss how this approach supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to the user's current location and how it can remove the complexity of using consumer healthcare technologies from different vendors connected to different devices and the opportunities for Independent Software Vendors to develop additional services."

            "abstract": "Background: Digital technologies have transformed nearly every aspect of our lives. However, for many of us, they have not yet improved the way we receive or participate in our health services and disease care. Hostetter et al. (2014) explore in a new multimedia essay the changes occurring with the arrival of new digital tools, from mobile apps and data-driven software solutions to wearable sensors that transmit information to a patient's team of health care providers. Digitisation will revolutionise health technology to a new extent, as the self-measurement, cloud services, teleconsultation and robotics technologies are being used to get health expenditure under control. In the future, robots will dispense drugs, and treatment routines will utilise cloud services (Biesdorf and Niedermann, 2014; Grain and Sharper, 2013). According to the rationale of the Horizon 2020 (European Commission, 2013b) work programme, personalising health and care has been stated to empower citizens and patients to manage their own health and disease, which can result in more cost-effective healthcare systems by enabling the management of chronic diseases outside institutions, improving health outcomes, and by encouraging healthy citizens to remain so. Solutions should be developed and tested with the use of open innovation platforms, such as large-scale demonstrators for health and service innovation. It is a fact that ICT/new health technology and personal health applications are transforming patients' self-management in many ways. A huge amount of personal health application solutions are being offered in the marketplace, which engage in activities that promote health, monitoring the symptoms and signs of illness, and managing the impact of illness (European Commission eHealth Action Plan 2012-2020, 2012). The WHO (2011) has conducted a comprehensive study and published a report on Member States' use of mHealth (mobile Health) as well as the readiness and barriers to its use. The percentage of countries reporting that they had formally evaluated mHealth initiatives was 12%. Seven per cent of developing countries reported conducting a mHealth evaluation. Mobile technologies have already changed, and they will continue to change the lives of millions around the world. In the WHO's report, it was estimated that mHealth can revolutionise health and well-being outcomes if implemented strategically and systematically, thereby providing virtually anyone with a mobile phone with health and well-being expertise and knowledge in real-time. In the research reports (European Commission eHealth Action Plan 2012-2020, 2012; Blake, 2013), it was reported that mobile phones as a tool are cost-effective and wide reaching, while they easily target large samples and hard-to-reach groups. Studies show that eHealth as a way to self-monitor and self-manage as well as supportive interventions for clients offers a good possibility to bridge the gap between inpatient and outpatient care. The mobile phone is especially effective in enhancing the therapist-patient bond so that this does not collapse when the client leaves the therapist's consulting room. Furthermore, eHealth applications can assist the client to cope with everyday situations in an autonomous way while improving the transfer of the abilities acquired by the client in the health care setting to everyday life. The findings of various projects (European Commission eHealth Action Plan 2012-2020, 2012; European Commission, 2012; European Commission, 2013b; Hämäläinen, 2013) provide an opportunity for an open discussion regarding the digital health revolution, which will change health care processes and citizens' applications for health promotion and self-care."

This has led to a notable increase in the utilization of this telecommunication in healthcare, namely phone calls and text messaging (SMS). However, evaluating its global impact on improving healthcare processes and outcomes demands a more comprehensive assessment. In this study, we focused on the role of mobile devices via phone calls and SMS in patient-doctor communication, and aimed to assess its impact on various health outcomes. Methods Major databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, and Cochrane CENTRAL, were searched for clinical trials that investigated mobile-device technology in any facet of doctor-patient communication published between 1990 and April 2015. A meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. Results Sixty-two articles met our inclusion criteria. Of those, 23 articles investigated mobile appointment reminder technologies, 19 investigated medication adherence, 20 investigated disease-control interventions, and two investigated test-result reporting. Patients who received an appointment reminder were 10% less likely to miss an appointment (relative risk [RR] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.15). Mobile interventions increased medication adherence by 22% (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.36). Ten of 20 studies examining disease control reported statistically significant reductions in clinically meaningful endpoints. The use of mobile-device interventions improved forced expiratory volume in one second and hemoglobin A1c percentage in meta-analyses.

Partial least squares-structural equation modeling was used to estimate our predictive model of personal traits-IT adaptation, such as exploitative use (use the telehealth technology in a standard way), and exploratory use (use the telehealth technology as innovative way)-and virtual service performance.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We collected 147 responses from graduate nursing students who were training to be nurse practitioners in their master's program, resulting in 121 valid responses from the cross-section online survey. Our theoretical model explained 60.0% of the variance in exploitative use of telehealth technology, 44% of the variance in exploratory use of telehealth technology, and 66% of the variance in virtual service performance. We found that exploitative IT use is an important driver to increase virtual service performance (β=0.762, P<.001), and personal characteristics such as habit are positively associated with both exploitative (β=0.293, P=.008) and exploratory use behaviors (β=0.414, P=.006), while computer self-efficacy is positively associated with exploitative use of telehealth technology (β=0.311, P=.047).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study discusses the unique role of frontline care providers in a virtual care service context and highlights the importance of their telehealth adaptation behavior in provider-to-provider communication. We showed that providers perceive that telehealth technologies should function as intended, otherwise it may create frustration or avoidance of the telehealth technology. Moreover, providers' habitual use of various technologies in daily lives also motivates them to adaptively use telehealth technology for improving virtual care service. Understanding providers' technology habit and adaptation can inform health care policy and further provide a better view of the design of telehealth technology for online communication."

Although mobile health (mHealth) interventions can provide consumers with an effective means for self-control of UAU in a timely, ubiquitous, and cost-effective manner, to date, there is a lack of understanding about different health outcomes brought by such interventions. The core components of these interventions are also unclear.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to systematically review and synthesize the research evidence about the efficacy of mHealth interventions on various health outcomes for consumer self-control of UAU and to identify the core components to achieve these outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We systematically searched 7 electronic interdisciplinary databases: Scopus, PubMed, PubMed Central, CINAHL Plus with full text, MEDLINE with full text, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES.

We screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-text papers as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted from the included papers according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-EHEALTH checklist (V 1.6.1) by 2 authors independently. Data quality was assessed by the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data synthesis and analyses were conducted following the procedures for qualitative content analysis. Statistical testing was also conducted to test differences among groups of studies.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 19 studies were included in the review. Of these 19 studies, 12 (63%) mHealth interventions brought significant positive outcomes in improving participants' health as measured by behavioral (n=11), physiological (n=1), and cognitive indicators (n=1). No significant health outcome was reported in 6 studies (6/19, 32%). Surprisingly, a significant negative outcome was reported for the male participants in the intervention arm in 1 study (1/19, 5%), but no change was found for the female participants. In total, 5 core components reported in the mHealth interventions for consumer self-control of UAU were context, theoretical base, delivery mode, content, and implementation procedure. However, sound evidence is yet to be generated about the role of each component for mHealth success. The health outcomes were similar regardless of types of UAU, deployment setting, with or without nonmobile cointervention, and with or without theory.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Most studies reported mHealth interventions for self-control of UAU appeared to be improving behavior, especially the ones delivered by short message service and interactive voice response systems. Further studies are needed to gather sound evidence about the effects of mHealth interventions on improving physiological and cognitive outcomes as well as the optimal design of these interventions, their implementation, and effects in supporting self-control of UAU."

This revolution makes the idea of in-home health monitoring practical and provides the opportunity for assessment in \"real-world\" environments producing more ecologically valid data. In the field of insomnia diagnosis, for example, it is now possible to offer patients wearable sleep monitoring systems which can be used in the comfort of their homes over long periods of time. The recorded data collected from body sensors can be sent to a remote clinical back-end system for analysis and assessment. Most of the research on sleep reported in the literature mainly looks into how to automate the analysis of the sleep data and does not address the problem of the efficient encoding and secure transmissions of the collected health data. This article reviews the key enabling communication technologies and research challenges for the design of efficient mHealth systems. An end-to-end mHealth system architecture enabling the remote assessment and monitoring of patient's sleep disorders is then proposed and described as a case study. Finally, various mHealth data serialization formats and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication protocols are evaluated and compared under realistic operating conditions."

            "abstract": "The field of interest discussed in this study is a novel codification scheme for (vital signs) medical device communication and patient monitoring data interchange, into the context of effective home care service provisioning. With medical technology having developed in isolation and major manufacturers developing their own proprietary communication protocols, which preclude connection to devices from different manufacturers, and with healthcare trends having evolved, pointing to primary care, telecare and home care monitoring, there is an increasing need for technical standardization in healthcare environments and the development of protocols that enable communication in a structured and open way. In this study, a novel codification scheme has been developed, based on two healthcare informatics standards, the VITAL and DICOM Sup. 30, in addressing the robust interchange of waveform and medical data for a home care application. Based on this scheme, we created a real-time facility, consisting of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit, that enables home telemonitoring, by installing the telemedicine unit at the patient's home while the base unit remains at the physician's office or hospital. The system allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3-lead ECG, pulse rate, blood pressure and SpO2) of the patient. This paper presents an object-oriented design with unified modeling language (UML) of a class hierarchy for exchanging the acquired medical data and performing alert management, and investigates the applicability of the proposed scheme into a commercial patient-connected medical device, thus addressing service and functionality requirements with focus on home-care applications. The system has been validated for technical performance over several telecommunication means and for clinical validity via real patient-involved pilot trials."

Patients at a Midwestern Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center were randomized to telephone, videophone, or usual care for follow-up care after hospitalization for heart failure exacerbation. Outcome measures included readmission rates; time to first readmission; urgent care clinic visits; survival; and quality of life. The intervention resulted in a significantly longer time to readmission but had no effect on readmission rates or mortality. There were no differences in hospital days or urgent care clinic use. All subjects reported higher disease-specific quality of life scores at 1 year.

Because social networks can improve engagement, which is a key mechanism of action, understanding the structure and potential impact of social networks could be key to improving mHealth effects. This study (a) evaluates social network characteristics of four distinct communication channels (discussion board, chat, e-mail, and blog) in a large social networking intervention, (b) predicts membership in online communities, and (c) evaluates whether community membership impacts engagement. Participants were 299 cancer survivors with significant distress using the 12-week health-space.net intervention. Social networking attributes (e.g., density and clustering) were identified separately for each type of network communication (i.e., discussion board, blog, web mail, and chat). Each channel demonstrated high levels of clustering, and being a community member in one communication channel was associated with being in the same community in each of the other channels (φ = 0.56-0.89, ps < 0.05). Predictors of community membership differed across communication channels, suggesting that each channel reached distinct types of users. Finally, membership in a discussion board, chat, or blog community was strongly associated with time spent engaging with coping skills exercises (Ds = 1.08-1.84, ps < 0.001) and total time of intervention (Ds = 1.13-1.80, ps < 0.001). mHealth interventions that offer multiple channels for communication allow participants to expand the number of individuals with whom they are communicating, create opportunities for communicating with different individuals in distinct channels, and likely enhance overall engagement."

            "abstract": "Components of mHealth are increasingly being added to development interventions worldwide. A particular case of interest is in Mali where the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) Africa Indoor Residual Spraying (AIRS) Project piloted a mobile mass-messaging service in Koulikoro District in August 2014 to determine whether voice and/or text messages received on cell phones could effectively replace door-to-door mobilization for an indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaign. To measure the pilot's effectiveness, we evaluated structure preparedness (all household and food items removed) in 3 pilot intervention villages compared with 3 villages prepared for spray through door-to-door mobilization that was modified by incorporating town hall meetings and radio spots. Structure preparedness was significantly lower in households mobilized through the mobile-messaging approach compared with the door-to-door approach (49% vs. 75%, respectively; P = .03). Spray coverage of targeted households also was significantly lower among the mobile-messaging villages than the door-to-door mobilization villages (86% vs. 96%, respectively; P = .02). The mobile-messaging approach, at US$8.62 per structure prepared, was both more costly and less effective than the door-to-door approach at US$1.08 per structure prepared. While literacy and familiarity with technology were major obstacles, it also became clear that by removing the face-to-face interactions between mobilizers and household residents, individuals were not as trusting or understanding of the mobilization messages. These residents felt it was easier to ignore a text or voice message than to ignore a mobilizer who could provide reassurances and preparation support. In addition, men often received the mobile messages, as they typically owned the mobile phones, while women-who were more likely to be at home at the time of spray-usually interacted with the door-to-door mobilizers. Future attempts at using mHealth approaches for similar IRS mobilization efforts in Mali should be done in a way that combines mHealth tools with more common human-based interventions, rather than as a stand-alone approach, and should be designed with a gender lens in mind. The choice of software used for mass messaging should also be considered to find a local option that is both less expensive and perhaps more attuned to the local context than a U.S.-based software solution."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Technology-based lifestyle behavioral interventions (i.e., telehealth, mHealth, eHealth, and/or digital health) are becoming an alternative standard of care and possess several advantages over traditional clinical settings such as convenience, cost, and the ability to tailor plans and feedback to a participant's individual needs. These technology-based interventions also present unique challenges to intervention fidelity due to extra elements involved in executing the intervention. Intervention fidelity monitoring is essential to ensure internal and external validity, yet the development and utilization of fidelity protocols is under-reported in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to describe the intervention fidelity protocol for the 24-START study, a behavior change intervention delivered through telephone and internet. This paper also discusses the results of a pilot audit conducted to determine the feasibility of monitoring adherence to the fidelity protocol.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The 24-START fidelity protocol was developed in accordance with the five fidelity areas outlined by the NIH Behavior Change Consortium (NIH BCC) including: design of study, provider training, delivery of treatment, receipt of treatment, and enactment of treatment. The fidelity strategies provided by the NIH BCC in each area were tailored to fit the specific design of the 24-START study. Twenty-six total fidelity strategies were developed in accordance with the five areas and a corresponding fidelity monitoring plan was created. Because these strategies are only beneficial if implemented, the fidelity monitoring plan was developed to ensure the fidelity strategies are consistently implemented over the course of the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A pilot audit of nine participant files was conducted to test the feasibility of the fidelity protocol developed. Out of the nine participant files reviewed, 89% of scheduled phone calls between a telehealth coach and participant were successfully completed. Of the completed calls, telehealth coaches delivered the intervention as intended 85.3% of the time, and 74% of planned secondary contacts made through the internet were delivered successfully. Additionally, between treatment group dosing was found to be equal. Several weak areas in the fidelity protocol were identified for improvement. The results were satisfactory and the audit was deemed feasible for ongoing use.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The NIH BCC provides a valuable framework for telehealth interventions to develop fidelity protocols ultimately contributing to improved internal and external validity, better translation of results, increased transparency, and increased opportunities for replication within the field. The 24-START pilot audit found the fidelity protocol efficacious and feasible while also identifying areas of weakness in need of revision. The refined protocol will continue to be utilized throughout the data collection phase. Future telehealth interventions should develop and disclose fidelity protocols to improve the overall quality and standard of telehealth interventions."

Three MATS interventions were developed to target medication adherence, socialization, and auditory hallucinations. Participants received up to 840 text messages over a 12-week intervention period. Fifty-five consumers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were enrolled, but 13 consumers with more severe negative symptoms, lower functioning, and lower premorbid IQ did not complete the intervention, despite repeated prompting and training. For completers, the average valid response rate for 216 outcome assessment questions over the 12-week period was 86%, and 86% of phones were returned undamaged. Medication adherence improved significantly, but only for individuals who were living independently. Number of social interactions increased significantly and a significant reduction in severity of hallucinations was found. In addition, the probability of endorsing attitudes that could interfere with improvement in these outcomes was also significantly reduced in MATS. Lab-based assessments of more general symptoms and functioning did not change significantly. This pilot study demonstrated that low-intensity text-messaging interventions like MATS are feasible and effective interventions to improve several important outcomes, especially for higher functioning consumers with schizophrenia."

Key drivers for these tools and technologies are the need and interest to collaborate among telehealth stakeholders, including patients, patient communities, research funders, researchers, healthcare services providers, professional societies, industry, healthcare management/economists, and healthcare policy makers. In the development, marketing, adoption, and implementation of these tools and technologies, communication, training, cultural sensitivity, and end-user customization are critical pieces to the process. Next-generation tools and technologies are vehicles toward personalized medicine, extending the telemedicine model to include cell phones and Internet-based telecommunications tools for remote and home health management with video assessment, remote bedside monitoring, and patient-specific care tools with event logs, patient electronic profile, and physician note-writing capability. Telehealth is ultimately a system of systems in scale and complexity. To cover the full spectrum of dynamic and evolving needs of end-users, we must appreciate system complexity as telehealth moves toward increasing functionality, integration, interoperability, outreach, and quality of service. Toward that end, our group addressed three overarching questions: (1) What are the high-impact topics?

Forty per cent of the world's population now has an internet connection, the average global social media penetration is 39% and 1·5 billion people have internet access via mobile phone. This large-scale move in population use of digital, social and mobile media presents an unprecedented opportunity to connect with individuals on issues concerning health. The present paper aims to investigate these opportunities in relation to dietary behaviour change. Several aspects of the digital environment could support behaviour change efforts, including reach, engagement, research, segmentation, accessibility and potential to build credibility, trust, collaboration and advocacy. There are opportunities to influence behaviour online using similar techniques to traditional health promotion programmes; to positively affect health-related knowledge, skills and self-efficacy. The abundance of data on citizens' digital behaviours, whether through search behaviour, global positioning system tracking, or via demographics and interests captured through social media profiles, offer exciting opportunities for effectively targeting relevant health messages. The digital environment presents great possibilities but also great challenges. Digital communication is uncontrolled, multi-way and co-created and concerns remain in relation to inequalities, privacy, misinformation and lack of evaluation. Although web-based, social-media-based and mobile-based studies tend to show positive results for dietary behaviour change, methodologies have yet to be developed that go beyond basic evaluation criteria and move towards true measures of behaviour change. Novel approaches are necessary both in the digital promotion of behaviour change and in its measurement."

This review aims to discuss the impact of mobile health (m-health) on chronic disease outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Systematic literature searches were performed using CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS databases and gray literature. Scientific literature was searched to identify controlled studies evaluating cell phone voice and text message interventions to address chronic diseases in adults in low- or middle-income countries. Outcomes measured included morbidity, mortality, hospitalization rates, behavioral or lifestyle changes, process of care improvements, clinical outcomes, costs, patient-provider satisfaction, compliance, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From the 1,709 abstracts retrieved, 163 articles were selected for full text review, including 9 randomized controlled trials with 4,604 participants. Most of the studies addressed more than one outcome. Of the articles selected, six studied clinical outcomes, six studied processes of care, three examined healthcare costs, and two examined HRQoL. M-health positively impacted on chronic disease outcomes, improving attendance rates, clinical outcomes, and HRQoL, and was cost-effective.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      M-health is emerging as a promising tool to address access, coverage, and equity gaps in developing countries and low-resource settings. The results for m-health interventions showed a positive impact on chronic diseases in LMIC.

IT often acts as an enabler of improved care delivery, rather than being an intervention per se. But how are different countries seeking to leverage adoption of these technologies to support people who have chronic conditions and complex care needs? This article presents three case examples from Ontario (Canada), Scotland and Kaiser Permanente Colorado (United States) to identify how these jurisdictions are currently using technology to address multimorbidity. A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis is presented for each case and a final discussion addresses the future of eHealth for complex care needs.

Pressure ulcers are a leading iatrogenic cause of death in developed countries and significantly impact quality of life for those affected. Pressure ulcers will be an increasing public health concern as the population ages. Electronic information systems are being explored to improve consistency and accuracy of documentation, improve patient and caregiver experience and ultimately improve patient outcomes. A software application was developed for Android Smartphones and tablets and was trialed in a personal care home in Western Canada. The software application provides an electronic medical record for chronic wounds, replacing nurses' paper-based charting and is positioned for integration with facility's larger eHealth framework. The mHealth application offers three intended benefits over paper-based charting of chronic wounds, including: (1) the capacity for remote consultation (telehealth between facilities, practitioners, and/or remote communities), (2) data organization and analysis, including built-in alerts, automatically-generated text-based and graph-based wound histories including wound images, and (3) tutorial support for non-specialized caregivers.

We also present a justification, motivation, and explanation of how to monitor the most important parameters for COPD patients, together with pointers for the challenges that remain. Additionally, we propose and justify the importance of electrocardiograms (ECGs) and the arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) as two crucial physiological parameters that have not been used so far to any great extent in the monitoring of COPD patients. We cover four possibilities for the remote monitoring of COPD patients: continuous monitoring during normal daily activities for the prediction and early detection of exacerbations and life-threatening events, monitoring during the home treatment of mild exacerbations, monitoring oxygen therapy applications, and monitoring exercise. We also present and discuss the current approaches to decision support at remote locations and list the normal and pathological values/ranges for all the relevant physiological parameters.

However, the advent of instant messaging services, which are abundantly used by the youth, can be used to improve communication and coordination among the various stake holders in the healthcare sector. We have tried to look at the impact of using the WhatsApp messenger service in the laboratory management system, by forming multiple groups of the various subsections of the laboratory. A total of 35 members used this service for a period of 3 months and their response was taken on a scale of 1 to 10. There was significant improvement in the communication in the form of sharing photographic evidence, information about accidents, critical alerts, duty rosters, academic activities and getting directives from seniors. There was also some increase in the load of adding information to the application and disturbance in the routine activities; but the benefits far outweighed the minor hassles.

Psychiatric care remains a notable exception that heavily relies on patient interviews and self-assessment. This is due to the fact that mental illnesses manifest themselves mainly in the way patients behave throughout their daily life and, until recently there were no \"behavior measurement devices.\" This is now changing with the progress in wearable activity recognition and sensor enabled smartphones. In this paper, we introduce a system, which, based on smartphone-sensing is able to recognize depressive and manic states and detect state changes of patients suffering from bipolar disorder. Drawing upon a real-life dataset of ten patients, recorded over a time period of 12 weeks (in total over 800 days of data tracing 17 state changes) by four different sensing modalities, we could extract features corresponding to all disease-relevant aspects in behavior. Using these features, we gain recognition accuracies of 76% by fusing all sensor modalities and state change detection precision and recall of over 97%.

As the role of information technology in modern radiology practice becomes more critical, these safety mechanisms must be addressed when viewing studies on any mobile device."

            "abstract": "## PURPOSE\nThe aim of the present study is to evaluate if remote monitoring with the CareLink Network may improve clinical management of tachyarrhythmias and heart failure episodes in patients treated with biventricular defibrillators (CRT-D).\n## METHODS\nPatients implanted with CRT-D for more than 6 months received the CareLink monitor and were trained to perform device interrogation. At-home transmissions were scheduled at 2 weeks, 1 and 2 months after training, with a final in-office visit after 3 months.\n## RESULTS\nSixty-seven patients performed 264 data transmissions. Twenty-three unscheduled data transmissions were requested by the centers after patient contact. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were reported in nine patients during 16 data reviews. Thirteen data reviews (81%) were performed remotely via CareLink transmissions (nine scheduled and four unscheduled), in seven patients. Of these events, in two cases (15%) in-hospital visits were requested, while in 11 (85%) no action was needed and no additional in-clinic visits were scheduled. During the study period, in 20/28 (71%) intra-thoracic impedance alerts, the patients remotely transmitted their device data. After remote data review, in ten cases drug therapy was adjusted by phone and in four cases no action was needed and the patient reassured. In six episodes an in-hospital extra visit was scheduled. On the whole, in 14 cases (70%), the patient could be managed remotely avoiding a visit to the hospital.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur study showed that remote follow-up is an efficient method to manage tachyarrhythmias and heart failure episodes in CRT-D patients. Early reaction to clinical events may improve overall patient care.\n"

The proposed system consists of a wearable body area network (WBAN) to collect user data and a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) to connect the WBAN with the Internet. The wearable sensors in the WBAN are exerted to measure the environmental conditions around the subject using a Safe Node and monitor the vital signs of the subject using a Health Node. A standalone local server (gateway), which can process the raw sensor signals, display the environmental and physiological data, and trigger an alert if any emergency circumstance is detected, is designed within the proposed network.

Two aspects in particular will be discussed that reflect where most of the efforts in home telehealth care are being directed. The first aspect is the more traditional implementation in which the healthcare practitioner \"visits\" the patient (typically chronically ill or at home recovering from a hospital visit) virtually at a distance using telemedicine technologies to assess their health status, obtain a select set of vital signs (e.g., blood pressure), and converse with them about how they feel and so on. The second application is the growing field of distance monitoring, especially as it pertains to prevention and health maintenance. In this application, the users may be patients with chronic conditions such as asthma or diabetes that require regular monitoring to achieve or maintain healthy functioning, but they are typically not in an acute phase. More and more often, however, the users of distance monitoring technologies are relatively healthy people looking to enhance their health awareness and healthy status by monitoring various vital signs to alert them of any potential changes in their health status that would require actual medical attention."

This article describes a paper-based moisture sensor that uses the hygroscopic character of paper (i.e. the ability of paper to adsorb water reversibly from the surrounding environment) to measure patterns and rate of respiration by converting the changes in humidity caused by cycles of inhalation and exhalation to electrical signals. The changing level of humidity that occurs in a cycle causes a corresponding change in the ionic conductivity of the sensor, which can be measured electrically. By combining the paper sensor with conventional electronics, data concerning respiration can be transmitted to a nearby smartphone or tablet computer for post-processing, and subsequently to a cloud server.

With an aging population, the cost associated with managing HF is expected to more than double from US $31 billion in 2012 to US $70 billion by 2030. Readmission rates for HF patients are high-25% are readmitted at 30 days and nearly 50% at 6 months. Low medication adherence contributes to poor HF management and higher readmission rates. Remote telehealth monitoring programs aimed at improved medication management and adherence may improve HF management and reduce readmissions.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The primary goal of this randomized controlled pilot study is to compare the MedSentry remote medication monitoring system versus usual care in older HF adult patients who recently completed a HF telemonitoring program. We hypothesized that remote medication monitoring would be associated with fewer unplanned hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, increased medication adherence, and improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to usual care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were randomized to usual care or use of the remote medication monitoring system for 90 days. Twenty-nine participants were enrolled and the final analytic sample consisted of 25 participants. Participants completed questionnaires at enrollment and closeout to gather data on medication adherence, health status, and HRQoL. Electronic medical records were reviewed for data on baseline classification of heart function and the number of unplanned hospitalizations and ED visits during the study period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Use of the medication monitoring system was associated with an 80% reduction in the risk of all-cause hospitalization and a significant decrease in the number of all-cause hospitalization length of stay in the intervention arm compared to usual care. Objective device data indicated high adherence rates (95%-99%) among intervention group participants despite finding no significant difference in self-reported adherence between study arms. The intervention group had poorer heart function and HRQoL at baseline, and HRQoL declined significantly in the intervention group compared to controls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The MedSentry medication monitoring system is a promising technology that merits continued development and evaluation. The MedSentry medication monitoring system may be useful both as a standalone system for patients with complex medication regimens or used to complement existing HF telemonitoring interventions. We found significant reductions in risk of all-cause hospitalization and the number of all-cause length of stay in the intervention group compared to controls. Although HRQoL deteriorated significantly in the intervention group, this may have been due to the poorer HF-functioning at baseline in the intervention group compared to controls.

Two hundred fifty-three patients were enrolled at three sites and randomized to monitoring and reporting (MR) or monitoring alone (MA). Patients completed questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks and symptom surveys via interactive voice response weekly for 12 weeks. MR patients' clinically significant symptom scores generated an e-mail alert to the site nurse for management. The primary endpoint was overall symptom burden; secondary endpoints included HRQL, treatment satisfaction, symptom management barriers, and self-efficacy.\n## RESULTS\nThis randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate efficacy of symptom monitoring and reporting in reducing symptom burden compared with monitoring alone in lung cancer. HRQL declined over 12 weeks in both groups (P < 0.006 to P < 0.025); at week 12, treatment satisfaction was higher in MA than MR patients (P < 0.012, P < 0.027). Adherence to weekly calls was good (82%) and patient satisfaction was high.\n## CONCLUSION\nFeasibility of using a technology-based system for systematic symptom monitoring in advanced lung cancer patients was demonstrated.

In an effort to establish standardization, this paper proposes a home healthcare monitoring system data exchange scheme between the HL7 standard and the IEEE1451 standard. IEEE1451 is a standard for special sensor networks, such as industrial control and smart homes, and defines a suite of interfaces that communicate among heterogeneous networks. HL7 is the standard for medical information exchange among medical organizations and medical personnel. While it provides a flexible data exchange in health care domains, it does not provide for data exchange with sensors. Thus, it is necessary to develop a data exchange schema to convert data between the HL7 and the IEEE1451 standard.

In addition, the scientific literatures on health behavior change facilitated by technology and harms driven by technology engagement have developed largely independent of one another. In this secondary analysis of the National Recovery Study (NRS), which provides a geo-demographically representative sample of US adults who resolved a substance use problem, we examined a) the weighted prevalence estimate of individuals who engaged with online technologies to \"cut down on substance use, abstain from substances, or strengthen one's recovery\" (i.e., recovery-related use of online technology, or ROOT), b) clinical/recovery correlates of ROOT, controlling for demographic covariates, and c) the unique association between ROOT and self-reported history of internet addiction. Results showed one in ten (11%) NRS participants reported ROOT. Significant correlates included greater current psychological distress, younger age of first substance use, as well as history of anti-craving/anti-relapse medication, recovery support services, and drug court participation. Odds of lifetime internet addiction were 4 times greater for those with ROOT (vs. no ROOT).

Despite proven health benefits and international recommendations, attendance at cardiac rehabilitation programs is poor. Telehealth (phone, Internet, and videoconference communication between patient and health-care provider) has emerged as an innovative way of delivering health interventions. This review aimed to determine telehealth effectiveness in CHD management. Study design includes systematic review with meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials evaluating telehealth interventions in patients with CHD were identified by searching multiple electronic databases, reference lists, relevant conference lists, gray literature, and key-word searching of the Internet. Studies were selected if they evaluated a telephone, videoconference, or web-based intervention, provided objective measurements of mortality, changes in multiple risk factor levels or quality of life. In total, 11 trials were identified (3145 patients). Telehealth interventions were associated with nonsignificant lower all-cause mortality than controls [relative risk=0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.45-1.1; P=0.12]. These interventions showed a significantly lower weighted mean difference (WMD) at medium long-term follow-up than controls for total cholesterol (WMD=0.37 mmol/l, 95% CI=0.19-0.56, P<0.001), systolic blood pressure (WMD=4.69 mmHg, 95% CI=2.91-6.47, P<0.001), and fewer smokers (relative risk = 0.84, 95% CI=0.65-0.98, P = 0.04).

In conclusion, telehealth interventions provide effective risk factor reduction and secondary prevention. Provision of telehealth models could help increase uptake of a formal secondary prevention by those who do not access cardiac rehabilitation and narrow the current evidence-practice gap."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Although maintaining a healthy weight and physical conditioning are requirements of active military duty, many US veterans rapidly gain weight and lose conditioning when they separate from active-duty service. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions that incorporate wearables for activity monitoring have become common, but it is unclear how to optimize engagement over time. Personalized health coaching, either through tailored automated messaging or by individual health coaches, has the potential to increase the efficacy of mHealth programs. In an attempt to preserve conditioning and ward off weight gain, we developed Stay Strong, a mobile app that is tailored to veterans of recent conflicts and tracks physical activity monitored by Fitbit Charge 2 devices and weight measured on a Bluetooth-enabled scale.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The goal of this study is to determine the effect of activity monitoring plus health coaching compared with activity monitoring alone.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this randomized controlled trial, with Stay Strong, a mobile app designed specifically for veterans, we plan to enroll 350 veterans to engage in an mHealth lifestyle intervention that combines the use of a wearable physical activity tracker and a Bluetooth-enabled weight scale. The Stay Strong app displays physical activity and weight data trends over time. Enrolled participants are randomized to receive the Stay Strong app (active comparator arm) or Stay Strong + Coaching, an enhanced version of the program that adds coaching features (automated tailored messaging with weekly physical activity goals and up to 3 telephone calls with a health coach-intervention arm) for 1 year. Our primary outcome is change in physical activity at 12 months, with weight, pain, patient activation, and depression serving as secondary outcome measures. All processes related to recruitment, eligibility screening, informed consent, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization, baseline assessment, randomization, the bulk of intervention delivery, and outcome assessment will be accomplished via the internet or smartphone app.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study recruitment began in September 2017, and data collection is expected to conclude in 2019.

To this end, an extensive search was conducted to find articles dealing with (a) telemedicine, (b) triage, (c) priority and (d) sensor; (e) comprehensively review related applications and establish the coherent taxonomy of these articles. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases were checked for articles on triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the type of telemedicine technology explored. A total of 150 articles were selected and classified into two categories. The first category includes reviews and surveys of triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The second category includes articles on the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. Tier 1 represents the users. Sensors acquire the vital signs of the users and send them to Tier 2, which is the personal gateway that uses local area network protocols or wireless body area network. Medical data are sent from Tier 2 to Tier 3, which is the healthcare provider in medical institutes. Then, the motivation for using triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine, the issues related to the obstruction of its application and the development and utilisation of telemedicine are examined on the basis of the findings presented in the literature."

Numerous applications such as heart rate monitor, blood pressure monitor and endoscopic capsule are already in use. To address the growing use of sensor technology in this area, a new field known as wireless body area networks (WBAN or simply BAN) has emerged. As most devices and their applications are wireless in nature, security and privacy concerns are among major areas of concern. Due to direct involvement of humans also increases the sensitivity. Whether the data gathered from patients or individuals are obtained with the consent of the person or without it due to the need by the system, misuse or privacy concerns may restrict people from taking advantage of the full benefits from the system. People may not see these devices safe for daily use. There may also possibility of serious social unrest due to the fear that such devices may be used for monitoring and tracking individuals by government agencies or other private organizations.

Implementation outcomes (user metrics, cost saving, and accuracy of electronic records) were also evaluated.

The components of the interventions were rather homogenous and typically involved electronic logging and reminders for prophylactic infusions, reporting of spontaneous and traumatic bleeding events, monitoring of infusion product usage and home inventory, and real-time communication with health care professionals and hemophilia clinics. Telemedicine-supported education and information interventions seemed to be particularly effective among adolescent and young adult patients. Although the patients reported improvements in their health-related quality of life and perception of illness, telemonitoring devices did not appear to have a significant effect on quantifiable health outcomes such as joint health.

Health apps, namely nutrition apps, were used by 62% of dietitians in their practice, primarily as an information resource (74%) and for patient self-monitoring (60%). The top two nutrition apps recommended were MyFitnessPal® (62%) and the Monash University Low FODMAP Diet® (44%). Text messaging was used by 51% of respondents, mainly for appointment-related purposes (84%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although the reported use of smartphone health apps in dietetic practice is high, health apps and other mHealth technologies are not currently being used for behaviour change, nor are they an integral part of the nutrition care process. Dietetic associations should provide training, education and advocacy to enable the profession to more effectively engage with and implement apps into their practice."

Search engines, developers' websites and webstores were screened with key words such as: \"smartphone\", \"medical apps\" and \"eye test\". The \"apps\" were evaluated for usability and with respective published reviews. In addition, an international survey among ophthalmologists asked about the use of a Smartphone and \"apps\" preferences. Direct inquiries were undertaken with developers on selected promising novel \"apps\".\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The more than 70 identified \"apps\" examined were subdivided into different categories A) examining function, B) photo and video recordings, C) office, D) patient education and informed consent as well as E) medical continued education functions and literature searching. The survey determined the iPhone to be the most popular Smartphone among the sampled ophthalmologists worldwide. Many popular \"apps\" have become available only recently and hence suffer in part from some initial technical problems. Some ophthalmic \"apps\" are very helpful in the emergency room or during consultations. Only a few \"apps\" were approved as medical products and therefore cannot substitute a full ophthalmic examination.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The increasing distribution of Smartphone \"apps\" in ophthalmology may have the potential to facilitate patient treatment, data management and communication."

            "abstract": "The continuous technological advances in favor of mHealth represent a key factor in the improvement of medical emergency services. This systematic review presents the identification, study, and classification of the most up-to-date approaches surrounding the deployment of architectures for mHealth. Our review includes 25 articles obtained from databases such as IEEE Xplore, Scopus, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and SAGE. This review focused on studies addressing mHealth systems for outdoor emergency situations. In 60% of the articles, the deployment architecture relied in the connective infrastructure associated with emergent technologies such as cloud services, distributed services, Internet-of-things, machine-to-machine, vehicular ad hoc network, and service-oriented architecture. In 40% of the literature review, the deployment architecture for mHealth considered traditional connective infrastructure. Only 20% of the studies implemented an energy consumption protocol to extend system lifetime. We concluded that there is a need for more integrated solutions specifically for outdoor scenarios. Energy consumption protocols are needed to be implemented and evaluated. Emergent connective technologies are redefining the information management and overcome traditional technologies."

Over the past few decades, we have witnessed a significant transformation in the quality of healthcare services provided by healthcare organizations and professionals. Recent advances have led to the emergence of Electronic Health (E-health), largely made possible by the massive deployment and adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs). However, cybercriminals and attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities associated primarily with ICTs, causing data breaches of patients' confidential digital health information records. Here, we review recent security attacks reported for E-healthcare and discuss the solutions proposed to mitigate them. We also identify security challenges that must be addressed by E-health system designers and implementers in the future, to respond to threats that could arise as E-health systems become integrated with technologies such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and smart cities."

            "abstract": "The present study formed part of a randomised controlled trial of telehealth for in-home monitoring to support people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. We explored the experiences of patients and healthcare practitioners, and their perceptions of the telehealth model of care used in the trial. In addition to their usual diabetes care, participants receive diabetes care from a diabetes educator nurse via an in-home broadband communication device. On average, each patient participated in 14 videoconferences with a diabetes care coordinator during the 12-month trial period. Qualitative data was collected from two general practices and included semi-structured interviews and document review of patient clinical notes. A total of 12 people were interviewed: 8 health practitioners and 4 patients. Patients and health practitioners expressed a high level of satisfaction with the model of care provided. Patients also reported positive health and social outcomes as a result of being involved in the trial and indicated that in the main they had achieved their goals and were happy with their progress over the 12-month period. Analysis of interviews revealed three broad elements associated with the implementation of telehealth: interpersonal factors, operational problems and the wider health system context within which the general practices and trial team were operating. The findings suggest that adopting telehealth in the management of type 2 diabetes can lead to improved diabetes control, but more support is required to ensure sustainability and widespread implementation."

Similar assumptions are made about older people's use of ICT-based care such as telecare and telehealth. To examine the evidence around these claims, we conducted a scoping review of the academic and grey literature, coving the period between January 2007 and August 2014. A framework analysis approach, based on six domains of QOL derived from the ASCOT and WHOQOL models, was adopted to deductively code and analyse relevant literature. The review revealed mixed results. Older people's use of ICT in both mainstream and care contexts has been shown to have both positive and negative impacts on several aspects of QOL. Studies which have rigorously assessed the impact of older people's use of ICT on their QOL mostly demonstrate little effect. A number of qualitative studies have reported on the positive effects for older people who use ICT such as email or Skype to keep in touch with family and friends. Overall, the review unearthed several inconsistencies around the effects of older people's ICT use on their QOL, suggesting that implicit agreement is needed on the best research methods and instrumentation to adequately describe older people's experiences in today's digital age. Moreover, the available evidence does not consider the large number of older people who do not use ICT and how non-use affects QOL."

            "abstract": "Novel care-technologies possess a transformational potential. Future care and support may be provided via monitoring technologies such as smart devices, sensors, actors (robots) and Information and Communication Technologies. Such technologies enable care provision outside traditional care institutions, for instance in the homes of patients. Health monitoring may become \"personalized\" i.e. tailored to the needs of individual care recipients' but may also alter relations between care providers and care recipents, shape and form the care environment and influence values central to health-care. Starting out from a social constructivist theory of technology, an interactive ethical assessment-model is offered. The suggested model supplements a traditional analysis based on normative ethical theory (top-down approach) with interviews including relevant stakeholders (a bottom-up approach). This method has been piloted by small-scale interviews encircling stakeholder perspectives on three emerging technologies: (1) Careousel, a smart medicine-management device, (2) Robot Giraff, an interactive and mobile communication-device and (3) I-Care, a care-software that combines alarm and register system. By incorporating stakeholder perspectives into the analysis, the interactive ethical assessment model provides a richer understanding of the impact of PHM-technologies on ethical values than a traditional top-down model. If the assessment is conducted before the technology has reached the market - preferably in close interaction with developers and users - ethically sound technologies may be obtained."

Engineering ethics can be challenging to teach: as a form of practical ethics, it is framed around future workplace experience in a professional setting which students are assumed to have no prior experience of. Yet the current generations of engineering students, who have been described as 'digital natives', do however have immersive personal experience with digital technologies; and experiential learning theory describes how students learn ethics more successfully when they can draw on personal experience which give context and meaning to abstract theories. This paper reviews current teaching practices in engineering ethics; and examines young people's engagement with technologies including cell phones, social networking sites, digital music and computer games to identify social and ethical elements of these practices which have relevance for the engineering ethics curricula. From this analysis three case studies are developed to illustrate how facets of the use of these technologies can be drawn on to teach topics including group work and communication; risk and safety; and engineering as social experimentation. Means for bridging personal experience and professional ethics when teaching these cases are discussed. The paper contributes to research and curriculum development in engineering ethics education, and to wider education research about methods of teaching 'the net generation'."

Cancer and/or palliative care physicians and nurses employed at one of the six participating sites across Australia will be eligible to participate in this trial and, on enrolment, will be allocated to the active or wait-listed arm. Participants allocated to the active arm will be invited to complete the mHealth cancer pain assessment intervention. In this trial, mHealth is defined as medical or public health practice supported by mobile devices (i.e. phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants and other wireless devices). This mHealth intervention integrates three evidence-based elements, namely: the COM-B theoretical framework; spaced learning pedagogy; and audit and feedback. This intervention will be delivered via the QStream online platform to participants' mobile devices over four weeks. The trial will determine if a tailored mHealth intervention, targeting clinicians' cancer pain assessment capabilities, is effective in reducing self-reported cancer pain scores, as measured by a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      If this mHealth intervention is found to be effective, in addition to improving cancer pain assessment practices, it will provide a readily transferable evidence-based framework that could readily be applied to other evidence practice gaps and a scalable intervention that could be administered simultaneously to multiple clinicians across diverse geographical locations. Moreover, if found to be cost-effective, it will help transform clinical continuing professional development. In summary, this mHealth intervention will provide health services with an opportunity to offer an evidence-based, pedagogically robust, cost-effective, scalable training alternative.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ACTRN12618001103257 .

A current ODA application was designed to support home-based training of behavioral attack prevention in chronic migraine, focusing on the identification of attack precursors and the support of preventive health behaviour.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim was to establish feasibility of the ODA approach in terms of technical problems and participant compliance, and ODA acceptability on the basis of ratings of user-friendliness, potential burden, and perceived support of the training for behavioral attack prevention in migraine.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      ODA combines mobile electronic diary monitoring with direct human online coaching of health behavior according to the information from the diary. The diary contains three parts covering the following: (1) migraine headache and medication use, (2) attack precursors, and (3) self-relaxation and other preventive behavior; in addition, menstruation (assessed in the evening diary) and disturbed sleep (assessed in the morning diary) is monitored. The pilot study consisted of two runs conducted with a total of five women with chronic migraine without aura. ODA was tested for 8.5 days (range 4-12 days) per participant. The first test run with three participants tested 4-5 diary prompts per day. The second run with another three participants (including one subject who participated in both runs) tested a reduced prompting scheme (2-3 prompts per day) and minor adaptations to the diary. Online coaching was executed twice daily on workdays.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      ODA feasibility was established on the basis of acceptable data loss (1.2% due to the personal digital assistant; 5.6% due to failing Internet transmission) and good participant compliance (86.8% in the second run).

Our aim was to investigate the effect of TM with the option of video consultations on exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with severe COPD.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients with severe COPD at high risk of exacerbations were eligible for the study. Of 560 eligible patients identified, 279 (50%) declined to participate. The remaining patients were equally randomized to either TM (n=141) or usual care (n=140) for the 6-month study period. TM comprised recording of symptoms, saturation, spirometry, and weekly video consultations. Algorithms generated alerts if readings breached thresholds. Both groups received standard care. The primary outcome was number of hospital admissions for exacerbation of COPD during the study period.\n## RESULTS\nMost of the enrolled patients had severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second <50%pred in 86% and ≥hospital admission for COPD in the year prior to enrollment in 45%, respectively, of the patients). No difference in drop-out rate and mortality was found between the groups. With regard to the primary outcome, no significant difference was found in hospital admissions for COPD between the groups (P=0.74), and likewise, no difference was found in time to first admission or all-cause hospital admissions. Compared with the control group, TM group patients had more moderate exacerbations (ie, treated with antibiotics/corticosteroid, but not requiring hospital admission; P<0.001), whereas the control group had more visits to outpatient clinics (P<0.001).\n## CONCLUSION\nOur study of patients with severe COPD showed that TM including video consultations as add-on to standard care did not reduce hospital admissions for exacerbated COPD, but TM may be an alternative to visits at respiratory outpatient clinics. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal role of TM in the management of severe COPD.\n"

            "abstract": "Introduction: While for adults in Pennsylvania, obesity rates tripled from less than 10% in 1990 to 30% in 2015, the combined rates of overweight, obese, and severely obese children and adolescents in Pennsylvania are projected to approach 37.11% by the end of 2018. Method: Pediatric obesity rates in rural areas tend to be even higher than those in urban areas. Pediatric obesity needs to be addressed, since it is strongly correlated with several chronic diseases. Given the scarcity of resources to manage this trend, innovative population-based approaches are needed. Web-based telehealth, telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), and telephone conferences have been proposed as solutions to treat and prevent childhood obesity in rural areas; the most suitable solution is through a family-based telemedicine intervention. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of such a telehealth application especially for rural Pennsylvania. Results: Telehealth use in healthcare organizations in Pennsylvania is scarce; however, 92% of Pennsylvania's school districts meet the minimum internet connectivity standards. Discussions: This article, while acknowledging barriers to the adoption of the internet-based telemedicine resources, discusses solutions for increasing their availability and dissemination in rural Pennsylvania. Current internet connectivity standards in Pennsylvania schools reflect ability to participate in telehealth programs in terms of technological background, but schools are not engaged in such programs. An appraisal of the real-life challenges to implement this modality is critical and will pave the way for advocacy and implementation of useful telehealth services in low-resource areas."

Both groups received monthly calls for diabetes education and self-management review. ACM+HT group participants transmitted blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight to a nurse practitioner using the Viterion 100 TeleHealth Monitor; the nurse practitioner adjusted medications for glucose, blood pressure, and lipid control based on established American Diabetes Association targets. Measures were obtained at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month visits. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups, with mean A1C of 9.4% (CC group) and 9.6% (ACM+HT group). Compared with the CC group, the ACM+HT group demonstrated significantly larger decreases in A1C at 3 months (1.7 vs. 0.7%) and 6 months (1.7 vs. 0.8%; P < 0.001 for each), with most improvement occurring by 3 months. CONCLUSIONS Compared with the CC group, the ACM+HT group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in A1C by 3 and 6 months.

In this paper, we focus on knowledge assessment of the online communities of Fitbit (a commercial wearable device) and the Quantified Self movement. Through their online forums, we investigate how users' knowledge claims, shared experiences and imaginations about wearable sensors interrogate or confirm the narratives through which they are introduced to the publics. Citizen initiatives like the Quantified Self movement claim the right to 'own' the sensor generated data. But how these data can be used through traditional healthcare systems is an open question. More importantly, wearable sensors trigger a social function that is transformative of the current idea of care and healthcare, focused on sharing, socialising and collectively reflecting about individual problems.

Research activity increased steeply in 2014 (17/51, 33%) and preexperimental design predominated (16/50, 32%). Diabetes (16/46, 35%) and heart failure management (9/46, 20%) were most frequently studied. We identified diversity and heterogeneity in the collection of biometrics and patient-reported outcome measures within and between chronic diseases. Across studies, we found 8 self-management supporting strategies and 4 distinct communication channels for supporting the decision-making process. In particular, self-monitoring (38/40, 95%), automated feedback (15/40, 38%), and patient education (13/40, 38%) were commonly used as self-management support strategies. Of the 23 studies that implemented decision support strategies, clinical decision making was delegated to patients in 10 studies (43%).

The use of remote patient monitoring, or telehealth (TH), has been widely adopted by many home care agencies to facilitate early identification of disease exacerbation, particularly for patients with chronic diseases such as heart failure. TH has been successfully used to improve symptom detection and potentially reduce rehospitalization rates. Quantifying program effectiveness through data analysis is a critical step for program improvement, resource allocation, and future strategic planning. Using the Outcome and Assessment Information Set-C database, a retrospective analysis was conducted examining 22 months of heart failure patient data from one home care agency in southern California. Seventy patients receiving TH were compared to patients who received usual home care nursing services. No major differences in baseline socio-demographics were found between the 2 groups. While receiving home healthcare services, the non-TH patients had a 21% all-cause hospital readmission rate, compared to the home TH patients with a 10% all-cause readmission rate. Statistical differences were found between groups on the variables of fall risk, vision, smoking, shortness of breath, the ability to bathe and take oral meds, along with having been discharged from a skilled nursing facility in the last 2 weeks. These results indicate that aggregate data analysis is useful in providing insight into program effectiveness.

Given the huge societal debate on the impact of smartphone usage on our daily lives, the present study undertook a large-scale investigation in order to provide numbers on smartphone usage generally-and use of WhatsApp in particular, with the aim of providing a basis for a scientific debate.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In a large sample of N = 2,418 users, we recorded WhatsApp behaviour over a 4 week period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our data show that use of WhatsApp accounted for 19.83% (= 32.11 min) of all smartphone behaviour (compare: Facebook only 9.38% = 15.19 min). The mean of general daily smartphone usage was 161.95 min. Females used WhatsApp for significantly longer periods of time than males and younger age was associated with longer duration of WhatsApp use. While the personality trait Extraversion was positively associated with daily WhatsApp use, Conscientiousness showed an inverse correlation with the length of daily WhatsApp use.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The numbers on smartphone usage in the present study show that the smartphone dominates our daily life. In particular WhatsApp is a driving force, here. Given the length of daily smartphone and WhatsApp usage, more studies need to be conducted to better understand smartphone usage."

            "abstract": "Existing frameworks have identified a range of intervention design features that may facilitate adherence to eHealth interventions; however, empirical data are lacking on whether intervention design features can predict user adherence in the real world-where the public access available tools-and whether some design aspects of behavioral eHealth interventions are more important than others in predicting adherence. This study examined whether intervention design qualities predict user adherence to behavioral eHealth interventions in real-world use and which qualities matter the most. We correlated the online activities of users of 30 web-based behavioral interventions-collected from a proprietary data set of anonymized logs from consenting users of Microsoft Internet Explorer add-on-with interventions' quality ratings obtained by trained raters prior to empirical examination. The quality ratings included: Usability, Visual Design, User Engagement, Content, Therapeutic Persuasiveness (i.e., persuasive design and incorporation of behavior change techniques), and Therapeutic Alliance. We found Therapeutic Persuasiveness (i.e., the incorporation of persuasive design/behavior change principles) to be the most robust predictor of adherence (i.e., duration of use, number of unique sessions; 40 ≤ rs ≤ .58, ps ≤ .005), explaining 42% of the variance in user adherence in our regression model. Results indicated up to six times difference in the percentage of users utilizing the interventions for more than a minimum amount of time and sessions based on Therapeutic Persuasiveness. Findings suggest the importance of persuasive design and behavior change techniques incorporation during the design and evaluation of digital behavioral interventions."

            "abstract": "The development of wireless body area sensor networks is imperative for modern telemedicine. However, attackers and cybercriminals are gradually becoming aware in attacking telemedicine systems, and the black market value of protected health information has the highest price nowadays. Security remains a formidable challenge to be resolved. Intelligent home environments make up one of the major application areas of pervasive computing. Security and privacy are the two most important issues in the remote monitoring and control of intelligent home environments for clients and servers in telemedicine architecture. The personal authentication approach that uses the finger vein pattern is a newly investigated biometric technique. This type of biometric has many advantages over other types (explained in detail later on) and is suitable for different human categories and ages. This study aims to establish a secure verification method for real-time monitoring systems to be used for the authentication of patients and other members who are working in telemedicine systems. The process begins with the sensor based on Tiers 1 and 2 (client side) in the telemedicine architecture and ends with patient verification in Tier 3 (server side) via finger vein biometric technology to ensure patient security on both sides. Multilayer taxonomy is conducted in this research to attain the study's goal. In the first layer, real-time remote monitoring studies based on the sensor technology used in telemedicine applications are reviewed and analysed to provide researchers a clear vision of security and privacy based on sensors in telemedicine. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that deal with security and privacy issues, related applications are reviewed comprehensively and a coherent taxonomy of these articles is established. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases are checked for articles on mHealth in telemedicine based on sensors. A total of 3064 papers are collected from 2007 to 2017. The retrieved articles are filtered according to the security and privacy of telemedicine applications based on sensors. Nineteen articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 57.89% (n = 11/19), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, accounting for 42.1% (n = 8/19), includes articles on the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. The collected studies reveal the essential need to construct another taxonomy layer and review studies on finger vein biometric verification systems. This map-matching for both taxonomies is developed for this study to go deeply into the sensor field and determine novel risks and benefits for patient security and privacy on client and server sides in telemedicine applications. In the second layer of our taxonomy, the literature on finger vein biometric verification systems is analysed and reviewed. In this layer, we obtain a final set of 65 articles classified into four categories. In the first category, 80% (n = 52/65) of the articles focus on development and design. In the second category, 12.30% (n = 8/65) includes evaluation and comparative articles. These articles are not intensively included in our literature analysis. In the third category, 4.61% (n = 3/65) includes articles about analytical studies. In the fourth category, 3.07% (n = 2/65) comprises reviews and surveys. This study aims to provide researchers with an up-to-date overview of studies that have been conducted on (user/patient) authentication to enhance the security level in telemedicine or any information system. In the current study, taxonomy is presented by explaining previous studies. Moreover, this review highlights the motivations, challenges and recommendations related to finger vein biometric verification systems and determines the gaps in this research direction (protection of finger vein templates in real time), which represent a new research direction in this area."

However, availability of treatment alone is insufficient to meet new UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets calling for rapid scale-up of engagement in HIV care to end the epidemic in 2030. Digital technology interventions (mHealth, eHealth, and telehealth) are emerging as one approach to support lifelong engagement in HIV care. This review synthesizes recent reviews and primary studies published since January 2014 on digital technology interventions for engagement in HIV care after diagnosis. Technologies for health provide emerging and proven solutions to support achievement of the United Nations targets for the generalized HIV-affected population. Much of the existing evidence addresses antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence; however, studies have begun to investigate programs to support linkage and retention in care as well as interventions to engage key populations facing extensive barriers to care."

            "abstract": "Despite recent advances in multiple sclerosis (MS) care, many patients only infrequently access health care services, or are unable to access them easily, for reasons such as mobility restrictions, travel costs, consultation and treatment time constraints, and a lack of locally available MS expert services. Advances in mobile communications have led to the introduction of electronic health (eHealth) technologies, which are helping to improve both access to and the quality of health care services. As the Internet is now readily accessible through smart mobile devices, most people can take advantage of eHealth apps. The development of digital applications and remote communication technologies for patients with MS has increased rapidly in recent years. These apps are intended to complement traditional in-clinic approaches and can bring significant benefits to both patients with MS and health care providers (HCPs). For patients, such eHealth apps have been shown to improve outcomes and increase access to care, disease information, and support. These apps also help patients to participate actively in self-management, for example, by tracking adherence to treatment, changes in bladder and bowel habits, and activity and mood. For HCPs, MS eHealth solutions can simplify the multidisciplinary approaches needed to tailor MS management strategies to individual patients; facilitate remote monitoring of patient symptoms, adverse events, and outcomes; enable the efficient use of limited resources and clinic time; and potentially allow more timely intervention than is possible with scheduled face-to-face visits. These benefits are important because MS is a long-term, multifaceted chronic condition that requires ongoing monitoring, assessment, and management. We identified in the literature 28 eHealth solutions for patients with MS that fall within the four categories of screening and assessment, disease monitoring and self-management, treatment and rehabilitation, and advice and education. We review each solution, focusing on any clinical evidence supporting their use from prospective trials (including ASSESS MS, Deprexis, MSdialog, and the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test) and consider the opportunities, barriers to adoption, and potential pitfalls of eHealth technologies in routine health care."

This study comprehensively examined published mHealth intervention studies for obesity and diabetes treatment and management to assess their effectiveness and provide recommendations for future research. We systematically searched PubMed for mHealth-related studies on diabetes and obesity treatment and management published during 2000-2016. Relevant information was extracted and analyzed. Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria and varied in terms of sample size, ethnicity, gender, and age of the participating patients and length of follow-up. The mHealth interventions were categorized into 3 types: mobile phone text messaging, wearable or portable monitoring devices, and applications running on smartphones. Primary outcomes included weight loss (an average loss ranging from -1.97 kg in 16 wk to -7.1 kg in 5 wk) or maintenance and blood glucose reduction (an average decrease of glycated hemoglobin ranging from -0.4% in 10 mo to -1.9% in 12 mo); main secondary outcomes included behavior changes and patient perceptions such as self-efficacy and acceptability of the intervention programs. More than 50% of studies reported positive effects of interventions based on primary outcomes. The duration or length of intervention ranged from 1 wk to 24 mo. However, most studies included small samples and short intervention periods and did not use rigorous data collection or analytic approaches. Although some studies suggest that mHealth interventions are effective and promising, most are pilot studies or have limitations in their study designs. There is an essential need for future studies that use larger study samples, longer intervention (≥ 6 mo) and follow-up periods (≥ 6 mo), and integrative and personalized innovative mobile technologies to provide comprehensive and sustainable support for patients and health service providers."

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment."

Providing information, content and services through positioning technologies forms the platform for new services for users and developers, as well as creating new revenue channels for service providers. These crucial advances in location based services have opened up new opportunities in real time patient tracking for personal healthcare applications. In this paper, a hybrid mobile-based location technique using the global positioning system (GPS) and cellular mobile network infrastructure is employed to provide the location tracking capability. This function will be integrated into the patient location tracking system (PLTS) to assist caregivers or family members in locating patients such as elderly or dependents when required, especially in emergencies. The capability of this PLTS is demonstrated through a series of location detection tests conducted over different operating conditions. Although the model is at its initial stage of development, it has shown relatively good accuracy for position tracking and potential of using integrated wireless technology to enhance the existing personal healthcare communication system through location based services."

Behavioural change is one plausible explanation. This study investigated the behavioural effects of a mobile-phone based home telehealth (MTH) intervention in people with diabetes. It was hypothesized that MTH would improve self-efficacy, illness beliefs, and diabetes self-care. Methods A randomized controlled trial compared standard care to standard care supplemented with MTH (self-monitoring, data transmission, graphical and nurse-initiated feedback, educational calls). Self-report measures of self-efficacy, illness beliefs, and self-care were repeated at baseline, three months, and nine months. MTH effects were based on the group by time interactions in hierarchical linear models and effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interviews with MTH participants explored the perceived effects of MTH on diabetes self-management. Results Eighty-one participants were randomized to the intervention ( n = 45) and standard care ( n = 36). Significant group by time effects were observed for five out of seven self-efficacy subscales. Effect sizes were large, particularly at nine months. Interaction effects for illness beliefs and self-care were non-significant, but effect sizes and confidence intervals suggested MTH may positively affect diet and exercise. In interviews, MTH was associated with increased awareness, motivation, and a greater sense of security. Improved self-monitoring and diet were reported by some participants. Discussion MTH empowers people with diabetes to manage their condition and may influence self-care.

Physiological sensors are commonly used in many human specialties e.g. electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes, for monitoring heart signals, and electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes, for sensing the electrical activity of the brain, are the most well-known applications. Consequently there is a substantial unmet need for physiological sensors that can be simply and easily applied by the patient or primary carer, are comfortable to wear, can accurately sense parameters over long periods of time and can be connected to data recording systems using Bluetooth technology. We have developed a small, battery powered, user customizable portable monitor. This prototype is capable of recording three-axial body acceleration, skin temperature, and has up to four bio analogical front ends. Moreover, it is also able of continuous wireless transmission to any Bluetooth device including a PDA or a cellular phone. The bio-front end can use long-lasting dry electrodes or novel textile electrodes that can be embedded in clothes. The device can be powered by a standard mobile phone which has a Ni-MH 3.6 V battery, to sustain more than seven days continuous functioning when using the Bluetooth Sniff mode to reduce TX power.

Implementing those systems however has always required spending a great effort on the underlying infrastructure instead of focusing on the application cores as perceived by their users. This paper proposes an abstract unifying infrastructure for telemedicine services which is loosely based on the multi-agent paradigm. It provides the capability of transferring to the clinic any remotely acquired information, and possibly sending back updates to the patient. The infrastructure is a layered one, with the bottom layer acting at the data level and implemented in terms of a software library targeting a wide set of hardware devices. On top of this infrastructure several services can be written shaping the functionality of the telemedicine application while at the highest level, adhering to a simple agent model, it is possible to reuse those functional components porting the application to different platforms. The infrastructure has been successfully used for implementing a telemonitoring service for a randomized controlled study aimed at testing the effectiveness of the artificial pancreas as a treatment within the AP@home project funded by the European Union."

In this paper, we described a portable vital sensing system and a home medical server to establish a home telemedicine system. In order to develop a portable vital sensing system, physiological sensing circuit, digital signal processor and wireless communication device are integrated into a small electrical circuit, called \"smart telecom unit\" with a size of 25mm * 37mm. By using a smart telecom unit, noninvasive vital sensing units including blood pressure, electrocardiograph, pulse wave and body temperature were developed. These sensing units are able to communicate vital records to a home medical server, which consists of a small computer and virtual physiological model to estimate health conditions and can seamlessly connect to the Internet. The accuracy and stability were evaluated in the system performance test. As a result of a performance test of a portable vital sensing system, these vital data could be measured easily and noninvasively. In addition, vital sensing system is able to communicate vital records to home medical server. Hence, it could be confirmed that it was useful to analyze daily health condition in order to prevent a lifestyle disease like hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes."

Such solutions are currently referred as e-health, the most popular and widely distributed being those based on telemedicine and mobile health (m-health). A specific application of telemedicine for hypertension management is blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT), which allows remote data transmission of BP and additional information on patients' health status from their living site or from a community setting to the doctor's office or the hospital. Several randomized studies have documented a significant BP reduction with regular BPT compared to usual care, particularly in high risk hypertensive patients. Additional benefits are observed when BPT is offered under the supervision of a team of healthcare professionals, including a community pharmacist. BPT may also be provided in the context of m-health solutions, which commonly include wireless diagnostic and clinical decision support tools. M-health has the potential to promote patient's self-management, as a complement to the doctor's intervention, and encourage greater participation in medical decision making. Current statistics show that half of smartphone owners gather health information through their phone and 19 % use a health app. In case of hypertensive patients the most popular apps are those with tracking function, including BPT. Thus, e-health, and in particular BPT and m-health, are progressively gaining a key role in the management of hypertensive patients, having the potential to improve the quality of the delivered care and to more effectively prevent cardiovascular consequences of high BP."

This work has helped to establish a clearer research agenda. However, to test the hypotheses generated by the conceptual modules, we need to know how to measure engagement in a valid and reliable way. The aim of this viewpoint is to provide an overview of engagement measurement options that can be employed in eHealth and mHealth behavior change intervention evaluations, discuss methodological considerations, and provide direction for future research. To identify measures, we used snowball sampling, starting from systematic reviews of engagement research as well as those utilized in studies known to the authors. A wide range of methods to measure engagement were identified, including qualitative measures, self-report questionnaires, ecological momentary assessments, system usage data, sensor data, social media data, and psychophysiological measures. Each measurement method is appraised and examples are provided to illustrate possible use in eHealth and mHealth behavior change research. Recommendations for future research are provided, based on the limitations of current methods and the heavy reliance on system usage data as the sole assessment of engagement.

Herein, we aim to quantify publication hotspots in the field of telemedicine, analyse their evolution, compare them in different countries, and provide visual representations. Methods We used software tools to process PubMed entries for a 54-year period and identified publication hotspots using keyword frequency analysis. We employed a keyword co-occurrence analysis, principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling analysis, and network visualization technology. Results The number of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms increased with time. The most common subcategories of telemedicine between 1962 and 2015 were Remote Consultation, Teleradiology, and Telepathology. The most popular information communication technologies in telemedicine publications were related to the Internet and cell phones. The topics of Patient Satisfaction, Treatment Outcomes, and Home Care Services associated with telemedicine were highlighted after the 1990s. Use frequency of the terms Cell Phones and Self-Care increased drastically in the past six years, and the publication focus in six countries that had the highest output was different. Knowledge network maps and perceptual maps show the relationship between high-frequency MeSH terms. Discussion The telemedicine field has experienced significant growth and expansion in knowledge and innovation in the last 54 years. Publication hotspots for telemedicine lean towards clinical treatment, home care services, and personal care, and countries emphasize publishing in areas related to their national characteristics. This study quantitatively discusses publication hotspots, provides an objective and systematic understanding of this field, and suggests directions for future telemedicine research."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and chronic condition with no known cure. Exercise is advocated in all clinical guidelines due to its positive effects on symptoms. Despite this, exercise participation is often poor in people with knee OA with access to exercise treatments a known barrier. Internet-delivered exercise interventions have the potential to improve access to evidence-based exercise treatments and can benefit OA outcomes, although non-usage and low adherence potentially limit their effectiveness. Short message services (SMS) show promise in facilitating exercise adherence and may be one solution to improve adherence to internet-delivered exercise interventions. The combination of internet-delivered exercise and SMS adherence support has not been specifically evaluated in people with knee OA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This protocol reports a two-arm parallel-design, assessor- and participant-blinded randomised controlled trial. This trial is recruiting 206 people aged 45 years and older, with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA from the Australian-wide community. Eligible and consenting participants are enrolled and randomised to receive access to either i) 'My Knee Education', an education control website containing OA and exercise information only or ii) a combined intervention that includes a website, 'My Knee Exercise', containing the same educational information as the control, guidance to increase general physical activity, and the prescription of a 24-week self-directed home-based lower-limb strengthening program in addition to a 24-week behaviour change SMS exercise adherence program. Outcome measures are being collected at baseline and 24-weeks. Primary outcomes are self-reported knee pain and physical function.

            "abstract": "Peritoneal dialysis (PD) as a therapy with all its advantages has not grown as would have been expected except in certain pockets, notably in Asia. In our opinion, from patient and their family interviews, a perception among prospective PD patients of inaccessibility to the referral PD Unit (RPU), usually for patients from rural areas in far flung places, inaccessible due to difficult terrain or long distances, play a strong role against the choice of PD as their modality choice for end-stage renal disease. We decided to address this issue by adopting novel initiatives such as easy access to the RPU through usage of internet and mobile phones from the patient homes especially in addressing the more clinically relevant infectious complications such as peritonitis and exit site infections with immediate treatment management responses from the RPU. In addition, we found that inherently the rural PD patients had several advantages over their urban counterparts and also over their hemodialysis (HD) counterparts in many socioeconomic, emotional support and nutritional parameters. We enhanced these advantages with an intensive home visit program. This two pronged approach has paid dividends in that our rural PD patients do as well, if not better than the urban PD and the HD patients, contrary to prevailing international experience."

The system was developed by the author and combined an open source survey application and a short message service (SMS) gateway to send SMS messages to patients after their anaesthesia and surgery. The messages requested patients to complete an online Quality of Recovery survey questionnaire if they had a smartphone. The results were immediately available. A preliminary survey of consenting patients with available mobile telephone numbers in a private practice was undertaken by the author. A total of 123 procedures were eligible for follow-up and survey requests were sent to 94 patients. Sixty-five surveys were completed.

At present there is a wide and disappointing difference between the results of treatment in routine work [1] and in clinical trials [2, 3] even when the same cohort of patients is treated by the same therapists. The efficacy rate in daily routine is about 20-35% as compared to 70-85% during trials. Assuming this gap is due to differences in disease management we integrated short message service and Internet applications into a new hypertension management tool (Blutdrucksms). According to our registry data \"Blutdrucksms\" is very successful: More than 80% of our hypertensive patients were treated to target. In June 2008, we implemented the SMS-Blood Pressure Protocol, and in October 2010, we analyzed the data of all \"Blutdrucksms\" users available in our registry. By then a total of 568 patients - 44% female and 56% male - had sent their self-recorded blood pressure readings as short messages to the SMS-Center; 75% of these patients had had at least one organ damage (left ventricular hypertrophy, increase in intima media thickening or carotid plaque). Mean casual blood pressure, recorded before enrolment into the SMS-program, was 152/83. It had improved to 136/80 mmHg by October 2010. The mean of the self-recorded blood pressures of the last month of participation was 128/76 mmHg and a heart rate of 69 beats per minute; 85% of all hypertensive patients had their pressures at treatment goal. Thus, we assume that \"Blutdrucksms\" is an excellent tool to improve the efficacy of antihypertensive disease management in routine work. We assume that the success is due to the enhanced communication between patient and doctor via SMS.

These challenges have led to the development of alternative models of cardiac rehabilitation in recent years. The aim of this study was to identify and critique evidence for the effectiveness of these alternative models. A total of 22 databases were searched to identify quantitative studies or systematic reviews of quantitative studies regarding the effectiveness of alternative models of cardiac rehabilitation. Included studies were appraised using a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool and the National Health and Medical Research Council's designations for Level of Evidence. The 83 included articles described interventions in the following broad categories of alternative models of care: multifactorial individualized telehealth, internet based, telehealth focused on exercise, telehealth focused on recovery, community- or home-based, and complementary therapies. Multifactorial individualized telehealth and community- or home-based cardiac rehabilitation are effective alternative models of cardiac rehabilitation, as they have produced similar reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors compared with hospital-based programmes. While further research is required to address the paucity of data available regarding the effectiveness of alternative models of cardiac rehabilitation in rural, remote, and culturally and linguistically diverse populations, our review indicates there is no need to rely on hospital-based strategies alone to deliver effective cardiac rehabilitation. Local healthcare systems should strive to integrate alternative models of cardiac rehabilitation, such as brief telehealth interventions tailored to individual's risk factor profiles as well as community- or home-based programmes, in order to ensure there are choices available for patients that best fit their needs, risk factor profile, and preferences."

The reasons are the better possibilities for managing chronic care, controlling health delivery costs, increasing quality of life and quality of health services and the distinct possibility of predicting and thus avoiding serious complications. For the above goals to become routine, new telemedicine and information technology (IT) solutions need to be implemented and integrated in the health delivery scene, and these solutions need to be assessed through evidence-based medicine in order to provide solid proof for their usefulness. Thus, the concept of contact or call centers has emerged as a new and viable reality in the field of IT for health and telemedicine. In this paper we describe a generic contact center that was designed in the context of an EU funded IST for health project with acronym Citizen Health System (CHS). Since the generic contact center is composed by a number of modules, we shall concentrate in the modules dealing with the communication between the patient and the contact center using mobile telecommunications solutions, which can act as link between the internet and the classical computer telephony communication means. We further elaborate on the development tools of such solutions, the interface problems we face, and on the means to convey information from and to the patient in an efficient and medically acceptable way. This application proves the usefulness of wireless technology in providing health care services all around the clock and everywhere the citizen is located, it proves the necessity for restructuring the medical knowledge for education delivery to the patient, and it shows the virtue of interactivity by means of using the limited, yet useful browsing capabilities of the wireless application protocol (WAP) technology."

However, there is limited data on impact of these interventions on outcomes after LT. Therefore, we conducted the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a THMP compared to standard of care (SOC) after LT.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      One hundred six consecutive LT recipients were randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 posttransplant care strategies: SOC or THMP. The THMP included an electronic tablet and bluetooth devices to support daily text messages, education videos, and video FaceTime capability; data was cyber-delivered into our electronic medical record daily. Endpoints were THMP participation, 90-day hospital readmission rate, and QOL.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred patients completed the study with 50 enrolled in each arm. Participation and adherence with telemedicine was 86% for basic health sessions (vital sign recording), but only 45% for using messaging or FaceTime. The THMP group had a lower 90-day readmission rate compared to SOC (28% vs 58%; P = 0.004). The THMP cohort also showed improved QOL in regards to physical function (P = 0.02) and general health (P = 0.05) at 90 days.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      To our knowledge, this is the first RCT demonstrating the impact of THMP after LT. The magnitude of effect on LT outcomes, hospital readmissions, and QOL suggests that the adoption of telemedicine has great potential for other major operations."

            "abstract": "Digital information technologies, such as the Internet, mobile phones and social media, provide vast amounts of data for decision-making and resource management. However, access to these technologies, as well as their associated software and training materials, is not evenly distributed: since the 1990s there has been concern about a \"Digital Divide\" between the data-rich and the data-poor. We present an innovative metric for evaluating international variations in access to digital data: the Data Poverty Index (DPI). The DPI is based on Internet speeds, numbers of computer owners and Internet users, mobile phone ownership and network coverage, as well as provision of higher education. The datasets used to produce the DPI are provided annually for almost all the countries of the world and can be freely downloaded. The index that we present in this 'proof of concept' study is the first to quantify and visualise the problem of global data poverty, using the most recent datasets, for 2013. The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction. The DPI highlights countries where support is needed for improving access to the Internet and for the provision of training in geoinfomatics. We conclude that the DPI is of value as a potential metric for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction."

Following a successful local use of a simple telehealth intervention ('Florence') for the diagnosis and management of hypertension, the Advice & Interactive Messaging (AIM) for Health simple telehealth programme was launched across England in March 2013. Four protocols were developed to diagnose and monitor blood pressure (BP). The aim of this service evaluation was to identify the extent to which predefined service outcomes, regarding ascertainment of a diagnosis of hypertension, and achievement of hypertension control, were met for the hypertension protocols.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with opportunistic raised BP in general practice or diagnosed hypertension were selected by their usual primary care providers to register onto diagnostic or monitoring hypertension protocols, respectively. Florence sent patients prompts via text messaging to submit readings, educational messages and user satisfaction questions. Patient responses were stored on Florence for review by their primary care health providers. This service evaluation used data from 2963 patients from general practices across England registered onto one of four AIM hypertension protocols from inception to January 2014.

Engagement of participants with the website was assessed by monitoring usage of the individual social networking functions (e.g. status post). The results demonstrate that users generally preferred contributing non-interactive public posts of information concerned with their individual physical activity levels, and more occasionally communicating privately to friends. Further analysis of topics within posts was done by classifying word usage frequencies. Results indicated that the dominant topics are well aligned with the social environment within which physical activity takes place. Topics centred around four main areas: description of the activity, timing of the activity, affective response to the activity, and context within which the activity occurs. These findings suggest that strong levels of user awareness and communication occur in the social networking setting, indicative of beneficial self-image and self-actualisation effects."

The mobile electrochemical analytical system has been evaluated in the laboratory with a model redox system - the reduction of hexacyanoferrate(III) - and also with commercially available enzymatic blood-glucose test-strips. The potentiostat communicates wirelessly with mobile devices such as tablets or Smartphones by near-field communication (NFC) or with personal computers by radio-frequency identification (RFID), and thus provides a solution to the 'missing link' in connectivity that often exists between low-cost mobile and wearable chemical sensors and ubiquitous mobile computing products. The mobile potentiostat has been evaluated in the laboratory with a set of proof-of-concept experiments, and its analytical performance compared with a commercial laboratory potentiostat (R(2)=0.9999). These first experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the wireless potentiostat and suggest that the device could be suitable for wearable and point-of-sample analytical measurements.

The Web-based portal was designed for clinicians to monitor patients' conditions and to support self-care regimens. The two-way communication protocol was developed to facilitate secure and efficient data exchange between the apps and the portal. The 3 phases of usability study discovered usability issues in the areas of self-care workflow, navigation and interface, and communications between the apps and the portal. The system was used by 14 patients in the first 6 months of the clinical implementation, with 1 drop out due to having a poor wireless connection. The apps have been highly utilized consistently by patients, even those addressing complex issues such as medication and skincare. The patterns of utilization showed an increase in use in the first month, followed by a plateau.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The system was capable of supporting self-care and adherence to regimen, monitoring adherence, supporting clinician engagement with patients, and has been highly utilized."

A population-based sample of 392 patients with an HF diagnosis from 4 Veterans Affairs centers who had a Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) overall summary score of less than 60 (heavy symptom burden and impaired functional status and quality of life) were enrolled between May 2009 and June 2011.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nThe PCDM intervention included collaborative care by a multidisciplinary care team consisting of a nurse coordinator, cardiologist, psychiatrist, and primary care physician; home telemonitoring and patient self-management support; and screening and treatment for comorbid depression.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was change in the KCCQ overall summary score at 1 year (a 5-point change is clinically significant). Mortality, hospitalization, and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) were secondary outcomes.\n## RESULTS\nThere were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients randomized to the PCDM intervention (n=187) vs usual care (n=197); baseline mean KCCQ overall summary scores were 37.9 vs 36.9 (P=.48). There was significant improvement in the KCCQ overall summary scores in both groups after 1 year (mean change, 13.5 points in each group), with no significant difference between groups (P=.97). The intervention was not associated with greater improvement in the KCCQ overall summary scores when the effect over time was estimated using 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month data (P=.74). Among secondary outcomes, there were significantly fewer deaths at 1 year in the intervention arm (8 of 187 [4.3%]) than in the usual care arm (19 of 197 [9.6%]) (P = .04).

The medical research literature has identified the impact of publication bias in clinical trials. Selective publication for positive outcomes or nonpublication of negative results could misdirect subsequent research and result in literature reviews leaning toward positive outcomes. Digital health trials face specific challenges, including a high attrition rate, usability issues, and insufficient formative research. These challenges may contribute to nonpublication of the trial results. To our knowledge, no study has thus far reported the nonpublication rates of digital health trials.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The primary research objective was to evaluate the nonpublication rate of digital health randomized clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. Our secondary research objective was to determine whether industry funding contributes to nonpublication of digital health trials.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To identify digital health trials, a list of 47 search terms was developed through an iterative process and applied to the \"Title,\" \"Interventions,\" and \"Outcome Measures\" fields of registered trials with completion dates between April 1, 2010, and April 1, 2013. The search was based on the full dataset exported from the ClinlicalTrials.gov database, with 265,657 trials entries downloaded on February 10, 2018, to allow publication of studies within 5 years of trial completion. We identified publications related to the results of the trials through a comprehensive approach that included an automated and manual publication-identification process.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 6717 articles matched the a priori search terms, of which 803 trials matched our latest completion date criteria.

In bivariate analyses, we observed statistically significant differences in trial characteristics between published and unpublished trials in terms of the intervention target condition, country, trial size, trial phases, recruitment, and prospective trial registration. In multivariate analyses, differences in trial characteristics between published and unpublished trials remained statistically significant for the intervention target condition, country, trial size, trial phases, and recruitment; the odds of publication for non-US-based trials were significant, and these trials were 3.3 (95% CI 1.845-5.964) times more likely to be published than US-based trials.

The high speed wireless RPM system will be an integral part of the mobile health (mHealth) paradigm reducing cost and providing better service to the patients. While the high speed wireless RPM system will allow clinicians to monitor various chronic and acute medical conditions, the reliability of such system will depend on the network Quality of Service (QoS). The RPM system needs to be resilient to temporary reduced network QoS. This paper presents a highly survivable bed pressure mat RPM system design using an adaptive information content management methodology for the monitored sensor data. The proposed design improves the resiliency of the RPM system under adverse network conditions like congestion and/or temporary loss of connectivity. It also shows how the proposed RPM system can reduce the information rate and correspondingly reduce the data transfer rate by a factor of 5.5 and 144 to address temporary network congestion. The RPM system data rate reduction results in a lower specificity and sensitivity for the features being monitored but increases the survivability of the system from 1 second to 2.4 minutes making it highly robust."

            "abstract": "Research on electronic healthcare (eHealth) systems has increased dramatically in recent years. eHealth represents a significant example of the application of the Internet of Things (IoT), characterized by its cost effectiveness, increased reliability, and minimal human eff ort in nursing assistance. The remote monitoring of patients through a wearable sensing network has outstanding potential in current healthcare systems. Such a network can continuously monitor the vital health conditions (such as heart rate variability, blood pressure, glucose level, and oxygen saturation) of patients with chronic diseases. Low-power radio-frequency (RF) technologies, especially Bluetooth low energy (BLE), play significant roles in modern healthcare. However, most of the RF spectrum is licensed and regulated, and the effect of RF on human health is of major concern. Moreover, the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio in high distance can be decreased to a considerable extent, possibly leading to the increase in bit-error rate. Optical camera communication (OCC), which uses a camera to receive data from a light-emitting diode (LED), can be utilized in eHealth to mitigate the limitations of RF. However, OCC also has several limitations, such as high signal-blockage probability. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid OCC/BLE system is proposed to ensure efficient, remote, and real-time transmission of a patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) signal to a monitor. First, a patch circuit integrating an LED array and BLE transmitter chip is proposed. The patch collects the ECG data according to the health condition of the patient to minimize power consumption. Second, a network selection algorithm is developed for a new network access request generated in the patch circuit. Third, fuzzy logic is employed to select an appropriate camera for data reception. Fourth, a handover mechanism is suggested to ensure efficient network allocation considering the patient's mobility. Finally, simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance and reliability of the proposed system."

            "abstract": "Recent trends of population aging and globalization have required an increasing number of individuals to act as long distance caregivers (LDCs) to aging family members. Information technology solutions may ease the burden placed on LDCs by providing remote monitoring, easier access to information and enhanced communication. While some technology tools have been introduced, the information and technology needs of LDCs in particular are not well understood. Consequently, a needs assessment was performed by using video conferencing software to conduct semi-structured interviews with 10 LDCs. Interviews were enriched through the use of stimulus materials that included the demonstration of a prototype LDC health management web/mobile app. Responses were recorded, transcribed and then analyzed. Subjects indicated that information regarding medication regimens and adherence, calendaring, and cognitive health were most needed. Participants also described needs for video calling, activity data regarding sleep and physical exercise, asynchronous communication, photo sharing, journaling, access to online health resources, real-time monitoring, an overall summary of health, and feedback/suggestions to help them improve as caregivers. In addition, all respondents estimated their usage of a LDC health management website would be at least once per week, with half indicating a desire to access the website from a smartphone. These findings are being used to inform the design of a LDC health management website to promote the meaningful involvement of distant family members in the care of older adults."

We studied mobile phone access among patients with tuberculosis, focusing on vulnerable patients and patients who later had adverse treatment outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In a prospective cohort study in Callao, Peru, we recruited and interviewed 2584 patients with tuberculosis between 2007 and 2013 and followed them until 2016 for adverse treatment outcomes using national treatment registers. Subsequently, we recruited a further 622 patients between 2016 and 2017.

Patients without access were more likely to hold a lower socioeconomic position, suffer from food insecurity and be older than 50 years (all P < 0.01). Compared to patients with mobile phone access, patients without access at recruitment were more likely to subsequently have incomplete treatment (20% vs. 13%, RR = 1.5; P = 0.001) or an adverse treatment outcome (29% vs. 23% RR = 1.3; P = 0.006).

Real-time monitoring features for supporting mobile care require the easy conduction of self-measurements on vital signs for patients. Therefore, a vital sign telemonitoring system got conceptualized, utilizing the potential of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The aim of this work was to gather technical and user-related requirements for a patient-centered telemonitoring system. Therefore, a mixed approach was followed comprising a comprehensive technical review, a literature review and interviews with stakeholders. Suitable use cases were derived from the gathered technical and user-related requirements. The results yielded to a concept for a seamless integrated, unobtrusive home monitoring system for elderly people with real-time data synchronization and communication features to support the mobile nurse organization, which got implemented and evaluated in the field. The concept overcomes known barriers of usability on telemonitoring systems like complex interaction which might lead to more efficiency and effectiveness in mobile nursing. The developed concept got further implemented as a prototype and validated within a 3-month test period."

The current study aimed to investigate the benefits of a TM system in managing AE in advanced-stage COPD patients to improve their Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and to reduce utilization of healthcare services.\n## METHODS\nA 12-month Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in the Veneto region (Italy). Adult patients diagnosed with Class III-IV COPD in accordance with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification were recruited and provided a TM system to alert the clinical staff via a trained operator whenever variations in respiratory parameters fell beyond the individual's normal range. The study's primary endpoint was HRQL, measured by the Italian version of the two Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF36v2). Its secondary endpoints were: scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the number and duration of hospitalizations; the number of readmissions; the number of appointments with a pulmonary specialist; the number of visits to the emergency department; and the number of deaths.\n## RESULTS\nThree hundred thirty-four patients were enrolled and randomized into two groups for a 1 year period. At its conclusion, changes in the SF36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores did not significantly differ between the TM and control groups [(-2.07 (8.98) vs -1.91 (7.75); p = 0.889 and -1.08 (11.30) vs -1.92 (10.92); p = 0.5754, respectively]. Variations in HADS were not significantly different between the two groups [0.85 (3.68) vs 0.62 (3.6); p = 0.65 and 0.50 (4.3) vs 0.72 (4.5); p = 0.71]. The hospitalization rate for AECOPD and/or for any cause was not significantly different in the two groups [IRR = 0.89 (95% CI 0.79-1,04); p = 0.16 and IRR = 0.91 (95% CI 0,75 - 1.04); p = 0.16, respectively]. The readmission rate for AECOPD and/or any cause was, however, significantly lower in the TM group with respect to the control one [IRR = 0.43 (95% CI 0.19-0.98); p = 0.01 and 0.46 (95% CI 0.24-0.89); p = 0.01, respectively].\n## CONCLUSION\nStudy results showed that in areas where medical services are well established, TM does not significantly improve HRQL in patients with COPD who develop AE. Although not effective in reducing hospitalizations, TM can nevertheless facilitate continuity of care during hospital-to-home transition by reducing the need for early readmission.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nRetrospectively registered on January 2012, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01513980 .\n"

Telemedicine is a form of remote medical practice using information and communication technologies. It connects one or more health professionals with other health professionals or with patients. Within the framework of emergencies in maxillofacial surgery, requests received for specialist advice often pertain to procedures to be followed for facial wounds, bites, burns, maxillofacial bone trauma or facial cellulitis. These requests for specialist advice were previously made by phone between emergency physicians and maxillofacial specialists, with exchange of patient photos by text messaging, which raised security issues. We collaborated with the Telehealth Normandy Health Cooperation Group (GCS TSBN) for the implementation of a mobile application using the \"Therap-e\" telemedicine platform. This platform links together websites and remote health professionals via the Internet. Physicians communicate over a mobile network or from a health institution, in online or offline mode, synchronously or asynchronously, using any medium (tablet, PC, Mac, smartphone). This scheme both ensures secure transmission of personal and clinical data (especially facial photographs) and records specialist advice in patient medical records.

Increasing the number of doctors and charitable medical hospitals or deploying advanced medical technologies in these areas might not be economically feasible, especially in developing countries. We need to mobilize science and technology to master this complex, large scale problem in an objective, logical, and professional way. This can only be achieved with a collaborative effort where a team of experts works on both technical and non-technical aspects of this health care divide. In this paper we use a systems engineering framework to discuss hospital networks which might be solution for the problem. We argue that with the advancement in communication and networking technologies, economically middle class people and even some rural poor have access to internet and mobile communication systems. Thus, Hospital Digital Networking Technologies (HDNT), such as telemedicine, can be developed to utilize internet, mobile and satellite communication systems to connect primitive rural healthcare centers to well advanced modern urban setups and thereby provide better consultation and diagnostic care to the needy people.

The present study was performed to determine the added benefit of incorporating DHK's into a formal readmissions reduction program (RRP) in preventing 30-d readmissions and to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the use of these devices.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis was a prospective study of all adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution from March 2014 to June 2015. During the study period, 443 adult patients (mean age, 65 ± 14, 33% female) were identified and participated in the formal RRP, 27 of whom also received a DHK after discharge (416 control group). In addition to providing a live video link to a provider specializing in cardiac surgery, the DHK also allowed for automatic daily transmission of weight, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients also completed a daily health survey targeting symptoms concerning for heart failure, poor wound healing, poor ambulation, and nonadherence to medications. Abnormal vitals or survey responses triggered automatic notifications to the healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of the healthcare team. Pearson χ(2) test and the Welch's t-test were used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables.\n## RESULTS\nDuring the study period, the readmission rate for the DHK and control groups were similar (7.4% versus 9.9%, P = 0.65). The use of DHKs led to 1649 alerts and 144 interventions, with the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9. The majority of alerts (64%) were prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, and a significant correlation was noted between abnormal biometrics and required intervention (r = 0.62, P < 0.001). No correlation was seen between alerts because of health survey responses (r = 0.07, P = 0.71) or missed check-ins (r = 0.06, P = 0.76) and required interventions. Poststudy satisfaction surveys showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9 ± 0.5 for DHK patients and 4.9 ± 0.2 for members of the care team (scale 1-5, 5 = agree).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn our study, adding DHKs to a formal RRP was not associated with a significant decrease in 30-d readmission rates. We also found that notifications because of abnormal biometric measures were significantly correlated with required interventions. In contrast, notifications due to abnormal health survey responses were not associated with increased interventions. Both patients and members of the healthcare team were highly satisfied with this technology. DHKs appear to extend care beyond the inpatient period and provide a portal for telemonitoring of surgical patients. However, this modality is highly resource intensive and may not significantly reduce readmissions. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of such kits in reducing readmissions and costs of care.\n"

            "abstract": "Recent technological advances in wireless communications and physiological sensing allow miniature, lightweight, ultra-low power, intelligent monitoring devices, which can be integrated into a Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) for health monitoring. Physiological signals of humans such as heartbeats, temperature and pulse can be monitored from a distant location using tiny biomedical wireless sensors. Hence, it is highly essential to combine the ubiquitous computing with mobile health technology using wireless sensors and smart phones to monitor the well-being of chronic patients such as cardiac, Parkinson and epilepsy patients. Since physiological data of a patient are highly sensitive, maintaining its confidentiality is highly essential. Hence, security is a vital research issue in mobile health (mHealth) applications, especially if a patient has an embarrassing disease. In this paper a three tier security architecture for the mHealth application is proposed, in which light weight data confidentiality and authentication protocols are proposed to maintain the privacy of a patient. Moreover, considering the energy and hardware constraints of the wireless body sensors, low complexity data confidential and authentication schemes are designed. Performance evaluation of the proposed architecture shows that they can satisfy the energy and hardware limitations of the sensors and still can maintain the secure fabrics of the wireless body sensor networks. Besides, the proposed schemes can outperform in terms of energy consumption, memory usage and computation time over standard key establishment security scheme."

An informed consent form and a paper questionnaire were given to students aged 18 to 24 years in 4 university campuses in Bordeaux, France. The survey was formulated in 3 sections: (1) sociodemographic characteristics and self-rated general and mental health, (2) information about the use of digital health, and (3) opinions about digital health. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and tests of independence.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 59.8% (303/507 females) students completed the questionnaire. Concerning digital health use, 34.9% (174/498) had at least 1 health app mostly for physical activity (49.4%, 86/174) and general health monitoring (41.4%, 72/174,), but only 3.9% (20/507) of students had a wearable device. Almost all (94.8%, 450/476) had searched for Web-based health-related information at least once in the last 12 months. The most sought health-related topics were nutrition (68.1%, 324/476); pain and illnesses (64.5%, 307/476); and stress, anxiety, or depression (51.1%, 243/476).

            "abstract": "Lately, we see that Internet of things (IoT) is introduced in medical services for global connection among patients, sensors, and all nearby things. The principal purpose of this global connection is to provide context awareness for the purpose of bringing convenience to a patient's life and more effectively implementing clinical processes. In health care, monitoring of biosignals of a patient has to be continuously performed while the patient moves inside and outside the hospital. Also, to monitor the accurate location and biosignals of the patient, appropriate mobility management is necessary to maintain connection between the patient and the hospital network. In this paper, a binding update scheme on PMIPv6, which reduces signal traffic during location updates by Virtual LMA (VLMA) on the top original Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) Domain, is proposed to reduce the total cost. If a Mobile Node (MN) moves to a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)-located boundary of an adjacent LMA domain, the MN changes itself into a virtual mode, and this movement will be assumed to be a part of the VLMA domain. In the proposed scheme, MAGs eliminate global binding updates for MNs between LMA domains and significantly reduce the packet loss and latency by eliminating the handoff between LMAs. In conclusion, the performance analysis results show that the proposed scheme improves performance significantly versus PMIPv6 and HMIPv6 in terms of the binding update rate per user and average handoff latency."

We conducted an eight month randomised-controlled-trial to study the effect of an automated telemedicine intervention on patients’ time-to-hospitalisation.\n## METHODS\nA total of 168 patients with a diagnosis of COPD in the past 24 months were enrolled to receive the intervention at a primary care clinic. The treatment group received daily phone messages from an automated system asking them to report if they were breathing better than, worse than, or the same as the day prior. Patients reported their breathing status by responding to the text message or call. If a patient reported breathing worse, an alert was sent directly to that patient’s provider within the clinic. The control group received the same daily phone messages as the treatment group. However, no proactive breathing alerts were ever generated to the provider for these subjects. The primary outcome was the subjects’ time-to-first-COPD-related hospitalisation following the start of messages.\n## RESULTS\nThe treatment group’s time-to-hospitalisation was significantly different than the control group’s with a hazard ratio of 2.36 (95% confidence interval 1.02–5.45, p = 0.0443). The number needed-to-treat ratio was 8.62. Subject engagement consistently ranged between 60% and 75%. The treatment group received both proactive monitoring and follow-up care from the providers.\n## DISCUSSION\nActive monitoring with provider feedback enables the detection of exacerbation events early enough for subjects to avoid admissions. The use of non-smartphone interventions reduces barriers to care presented by more complicated and expensive technologies.

            "abstract": "The number of wearable wireless sensors is expected to grow to 400 million by the year 2014, while the number of operational mobile subscribers has already passed the 5.2 billion mark in 2011. This growth results in an increasing number of mobile applications including: Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, Electronic-Health (eHealth), and Mobile-Health (mHealth). A number of emerging mobile applications that require 3G and 4G mobile networks for data transport relate to telemedicine, including establishing, maintaining, and transmitting health-related information, research, education, and training. This review paper takes a closer look at these applications, specifically with regard to the healthcare industry and their underlying link technologies. The authors believe that the BlackBerry platform and the associated infrastructure (i.e., BlackBerry Enterprise Server) is a logical and practical solution for eHealth, mHealth, sensor and M2M deployments, which are considered in this paper."

            "abstract": "In 2005, all WHO Member States pledged to fight for universal health coverage (UHC). The availability of financial, human and technological resources seems to be necessary to develop efficient health policies and also to offer UHC. One of the main challenges facing the health sector comes from the need to innovate efficiently. The intense use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the health field evidences a notable improvement in results obtained by institutions, health professionals and patients, principally in developed countries. In the Americas, the relationship between economic development and health innovation is not particularly evident. Data from 19 of 35 countries surveyed in the 2015 Third Global Survey on eHealth for the region of the Americas were analysed. 52.6% of the countries of the Americas have a national policy or strategy for UHC. 57.9% of the countries in the sample indicate that they have a national eHealth policy or strategy, but only 26.3% have an entity that supervises the quality, safety and reliability regulations for mobile health applications. The survey data indicate that high-income and low-income to middle-income countries show higher percentages in relation to the existence of entities that promote innovation. These countries also exceed 60%-compared with 40% and 50% in lower-income countries-in all cases regarding the use of eHealth practices, such as mobile health, remote patient monitoring or telehealth. 100% of low-income countries report offering ICT training to healthcare professionals, compared with 83% of wealthy countries and 81% of middle-income to high-income countries."

However, the burden of cancer among the US population is not shared equally, with racial and ethnic minorities and lower-income populations having a higher cancer burden compared with their counterparts. For example, African Americans have the highest mortality rates and shortest survival rates for most cancers compared with other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. A wide range of technologies (eg, internet-based [electronic health, eHealth] technologies, mobile [mobile health, mHealth] apps, and telemedicine) available to patients are designed to improve their access to care and empower them to participate actively in their care, providing a means to reduce health care disparities; however, little is known of their use among underserved populations.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to systematically review the current evidence on the use of cancer-specific patient-centered technologies among various underserved populations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Computer-based search was conducted in the following academic databases: (1) PubMed (cancer subset), (2) MEDLINE, (3) PsycINFO, and (4) CINAHL. We included studies that were peer-reviewed, published in the English language, and conducted in the United States. Each study was individually assessed for relevance, with any disagreements being reconciled by consensus. We used a 3-step inclusion process in which we examined study titles, abstracts, and full-text papers for assessment of inclusion criteria. We systematically extracted information from each paper meeting our inclusion criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      This review includes 71 papers that use patient-centered technologies that primarily targeted African Americans (n=31), rural populations (n=14), and Hispanics (n=12).

Studies on mHealth found that participants reported overall favorable responses to receiving health information via short message service (SMS) text message; however, challenges were experienced with respect to lack of knowledge of how to text among some participants. More complex mobile technologies (eg, a tablet-based risk assessment tool) were also found favorable to use and acceptable among underserved populations; however, they also resulted in more significant barriers, for example, participants expressed concerns regarding security and unfamiliarity with the technology and preferred further instruction and assistance in its use.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is a growing body of literature exploring patient-centered technology and its influence on care of underserved populations.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an e-health monitoring system with minimum service delay and privacy preservation by exploiting geo-distributed clouds. In the system, the resource allocation scheme enables the distributed cloud servers to cooperatively assign the servers to the requested users under the load balance condition. Thus, the service delay for users is minimized. In addition, a traffic-shaping algorithm is proposed. The traffic-shaping algorithm converts the user health data traffic to the nonhealth data traffic such that the capability of traffic analysis attacks is largely reduced. Through the numerical analysis, we show the efficiency of the proposed traffic-shaping algorithm in terms of service delay and privacy preservation. Furthermore, through the simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation scheme significantly reduces the service delay compared to two other alternatives using jointly the short queue and distributed control law."

Mobile health (mhealth) education technologies present a promising mechanism for improving cancer prevention, treatment, and follow-up. The purpose of this study was to summarize the literature related to mobile phone (mhealth) applications for patient education specific to cancer and identify current recommendations from randomized studies. In particular, we were interested in identifying mobile phone applications along the cancer continuum, from cancer prevention to survivorship. The authors identified 28 articles reporting on mobile applications for patients related to cancer. Articles were identified in all categories along the cancer continuum, including health professional involvement in application development. Of these, six involved direct patient education, and eight focused on improving patient/professional communication and patient self-management. However, only six of the studies were randomized interventions. The potential for mobile applications to help overcome the \"health care gap\" has not yet been realized in the studies from the USA that were reviewed for this paper. However, early recommendations are emerging that support the use of mHealth communications to change behaviors for cancer prevention, early detection, and symptom management and improved patient-provider communication. Recommendations include short messages, use of multiple modalities as patient characteristics dictate comfort with mHealth communication, and the inclusion of patients and health professionals to develop and test applications. Tailoring mHealth to particular cultures, languages, and ethnic groups may also represent a unique possibility to provide accessible information and education at minimal cost for under-resourced communities and individuals."

It comes from the need for maintenance of healthcare among patients and elderly people that leads to the demand on change in traditional monitoring approaches among chronic disease patients and alert on acute events. In this paper, we propose a new automated patient diagnosis called automated patient diagnosis (AUPA) using ATmega microcontrollers over environmental sensors. AUPA monitors and aggregates data from patients through network connected over web server and mobile network. The scheme supports variable data management and route establishment. Data transfer is established using adaptive route discovery and management approaches. AUPA supports minimizing packet loss and delay, handling erroneous data, and providing optimized decision-making for healthcare support. The performance of AUPA's QoS approach is tested using a set of health-related sensors which gather the patient's data over variable period of time and send from a source to destination AUPA node. Experimental results show that AUPA outperforms the existing schemes, namely SPIN and LEACH, with minimal signal loss rate and a better neighborhood node selection and link selection. It diminishes the jitter compared to the related algorithms. Graphical abstract Stack architecture of AUPA."

            "abstract": "Diabetes patients suffer from abnormal blood glucose levels, which can cause diverse health disorders that affect their kidneys, heart and vision. Due to these conditions, diabetes patients have traditionally checked blood glucose levels through Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) techniques, like pricking their fingers multiple times per day. Such techniques involve a number of drawbacks that can be solved by using a device called Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), which can measure blood glucose levels continuously throughout the day without having to prick the patient when carrying out every measurement. This article details the design and implementation of a system that enhances commercial CGMs by adding Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to them that allow for monitoring patients remotely and, thus, warning them about potentially dangerous situations. The proposed system makes use of smartphones to collect blood glucose values from CGMs and then sends them either to a remote cloud or to distributed fog computing nodes. Moreover, in order to exchange reliable, trustworthy and cybersecure data with medical scientists, doctors and caretakers, the system includes the deployment of a decentralized storage system that receives, processes and stores the collected data. Furthermore, in order to motivate users to add new data to the system, an incentive system based on a digital cryptocurrency named GlucoCoin was devised. Such a system makes use of a blockchain that is able to execute smart contracts in order to automate CGM sensor purchases or to reward the users that contribute to the system by providing their own data. Thanks to all the previously mentioned technologies, the proposed system enables patient data crowdsourcing and the development of novel mobile health (mHealth) applications for diagnosing, monitoring, studying and taking public health actions that can help to advance in the control of the disease and raise global awareness on the increasing prevalence of diabetes."

Technology-mediated interventions have demonstrated improved clinical effectiveness in outcomes, such as viral suppression, for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). However, the evidence to support the impact of these interventions on QoL is lacking.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this paper was to assess the impact of technology-mediated interventions on QoL and to identify the instruments used to measure the QoL of PLWH.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      For this review we followed the PRISMA guidelines.

This systematic review identified four types of technology-mediated interventions and two types of QoL instruments used to examine the impact of technology-mediated interventions on PLWH. Four studies of technology-mediated interventions resulted in improvement in QoL. Four studies considered QoL as a secondary outcome and resulted in a negative or neutral impact on QoL.

Current digital communication modalities include cell phones, smartphones, interactive voice response, text messages, e-mails, clinic-based interactive video, home-based web-cams, mobile smartphone two-way cameras, personal monitoring devices, kiosks, dashboards, personal health records, web-based portals, social networking sites, secure chat rooms, and on-line forums. Improvements in digital access could drastically diminish the geographical, temporal, and cultural access problems faced by many patients. Conversely, a growing digital divide could create greater access disparities for some populations. As the paradigm of healthcare delivery evolves towards greater reliance on non-encounter-based digital communications between patients and their care teams, it is critical that our theoretical conceptualization of access undergoes a concurrent paradigm shift to make it more relevant for the digital age. The traditional conceptualizations and indicators of access are not well adapted to measure access to health services that are delivered digitally outside the context of face-to-face encounters with providers. This paper provides an overview of digital \"encounterless\" utilization, discusses the weaknesses of traditional conceptual frameworks of access, presents a new access framework, provides recommendations for how to measure access in the new framework, and discusses future directions for research on access."

Also, although many studies have referenced behavioral theory, none appears to have explicitly tested theoretical assumptions or demonstrated mechanisms of change. More robust evaluation models that incorporate theory and measurement of behavioral mediators are needed. As in all public health programs, mobile health operates within a social ecological context. For example, organizational- and individual-level programs seek to influence health and health care practices and individual health behaviors. New programs such as Text4baby demonstrate how theory and explicit testing of mediators can be incorporated in evaluations. There are challenges and opportunities facing mHealth evaluations given the nature of the mobile channel. Mobile communication is ubiquitous, available at all times and places, and thus experimental control is often difficult. Natural experiments using variation in dosage of mHealth and place- or location-based designs may increase experimental control. Text4baby is a text messaging program that provides prenatal care messages to pregnant women and new mothers. It uses a partnership model with health care facilities often serving as local implementation partners. The authors review a case example of the evaluation of Text4baby at Madigan Army Medical Center. Participants were randomized to usual prenatal care plus text messaging or usual care alone. The evaluation has a theoretical model of behavior change and measures mediators as well as behavioral outcomes. Results will inform how behavioral theory works within mobile health programs."

Adult patients with IBD who received immunosuppressants and biological agents were recruited from the IBD Unit of a tertiary university hospital. The patients were randomized into groups to receive remote monitoring (G_TECCU), nurse-assisted telephone care (G_NT), or standard care with in-person visits (G_control). All patients completed the study visits at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks in addition to each type of intervention. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients in remission at 24 weeks. Secondary health outcomes were quality of life, medication adherence, adverse effects, satisfaction, and social activities. Data on the number of outpatient visits and telephone calls, emergency visits, hospitalizations, IBD-related surgeries, and corticosteroid courses were also collected.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 63 patients were selected (21 patients in each group). During the study, 90.5% (19/21) of patients in G_control, 95.2% (20/21) in G_NT, and 85.7% (18/21) in G_TECCU were compliant to the intervention. After 24 weeks, the percentage of patients in remission was higher in G_TECCU (17/21, 81%) than in G_NT (14/21, 66.7%) and G_control (15/21, 71.4%). A higher improvement in disease activity was observed in G_TECCU than in G_control in terms of the Harvey-Bradshaw/Mayo (odds ratio=0.12, 95% CI=0.003-2.162, P=.19) and Harvey-Bradshaw/Walmsley (odds ratio=0.11, 95% CI=0.004-1.55, P=.13) indexes. Improvement in disease activity was associated with a larger reduction in fecal calprotectin values in G_TECCU compared to G_control (estimated intervention effect: odds ratio=-0.90; 95% CI=-1.96 to 0.16, P=.11). All completers adhered to treatment in G_TECCU. In addition, the quality of life, social activities, and satisfaction improved in all 3 groups. Although the number of outpatient visits and telephone calls was lower in G_TECCU than in G_NT and G_control, the safety profile was similar in all 3 groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis pilot clinical trial suggests that the TECCU Web-based system is a safe strategy for improving health outcomes in patients with complex IBD and reducing the use of health care resources.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02943538; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02943538 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/746CRRtDN).\n"

            "abstract": "Health care delivery is changing drastically. In its current state it tends to use the home care model in order to increase quality of life, to rationalize costs and to achieve wellness. Pivotal to these purposes are contact centers, which act as mediators between the medical staff and the citizens seeking advice and/or therapy. Main platforms used for the development of such applications are the INTERNET and PCs, and the telecommunication networks, including mobile solutions. In this paper, a generic contact center model shall be presented, which is under development in the context of an IST European project in health telematics entitled â Distance Information Technologies for Home care. The Citizen Health System (CHS)'. After the description of this generic contact center, an application for health care delivery to diabetic patients shall be described. In this application we shall see the possible use of the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) scheme. This application proves the usefulness of wireless technology in providing health care services all around the clock and everywhere the citizen is located, it shows the necessity for restructuring the medical knowledge for education delivery to the patient, and it shows the virtue of interactivity by means of using the limited, yet useful browsing capabilities of the WAP technology."

            "abstract": "The evidence that quality of life is a positive variable for the survival of cancer patients has prompted the interest of the health and pharmaceutical industry in considering that variable as a final clinical outcome. Sustained improvements in cancer care in recent years have resulted in increased numbers of people living with and beyond cancer, with increased attention being placed on improving quality of life for those individuals. Connected Health provides the foundations for the transformation of cancer care into a patient-centric model, focused on providing fully connected, personalized support and therapy for the unique needs of each patient. Connected Health creates an opportunity to overcome barriers to health care support among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions. This paper provides an overview of important areas for the foundations of the creation of a new Connected Health paradigm in cancer care. Here we discuss the capabilities of mobile and wearable technologies; we also discuss pervasive and persuasive strategies and device systems to provide multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches for cancer patients for mental well-being, physical activity promotion, and rehabilitation. Several examples already show that there is enthusiasm in strengthening the possibilities offered by Connected Health in persuasive and pervasive technology in cancer care. Developments harnessing the Internet of Things, personalization, patient-centered design, and artificial intelligence help to monitor and assess the health status of cancer patients. Furthermore, this paper analyses the data infrastructure ecosystem for Connected Health and its semantic interoperability with the Connected Health economy ecosystem and its associated barriers. Interoperability is essential when developing Connected Health solutions that integrate with health systems and electronic health records. Given the exponential business growth of the Connected Health economy, there is an urgent need to develop mHealth (mobile health) exponentially, making it both an attractive and challenging market. In conclusion, there is a need for user-centered and multidisciplinary standards of practice to the design, development, evaluation, and implementation of Connected Health interventions in cancer care to ensure their acceptability, practicality, feasibility, effectiveness, affordability, safety, and equity."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Seniors with chronic diseases such as heart failure have complex care needs. They are vulnerable to their condition deteriorating and, without timely intervention, may require multiple emergency department visits and/or repeated hospitalizations. Upon discharge, the transition from the emergency department to home can be a vulnerable time for recovering patients with disruptions in the continuity of care. Remote monitoring of heart failure patients using home telemonitoring, coupled with clear communication protocols between health care professionals, can be effective in increasing the safety and quality of care for seniors with heart failure discharged from the emergency department.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of the Telehealth for Emergency-Community Continuity of Care Connectivity via Home Telemonitoring (TEC4Home) study is to generate evidence through a programmatic evaluation and a clinical trial to determine how home telemonitoring may improve care and increase patient safety during the transition of care and determine how it is best implemented to support patients with heart failure within this context.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This 4-year project consists of 3 studies to comprehensively evaluate the outcomes and effectiveness of TEC4Home. Study 1 is a feasibility study with 90 patients recruited from 2 emergency department sites to test implementation and evaluation procedures. Findings from the feasibility study will be used to refine protocols for the larger trial. Study 2 is a cluster randomized controlled trial that will include 30 emergency department sites and 900 patients across British Columbia. The primary outcome of the randomized controlled trial will be emergency department revisits and hospital readmission rates. Secondary outcomes include health care resource utilization/costs, communication between members of the care team, and patient quality of life. Study 3 will run concurrently to study 2 and test the effectiveness of predictive analytic software to detect patient deterioration sooner.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      It is hypothesized that TEC4Home will be a cost-effective strategy to decrease 90-day emergency department revisits and hospital admission rates and improve comfort and quality of life for seniors with heart failure. The results from this project will also help establish an innovation pathway for rapid and rigorous introduction of innovation into the health system.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      While there is some evidence about the effectiveness of home telemonitoring for some patients and conditions, the TEC4Home project will be one of the first protocols that implements and evaluates the technology for patients with heart failure as they transition from the emergency department to home care.

            "abstract": "Depression associated with stroke affects roughly one-third of stroke survivors. Post-stroke depression (PSD) is thought to adversely influence functional outcome by limiting participation in rehabilitation, decreasing physical, social, and cognitive function, and affecting neuroplasticity thereby placing stroke survivors at high risk for future vascular events. PSD has also been associated with higher mortality rates after stroke. In Peru, a country where there is no national stroke program and mental health disorders are largely underdiagnosed and untreated, people with PSD are likely to be further challenged by dependency and impoverished conditions that will limit their use of ambulatory services, leading to inadequate clinical follow-up. In this scenario, mobile health (mHealth) technology offers a promising approach to extend access to high-quality and culturally tailored evidence-based psychological care to address PSD given that cell phone use, Internet connectivity, and digital health technology have met a rapid growth in the last years and thus contribute to the attainment of broader Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The limited evidence of the effectiveness of mHealth for PSD calls for researchers to fill a knowledge gap where Peru poses as an ideal setting because rapid expansion of digital technology and current mental healthcare reform could be leveraged to enhance post-stroke outcomes. This article proposes the rationale for a suitable evidence-driven, mHealth-based, PSD self-management intervention called iMOODS-Investigating the role of mHealth in overcoming occurrence of depression after stroke-that could be tested among recent stroke patients with PSD in resource constrained settings."

We developed a care pathway for postoperative home monitoring of IBD patients using telehealth applications.Materials and Methods:We performed a retrospective cohort study with a matched control group to assess the efficacy of the Tight Control Surgery Scenario (TCSS), a 4-week postoperative care pathway. IBD patients aged 18 or older who underwent an IBD-related intestinal operation between October 2013 and December 2015 were eligible. Enrolled participants submitted postsurgical questionnaires and wound photos through e-mail. We measured patient satisfaction with the care pathway and assessed its impact on 30-day postoperative hospital readmission rates, emergency department (ED) visits, and gastroenterologist (GI)-related office visits.Results:Sixty-four (n) cases were enrolled in TCSS and matched to 64 historic controls. Patients who completed the additional evaluation survey expressed overall satisfaction. Readmissions, 30-day ED rates, and GI visits were numerically higher in cases compared with controls, but this difference was not statistically significant.Discussion:TCSS demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a telehealth care coordination platform for postsurgery IBD management. Patients with more complications may have sent in more photos due to greater concern for maintaining their health.Conclusions:Implementation of TCSS for easy home monitoring is feasible. While we did not see reductions in ED visits, GI follow-up visits, or readmissions, patient satisfaction was high, thus demonstrating its feasibility for telehealth applications."

Patient monitoring system plays vital role in the hospital particularly in the emergency ward to resolve certain problems such as maintaining glucose level in the body, maintaining minimum sugar levels under emergency conditions. IOT find tremendous application in the hospital to deal with certain issues such as injection of drug to the patients by doctor from remote places, monitoring patients heart beats, sugar level by the concerned doctors. MIMO finds many applications in medical field to enrich data rate while communication patient information at faster rate. We utilize MC-CDMA system to accommodate large user patients information and to transmit such information with high resolution by eliminating channel impairments. We are utilizing Cognitive spectrum for medical image transmission of higher bandwidth applications. We realize Double-space-time transmit diversity as MIMO profile to boost up throughput. We perform multi-carrier modulation using IDFT at the transmitter .we carryout demodulation employing DFT at the hospital. We introduce Multi-carrier communication to fulfil the need of bandwidth efficiency and to diminish frequency selectivity effects.In the application layer, we estimate patient's information with aid of block-nulling decoding algorithm. Moreover we analyze the quality of image of D-STTD MC-CDMA system with turbo style of channel encoder to manifest medical image with high resolution with less signal strength. We conclude that Cognitive D-STTD MC-CDMA system provides reliable communication for the application of IOT and also transfer high resolution medical image with less signal strength in order to observe patient status by doctor."

Early detection of any alteration using telemonitoring of multiple vital parameters may avoid severe decompensation requiring hospital admission. The feasibility and the clinical outcome using a new telemonitoring device for recording multiple vital parameters and allowing communication on individual state of health is investigated. Twenty-four patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 65 years, mean LV ejection fraction 35%) requiring at least one hospital admission during the past year were investigated. Twice a day, the vital-parameters were measured (weight, blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, oxygen saturation, respiration rate) and patients information on well being, shortness of breath, medication, and request for contact were received. Intra-individual comparison was carried out between the 12 month before inclusion in this study and 12 month under telemonitoring surveillance (extrapolated, if necessary). Performing over 10 500 measurements during 5751 patient days, critical events were diagnosed for 55 events concerning relative weight gain (43 episodes), blood pressure (6), decrease in oxygen saturation (3), new onset of atrial fibrillation with tachyarrhymia (3). Of these, 45 events were controlled on an outpatient basis by changing medication or external cardioversion. Only 10 patients required re-admission. Thus, the number of admission to the hospital could be reduced by 62%, those of days spent in hospital by 69%. Non-invasive telemonitoring of multiple vital parameters combined with patients statements on their health condition and out-patient treatment on the basis of these findings is found to be an effective and reliable approach to avoid hospital readmission for patients with chronic heart failure."

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus were searched for studies reporting the use of mobile health applications (apps) for managing headache disorders. Different combinations of keywords for mobile health, smartphone and headache were used for electronic search. Six studies (two journal papers and four conference papers) met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. All of the reviewed studies were categorised as the lowest level (level IV) of evidence according to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) hierarchy of evidence. The results of the studies demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a few mobile apps for headache in very limited settings, and indicated that these apps can be effective tools for identifying trigger factors of migraine, improving self-management of headache disorders, and mediating the interactions between headache sufferers and their treating doctors. The role of participatory research and involvement of patients and clinicians in the development of such apps was also highlighted. Despite the availability of numerous mobile apps for headache disorders, the evidence base to support their effectiveness and clinical safety is very weak. The current literature indicates that mobile apps have the potential for improving the care of headache sufferers, but this is yet to be proven by adequately designed studies."

Barriers including practical difficulties administering printed questionnaires have limited their use. Telehealth technology could reduce these barriers and encourage better doctor-patient interaction regarding patient symptoms and quality-of-life monitoring. The aim of this study was to develop a new system for transmitting patients' self-reported outcomes using mobile phones or the internet, and to test whether patients can and will use the system via a mobile phone.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We have developed a prototype of a Wireless Health Outcomes Monitoring System, which allows structured questionnaires to be sent to the patient by their medical management team.

Most of the current devices are equipped with remote monitoring functions, including bioimpedance for fluid status monitoring. The question remains whether bioimpedance measurements positively impact clinical outcome.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical interventions taken based on remote bioimpedance monitoring alerts and their impact on clinical outcome.\n## METHODS\nThis is a single-center observational study of consecutive ICD and CRT patients (n=282) participating in protocol-driven remote follow-up. Bioimpedance alerts were analyzed with subsequently triggered interventions.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 55.0% (155/282) of patients had an ICD or CRT device equipped with a remote bioimpedance algorithm. During 34 (SD 12) months of follow-up, 1751 remote monitoring alarm notifications were received (2.2 per patient-year of follow-up), comprising 2096 unique alerts (2.6 per patient-year of follow-up). Since 591 (28.2%) of all incoming alerts were bioimpedance-related, patients with an ICD or CRT including a bioimpedance algorithm had significantly more alerts (3.4 versus 1.8 alerts per patient-year of follow-up, P<.001). Bioimpedance-only alerts resulted in a phone contact in 91.0% (498/547) of cases, which triggered an actual intervention in 15.9% (87/547) of cases, since in 75.1% (411/547) of cases reenforcing heart failure education sufficed. Overall survival was lower in patients with a cardiovascular implantable electronic device with a bioimpedance algorithm; however, this difference was driven by differences in baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio of 2.118, 95% CI 0.845-5.791). No significant differences between both groups were observed in terms of the number of follow-up visits in the outpatient heart failure clinic, the number of hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of heart failure, or mean length of hospital stay.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBioimpedance-only alerts constituted a substantial amount of incoming alerts when turned on during remote follow-up and triggered an additional intervention in only 16% of cases since in 75% of cases, providing general heart failure education sufficed. The high frequency of heart failure education that was provided could have contributed to fewer heart failure-related hospitalizations despite significant differences in baseline characteristics.\n"

One is an attempt to create a scalable clinical decision support system by engaging a global network of specialist doctors and reversing some of the damaging effects of medical brain drain. The other efficiently extracts digital information from paper-based records using low-cost and locally produced tools such as rubber stamps to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines.

Cell phone owners were younger and more educated than nonowners. Transportation difficulty and forgetting appointments were cited as significant barriers by 34.2% and 39.5% of respondents, respectively. Fifty-six percent of subjects felt it would be acceptable to receive text message appointment reminders, and 33% felt that text message reminders to take medications would be acceptable. Younger age and cell phone ownership were significantly associated with acceptance of text message reminders. Black and Hispanic subjects were more likely to feel that text message reminders for appointments or medications were helpful than White subjects. Further, Black and Hispanic subjects, as well as subjects with lower educational attainment, were more receptive to healthcare-related educational text messages.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cell phones and text messaging were prevalent among our subjects attending HIV and TB clinics, and subjects were generally receptive to text messaging for healthcare-related communication.

The mobile Web form was automatically adjusted to fit the different display resolutions of the terminal devices. The system provided reliable exchange of all relevant information between a doctor and the asthma patient using wireless mobile transmission. E-mail and Short Messaging Service (SMS) were used to send messages to patients, for example in the case of an automatically determined patient alert. Patients could obtain customized instructions according to their daily personal symptoms, peak expiratory flow (PEF), medications and activity restriction. The daily graph of PEF and the graphs of symptoms and medication were particularly useful for asthma patient control and self-awareness of the progress of the disease."

However, it requires a process of adaptation not always achieved due to poor compliance. The role of telemonitoring of NIV is not yet established.\n## OBJECTIVES\nTo test the advantage of using modem communication in NIV of ALS patients.\n## DESIGN\nProspective, single blinded controlled trial. Population and methods According to their residence, 40 consecutive ventilated ALS patients were assigned to one of two groups: a control group (G1, n=20) in which compliance and ventilator parameter settings were assessed during office visits; or an intervention group (G2, n=20) in which patients received a modem device connected to the ventilator. The number of office and emergency room visits and hospital admissions during the entire span of NIV use and the number of parameter setting changes to achieve full compliance were the primary outcome measurements.\n## RESULTS\nDemographic and clinical features were similar between the two groups at admission. No difference in compliance was found between the groups. The incidence of changes in parameter settings throughout the survival period with NIV was lower in G2 (p<0.0001) but it was increased during the initial period needed to achieve full compliance. The number of office or emergency room visits and inhospital admissions was significantly lower in G2 (p<0.0001). Survival showed a trend favouring G2 (p=0.13).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study shows that telemonitoring reduces health care utilisation with probable favourable implications on costs, survival and functional status.\n"

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are emerging as a possible solution for supporting long-term engagement in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV care continuum. In order to explore acceptability and feasibility of mobile health (mHealth) interventions in this context, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) to assess trends in smartphone usage in postpartum women. In six FGDs, we interviewed 27 HIV-positive, postpartum women who attended regular care at the Gugulethu Community Health Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, and who use a smartphone. Questions assessed the respondent's general trends in smartphone use, as well as their exposure to and perceptions of mHealth interventions. We found little turnover in phones and phone numbers, and about half the participants shared their devices with family and friends. Respondents reported high familiarity with smartphone applications, including WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, with WhatsApp as their preferred method of smartphone communication. Data bundles were most often used to connect to the internet, motivated by the perception that data bundles last longer and are cheaper than airtime, but respondents were adept at locating Wi-Fi sources at work or other public spaces. Nearly all participants were familiar with MomConnect, a national mHealth text support service in South Africa, and most described it positively. Respondents expressed interest in future HIV mHealth applications including complementary health information on physical activity, nutrition, mental health and basic social services.

We describe the development and implementation of an innovative real-time telemedicine system based around transmission and feedback of data to and from a mobile phone. Proprietary Java-based programs were used to link a blood glucose meter to a mobile phone. In addition to immediate transmission of blood glucose data, information about insulin dose, eating patterns and physical exercise were collected. Immediate feedback to the phone included a colour histogram to draw attention to levels of control over glycaemia over the previous two weeks. Clinicians supporting patients had access to summary screens identifying users not testing, and those with levels of blood glucose outside pre-defined limits. More detailed graphical displays of data were used to provide data about control of insulin dose and the degree to which it was modified in response to diet and exercise.

A mixed methods formative research approach was utilized. Qualitative methods included 20 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and six focus groups with CHWs, clinic staff, and patients. Thematic analysis was performed and selected quotations used to illustrate themes. Quantitative methods consisted of a survey administered to CHWs and clinic staff, using categorical and Likert scale questions regarding current mobile phone and internet access and perceptions on the potential use of smartphones by CHWs. Qualitative results included themes on significant current care challenges, multiple perceived mHealth benefits, and general intervention acceptability. Key mHealth features desired included tools to verify CHWs' task completions, clinical decision support tools, and simple access to voice calling. Inhibiting factors identified included concerns about CHWs' job security and unrealistic expectations of mHealth capabilities. Quantitative results from 27 staff participants found that 26 (96%) did not have internet access at home, yet only 2 (7.4%) did not own a mobile phone. Likert scale survey responses (1-5, 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree) indicated general agreement that smartphones would improve efficiency (Mean = 4.35) and patient care (4.31) but might be harmful to patient confidentiality (3.88) and training was needed (4.63). Qualitative and quantitative results were generally consistent, and, overall, there was enthusiasm for mHealth technology. However, a number of potential inhibiting factors were also discovered.

            "abstract": "Mobile phones and especially smartphones have been embraced by a rapidly increasing number of people worldwide and this trend is expected to evolve even more in the years to come. There are numerous smartphone Apps that record critical medical data in an effort to solve a particular health issue each time. We studied such applications and not surprisingly, we have found that development and design effort is often repeated. Software patterns have been detected to exist, however re-usability has not been enforced. This leads to lost programming manpower and to increased probability of repeating bugs in Apps. Moreover, at the moment smartphone e-Health Apps demand time, effort and costs for development. Unfortunately even simple data recording Apps are practically impossible to be produced by multiple health domain users who are not developers. In this work, we propose, design and implement a simple and integrated solution which gives healthcare professionals and researchers the ability to create their own data intensive smartphone applications, independent of the desired healthcare domain. The proposed approach applies efficient software techniques that hide development from the users and enable App creation through a simple Web User Interface. The Apps produced are in native format and it is possible to dynamically receive m-Health business logic and the chosen UI. Evaluation of the proposed solution has shown that the generated Apps are functionally and UI equivalent to human-coded Apps according to a number of comparison parameters. Furthermore, e-Health professionals show particular interest in developing Apps on their own for a particular domain they focus on."

            "abstract": "A target of telehealth is to maintain or improve the health of people outside the normal healthcare infrastructure. A modern paradigm in healthcare, and one which fits perfectly with telehealth, is \"person self-monitoring\", and this fits with the concept of \"personal health record\" (PHR). One factor in maintaining health is to monitor physiological parameters; this is of course especially important in people with chronic maladies such as diabetes or heart disease. Parameters to be monitored include blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, weight, blood glucose, oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram (ECG), etc. So one task within telehealth would be to help monitor an individual's physiological parameters outside of healthcare institutions and store the results in a PHR in a way which is available, comprehensible and beneficial to the individual concerned and to healthcare providers. To date many approaches to this problem have been fragmented - emphasizing only part of the problem - or proprietary and not freely verifiable. We describe a framework to approach this task; it emphasizes the implementation of standards for data acquisition, storage and transmission in order to maximize the compatibility among disparate components, e.g. various PHR systems. Data from mobile biosensors is collected on a smartphone using the IEEE 11073 standard where possible; the data can be stored in a PHR on the phone (using standard formats) or can be converted in real-time into more useful information in the PHR, which is based on the International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC2e). The phone PHR data or information can be uploaded to a central online PHR using either the Wi-Fi or GSM transmission protocol together with the Continuity of Care Record message format (CCR, ASTM E2369)."

Existing models of IDA are unlikely to meet the increasing service demand unless efficiencies are increased. Mobile health (mHealth), a subset of Ehealth, has been shown to improve glycaemic control through enhanced self-management and feedback leading to improved patient satisfaction and could simultaneously reduce costs. Considering the potential benefits of mHealth, we have developed an innovative mHealth-based care model to support patients and clinicians in diabetes specialist community outreach and telehealth clinics, that is, REthinking Model of Outpatient Diabetes care utilizing EheaLth - Insulin Dose Adjustment (REMODEL-IDA). This model primarily aims to improve the glycaemic management of patients with T2DM on insulin, with the secondary aims of improving healthcare service delivery efficiency and the patients' experience.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      A two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted for 3 months with 44 participants, randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either the mHealth-based model of care (intervention) or routine care (control), in diabetes specialist community outreach and telehealth clinics. The intervention arm will exchange information related to blood glucose levels via the Mobile Diabetes Management System developed for outpatients with T2DM. They will receive advice on insulin titration from the CDE via the mobile-app and receive automated text-message prompts for better self-management based on their blood glucose levels and frequency of blood glucose testing. The routine care arm will be followed up via telephone calls by the CDE as per usual practice. The primary outcome is change in glycated haemoglobin, a marker of glycaemic management, at 3 months. Patient and healthcare provider satisfaction, and time required to perform IDA by healthcare providers in both arms will be collected.

Working family caregivers, with at least one health and/or safety concern related to an elder residing alone at home during the workday, were recruited from five companies (n = 27). Caregivers received free computer access to the Worker Interactive Networking (WIN) Internet online caregiver support group and a remote elder monitoring system at home for 6 months. The remote monitoring system provided Web-based status reports and e-mail/pager alerts when individualized parameters were exceeded. Motion sensor signals were transmitted to a transponder that uploaded via wireless cellular communications to the project server, thereby not interfering with elders' telephone use. Formative qualitative analyses clarified acceptance and implementation issues. Summative quantitative evaluation determined pilot intervention effects and was conducted by external evaluators.

            "abstract": "The traditional models of epilepsy care provision have not changed substantially in more than a century, despite rapid advances in computing, technology and materials science. One consequence of these advances has been the near universal prevalence of smartphones. Wearable devices with a complex sensor arrays are an emerging technology. These devices provide a coalescence of digital computing and communication tools that offer a new way to detect, report and communicate about seizures. The pilot of a smartphone-based application for patients and cares allowing real-time reporting of seizures securely to the relevant epilepsy care team is described. Wrist-worn devices were evaluated for their ability to detect epileptic seizures. Relevant information, such as seizure notifications and live alerts for notification of emergency attendance or admission to the hospital, are sent securely to the epilepsy care team in real time. Tailored specialist advice following notification is provided along traditional lines. Compared to the year preceding the pilot, the interval between seizure occurrence in the community and notification of the specialist team reduced, with faster response times in terms of advice. There was a 30% reduction in admissions for patients with epilepsy and 10% reduction in length of stay. Patients using the technology report an increased feeling of empowerment. This model of care has several challenges and requires modification of existing working practices if benefits for patients are to be fully realised. The benefits and challenges of technology-enabled care in are discussed from the perspective of the experience from development to clinical deployment."

Three studies fulfilled the criteria for adolescent intervention using Internet-based sites but did not provide evidence for effectiveness. Two studies focused on mobile technology. One study included text message reminders for controller medication use in asthma patients. Perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and ease of use of text messages were high, but there was no improvement in asthma control. The literature search did not find any studies exploring the use of smartphone applications or social media services. Current studies of technology use in adolescents with asthma do not provide consistent evidence of effectiveness.

A randomized controlled trial was established using three groups. The first group, control group C, received traditional skilled nursing care at home. The second group, video intervention group V, received traditional skilled nursing care at home and virtual visits using videoconferencing technology. The third group, monitoring intervention group M, received traditional skilled nursing care at home, virtual visits using videoconferencing technology, and physiologic monitoring for their underlying chronic condition. Discharge to a higher level of care (hospital, nursing home) within 6 months of study participation was 42% for C subjects, 21% for V subjects, and 15% for M subjects. There was no difference in mortality between the groups. Morbidity, as evaluated by changes in the knowledge, behavior and status scales of the Omaha Assessment Tool, showed no differences between groups except for increased scores for activities of daily living at study discharge in the V and M groups. The average visit costs were $48.27 for face-to-face home visits, $22.11 for average virtual visits (video group), and $32.06 and $38.62 for average monitoring group visits for congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects, respectively. This study has demonstrated that virtual visits between a skilled home healthcare nurse and chronically ill patients at home can improve patient outcome at lower cost than traditional skilled face-to-face home healthcare visits."

All participants had a prior diagnosis of COPD with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV1)% predicted <50%, age ≥ 50 years, were on long-term home oxygen therapy, and non-smokers. Patients in the HT group measured their vital signs on a daily bases, and data were transmitted automatically to a Clinical Monitoring Center for followed-up, and who escalated clinical alerts to a Pneumologist.\n## RESULTS\nAfter 7-month of monitoring and follow-up, there was a significant reduction in ER visits (20 in HT vs. 57 in CC), hospitalizations (12 vs. 33), length of hospital stay in (105 vs. 276 days), and even need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (0 vs. 8), all p < 0.05.

Little research, however, has examined the effect of patients using eHealth tools to self-report their medication management and use. Similarly, there is little evidence showing how eHealth tools might prompt patients and health care providers to make appropriate changes to medication use.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this systematic review was to determine the impact of patients' use of eHealth tools on self-reporting adverse effects and symptoms that promote changes to medication use.

Title, abstract, and full-text review as well as data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Due to high heterogeneity, results were not meta-analyzed and instead presented as a narrative synthesis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 14 studies, including 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 open-label intervention, were included, from which 11 unique eHealth tools were identified. In addition, 14 RCTs found statistically significant increases in positive medication changes as a result of using eHealth tools, as did the single open-label study. Moreover, 8 RCTs found improvement in patient symptoms following eHealth tool use, especially in adolescent asthma patients. Furthermore, 3 RCTs showed that eHealth tools might improve patient self-efficacy and self-management of chronic disease. Little or no evidence was found to support the effectiveness of eHealth tools at improving medication recommendations and reconciliation by clinicians, medication-use behavior, health service utilization, adverse effects, quality of life, or patient satisfaction. eHealth tools with multifaceted functionalities and those allowing direct patient-provider communication may be more effective at improving patient self-management and self-efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Evidence suggests that the use of eHealth tools may improve patient symptoms and lead to medication changes.

            "abstract": "Instant messaging (IM) is when users communicate instantly via their mobile devices, and it has become one of the most preferred choices of tools to communicate amongst health professions students. The aim of this study was to understand how dental students communicate via IM, faculty members' perspectives on using IM to communicate with students, and whether such tools are useful in the learning environment. After free-associating themes on online communication, two draft topic guides for structured interviews were designed that focussed on mobile device-related communication activities. A total of 20 students and six faculty members at the University of Birmingham School of Dentistry agreed to take part in the interviews. Students were selected from years 1-5 representing each year group. The most preferred communication tools were emails, social networking, and IM. Emails were used for more formal messages, and IM and social networking sites were used for shorter messages. WhatsApp was the most used IM app because of its popular features such as being able to check if recipients have read and received messages and group work. The students reported that changes were necessary to improve their communication with faculty members. The faculty members reported having mixed feelings toward the use of IM to communicate with students. The students wished to make such tools a permanent part of their learning environment, but only with the approval of faculty members. The faculty members were willing to accept IM as a communication tool only if it is monitored and maintained by the university and has a positive effect on learning."

Time to event analysis (Cox regression) was performed comparing telehealth patients with controls who were matched using a machine-learning algorithm.\n## SETTING\nA predominantly rural region of England (North Yorkshire).\n## PARTICIPANTS\n716 telehealth patients were recruited from community, general practice and specialist acute care, between June 2010 and March 2013. Patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure or diabetes, and a history of associated inpatient admission. Patients were matched 1:1 to control patients, also selected from North Yorkshire, with respect to demographics, diagnoses of health conditions, previous hospital use and predictive risk score.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nTelehealth involved the remote exchange of medical data between patients and healthcare professionals as part of the ongoing management of the patient's health condition. Monitoring centre staff alerted healthcare professionals if the telemonitored data exceeded preset thresholds. Control patients received usual care, without telehealth.\n## PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES\nTime to the first emergency (unplanned) hospital admission or death. Secondary metrics included time to death and time to first admission, outpatient attendance and emergency department visit.\n## RESULTS\nMatched controls and telehealth patients were similar at baseline. Following enrolment, telehealth patients were more likely than matched controls to experience emergency admission or death (adjusted HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.56, p<0.001). They were also more likely to have outpatient attendances (adjusted HR=1.25, 1.11 to 1.40, p<0.001), but mortality rates were similar between groups. Sensitivity analyses showed that we were unlikely to have missed reductions in the likelihood of an emergency admission or death because of unobserved baseline differences between patient groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTelehealth was not associated with a reduction in secondary care utilisation.\n"

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies to improve population-level health outcomes around the world has surged in the last decade. Research supports the use of mHealth apps to improve health outcomes such as maternal and infant mortality, treatment adherence, immunization rates, and prevention of communicable diseases. However, developing countries face significant barriers to successfully implement, sustain, and expand mHealth initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable populations.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      We aimed to identify and synthesize barriers to the use of mHealth technologies such as text messaging (short message service [SMS]), calls, and apps to change and, where possible, improve the health behaviors and health outcomes of populations in developing countries.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Deriving search criteria from the review's primary objective, we searched PubMed and CINAHL using an exhaustive terms search (eg, mHealth, text messaging, and developing countries, with their respective Medical Subject Headings) limited by publication date, English language, and full text. At least two authors thoroughly reviewed each article's abstract to verify the articles were germane to our objective. We then applied filters and conducted consensus meetings to confirm that the articles met the study criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Review of 2224 studies resulted in a final group of 30 articles for analysis. mHealth initiatives were used extensively worldwide for applications such as maternal health, prenatal care, infant care, HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment adherence, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and health education. Studies were conducted in several developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. From each article, we recorded the specific health outcome that was improved, mHealth technology used, and barriers to the successful implementation of the intervention in a developing country. The most prominent health outcomes improved with mHealth were infectious diseases and maternal health, accounting for a combined 20/30 (67%) of the total studies in the analysis. The most frequent mHealth technology used was SMS, accounting for 18/30 (60%) of the studies. We identified 73 individual barriers and grouped them into 14 main categories. The top 3 barrier categories were infrastructure, lack of equipment, and technology gap, which together accounted for 28 individual barriers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This systematic review shed light on the most prominent health outcomes that can be improved using mHealth technology interventions in developing countries. The barriers identified will provide leaders of future intervention projects a solid foundation for their design, thus increasing the chances for long-term success. We suggest that, to overcome the top three barriers, project leaders who wish to implement mHealth interventions must establish partnerships with local governments and nongovernmental organizations to secure funding, leadership, and the required infrastructure."

In this paper, the all-IP WSN architecture based on gateway trees is proposed and the hierarchical address structure is presented. Based on this architecture, the all-IP WSN can perform routing without route discovery. Moreover, a mobile node is always identified by a home address and it does not need to be configured with a care-of address during the mobility process, so the communication disruption caused by the address change is avoided. Through the proposed scheme, a physician can monitor the vital signs of a patient at any time and at any places, and according to the IPv6 address he can also obtain the location information of the patient in order to perform effective and timely treatment. Finally, the proposed scheme is evaluated based on the simulation, and the simulation data indicate that the proposed scheme might effectively reduce the communication delay and control cost, and lower the packet loss rate."

Because currently a majority of the elderly are nonusers of computers and Internet, we developed a home telehealth system based on digital pen technology. Fourteen patients (mean age, 84 years [median, 83 years]) with severe heart failure participated in a 13-month pilot study in specialized homecare. Participants communicated patient-reported outcome measures daily using the digital pen and health diary forms, submitting a total of 3 520 reports. The reports generated a total of 632 notifications when reports indicated worsening health. Healthcare professionals reviewed reports frequently, more than 4700 times throughout the study, and acted on the information provided. Patients answered questionnaires and were observed in their home environment when using the system. Results showed that the technology was accepted by participants: patients experienced an improved contact with clinicians; they felt more compliant with healthcare professionals' advice, and they felt more secure and more involved in their own care. Via the system, the healthcare professionals detected heart failure-related deteriorations at an earlier stage, and as a consequence, none of the patients were admitted into hospital care during the study."

            "abstract": "Mobile phone technology (mHealth) is a promising tool that has been used to improve HIV care in high-risk populations worldwide. Understanding patient perspectives of newly diagnosed men who have sex with men (MSM) in Lima, Peru during linkage and engagement in the HIV care continuum can help close the gaps in care following initial HIV diagnosis and ensure retention in continuous care. From June 2015 to March 2016, as part of a randomized controlled trial, 40 MSM participants were linked to care with an mHealth intervention within 3 months of HIV diagnosis at Via Libre clinic. For 12 weeks, participants agreed to receive weekly predetermined, standardized short message service (SMS), WhatsApp©, and/or Facebook© messages from an assigned HIV counselor. Text messaging was bi-directional, meaning participants could also send messages to their counselor at any time. In this qualitative study, we coded and thematically analyzed 947 SMS, 918 WhatsApp, and 2,694 Facebook bi-directional messages. Mean age of participants was 29.8 years (20-50); with 70 percent reporting some post-high school education and 73 percent self-identifying as homosexual. We identified six recurring themes that emerged from the data: (a) mental health symptoms; (b) coping behaviors; (c) interpersonal support; (d) physical symptoms; (e) HIV knowledge; and (f) care coordination. Participants sent text messages describing depressive symptoms and seeking mental health services during this initial stage of HIV care. For newly diagnosed MSM entering the HIV care continuum, a bi-directional mHealth intervention provided support to facilitate care while eliciting deeply personal mental and emotional states. Future interventions could benefit from using mHealth interventions as ancillary support for clinicians."

However, the cost-effectiveness and clinical effect of synchronous telehealth services in older patients with cardiovascular diseases has not yet been studied. Since 2009, the Telehealth Center at the National Taiwan University Hospital has provided a range of telehealth services (led by a cardiologist and staffed by cardiovascular nursing specialists) for cardiovascular disease patients including (1) instant transmission of blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiography, oximetry, and glucometry for analysis, (2) mutual telephone communication and health promotion, and (3) continuous analytical and decision-making support.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the impact of a synchronous telehealth service on older patients with cardiovascular diseases.\n## METHODS\nBetween November 2009 and April 2010, patients with cardiovascular disease who received telehealth services at the National Taiwan University Hospital were recruited. We collected data on hospital visits and health expenditures for the 6-month period before and the 6-month period after the opening of the Telehealth Center to assess the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of telehealth services on cardiovascular patients.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 141 consecutive cardiovascular disease patients were recruited, including 93 aged ≥65 years (senior group) and 48 aged <65 years (nonsenior group). The telehealth intervention significantly reduced the all-cause admission rate per month per person in the nonsenior group (pretelehealth: median 0.09, IQR 0-0.14; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P=.002) and the duration (days per month per person) of all-cause hospital stay (pretelehealth: median 0.70, IQR 0-1.96; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P<.001) with increased all-cause outpatient visits per month per person (pretelehealth: median 0.77, IQR 0.20-1.64; posttelehealth: mean 1.60, IQR 1.06-2.57; P=.002).

Such a tool can be an alternative to the self-report method and particularly serve patients who are unable to self-report like patients in the intensive care unit and minors. In this paper, a wearable device with a biosensing facial mask is proposed to monitor pain intensity of a patient by utilizing facial surface electromyogram (sEMG). The wearable device works as a wireless sensor node and is integrated into an Internet of Things (IoT) system for remote pain monitoring. In the sensor node, up to eight channels of sEMG can be each sampled at 1000 Hz, to cover its full frequency range, and transmitted to the cloud server via the gateway in real time. In addition, both low energy consumption and wearing comfort are considered throughout the wearable device design for long-term monitoring. To remotely illustrate real-time pain data to caregivers, a mobile web application is developed for real-time streaming of high-volume sEMG data, digital signal processing, interpreting, and visualization. The cloud platform in the system acts as a bridge between the sensor node and web browser, managing wireless communication between the server and the web application. In summary, this study proposes a scalable IoT system for real-time biopotential monitoring and a wearable solution for automatic pain assessment via facial expressions."

The concept of eHealth and telemedicine was poorly established among the study population. While most participants already used mobile devices, they expressed a quite low desirability of using various telemedicine applications in the future. Study participants perceived that the most important overall benefits for implementing connected health technology were better quality of healthcare, location-independent access to healthcare services, and better quality of life.

The current article reports the results of an integrative literature review summarizing current in-home telerehabilitation research with older adults. Nine studies from 2006-2015 are included. Six studies employed a remote therapist using real-time video. Three studies used text- or web-based messaging and electronic surveys. Six studies relied on dial-up Internet service and the remaining three studies used broad-band Internet connections. Future research should address (a) in-home and wearable sensing technologies to monitor health and (b) mobile devices, such as tablet computers, to collect patient self-reports. Interoperable platforms are needed to integrate disparate devices and support continuity of care across post-acute care settings. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 42(10), 15-20.]."

            "abstract": "The development of telemonitoring via wireless body area networks (WBANs) is an evolving direction in personalized medicine and home-based mobile health. A WBAN consists of small, intelligent medical sensors which collect physiological parameters such as electrocardiogram, electroencephalography, and blood pressure. The recorded physiological signals are sent to a coordinator via wireless technologies, and are then transmitted to a healthcare monitoring center. One of the most widely used wireless technologies in WBANs is ZigBee because it is targeted at applications that require a low data rate and long battery life. However, ZigBee-based WBANs face severe interference problems in the presence of WiFi networks. This problem is caused by the fact that most ZigBee channels overlap with WiFi channels, severely affecting the ability of healthcare monitoring systems to guarantee reliable delivery of physiological signals. To solve this problem, we have developed an algorithm that controls the load in WiFi networks to guarantee the delay requirement for physiological signals, especially for emergency messages, in environments with coexistence of ZigBee-based WBAN and WiFi. Since WiFi applications generate traffic with different delay requirements, we focus only on WiFi traffic that does not have stringent timing requirements. In this paper, therefore, we propose an adaptive load control algorithm for ZigBee-based WBAN/WiFi coexistence environments, with the aim of guaranteeing that the delay experienced by ZigBee sensors does not exceed a maximally tolerable period of time. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm guarantees the delay performance of ZigBee-based WBANs by mitigating the effects of WiFi interference in various scenarios."

Mobile technologies are assuming an emerging role in this scenario. This is particularly true in care processes where the patient has a particularly enhanced role, as is the case of cancer supportive care.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This paper aims to review existing studies on the actual role and use of mobile technology during the different stages of care processes, with particular reference to cancer supportive care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We carried out a review of literature with the aim of identifying studies related to the use of mHealth in cancer care and cancer supportive care.

Looking more generally at cancer care, we found that mHealth is mainly used for self-management activities carried out by patients. The main tools used are mobile devices like mobile phones and tablets, but remote monitoring devices also play an important role. Text messaging technologies (short message service, SMS) have a minor role, with the exception of middle income countries where text messaging plays a major role. Telehealth technologies are still rarely used in cancer care processes. If we look at the different stages of health care processes, we can see that mHealth is mainly used during the treatment of patients, especially for self-management activities. It is also used for prevention and diagnosis, although to a lesser extent, whereas it appears rarely used for decision-making and follow-up activities.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Since mHealth seems to be employed only for limited uses and during limited phases of the care process, it is unlikely that it can really contribute to the creation of new care models. This under-utilization may depend on many issues, including the need for it to be embedded into broader information systems. If the purpose of introducing mHealth is to promote the adoption of integrated care models, using mHealth should not be limited to some activities or to some phases of the health care process. Instead, there should be a higher degree of pervasiveness at all stages and in all health care delivery activities."

Responses were analysed by sub-group, and preferences were compared with current diabetes apps. App features included data storage/graphics, exercise tracking, health/diet, reminders/alarms, education. Questionnaire response rate was 59 per cent (234/400); 144/233 (62%) owned smartphones. Smartphone users expressed preference towards mHealth (101/142 (71%)), although diabetes use was low (12/163 (7%)). Respondents favoured many potential features, with similar preferences between diabetes types. This study demonstrates that while mHealth acceptance is high, current engagement is low.

Different biomarkers and numerous approaches have been studied for biological age estimation, each with its advantages and limitations. In this work, we investigate whether physical activity can be exploited for biological age estimation for adult humans. We introduce an approach based on deep convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM) to predict biological age, using human physical activity as recorded by a wearable device. We also demonstrate five deep biological age estimation models including the proposed approach and compare their performance on the NHANES physical activity dataset. Results on mortality hazard analysis using both the Cox proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier curves each show that the proposed method for estimating biological age outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. This work has significant implications in combining wearable sensors and deep learning techniques for improved health monitoring, for instance, in a mobile health environment.

When the sensor nodes are constant, the security property is not satisfied. Meanwhile, the authentication between the portable mobile device and application provider is prone to mutual impersonation attack, so the critical goal of mutual authentication can not be achieved. In this paper, an improved two-layer authentication scheme is proposed to remove the flaws. The analysis shows that our method is more secure and could withstand various attacks."

            "title": "Smart Home-based IoT for Real-time and Secure Remote Health Monitoring of Triage and Priority System using Body Sensors: Multi-driven Systematic Review.",
            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been identified in various applications across different domains, such as in the healthcare sector. IoT has also been recognised for its revolution in reshaping modern healthcare with aspiring wide range prospects, including economical, technological and social. This study aims to establish IoT-based smart home security solutions for real-time health monitoring technologies in telemedicine architecture. A multilayer taxonomy is driven and conducted in this study. In the first layer, a comprehensive analysis on telemedicine, which focuses on the client and server sides, shows that other studies associated with IoT-based smart home applications have several limitations that remain unaddressed. Particularly, remote patient monitoring in healthcare applications presents various facilities and benefits by adopting IoT-based smart home technologies without compromising the security requirements and potentially large number of risks. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that handle these issues, related applications are comprehensively reviewed and a coherent taxonomy for these articles is established. A total number of (n = 3064) are gathered between 2007 and 2017 for most reliable databases, such as ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineer Xplore databases. Then, the articles based on IoT studies that are associated with telemedicine applications are filtered. Nine articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 22.22% (n = 2/9), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, which accounts for 77.78% (n = 7/9), includes articles on the client and server sides of telemedicine architecture. The collected studies reveal the essential requirement in constructing another taxonomy layer and review IoT-based smart home security studies. Therefore, IoT-based smart home security features are introduced and analysed in the second layer. The security of smart home design based on IoT applications is an aspect that represents a crucial matter for general occupants of smart homes, in which studies are required to provide a better solution with patient security, privacy protection and security of users' entities from being stolen or compromised. Innovative technologies have dispersed limitations related to this matter. The existing gaps and trends in this area should be investigated to provide valuable visions for technical environments and researchers. Thus, 67 articles are obtained in the second layer of our taxonomy and are classified into six categories. In the first category, 25.37% (n = 17/67) of the articles focus on architecture design. In the second category, 17.91% (n = 12/67) includes security analysis articles that investigate the research status in the security area of IoT-based smart home applications. In the third category, 10.44% (n = 7/67) includes articles about security schemes. In the fourth category, 17.91% (n = 12/67) comprises security examination. In the fifth category, 13.43% (n = 9/67) analyses security protocols. In the final category, 14.92% (n = 10/67) analyses the security framework. Then, the identified basic characteristics of this emerging field are presented and provided in the following aspects. Open challenges experienced on the development of IoT-based smart home security are addressed to be adopted fully in telemedicine applications. Then, the requirements are provided to increase researcher's interest in this study area. On this basis, a number of recommendations for different parties are described to provide insights on the next steps that should be considered to enhance the security of smart homes based on IoT. A map matching for both taxonomies is developed in this study to determine the novel risks and benefits of IoT-based smart home security for real-time remote health monitoring within client and server sides in telemedicine applications."

            "abstract": "This article reports on a usability study of remote noninvasive cardiac testing in homes. We studied the Vitaphone 3100BT (Bluetooth®) event loop recorder (Vitaphone GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and paired BlackBerry® Curve™ 8520 smartphone (Research In Motion, Ltd., Waterloo, ON, Canada). This application requires independent device set-up by patients in their own homes following receipt by mail out of the kit (instructions plus the event loop recorder and smartphone). The case studies of five participants, each with varying experience with technology, were documented as they interacted with the devices. Participants were videotaped following written instructions as they performed a \"think aloud\" procedure while completing 20 device set-up tasks. Interviews provided insight into how the independent device set-up and processes could be improved. This study concluded that gender, age, and familiarity with technology seemed to influence the participants' abilities to successfully set up these devices and that sending the kit by mail appeared to be an acceptable strategy to provide remote noninvasive cardiac diagnostic services. This study provides a foundation for future research assessing usability of mobile healthcare technology."

            "abstract": "We are in the midst of a real change in the application of information technology to support the delivery of healthcare. We are seeing a shift from the 'informed patient' which has resulted from improved access to healthcare information, primarily from the Web, to the 'participative patient' as we move into Web 2.0 territory. The last decade has seen significant strides in the application of healthcare information to support patient care including: Increased access to healthcare related information by the patient through access to healthcare information on the Web (1.0). The development of electronic patient/health records. Improved access to knowledge for care professionals has enabled the dissipation of professional clinical skills with the introduction of nurse practitioners and increased use of therapies. Improved access to patient related information across disciplines is beginning to enable the shift from acute based to community based care. The introduction of home care technologies has enabled self monitoring in supporting self care. There are also developments in the way care is provided with an increasing diversity of healthcare providers with the challenges this has presented in exchanging patient related information to support continuity of care. We are now at another major turning point that could present greater challenges for healthcare professionals, organisations and the patient or client. These developments include: The application of information sharing services commonly referred to as Web 2.0. As a result we are seeing a transition from the 'informed patient' to the 'participative patient' that will present increasing challenges for healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations in adapting care to embrace this evolution. New entrants to the ehealth market are now emerging such as Google and Microsoft who are competing to 'own' the 'healthcare consumer'. Open source solutions for EPR/EHRs are now emerging that will challenge the traditional mechanisms for delivery of organisational healthcare solutions. Technologies that have been growing in use and demand over the past decade are now being applied to healthcare including digital TV and mobile computing. What then are the challenges for patients, healthcare organisations and information service providers as we move from the passive role of the patient in the provision of their care to a more participative role?"

Consequently, a large amount of consumer-generated data is being collected. Technological advances in innovative sensory systems have enabled data connectivity and aggregation to become cornerstones in developing workable solutions for remote monitoring systems in clinical practice. However, few systems are currently available to handle such data, especially for clinical use.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to develop and implement the digital health research platform for mobile health (DHARMA) that combines data saved in different formats from a variety of sources into a single integrated digital platform suitable for mobile remote monitoring studies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      DHARMA comprises a smartphone app, a Web-based platform, and custom middleware and has been developed to collect, store, process, and visualize data from different vendor-specific sensors.

Cost-effectiveness had high variance both between the PCTs and between the comparison periods ranging from a saving of £140,800 ($176,000) to an increase of £9,600 ($12,000). The average saving was £1,023 ($1,280) per patient per year. The largest impact was on length of stay with a fall in the average length of inpatient care in PCT1 from 11.5 days in the period 12 months before monitoring to 6.5 days during monitoring, and similarly in PCT2 from 7.5 to 5.2 days.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There was a wide discrepancy in the results from the two PCTs. This places doubt on outcomes and may indicate also why the literature on cost-effectiveness remains inconclusive. The wide variance on savings and the uncertainty of monitoring cost do not allow a definitive conclusion on the cost-effectiveness as an outcome of this study. It might well be that the average saving was £1,023 ($1,280) per patient per year, but the variance is too great to allow this to be statistically significant. Each locality-based clinical service provides a service to achieve the same clinical goal, but it does so in significantly different ways. The introduction of remote monitoring has a profound effect on team learning and clinical practice and thus distorts the cost-effectiveness evaluation of the use of the technology. Cost-effectiveness studies will continue to struggle to provide a definitive answer because outcome measurements are too dependent on factors other than the technology."

This rapid test transmits the relevant pulmonary parameters, converted in an Extensible Markup Language file to the smartphone. The application will analyze the incoming data to evaluate the current health status of the patient. Additionally the data will be transferred to the virtual control point (server) and stored in a database. If critical values are detected, the server will send a notification to prior defined relatives and doctors.

The aim of this study is to review the role of mobile health (mHealth) tools for improving medication adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease. We performed a systematic search for randomized controlled trials that primarily investigated mHealth tools for improving adherence to cardiovascular disease medications in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. We extracted and reviewed data on the types of mHealth tools used, preferences of patients and healthcare providers, the effect of the mHealth interventions on medication adherence, and the limitations of trials. We identified 10 completed trials matching our selection criteria, mostly with <100 participants, and ranging in duration from 1 to 18 months. mHealth tools included text messages, Bluetooth-enabled electronic pill boxes, online messaging platforms, and interactive voice calls. Patients and healthcare providers generally preferred mHealth to other interventions. All 10 studies reported that mHealth interventions improved medication adherence, though the magnitude of benefit was not consistently large and in one study was not greater than a telehealth comparator. Limitations of trials included small sample sizes, short duration of follow-up, self-reported outcomes, and insufficient assessment of unintended harms and financial implications. Current evidence suggests that mHealth tools can improve medication adherence in patients with cardiovascular diseases.

Although strong evidence supports the value of integrating text-messaging interventions into public health practice, additional research is needed to establish longer-term intervention effects, identify recommended intervention characteristics, and explore issues of cost-effectiveness."

A web browser plug-in simplifies the process of capturing video and transferring it to a web site for novice computer users. The design of the video capture plug-in can be reused to acquire and securely transfer any type of data over the web. For example, readings from home biosensor instruments (e.g., glucometers and spirometers) that can be connected to a personal computer can be transferred to a home telemedicine web site. Both patients and doctors can access this web site to monitor health status longitudinally. Six patients, whose familiarity with computers ranged from no experience to expert users, used the system. All of the subjects were able to use the system to check treatment reminders and to send at least one message with video to their surgeons. The surgeons monitored the system regularly and always responded to messages within 24 h during the six-month trial period."

However, usage difficulties and compliance issues relating to this technology restrict the effect of mHealth system-supported self-management. In this study, an mHealth framework is introduced to overcome these drawbacks and improve the outcome of self-management. We implemented a set of ease of use principles in the mHealth design and employed the quantitative Fogg Behavior Model to enhance users' execution ability. The framework was realized in a prototype design for the mHealth system, which consists of medical apparatuses, mobile applications and a health management server. The system is able to monitor the physiological status in an unconstrained manner with simplified operations, while supervising the healthcare plan. The results suggest that the present framework design is accessible for ordinary users and effective in improving users' execution ability in self-management."

The term green refers to the fact that the nanodevices in such a network can harvest energy from their surrounding environment, so that no nanodevice gets old solely due to the reasons attributed to energy depletion. However, the residual energy of a nanodevice can deplete substantially with the lapse of time, if the rate of energy consumption is not comparable with the rate of energy harvesting. It is observed that the rate of energy harvesting is nonlinear and sporadic in nature. So, the management of energy of the nanodevices is fundamentally important. We specifically address this problem in a ubiquitous healthcare monitoring scenario and formulate it as a cooperative Nash Bargaining game. The optimal strategy obtained from the Nash equilibrium solution provides improved network performance in terms of throughput and delay."

Platforms available today include Android, Apple iOS, RIM BlackBerry, Symbian, and Windows (Windows Mobile 6.x and the emerging Windows Phone 7 platform). The paper covers apps targeting both laypersons/patients and healthcare professionals in various scenarios, e.g., health, fitness and lifestyle education and management apps; ambient assisted living apps; continuing professional education tools; and apps for public health surveillance. Among the surveyed apps are those assisting in chronic disease management, whether as standalone apps or part of a BAN (Body Area Network) and remote server configuration.

We propose here an STM32F-microcontroller-based ECG mobile system providing both long-term (several weeks) Holter monitoring and 12-lead ECG recording, according to the clinical standard requirements for these kinds of recordings, which in addition can yield further digital compression at stages close to the acquisition. The system can be especially useful in rural areas of developing countries, where the lack of specialized medical personnel justifies the introduction of telecardiology services, and the limitations of coverage and bandwidth of cellular networks require the use of efficient signal compression systems. The prototype was implemented using a small architecture, with a 16-bits-per-sample resolution. We also used a low-noise instrumentation amplifier TI ADS1198, which has a multiplexer and an analog-to-digital converter (16 bits and 8 channels) connected to the STM32F processor, the architecture of which incorporates a digital signal processing unit and a floating-point unit. On the one hand, the system portability allows the user to take the prototype in her/his pocket and to perform an ECG examination, either in 12-lead controlled conditions or in Holter monitoring, according to the required clinical scenario. An app in the smartphone is responsible for giving the users a friendly interface to set up the system. On the other hand, electronic health recording of the patients are registered in a web application, which in turn allows them to connect to the Internet from their cellphones, and the ECG signals are then sent though a web server for subsequent and ubiquitous analysis by doctors at any convenient terminal device. In order to determine the quality of the received signals, system testing was performed in the three following scenarios: (1) The prototype was connected to the patient and the signals were subsequently stored; (2) the prototype was connected to the patient and the data were subsequently transferred to the cellphone; (3) the prototype was connected to the patient, and the data were transferred to the cellphone and to the web via the Internet. An additional benchmarking test with expert clinicians showed the clinical quality provided by the system. The proposed ECG system is the first step and paves the way toward mobile cardiac monitors in terms of compatibility with the electrocardiographic practice, including the long-term monitoring, the usability with 12 leads, and the possibility of incorporating signal compression at the early stages of the ECG acquisition."

Among those with a mobile phone, 71% used text messaging. Nearly all respondents (93%) were interested in receiving mobile phone reminders (text message or phone call) about upcoming medical appointments, and a similar proportion (88%) wanted mobile phone outreach asking if they would like to schedule an appointment if they had not been seen by a health provider in over a year.

            "abstract": "Promising development in the light emitting diode (LED) technology has spurred the interest to adapt LED for both illumination and data transmission. This has fostered the growth of interest in visible light communication (VLC), with on-going research to utilize VLC in various applications. This paper presents a mobile-health monitoring system, where healthcare information such as biomedical signals and patient information are transmitted via the LED lighting. A small and portable receiver module is designed and developed to be attached to the mobile device, providing a seamless monitoring environment. Three different healthcare information including ECG, PPG signals and HL7 text information is transmitted simultaneously, using a single channel VLC. This allows for a more precise and accurate monitoring and diagnosis. The data packet size is carefully designed, to transmit information in a minimal packet error rate. A comprehensive monitoring application is designed and developed through the use of a tablet computer in our study. Monitoring and evaluation such as heart rate and arterial blood pressure measurement can be performed concurrently. Real-time monitoring is demonstrated through experiment, where non-hazardous transmission method can be implemented alongside a portable device for better and safer healthcare service."

Although the numeric rating scale (NRS) is implemented in hospitals in the Netherlands, pain is still not systematically registered during outpatient consultations. The aim of this study was to assess whether home telemonitoring increases pain registration in medical records of outpatients with cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with cancer were included in the intervention group (IG) when they visited the outpatient clinic. They received a short message service and an interactive voice response on their mobile phones 3 times a week, asking them to provide their pain score (NRS). When the reported NRS pain score was ≥5, a specialized oncology nurse adapted the pain treatment when necessary. Outcomes were compared to a control group (CG) without home telemonitoring. In both groups, medical records were analyzed and data on pain and analgesics were collected.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In each group, the medical records of 54 patients were analyzed on 3 consecutive outpatient visits. In the CG, pain registration or its absence was described in 60 visits (37.0%). In the IG, pain registration or its absence was reported in 83 visits (51.2%). Patients in the IG received a prescription for analgesics significantly more often (36/54 patients [66.6%]) than did patients in the CG (18/54 patients [33.3%]), P < 0.01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Home telemonitoring for patients with cancer significantly increases registration of pain and prescriptions of analgesics in outpatient medical records.

We expanded the ETSI/Parlay architecture with new service capability features as well as sensor, profiling and security mechanisms. The proposed framework assists the seamless integration, within the e-Health service structure, of diverse facilities provided by both the underlying communication and computing infrastructure as well as the patient's bio and context sensor networks.

The Congo Red Dot (CRD) test, a simple modality to assess the presence of misfolded proteins in urine, shows promise as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for preeclampsia. We propose an innovative mobile health (mHealth) solution that enables the quantification of the CRD test as a batch laboratory test, with minimal cost and equipment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A smartphone application that guides the user through seven easy steps, and that can be used successfully by non-specialized personnel, was developed. After image acquisition, a robust analysis runs on a smartphone, quantifying the CRD test response without the need for an internet connection or additional hardware. In the first stage, the basic image processing algorithms and supporting test standardizations were developed using urine samples from 218 patients. In the second stage, the standardized procedure was evaluated on 328 urine specimens from 273 women. In the third stage, the application was tested for robustness using four different operators and 94 altered samples.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the first stage, the image processing chain was set up with high correlation to manual analysis (z-test P < 0.001).

            "title": "Is a Self-Monitoring App for Depression a Good Place for Additional Mental Health Information? Ecological Momentary Assessment of Mental Help Information Seeking among Smartphone Users.",
            "abstract": "Mobile devices and apps offer promising opportunities for both patients and healthcare professionals, for example, to monitor and assess health status, and also to provide relevant health information. However, health information seeking within a mood-tracking app has not yet been addressed by research. To bridge this gap, the depression-related health information seeking of 6,675 users of a mood-tracking smartphone app was unobtrusively monitored. The study shows that self-monitored depressive symptoms are associated with higher depression-related information seeking within the app. Health information seeking was low in general, with differences across 12 depression-related topics (e.g., depressive thoughts, a depression diagnosis, or depression facts), but the findings are also promising as the smartphone app was shown to be a place where users can inform themselves about health topics related to the main purpose of the app. Smartphone apps would therefore seem to be a vehicle through which to provide additional health information about, for example, comorbidities, or pre- or post-interventions, even going beyond the original purposes of such mobile health (mHealth) monitoring apps."

Recently, there has been a rise in the number of eHealth modalities and the frequency with which they are used to deliver technology-assisted self-management interventions for people living with chronic pain. However, there has been little or no research directly comparing these eHealth modalities.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this systematic review with a network meta-analysis (NMA) is to compare the effectiveness of eHealth modalities in the context of chronic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Randomized controlled trials (N>20 per arm) that investigated interventions for adults with chronic pain, delivered via an eHealth modality, were included.

            "abstract": "The evolution of information technology and of telematics and increasing efforts to establish an electronic health record stimulate the development and introduction of new concepts in health care. However, compared to other application areas, e.g., tourism, banking, commerce etc. the use of information technology in health care is still of limited success. In hospitals as well in ambulatory medicine (General Practitioner systems) computers are often only used for administrative purposes. Fully operational Hospital Information Systems (HIS) are rare and often island solutions. The situation is somewhat better for department systems (DIS), e.g., where image analysis, processing of biochemical data or of biosignals is in the clinical focus. Even before we have solved the various problems in health care data processing and management within the \"conventional\" care institutions new challenges are coming up with concepts of telemedicine for assisted and non-assisted home care for patients with chronic diseases or people at high risk. The major challenges for provision of tele-monitoring and alarming services are improvement of communication and interoperability of devices and care providers. A major obstacle in achieving such goals are lack of standards for devices as well for procedures and a lack of databases with information on \"normal\" variability of many medical parameters to be monitored by serial comparison in continuous medical care. Some of these aspects will be discussed in more detail."

Internet and mobile phone based interventions have been successfully used to help people to achieve this. One of the components that are related to the efficacy of these interventions is tailoring of content to the individual. This trial is studying the effect of a longitudinally tailored Internet and mobile phone based intervention that is based on models of health behaviour, on the level of physical activity and the adherence to the intervention, as an extension of a face-to-face cardiac rehabilitation stay.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      A parallel group, cluster randomized controlled trial.

Participants have access to a website with information regarding cardiac rehabilitation, an online discussion forum and an online activity calendar. Those randomized to the intervention condition, receive in addition tailored content based on models of health behaviour, through the website and mobile text messages. The objective is to assess the effect of the intervention on maintenance of self-management behaviours after the rehabilitation stay. Main outcome is the level of physical activity one month, three months and one year after the end of the cardiac rehabilitation programme.

The management of HF is usually multi-disciplinary and should comprise the cooperation of all groups of individuals involved in the care like clinicians, cardiologists, general practitioners, internists, nurses, relatives and patients. There is an ongoing debate with regard to monitoring and the optimal level and intensity of care for which kind of patients. Based on our experience with the recently established HF network HerzMobil Tirol, we developed a concept how to combine mHealth-based telemonitoring and disease management programs. The collaborative HF management concept timely and efficiently closes the feedback loop between patients and care providers and allows for continuity of care. The aim is to gradually adjust intensity of care according to the patients' level of disease severity and risk of readmission after hospital discharge along the overall trajectory of illness. Next steps will be to investigate how to define shared decision making, rights, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of the individual stakeholders as well as to analyze business models for reimbursement."

In this study, we aim to describe the current status of multidisciplinary research and development of IBC, based on bibliographic research and reports from seminars, workshops, conferences, and working groups. A further aim is to inform the developers, the decision makers, and users in the health and healthcare sector regarding future solutions to support personalized health care and disease management. Both the textile sector and healthcare sector are looking with great interest at the innovative products and applications that could result from the integration of microsystems, nanotechnologies, biomedical sensors, textiles, and mobile telecommunications.

Activity recognition (AR) systems are typically trained on movement data from healthy individuals collected in a laboratory setting. However, movement patterns change after a stroke (eg, gait impairment), and activities may be performed differently at home than in a lab. Thus, it is important to validate AR for gait-impaired stroke patients in a home setting for accurate clinical predictions.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      In this study, we sought to evaluate AR performance in a home setting for individuals who had suffered a stroke, by using different sets of training activities. Specifically, we compared AR performance for persons with stroke while varying the origin of training data, based on either population (healthy persons or persons with stoke) or environment (laboratory or home setting).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty individuals with stroke and fifteen healthy subjects performed a series of mobility-related activities, either in a laboratory or at home, while wearing a smartphone. A custom-built app collected signals from the phone's accelerometer, gyroscope, and barometer sensors, and subjects self-labeled the mobility activities. We trained a random forest AR model using either healthy or stroke activity data. Primary measures of AR performance were (1) the mean recall of activities and (2) the misclassification of stationary and ambulatory activities.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A classifier trained on stroke activity data performed better than one trained on healthy activity data, improving average recall from 53% to 75%.

A mobile health (mHealth) research platform--the Few Touch Application (FTA)--is a tool designed to support the self-management of diabetes. The FTA consists of a mobile phone-based diabetes diary, which can be updated both manually from user input and automatically by wireless data transfer, and which provides personalized decision support for the achievement of personal health goals. Studies and applications (apps) based on FTAs have included: (1) automatic transfer of blood glucose (BG) data; (2) short message service (SMS)-based education for type 1diabetes (T1DM); (3) a diabetes diary for type 2 diabetes (T2DM); (4) integrating a patient diabetes diary with health care (HC) providers; (5) a diabetes diary for T1DM; (6) a food picture diary for T1DM; (7) physical activity monitoring for T2DM; (8) nutrition information for T2DM; (9) context sensitivity in mobile self-help tools; and (10) modeling of BG using mobile phones. We have analyzed the performance of these 10 FTA-based apps to identify lessons for designing the most effective mHealth apps. From each of the 10 apps of FTA, respectively, we conclude: (1) automatic BG data transfer is easy to use and provides reassurance; (2) SMS-based education facilitates parent-child communication in T1DM; (3) the T2DM mobile phone diary encourages reflection; (4) the mobile phone diary enhances discussion between patients and HC professionals; (5) the T1DM mobile phone diary is useful and motivational; (6) the T1DM mobile phone picture diary is useful in identifying treatment obstacles; (7) the step counter with automatic data transfer promotes motivation and increases physical activity in T2DM; (8) food information on a phone for T2DM should not be at a detailed level; (9) context sensitivity has good prospects and is possible to implement on today's phones; and (10) BG modeling on mobile phones is promising for motivated T1DM users. We expect that the following elements will be important in future FTA designs: (A) automatic data transfer when possible; (B) motivational and visual user interfaces; (C) apps with considerable health benefits in relation to the effort required; (D) dynamic usage, e.g., both personal and together with HC personnel, long-/short-term perspective; and (E) inclusion of context sensitivity in apps.

The burden of disease is great and there is an extreme shortage of health professionals. Telemedicine can provide access to scarce specialist care, improve the quality of care in rural areas and reduce the need for rural patients to travel to seek medical attention. International cross border service can alleviate the shortage of doctors. But telecardiology, and telemedicine uptake in general, has been poor in Africa. Legal and ethical issues around local and cross border telemedicine have not been resolved. The literature was reviewed and obstacles to telemedicine in Africa and current telemedicine activities in Africa, are described. There are few sustained telemedicine services in Africa with the exception of tele-education. There is an expectation that mobile phones will facilitate a range of telemedicine activities in Africa. Africa needs telemedicine."

This study explores the eHealth services that home care nursing providers in Sweden currently use, plan to use, and have discarded. It also investigates their eHealth visions for the future. We sent a survey to the 264 Swedish municipalities responsible for home care nursing and received 144 responses (55%). The results show a large diversity of eHealth services in use. A few can be considered core services since they are broadly implemented or will be in the near future. Trials are also being carried out with more specialized services. The respondents envision more automation and remote monitoring services, while technical and usability issues are the main obstacles to implementation today. Much knowledge can be gained from proper evaluation of the ongoing work. More research is needed regarding (1) what eHealth can offer home care nursing, (2) the effects of using eHealth in home care nursing, and (3) if and how home care nursing organizations need to adapt to best make use of eHealth."

We compared its effect on management of type 2 diabetes to the Internet-based glucose monitoring system (IBGMS), which had been studied previously. We conducted a randomized trial involving 69 patients for three months. Participants were assigned to an Internet group or a phone group. The phone group communicated with medical staff through the mobile phone only. Their glucose-monitoring data were automatically transferred to individual, web-based charts and they received medical recommendations by short message service. The Internet group used the IBGMS. There were no significant differences between the groups at baseline. After three months' intervention, HbA(1c) levels of both groups had decreased significantly, from 7.6% to 6.9% for the Internet group and from 8.3% to 7.1% for the phone group (P < 0.01). Levels of patient satisfaction and adherence to medical advice were similar. Mobile, bidirectional communication between doctors and patients using the diabetes phone was as effective for glucose control as the previously-studied Internet-based monitoring system and it was good for patient satisfaction and adherence."

Dementia carries significant physical, psychological and social challenges for individuals and caregivers. Informal caregiving is common and increasing as more people with dementia are being cared for at home instead of in nursing homes. Caregiver burden is associated with lower perceived health, lower social coherence, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effects of information and communication technology (ICT) on caregiver burden among informal caregivers of people with dementia by reducing the need for supervision.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 320 dyads composed of people with dementia living in community settings and their primary informal caregivers.

The ICT kit includes home-leaving sensors, smoke and water leak sensors, bed sensors, and automatic lights that monitor the individual's behavior. Alerts (text message and/or phone call) will be sent to the caregiver if anything unusual occurs. All study dyads will receive three home visits by project administrators who have received project-specific training in order to harmonize data collection. Home visits will take place at enrollment and 3 and 12 months following installation of the ICT kit. At every home visit, a standardized questionnaire will be administered to all dyads to assess their health, quality of life and resource utilization.

            "abstract": "Physiological, behavioral, and psychological changes associated with neuropsychiatric illness are reflected in several related signals, including actigraphy, location, word sentiment, voice tone, social activity, heart rate, and responses to standardized questionnaires. These signals can be passively monitored using sensors in smartphones, wearable accelerometers, Holter monitors, and multimodal sensing approaches that fuse multiple data types. Connection of these devices to the internet has made large scale studies feasible and is enabling a revolution in neuropsychiatric monitoring. Currently, evaluation and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders relies on clinical visits, which are infrequent and out of the context of a patient's home environment. Moreover, the demand for clinical care far exceeds the supply of providers. The growing prevalence of context-aware and physiologically relevant digital sensors in consumer technology could help address these challenges, enable objective indexing of patient severity, and inform rapid adjustment of treatment in real-time. Here we review recent studies utilizing such sensors in the context of neuropsychiatric illnesses including stress and depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease."

Among the technological resources, the articles presented smartphone applications, which interact with external telemonitoring devices (such as electrodes attached to the body and thermometers) or request information about maternal and / or fetal health status. Based on those devices, decision-making by health professionals is more reliable, since data is obtained by digital devices that have a greater accuracy. The variety of studies is enormous and achieve promising results. However, there are still important gaps to be addressed. Many studies only cover isolated aspects of maternal health, e.g. blood pressure, which somehow limits clinical decision-making. All authors have described concerns about usability, but not all of them had actually performed usability tests. Interventions through obstetric telemonitoring can be applied to a wide range of domains, at various levels of healthcare complexity.

Wearable devices have the possibility to become new modalities for monitoring vital parameters less-invasively. However, for round-the-clock monitoring of data from sensors over long periods of time, it would be better to put them inside the body to avoid causing inconvenience to patients in their daily lives.

            "abstract": "e-health is defined as the use of communication and information technologies (ICT) to manage patients and their health in a more efficient way, with the aim of improving the overall quality of care. Healthcare services relying on telehealth (or telemedicine) and mobile health (m-health) are the most popular e-health tools used by healthcare professionals and consumers. These applications allow the exchange of medical data between patients and their doctors or among healthcare professionals, mainly through the Internet, and are used to provide healthcare services remotely (so-called \"connected health\"). The most popular telemedicine application in the field of hypertension is blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT), which enables transmission of BP and various clinical information from patients' homes or from the community to the doctor's surgery or the hospital. Numerous randomized controlled trials have documented a significant BP reduction combined with an intensification and optimization of the use of antihypertensive medications in patients making use of BPT plus remote counseling by a case manager, with the supervision of a doctor or a community pharmacist (telepharmacy). The major benefits of BPT are usually observed in high-risk patients. BPT can also be based on m-health wireless solutions, provided with educational support, medication trackers and reminders, and teleconsultation. In this context, BPT may favor patient's self-management, as an adjunct to the doctor's intervention, and foster patient's participation in medical decision making, with consequent improvement in BP control and increase in medication adherence. In conclusion, e-health solutions, and in particular telemedicine, are increasingly attaining a key position in the management of the hypertensive patient, with an enormous potential in terms of improvement of the quality of the delivered care, increase in the chance of a successful BP control and effective prevention of cardiovascular diseases."

            "abstract": "Before a telemedical application can be implemented in practice, various technical, organisational, and legal questions have to be solved. The answers to these questions are, however, in most cases not very obvious. Telemedicine guidelines which could provide a path to follow currently exist only for selected medical fields and are frequently customized for particular medical and technical scenarios. The use of existing telemedicine guidelines in Austrian health care is further complicated by the fact that most of them are based on foreign legal systems. This paper therefore aims to develop general telemedicine guidelines which are appropriate for all application areas of telemedicine in Austrian health care. From nine existing telemedicine guidelines for individual medical fields, two generally applicable guidelines were derived. The corresponding abstraction process was based on a categorization of telemedical applications, which is oriented on the communication partners involved. The derived, general guidelines address seven typical problem domains in the practical application of a telemedical application. As opposed to the existing guidelines, they (1) are independent of special medical fields and are therefore appropriate for all application areas of telemedicine -- also in medical fields where no specific guidelines have existed before; (2) are adapted to the Austrian legal system; (3) provide additional insight for medical fields where specific guidelines have already existed, as they can benefit from recommendations of other medical fields where equivalent telemedical applications are employed."

We have designed and implemented a prototype technology platform for providing home-based healthcare services. It supports a personal electronic health diary and enables secure and reliable communication and interaction with peers and healthcare personnel. The platform runs on a small computer with a dedicated remote control. It is connected to the patient's TV and to a broadband Internet. The platform has been tested with home-based rehabilitation and education programs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. As part of our work, a risk assessment of privacy and security aspects has been performed, to reveal actual risks and to ensure adequate information security in this technical platform.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Risk assessment was performed in an iterative manner during the development process. Thus, security solutions have been incorporated into the design from an early stage instead of being included as an add-on to a nearly completed system. We have adapted existing risk management methods to our own environment, thus creating our own method. Our method conforms to ISO's standard for information security risk management.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of approximately 50 threats and possible unwanted incidents were identified and analysed. Among the threats to the four information security aspects: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and quality; confidentiality threats were identified as most serious, with one threat given an unacceptable level of High risk. This is because health-related personal information is regarded as sensitive. Availability threats were analysed as low risk, as the aim of the home programmes is to provide education and rehabilitation services; not for use in acute situations or for continuous health monitoring.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Most of the identified threats are applicable for healthcare services intended for patients or citizens in their own homes. Confidentiality risks in home are different from in a more controlled environment such as a hospital; and electronic equipment located in private homes and communicating via Internet, is more exposed to unauthorised access. By implementing the proposed measures, it has been possible to design a home-based service which ensures the necessary level of information security and privacy."

Internet- and mobile-based interventions for physical activity have shown promising results in helping users increase or maintain their level of physical activity in general and specifically in secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and cardiac rehabilitation. One component related to the efficacy of these interventions is tailoring of the content to the individual.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Our trial assessed the effect of a longitudinally tailored Internet- and mobile-based intervention for physical activity as an extension of a face-to-face cardiac rehabilitation stay. We hypothesized that users of the tailored intervention would maintain their physical activity level better than users of the nontailored version.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study population included adult participants of a cardiac rehabilitation program in Norway with home Internet access and a mobile phone. The participants were randomized in monthly clusters to a tailored or nontailored (control) intervention group. All participants had access to a website with information regarding cardiac rehabilitation, an online discussion forum, and an online activity calendar. Those using the tailored intervention received tailored content based on models of health behavior via the website and mobile fully automated text messages. The main outcome was self-reported level of physical activity, which was obtained using an online international physical activity questionnaire at baseline, at discharge, and at 1 month and 3 months after discharge from the cardiac rehabilitation program.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Included in the study were 69 participants.

Treatment for these kind of afflictions often take place at home, where the continuous care of a medical specialist is frequently beyond the economical means of the patient, therefore having to rely on informal caregivers (family, friends, etc.). Unfortunately, these treatments require a deep involvement on their part, which results in a heavy burden on the caregivers' routine and usually end up deteriorating their quality of life. In recent years, mHealth and eHealth applications have gained a wide interest in academia due to new capabilities enabled by the latest advancements in mobile technologies and wireless communication infrastructure. These innovations have resulted in several applications that have successfully managed to improve automatic patient monitoring and treatment and to bridge the distance between patients, caregivers and medical specialists. We therefore seek to move this trend forward by now pushing these capabilities into the field of respiratory therapies in order to assist patients with chronic respiratory diseases with their treatment, and to improve both their own and their caregivers' quality of life. This paper presents a cloud-based mobile system to support and improve homecare for respiratory diseases. The platform described uses vital signs monitoring as a way of sharing data between hospitals, caregivers and patients. Using an iterative research approach and the user's direct feedback, we show how mobile technologies can improve a respiratory therapy and a family's quality of life."

Methods MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Global Health electronic databases were searched. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published between 2005 and 2015, evaluated an mHealth intervention, and reported an outcome relating to HIV testing. We also reviewed the bibliographies of retrieved studies for other relevant citations. The methodological rigor of selected articles was assessed, and narrative analyses were used to synthesize findings from mixed methodologies. Results A total of seven articles met the inclusion criteria. Most mHealth interventions employed a text-messaging feature and were conducted in middle- and high-income countries. The methodological rigor was moderate among studies. The current literature suggests that mHealth interventions can have significant positive effects on HIV testing initiation among vulnerable and key populations, as well as the general public. In some cases, null results were observed. Qualitative themes relating to the use of mobile technologies to increase HIV testing included the benefits of having low-cost, confidential, and motivational communication. Reported barriers included cellular network restrictions, poor linkages with physical testing services, and limited knowledge of appropriate text-messaging dose. Discussion MHealth interventions may prove beneficial in reducing the proportion of undiagnosed persons living with HIV, particularly among vulnerable and key populations. However, more rigorous and tailored interventions are needed to assess the effectiveness of widespread use."

            "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a multifaceted and highly variable disease that is often difficult to manage within the traditional health-care model. The conventional model of regular or pre-scheduled appointments with physicians or allied health professionals is poorly suited to the unpredictable and often urgent clinical needs of patients with AF. Mobile health (mHealth) has the potential to dramatically transform the delivery and quality of AF care. In this brief review, we summarize the current limitations and evidence gaps in treating patients with AF. We then describe the current mHealth landscape, changes in telehealth coverage and reimbursement, and recent technological advances of smartphones, mobile applications, and connected wearable devices. We also describe important barriers and challenges, such as clinical management of large volumes of data, application of predictive analytics/machine learning, and the need for high-quality randomized clinical trials."

Three and 6month follow-up of 7-day point prevalence or continuous abstinence was considered from studies meeting criteria. All analyses were conducted with intention-to-treat. Both fixed and random effects models were used to calculate the global outcome measure and confidence intervals.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirteen studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. The studies were found to be homogeneous [Q12=12.47, p=0.14]. Odds ratios based on the random effects models suggested that interventions generally increased quit rates compared to controls, 1.36 [95% CI=1.23, 1.51]. Intervention efficacy was higher in studies with a 3month follow-up compared to 6month follow-up. Text plus programs (e.g., text messaging plus Web or in-person intervention modalities) performed only slightly better than text only programs. Pooled results also indicate message frequency schedule can affect quit rates, in which fixed schedules performed better than decreasing or variable schedules. The use of quit status assessment messages was not related to intervention efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Smoking quit rates for the text messaging intervention group were 36% higher compared to the control group quit rates. Results suggest that SMS text messaging may be a promising way to improve smoking cessation outcomes. This is significant given the relatively wide reach and low cost of text message interventions. Identifying the components that make interventions efficacious will help to increase the effectiveness of such interventions."

In professions such as perfusion, where clinical vigilance is essential to patient care, the potential distraction of cell phones may be especially problematic. However, the extent of this as an issue is currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to (1) determine the frequency of cell phone use in the perfusion community, and (2) to identify concerns and opinions among perfusionists regarding cell phone use. In October 2010, a link to a 19-question survey (surveymonkey.com) was posted on the AmSECT (PerfList) and Perfusion.com (PerfMail) forums. There were 439 respondents. Demographic distribution is as follows; Chief Perfusionist (30.5%), Staff Perfusionist (62.0%), and Other (7.5%), with age ranges of 20-30 years (14.2%), 30-40 years (26.5%), 40-50 years (26.7%), 50-60 years (26.7%), >60 years (5.9%). The use of a cell phone during the performance of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was reported by 55.6% of perfusionists. Sending text messages while performing CPB was acknowledged by 49.2%, with clear generational differences detected when cross-referenced with age groups. For smart phone features, perfusionists report having accessed e-mail (21%), used the internet (15.1%), or have checked/posted on social networking sites (3.1%) while performing CPB. Safety concerns were expressed by 78.3% who believe that cell phones can introduce a potentially significant safety risk to patients. Speaking on a cell phone and text messaging during CPB are regarded as \"always an unsafe practice\" by 42.3% and 51.7% of respondents, respectively. Personal distraction by cell phone use that negatively affected performance was admitted by 7.3%, whereas witnessing another perfusionist distracted with phone/text while on CPB was acknowledged by 33.7% of respondents. This survey suggests that the majority of perfusionists believe cell phones raise significant safety issues while operating the heart-lung machine. However, the majority also have used a cell phone while performing this activity. There are clear generational differences in opinions on the role and/or appropriateness of cell phones during bypass. There is a need to further study this issue and, perhaps, to establish consensus on the use of various communication modes within the perfusion community."

Our objectives were to assess mobile phone ownership and mobile phone literacy among low-income, predominately racial and ethnic minority patients.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of primary care patients in a publicly-funded clinic in Houston, TX.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 285 participants, 240 owned a mobile phone and 129 owned a smartphone. The most common uses of phones were talk (89%) and text messaging (65%). Only 28% of smartphone owners had health apps. Younger age was significantly associated with smartphone ownership and use of smartphones for Internet browsing, social media, and apps.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our findings from a safety-net patient population represent trends in mobile phone ownership and literacy. Despite the single-site location of our study, the findings could be helpful to health promotion practitioners working with similar underserved populations. mHealth interventions should employ phone features that are accessible and familiar to the target audience to avoid denying intervention benefits to those with low mobile phone literacy and therefore widen health disparities."

Certain individuals or corporate organisations will continue to steal it similar to bank account data once data is on wireless channels. Once health information is part of a social network, corresponding privacy issues also surface. Insufficiently trained employees at hospitals that pay less attention to creating a privacy-aware culture will suffer loss when mobile devices containing health information are lost, stolen or sniffed. In this work, a social network system is explored as a m-health system from a privacy perspective. A model is developed within a framework of data-driven privacy and implemented on Android operating system. In order to check feasibility of the proposed model, a prototype application is developed on Facebook for different services, including: i) sharing user location; ii) showing nearby friends; iii) calculating and sharing distance moved, and calories burned; iv) calculating, tracking and sharing user heart rate; etc."

The characteristics of studies, effects, and features of interventions were extracted.Results: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Outcomes were categorized into three groups (GWG control, proportion of women returning to pre-pregnancy weight, and proportion of women who exceeded the Institute of Medicine recommendations for GWG). Although most studies (66%) showed a statistically significant positive effect of phone-based interventions on the GWG control, the effects on the other outcome categories were found to be inconsistent. While the included studies used phone call and short messaging service (SMS), no study used the other functions of telephones and mobile phones such as video call, internet access, social networks, and smartphone applications. Regarding the functionalities, phone calls were used to provide guidance for healthy weight gain and communication with healthcare providers. SMS provided reminders, educational materials, and guidance.Conclusion: Phone-based interventions can help pregnant women control GWG by providing guidance, reminders, and educational materials. When these interventions use multiple functionalities, they are more effective in controlling GWG."

However, little is known about the otolaryngologists' use behavior and their attitudes toward the potential of e-health. The aims of the study were to evaluate the documentation, information, and communication technologies used by otolaryngologists and to get a better understanding of their attitudes toward the potential of e-health for cross-sectoral patient care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A survey was developed and tested by otolaryngologists, healthcare-information technology experts, and health services researchers. A total of 334 otolaryngologists in private practice were asked to participate in this cross-sectional study. In total, 234 of them took part in the study, and 157 returned completed questionnaires. Statistical analysis was performed by using crosstabs, including chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regressions. Results and Materials: Digital technologies are widely used by otolaryngologists (e.g., 89.6% use an electronic health record). However, the majority of intersectoral communication is still based on analogue techniques (e.g., fax use in 63.7%). From the otolaryngologists' perspectives, the potential of e-health for intersectoral care is mostly in appointment scheduling, further referrals to hospitals, and automated appointment reminders. The physicians' attitudes toward e-health are associated with their Internet use behavior in daily life (odds ratio = 4.30, confidence interval 1.11-16.64, p = 0.035) but not with their demographics.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The otolaryngologists are well prepared and have an overall positive attitude toward e-health for deeper use in cross-sectoral care. Therefore, e-health in otolaryngology needs more attention and resources for further studies, especially with a focus on quality and safety of care."

Mobile phones are a popular means of communication that may provide a convenient, inexpensive means to deliver health intervention programmes. This pilot study aimed to measure the effect of a 12-week mobile health (mHealth) intervention on body weight, body mass index and specific lifestyle behaviours addressed by the programme.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      University students and staff aged 18-35 years (n = 51) were randomised (ratio 1 : 1, intervention : control).

We aimed to examine if patient and HF characteristics are associated with device preferences and use. Methods Using a cross-sectional, multicenter, international design, ambulatory and hospitalized adults with HF in Ohio, California, and Denmark viewed a six-minute video of telemonitoring configurations (tablet, smart phone, and key fob) and completed questionnaires. Comparative analyses were performed and when significant, pairwise comparisons were performed using Bonferroni-adjusted significance levels. Results Of 206 participants, 48.2% preferred smart phones for telemonitoring, especially when traveling (54.8%), with new/worsening symptoms (50%), for everyday use (50%), and connecting with doctors (48.5%). Participants preferred two-way communication and a screen with words over voice or number pads. Of device purposes, allowing for nurse communication ranked highest, followed by maintaining overall health. Very few patient and HF factors were associated with device preferences. Patients with higher health literacy ( p = 0.007), previous/current device use history ( p = 0.008), higher education level ( p = 0.035), and married/cohabitating status ( p = 0.023) had higher perceptions of ease of using devices. Those who were asymptomatic or had mild HF had higher self-confidence for health devices ( p = 0.024) and non-white patients perceived devices as more useful ( p = 0.033). Conclusion Telemonitoring use may be enhanced by simple plug-and-play type devices, two-way communication, and features that meet patients' personal learning and use needs."

In order to achieve this, the identification of suffering by screening for patient-reported-outcomes (PROs, i.e., symptoms) is of utmost importance. The use of paper-pencil questionnaires is associated with significant shortcomings due to missing data, recall bias and transcription errors. Other than that, the electronic recording of PROs by mobile Health (mHealth) offers a number of advantages. The aim of this study was to test whether the routine assessment of PROs via a newly developed smartphone application (MeQoL®) is feasible.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A prospective, uncontrolled, multi-center, feasibility trial was performed in adult outpatients with advanced, solid cancer. Patients under anti-cancer therapy and with regular outpatient visits were eligible. Patients daily recorded the degree of perceived distress (NCCN Distress Thermometer®), pain intensity {average and worst [numerical rating scale (NRS), 0-10]}, the number of breakthrough pain episodes (BPE) and ten questions from a modified version of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). Weekly, five questions concerning different domains of QoL from the short-form 8 (SF-8) questionnaire were obtained. Also, patients recorded the intake of their opioid rescue medication. According to the main scope of the trial (feasibility), no primary endpoint was defined. Rather, the following main feasibility criteria were assessed: missing data, drop-out- and acceptance-rate, patient satisfaction, patients' judgement of practicability, patients' and physicians' suggestions for improvement and basic clinical and demographic data of the participating patients. The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (ID: DRKS00008761).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In three German cancer centers, 40 patients {female: 28 (70%); average age, 57 years [range, 27-73 years; standard deviation (SD), 12]} were included. As three devices were lost on transport, 37 devices could be evaluated. The median investigation period per device was 99.5 days (SD, 31). Patient adherence in using the smartphone app to document their distress and symptoms was high and missing data were low: In median daily reviews were performed on 70 (SD, 29) of these days (70%) and median weekly recordings were 13 weeks (87%). Most often, patients recorded symptom intensity (89%, MIDOS) and distress (85%, NCCN thermometer). On feedback forms, patients reported a good to very good user friendliness of MeQoL® and a high motivation to use this tool again.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Even though participants were asked to record PROs rather frequently (daily), missing data were low and patient satisfaction was high. Having in mind the findings of other working groups, such routine implementation of mHealth solutions may substantially improve outcomes of cancer therapy and increase the value of trials' findings. For the individual patient, MeQoL® allows for monitoring adherence to pharmacotherapy and can facilitate patient guidance."

Responses are transmitted through a landline connection and high-risk responses are highlighted by the system for follow-up. We developed the questions and messages based on input from patient and clinician focus groups. We evaluated feasibility by administering the intervention to inpatient and outpatient adults aged 60 or older. We gave participants a choice of exercise monitoring by HB (n = 20) or telephone (n = 18). The results showed that home exercise monitoring by HB and telephone is safe, as evidenced by low adverse event rates. We saw a decline in exercise adherence rates to both the HB and telephone after 8 weeks, although adherence was better for HB than telephone.

It explains aspects of IEEE 11073, including the domain information model, state model, and nomenclature, and how these support its plug-and-play architecture. It shows how these aspects underpin a much larger ecosystem of interoperable devices and systems that include IHE PCD-01, HL7, and BlueTooth LE medical devices, and the relationship to the Continua Guidelines, advocating the adoption of data standards and nomenclature to support semantic interoperability between health and ambient assisted living in future platforms. The paper further describes the adaptions that have been made in order to implement the standard on the ZigBee Health Care Profile and the experiences of implementing an end-to-end platform that has been deployed to frail elderly patients with chronic disease(s) and patients with diabetes."
