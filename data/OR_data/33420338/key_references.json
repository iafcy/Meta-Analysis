Cox-proportional hazard models and negative binomial regression models were used to assess the relationship between the intervention and survival and utilization, controlling for demographic and health characteristics that were statistically different between groups after matching.\n## RESULTS\nAt 2 years, participants offered the Health Buddy Program had 15% lower risk-adjusted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74-0.98; P = .03) and had reductions in the number of quarterly inpatient admissions from baseline to the study period that were 18% greater than those of matched controls during this same time period (-0.035 vs -0.003; difference-in-differences = -0.032, 95% CI = -0.054 to -0.010, P = .005). No relationship was found between the Health Buddy Program and ED use or number of hospital days for participants who were hospitalized. The Health Buddy Program was most strongly associated with fewer admissions for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mortality for those with congestive heart failure.\n## CONCLUSION\nCare management coupled with content-driven telehealth technology has potential to improve health outcomes in high-cost Medicare beneficiaries.\n",

Those with home computers received weekly e-mail prompts to report between visits. Treating physicians received symptom printouts at visits, and nurses received e-mail alerts when participants reported severe or worsening symptoms. The primary outcome was change in health-related quality of life (HRQL) at 6 months compared with baseline, measured by the EuroQol EQ-5D Index. Secondary endpoints included emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and survival.\n## RESULTS\nAmong 766 patients allocated, HRQL improved among more participants in the intervention group than usual care (34% v 18%) and worsened among fewer (38% v 53%; P < .001). Overall, mean HRQL declined by less in the intervention group than usual care (1.4- v 7.1-point drop; P < .001). Patients receiving intervention were less frequently admitted to the ER (34% v 41%; P = .02) or hospitalized (45% v 49%; P = .08) and remained on chemotherapy longer (mean, 8.2 v 6.3 months; P = .002).

Benefits were greater for participants lacking prior computer experience. Most patients receiving intervention (63%) reported severe symptoms during the study. Nurses frequently initiated clinical actions in response to e-mail alerts.\n## CONCLUSION\nClinical benefits were associated with symptom self-reporting during cancer care.\n",

A population-based sample of 392 patients with an HF diagnosis from 4 Veterans Affairs centers who had a Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) overall summary score of less than 60 (heavy symptom burden and impaired functional status and quality of life) were enrolled between May 2009 and June 2011.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nThe PCDM intervention included collaborative care by a multidisciplinary care team consisting of a nurse coordinator, cardiologist, psychiatrist, and primary care physician; home telemonitoring and patient self-management support; and screening and treatment for comorbid depression.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was change in the KCCQ overall summary score at 1 year (a 5-point change is clinically significant). Mortality, hospitalization, and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) were secondary outcomes.\n## RESULTS\nThere were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients randomized to the PCDM intervention (n=187) vs usual care (n=197); baseline mean KCCQ overall summary scores were 37.9 vs 36.9 (P=.48). There was significant improvement in the KCCQ overall summary scores in both groups after 1 year (mean change, 13.5 points in each group), with no significant difference between groups (P=.97). The intervention was not associated with greater improvement in the KCCQ overall summary scores when the effect over time was estimated using 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month data (P=.74).

            "abstract": "We have studied how well the need for a medical intervention can be predicted by a telecare monitoring system. During a study period of about 18 months, 45 elderly individuals with congestive heart failure used a home health monitor to enter daily information pertaining to their symptoms and health status. A total of 8576 alerts were generated by the monitoring system, although in most cases, patient and service provider interaction was not required. When system alerts were considered to be serious, or if symptoms persisted, the patient was contacted. A total of 171 key medical events (6 deaths; 28 hospital admissions; 59 changes in medication; 54 cases of advice given; 24 instances where immediate medical attention was recommended) were recorded in the monitoring logs. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to predict these medical interventions/events. The model correctly predicted key medical events in 75% of cases with a specificity of 74% and an overall cross-validated accuracy of 74% (95% CI, 68-80%). Key predictors included the number of system alerts, self-rated mobility, self-rated health and self-rated anxiety. This suggests that subjective measures are useful in addition to physiological ones for predicting health status. A multivariate decision support model has potential to supplement practitioners and current telecare systems in identifying heart failure patients in need of medical intervention.\n",

This study evaluated whether early automated fluid status alert notification via telemedicine improves outcome in HF patients.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients recently implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy were eligible if one of three conditions was met: prior HF hospitalization, recent diuretic treatment, or recent brain natriuretic peptide increase. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to have fluid status alerts automatically transmitted as inaudible text message alerts to the responsible physician or to receive standard care (no alerts). In the intervention arm, following a telemedicine alert, a protocol-specified algorithm with remote review of device data and telephone contact was prescribed to assess symptoms and initiate treatment. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and cardiovascular hospitalization. We followed 1002 patients for an average of 1.9 years.

All participants had a prior diagnosis of COPD with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV1)% predicted <50%, age \u2265 50 years, were on long-term home oxygen therapy, and non-smokers. Patients in the HT group measured their vital signs on a daily bases, and data were transmitted automatically to a Clinical Monitoring Center for followed-up, and who escalated clinical alerts to a Pneumologist.\n## RESULTS\nAfter 7-month of monitoring and follow-up, there was a significant reduction in ER visits (20 in HT vs. 57 in CC), hospitalizations (12 vs. 33), length of hospital stay in (105 vs. 276 days), and even need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (0 vs. 8), all p < 0.05. Time to the first severe AECOPD increased from 77 days in CC to 141 days in HT (K-M p < 0.05). There was no study withdrawals associated with technology.

However, the cost-effectiveness and clinical effect of synchronous telehealth services in older patients with cardiovascular diseases has not yet been studied. Since 2009, the Telehealth Center at the National Taiwan University Hospital has provided a range of telehealth services (led by a cardiologist and staffed by cardiovascular nursing specialists) for cardiovascular disease patients including (1) instant transmission of blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiography, oximetry, and glucometry for analysis, (2) mutual telephone communication and health promotion, and (3) continuous analytical and decision-making support.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the impact of a synchronous telehealth service on older patients with cardiovascular diseases.\n## METHODS\nBetween November 2009 and April 2010, patients with cardiovascular disease who received telehealth services at the National Taiwan University Hospital were recruited. We collected data on hospital visits and health expenditures for the 6-month period before and the 6-month period after the opening of the Telehealth Center to assess the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of telehealth services on cardiovascular patients.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 141 consecutive cardiovascular disease patients were recruited, including 93 aged \u226565 years (senior group) and 48 aged <65 years (nonsenior group). The telehealth intervention significantly reduced the all-cause admission rate per month per person in the nonsenior group (pretelehealth: median 0.09, IQR 0-0.14; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P=.002) and the duration (days per month per person) of all-cause hospital stay (pretelehealth: median 0.70, IQR 0-1.96; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P<.001) with increased all-cause outpatient visits per month per person (pretelehealth: median 0.77, IQR 0.20-1.64; posttelehealth: mean 1.60, IQR 1.06-2.57; P=.002).

The primary end-point of this randomized prospective multicentre health economic trial was the total FU-related cost for providers, comparing Home Monitoring facilitated FU (HM ON) to regular in-office FU (HM OFF) during the first 2 years after ICD implantation. Also the net financial impact on providers (taking national reimbursement into account) and costs from a healthcare payer perspective were evaluated.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nA total of 312 patients with VVI- or DDD-ICD implants from 17 centres in six EU countries were randomised to HM ON or OFF, of which 303 were eligible for data analysis. For all contacts (in-office, calendar- or alert-triggered web-based review, discussions, calls) time-expenditure was tracked. Country-specific cost parameters were used to convert resource use into monetary values. Remote FU equipment itself was not included in the cost calculations. Given only two patients from Finland (one in each group) a monetary valuation analysis was not performed for Finland. Average age was 62.4 \u00b1 13.1 years, 81% were male, 39% received a DDD system, and 51% had a prophylactic ICD. Resource use with HM ON was clearly different: less FU visits (3.79 \u00b1 1.67 vs. 5.53 \u00b1 2.32; P < 0.001) despite a small increase of unscheduled visits (0.95 \u00b1 1.50 vs. 0.62 \u00b1 1.25; P < 0.005), more non-office-based contacts (1.95 \u00b1 3.29 vs. 1.01 \u00b1 2.64; P < 0.001), more Internet sessions (11.02 \u00b1 15.28 vs. 0.06 \u00b1 0.31; P < 0.001) and more in-clinic discussions (1.84 \u00b1 4.20 vs. 1.28 \u00b1 2.92; P < 0.03), but with numerically fewer hospitalizations (0.67 \u00b1 1.18 vs. 0.85 \u00b1 1.43, P = 0.23) and shorter length-of-stay (6.31 \u00b1 15.5 vs. 8.26 \u00b1 18.6; P = 0.27), although not significant. For the whole study population, the total FU cost for providers was not different for HM ON vs. OFF [mean (95% CI): \u20ac204 (169-238) vs. \u20ac213 (182-243); range for difference (\u20ac-36 to 54), NS]. From a payer perspective, FU-related costs were similar while the total cost per patient (including other physician visits, examinations, and hospitalizations) was numerically (but not significantly) lower. There was no difference in the net financial impact on providers [profit of \u20ac408 (327-489) vs. \u20ac400 (345-455); range for difference (\u20ac-104 to 88), NS], but there was heterogeneity among countries, with less profit for providers in the absence of specific remote FU reimbursement (Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands) and maintained or increased profit in cases where such reimbursement exists (Germany and UK). Quality of life (SF-36) was not different.\n## CONCLUSION\nFor all the patients as a whole, FU-related costs for providers are not different for remote FU vs. purely in-office FU, despite reorganized care. However, disparity in the impact on provider budget among different countries illustrates the need for proper reimbursement to ensure effective remote FU implementation.\n",

Therefore, we conducted the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a THMP compared to standard of care (SOC) after LT.\n## METHODS\nOne hundred six consecutive LT recipients were randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 posttransplant care strategies: SOC or THMP. The THMP included an electronic tablet and bluetooth devices to support daily text messages, education videos, and video FaceTime capability; data was cyber-delivered into our electronic medical record daily. Endpoints were THMP participation, 90-day hospital readmission rate, and QOL.\n## RESULTS\nOne hundred patients completed the study with 50 enrolled in each arm. Participation and adherence with telemedicine was 86% for basic health sessions (vital sign recording), but only 45% for using messaging or FaceTime. The THMP group had a lower 90-day readmission rate compared to SOC (28% vs 58%; P = 0.004). The THMP cohort also showed improved QOL in regards to physical function (P = 0.02) and general health (P = 0.05) at 90 days.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTo our knowledge, this is the first RCT demonstrating the impact of THMP after LT. The magnitude of effect on LT outcomes, hospital readmissions, and QOL suggests that the adoption of telemedicine has great potential for other major operations.\n",

            "abstract": "## AIM\nTo see if home telemonitors reduce healthcare use in those with optimized chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n## METHODS\nWe randomized 40 stable patients with moderate to severe COPD, who had completed at least 12 sessions of outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), to receive standard care (Controls) for 52 weeks or standard care plus Docobo HealthHUB monitors at home for 26 weeks followed by 26 weeks standard care (Tm Group). During the monitoring period, the Tm Group completed symptoms and physical observations twice daily which were stored and then uploaded at 2 am through a freephone landline. Nurses could access the data through a secure web site and received alerting e-mails if certain combinations of data occurred.\n## RESULTS\nThere were fewer primary care contacts for chest problems (p < 0.03) in the Tm group, but no differences between the groups in emergency room visits, hospital admissions, days in hospital or contacts to the specialist COPD community nurse team, during the monitoring period. After the monitors were removed, there were no differences between the groups for any of the health care contacts (p > 0.20 throughout).\n## CONCLUSION\nIn stable, optimized COPD patients who have already completed PR, telemonitoring in addition to best care, reduces primary care chest contacts but not hospital or specialist team utilization.\n",

However, further studies exploring this issue are needed in primary care.\n## OBJECTIVES\nTo assess the impact of a primary care-based home telemonitoring intervention for highly unstable chronic patients on the use of healthcare resources.\n## METHODS\nA one-year follow-up before and after exploratory study, without control group, was conducted. Housebound patients with heart failure or chronic lung disease, with recurrent hospital admissions, were included. The intervention consisted of patient's self-measurements and responses to a health status questionnaire, sent daily from smartphones to a web-platform (aided by an alert system) reviewed by healthcare professionals. The primary outcome measure was the number of hospital admissions occurring 12 months before and after the intervention. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and number of emergency department attendances. Primary care nurses were mainly in charge of the telemonitoring process and were assisted by the general practitioners when required.\n## RESULTS\nFor the 28 patients who completed the follow-up (out of 42 included, 13 patients died and 1 discontinued the intervention), a significant reduction in hospitalizations, from 2.6 admissions/patient in the previous year (standard deviation, SD: 1.6) to 1.1 (SD: 1.5) during the one-year telemonitoring follow-up (P\u2009<0.001), and emergency department attendances, from 4.2 (SD: 2.6) to 2.1 (SD: 2.6) (P\u2009<0.001) was observed. The length of hospital stay was reduced non-significantly from 11.4 to 7.9 days.\n## CONCLUSION\nIn this small exploratory study, the primary care-based telemonitoring intervention seemed to have a positive impact decreasing the number of hospital admissions and emergency department attendances.\n",

            "title": "Use of digital health kits to reduce readmission after cardiac surgery.",
            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nUnintended rehospitalizations after surgical procedures represent a large percentage of readmissions and have been associated with increased morbidity and cost of care. Beginning in 2017, Medicare will expand diagnostic categories subject to financial penalties for excess postoperative readmissions to include coronary revascularization procedures. Arrhythmias and pulmonary complications comprise the largest categories for readmission after cardiac surgery. Technologic advances in remote monitoring have led to the use of web-based digital health kits (DHK) aimed at reducing readmissions and improving postoperative outcomes. The present study was performed to determine the added benefit of incorporating DHK's into a formal readmissions reduction program (RRP) in preventing 30-d readmissions and to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the use of these devices.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis was a prospective study of all adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution from March 2014 to June 2015. During the study period, 443 adult patients (mean age, 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014, 33% female) were identified and participated in the formal RRP, 27 of whom also received a DHK after discharge (416 control group). In addition to providing a live video link to a provider specializing in cardiac surgery, the DHK also allowed for automatic daily transmission of weight, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients also completed a daily health survey targeting symptoms concerning for heart failure, poor wound healing, poor ambulation, and nonadherence to medications. Abnormal vitals or survey responses triggered automatic notifications to the healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of the healthcare team. Pearson \u03c7(2) test and the Welch's t-test were used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables.\n## RESULTS\nDuring the study period, the readmission rate for the DHK and control groups were similar (7.4% versus 9.9%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.65). The use of DHKs led to 1649 alerts and 144 interventions, with the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9. The majority of alerts (64%) were prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, and a significant correlation was noted between abnormal biometrics and required intervention (r\u00a0=\u00a00.62, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No correlation was seen between alerts because of health survey responses (r\u00a0=\u00a00.07, P\u00a0=\u00a00.71) or missed check-ins (r\u00a0=\u00a00.06, P\u00a0=\u00a00.76) and required interventions. Poststudy satisfaction surveys showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 for DHK patients and 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 for members of the care team (scale 1-5, 5\u00a0=\u00a0agree).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn our study, adding DHKs to a formal RRP was not associated with a significant decrease in 30-d readmission rates. We also found that notifications because of abnormal biometric measures were significantly correlated with required interventions. In contrast, notifications due to abnormal health survey responses were not associated with increased interventions. Both patients and members of the healthcare team were highly satisfied with this technology. DHKs appear to extend care beyond the inpatient period and provide a portal for telemonitoring of surgical patients. However, this modality is highly resource intensive and may not significantly reduce readmissions. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of such kits in reducing readmissions and costs of care.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nPost-surgical discharge complications result in increased hospital readmissions, cost, and patient dissatisfaction. Telehealth technology to monitor patients, especially those in geographically isolated areas, may reduce post-operative complications and improve health and financial outcomes. The primary objective of this study was to compare outcomes between patients who received TeleHealth Electronic Monitoring (THEM) and those with routine discharge instructions and no monitoring, Standard Of Care (SOC).\n## METHODS\nThis is a prospective randomized study of vascular surgery patients with infrainguinal incisions. THEM patients received a tablet and home monitoring devices that transmitted information to care managers. Monitoring tools included image capture, weight scales, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, and oxygen saturation monitors. Care managers used the TeleMed 2020 Enform\u2122 platform to review alerts, real-time patient data, and dialogue with the care team.\n## RESULTS\nEighty patients were screened and 30 enrolled, of which 16 (53.3%) were randomized to the THEM group and 14 (46.7%) to the control group. Average age and body mass index for THEM and control patients were similar (62.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2 vs. 65.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3, P\u00a0=\u00a00.234; and 27.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3 vs. 29.1 7.1, P\u00a0=\u00a00.487), respectively. There was a similar number of male participants in each group (THEM 62.5% vs. SOC 42.9%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.464). There were no significant differences in wound or 30-day readmissions (THEM 6.3% vs. SOC 7.1%, P\u00a0=\u00a01.000). Interestingly, 30-day infection rates indicated that care managers identified marginally more superficial wound problems in the THEM group (31.3% vs. 7.1%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.175). Both groups reported an increase in short-form-8 physical summary scores, but was more pronounced in THEM patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.076). THEM patients reported a significantly greater improvement in quality of life on 3 of the short-form-8 quality subscales (physical function, role-physical, and role-emotional; THEM delta 7.5 versus Control delta 1.1; THEM delta 8.7 versus Control delta 1.1; and THEM delta 6.3 versus Control delta -0.5; all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). THEM patients reported trends for higher satisfaction in terms of\u00a0general satisfaction, technical quality, and accessibility for Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 survey questions (4.2 vs. 3.7, P\u00a0=\u00a00.072; 4.5 vs. 4.1, P\u00a0=\u00a00.081; and 4.2 vs. 3.8, P\u00a0=\u00a00.063), respectively.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTHEM was technically feasible and provided some benefit to patients in geographically disparate areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction. Additional findings suggested that THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took advantage of increased access to healthcare professionals. Telehealth successfully merged remotely generated information with care manager interaction. Presently, a larger study, preferably multi-center, is warranted and under consideration.\n",

Early detection of any alteration using telemonitoring of multiple vital parameters may avoid severe decompensation requiring hospital admission.

Twenty-four patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 65 years, mean LV ejection fraction 35%) requiring at least one hospital admission during the past year were investigated. Twice a day, the vital-parameters were measured (weight, blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, oxygen saturation, respiration rate) and patients information on well being, shortness of breath, medication, and request for contact were received. Intra-individual comparison was carried out between the 12 month before inclusion in this study and 12 month under telemonitoring surveillance (extrapolated, if necessary).

We excluded people who had other significant lung disease, who were unable to provide informed consent or complete the study, or who had other significant social or clinical problems.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were recruited between 21 May 2009 and 28 March 2011, and centrally randomised to receive telemonitoring or conventional self monitoring. Using a touch screen, telemonitoring participants recorded a daily questionnaire about symptoms and treatment use, and monitored oxygen saturation using linked instruments. Algorithms, based on the symptom score, generated alerts if readings were omitted or breached thresholds. Both groups received similar care from existing clinical services.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was time to hospital admission due to COPD exacerbation up to one year after randomisation. Other outcomes included number and duration of admissions, and validated questionnaire assessments of health related quality of life (using St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ)), anxiety or depression (or both), self efficacy, knowledge, and adherence to treatment. Analysis was intention to treat.\n## RESULTS\nOf 256 patients completing the study, 128 patients were randomised to telemonitoring and 128 to usual care; baseline characteristics of each group were similar. The number of days to admission did not differ significantly between groups (adjusted hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.44). Over one year, the mean number of COPD admissions was similar in both groups (telemonitoring 1.2 admissions per person (standard deviation 1.9) v control 1.1 (1.6); P=0.59). Mean duration of COPD admissions over one year was also similar between groups (9.5 days per person (standard deviation 19.1) v 8.8 days (15.9); P=0.88). The intervention had no significant effect on SGRQ scores between groups (68.2 (standard deviation 16.3) v 67.3 (17.3); adjusted mean difference 1.39 (95% confidence interval -1.57 to 4.35)), or on other questionnaire outcomes. Conclusions In participants with a history of admission for exacerbations of COPD, telemonitoring was not effective in postponing admissions and did not improve quality of life. The positive effect of telemonitoring seen in previous trials could be due to enhancement of the underpinning clinical service rather than the telemonitoring communication.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nISRCTN96634935.\n## FUNDING\nThe trial was funded by an NHS applied research programme grant from the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish government (ARPG/07/03).

The incidence of changes in parameter settings throughout the survival period with NIV was lower in G2 (p<0.0001) but it was increased during the initial period needed to achieve full compliance. The number of office or emergency room visits and inhospital admissions was significantly lower in G2 (p<0.0001). Survival showed a trend favouring G2 (p=0.13).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study shows that telemonitoring reduces health care utilisation with probable favourable implications on costs, survival and functional status.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE\nTele monitoring (TM) of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has gained much interest, but studies have produced conflicting results. Our aim was to investigate the effect of TM with the option of video consultations on exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with severe COPD.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients with severe COPD at high risk of exacerbations were eligible for the study. Of 560 eligible patients identified, 279 (50%) declined to participate. The remaining patients were equally randomized to either TM (n=141) or usual care (n=140) for the 6-month study period. TM comprised recording of symptoms, saturation, spirometry, and weekly video consultations. Algorithms generated alerts if readings breached thresholds. Both groups received standard care. The primary outcome was number of hospital admissions for exacerbation of COPD during the study period.\n## RESULTS\nMost of the enrolled patients had severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second <50%pred in 86% and \u2265hospital admission for COPD in the year prior to enrollment in 45%, respectively, of the patients). No difference in drop-out rate and mortality was found between the groups. With regard to the primary outcome, no significant difference was found in hospital admissions for COPD between the groups (P=0.74), and likewise, no difference was found in time to first admission or all-cause hospital admissions. Compared with the control group, TM group patients had more moderate exacerbations (ie, treated with antibiotics/corticosteroid, but not requiring hospital admission; P<0.001), whereas the control group had more visits to outpatient clinics (P<0.001).\n## CONCLUSION\nOur study of patients with severe COPD showed that TM including video consultations as add-on to standard care did not reduce hospital admissions for exacerbated COPD, but TM may be an alternative to visits at respiratory outpatient clinics. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal role of TM in the management of severe COPD.\n",

At-home transmissions were scheduled at 2 weeks, 1 and 2 months after training, with a final in-office visit after 3 months.\n## RESULTS\nSixty-seven patients performed 264 data transmissions. Twenty-three unscheduled data transmissions were requested by the centers after patient contact. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were reported in nine patients during 16 data reviews. Thirteen data reviews (81%) were performed remotely via CareLink transmissions (nine scheduled and four unscheduled), in seven patients. Of these events, in two cases (15%) in-hospital visits were requested, while in 11 (85%) no action was needed and no additional in-clinic visits were scheduled. During the study period, in 20/28 (71%) intra-thoracic impedance alerts, the patients remotely transmitted their device data. After remote data review, in ten cases drug therapy was adjusted by phone and in four cases no action was needed and the patient reassured. In six episodes an in-hospital extra visit was scheduled. On the whole, in 14 cases (70%), the patient could be managed remotely avoiding a visit to the hospital.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur study showed that remote follow-up is an efficient method to manage tachyarrhythmias and heart failure episodes in CRT-D patients. Early reaction to clinical events may improve overall patient care.\n",

Patients randomized into the tele group were equipped with mobile phone-based patient terminals for data acquisition and data transmission to the monitoring center. Study physicians had continuous access to the data via a secure Web portal. If transmitted values went outside individually adjustable borders, study physicians were sent an email alert. Primary endpoint was hospitalization for worsening CHF or death from cardiovascular cause.\n## RESULTS\nThe study was stopped after randomization of 120 patients (85 male, 35 female); median age was 66 years (IQR 62-72). The control group comprised 54 patients (39 male, 15 female) with a median age of 67 years (IQR 61-72), and the tele group included 54 patients (40 male, 14 female) with a median age of 65 years (IQR 62-72). There was no significant difference between groups with regard to baseline characteristics. Twelve tele group patients were unable to begin data transmission due to the inability of these patients to properly operate the mobile phone (\"never beginners\"). Four patients did not finish the study due to personal reasons. Intention-to-treat analysis at study end indicated that 18 control group patients (33%) reached the primary endpoint (1 death, 17 hospitalizations), compared with 11 tele group patients (17%, 0 deaths, 11 hospitalizations; relative risk reduction 50%, 95% CI 3-74%, P = .06). Per-protocol analysis revealed that 15% of tele group patients (0 deaths, 8 hospitalizations) reached the primary endpoint (relative risk reduction 54%, 95% CI 7-79%, P= .04). NYHA class improved by one class in tele group patients only (P< .001). Tele group patients who were hospitalized for worsening heart failure during the study had a significantly shorter length of stay (median 6.5 days, IQR 5.5-8.3) compared with control group patients (median 10.0 days, IQR 7.0-13.0; P= .04). The event rate of never beginners was not higher than the event rate of control group patients.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTelemonitoring using mobile phones as patient terminals has the potential to reduce frequency and duration of heart failure hospitalizations. Providing elderly patients with an adequate user interface for daily data acquisition remains a challenging component of such a concept.\n",

Mobile phones are becoming ubiquitous and economical, but the feasibility and efficacy of a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system have not been determined.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system on heart failure management and outcomes.\n## METHODS\nOne hundred patients were recruited from a heart function clinic and randomized into telemonitoring and control groups. The telemonitoring group (N = 50) took daily weight and blood pressure readings and weekly single-lead ECGs, and answered daily symptom questions on a mobile phone over 6 months. Readings were automatically transmitted wirelessly to the mobile phone and then to data servers. Instructions were sent to the patients' mobile phones and alerts to a cardiologist's mobile phone as required.\n## RESULTS\nBaseline questionnaires were completed and returned by 94 patients, and 84 patients returned post-study questionnaires. About 70% of telemonitoring patients completed at least 80% of their possible daily readings. The change in quality of life from baseline to post-study, as measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, was significantly greater for the telemonitoring group compared to the control group (P = .05). A between-group analysis also found greater post-study self-care maintenance (measured with the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index) for the telemonitoring group (P = .03). Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, self-care management, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved significantly for both groups from baseline to post-study, but did not show a between-group difference. However, a subgroup within-group analysis using the data from the 63 patients who had attended the heart function clinic for more than 6 months revealed the telemonitoring group had significant improvements from baseline to post-study in BNP (decreased by 150 pg/mL, P = .02), LVEF (increased by 7.4%, P = .005) and self-care maintenance (increased by 7 points, P = .05) and management (increased by 14 points, P = .03), while the control group did not. No differences were found between the telemonitoring and control groups in terms of hospitalization, mortality, or emergency department visits, but the trial was underpowered to detect differences in these metrics.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur findings provide evidence of improved quality of life through improved self-care and clinical management from a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system.

We conducted an eight month randomised-controlled-trial to study the effect of an automated telemedicine intervention on patients\u2019 time-to-hospitalisation.\n## METHODS\nA total of 168 patients with a diagnosis of COPD in the past 24 months were enrolled to receive the intervention at a primary care clinic. The treatment group received daily phone messages from an automated system asking them to report if they were breathing better than, worse than, or the same as the day prior. Patients reported their breathing status by responding to the text message or call. If a patient reported breathing worse, an alert was sent directly to that patient\u2019s provider within the clinic. The control group received the same daily phone messages as the treatment group. However, no proactive breathing alerts were ever generated to the provider for these subjects. The primary outcome was the subjects\u2019 time-to-first-COPD-related hospitalisation following the start of messages.\n## RESULTS\nThe treatment group\u2019s time-to-hospitalisation was significantly different than the control group\u2019s with a hazard ratio of 2.36 (95% confidence interval 1.02\u20135.45, p\u2009=\u20090.0443). The number needed-to-treat ratio was 8.62. Subject engagement consistently ranged between 60% and 75%. The treatment group received both proactive monitoring and follow-up care from the providers.\n## DISCUSSION\nActive monitoring with provider feedback enables the detection of exacerbation events early enough for subjects to avoid admissions. The use of non-smartphone interventions reduces barriers to care presented by more complicated and expensive technologies. This intervention represents a simple, innovative, and inexpensive tool for improved COPD management.\n",

Most of the current devices are equipped with remote monitoring functions, including bioimpedance for fluid status monitoring. The question remains whether bioimpedance measurements positively impact clinical outcome.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical interventions taken based on remote bioimpedance monitoring alerts and their impact on clinical outcome.\n## METHODS\nThis is a single-center observational study of consecutive ICD and CRT patients (n=282) participating in protocol-driven remote follow-up. Bioimpedance alerts were analyzed with subsequently triggered interventions.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 55.0% (155/282) of patients had an ICD or CRT device equipped with a remote bioimpedance algorithm. During 34 (SD 12)\u00a0months of follow-up, 1751 remote monitoring alarm notifications were received (2.2 per patient-year of follow-up), comprising 2096 unique alerts (2.6 per patient-year of follow-up). Since 591 (28.2%) of all incoming alerts were bioimpedance-related, patients with an ICD or CRT including a bioimpedance algorithm had significantly more alerts (3.4 versus 1.8 alerts per patient-year of follow-up, P<.001). Bioimpedance-only alerts resulted in a phone contact in 91.0% (498/547) of cases, which triggered an actual intervention in 15.9% (87/547) of cases, since in 75.1% (411/547) of cases reenforcing heart failure education sufficed. Overall survival was lower in patients with a cardiovascular implantable electronic device with a bioimpedance algorithm; however, this difference was driven by differences in baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio of 2.118, 95% CI 0.845-5.791). No significant differences between both groups were observed in terms of the number of follow-up visits in the outpatient heart failure clinic, the number of hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of heart failure, or mean length of hospital stay.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBioimpedance-only alerts constituted a substantial amount of incoming alerts when turned on during remote follow-up and triggered an additional intervention in only 16% of cases since in 75% of cases, providing general heart failure education sufficed. The high frequency of heart failure education that was provided could have contributed to fewer heart failure-related hospitalizations despite significant differences in baseline characteristics.\n",

The current study aimed to investigate the benefits of a TM system in managing AE in advanced-stage COPD patients to improve their Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and to reduce utilization of healthcare services.\n## METHODS\nA 12-month Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in the Veneto region (Italy). Adult patients diagnosed with Class III-IV COPD in accordance with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification were recruited and provided a TM system to alert the clinical staff via a trained operator whenever variations in respiratory parameters fell beyond the individual's normal range. The study's primary endpoint was HRQL, measured by the Italian version of the two Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF36v2). Its secondary endpoints were: scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the number and duration of hospitalizations; the number of readmissions; the number of appointments with a pulmonary specialist; the number of visits to the emergency department; and the number of deaths.\n## RESULTS\nThree hundred thirty-four patients were enrolled and randomized into two groups for a 1\u00a0year period. At its conclusion, changes in the SF36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores did not significantly differ between the TM and control groups [(-2.07 (8.98) vs -1.91 (7.75); p\u2009=\u20090.889 and -1.08 (11.30) vs -1.92 (10.92); p\u2009=\u20090.5754, respectively]. Variations in HADS were not significantly different between the two groups [0.85 (3.68) vs 0.62 (3.6); p\u2009=\u20090.65 and 0.50 (4.3) vs 0.72 (4.5); p\u2009=\u20090.71]. The hospitalization rate for AECOPD and/or for any cause was not significantly different in the two groups [IRR\u2009=\u20090.89 (95% CI 0.79-1,04); p\u2009=\u20090.16 and IRR\u2009=\u20090.91 (95% CI 0,75 - 1.04); p\u2009=\u20090.16, respectively]. The readmission rate for AECOPD and/or any cause was, however, significantly lower in the TM group with respect to the control one [IRR\u2009=\u20090.43 (95% CI 0.19-0.98); p\u2009=\u20090.01 and 0.46 (95% CI 0.24-0.89); p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively].\n## CONCLUSION\nStudy results showed that in areas where medical services are well established, TM does not significantly improve HRQL in patients with COPD who develop AE. Although not effective in reducing hospitalizations, TM can nevertheless facilitate continuity of care during hospital-to-home transition by reducing the need for early readmission.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nRetrospectively registered on January 2012, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01513980 .\n",
