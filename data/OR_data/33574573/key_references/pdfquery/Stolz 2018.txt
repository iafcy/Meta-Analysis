Objective: Internet-based cognitive– behavioral treatments (ICBT) have shown promise for various 
mental disorders, including social anxiety disorder (SAD). Most of these treatments have been delivered 
on desktop computers. However, the use of smartphones is becoming ubiquitous and could extend the 
reach of ICBT into users’ everyday life. Only a few studies have empirically examined the efficacy of 
ICBT delivered through a smartphone app and there is no published study on mobile app delivered ICBT 
for SAD. This three-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is the first to compare the efficacy of guided 
ICBT for smartphones (app) and conventional computers (PC) with a wait list control group (WL). 
Method: A total of 150 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for SAD were randomly assigned to 
one of the three conditions. Primary endpoints were self-report measures and diagnostic status of SAD. 
Results: After 12 weeks of treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcome on the composite 
of all SAD measures (PC vs. WL: d (cid:2) 0.74; App vs. WL: d (cid:2) 0.89) and promising diagnostic response 
(cid:2) 6.00) compared to the WL. No significant between-groups effects were 
rates (NNTPC 
found between the two active conditions on the composite score (Cohen’s d (cid:2) 0.07). Treatment gains 
were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Program use was more evenly spread throughout the day in the 
mobile condition, indicating an integration of the program into daily routines. Conclusions: ICBT can be 
delivered effectively using smartphones. 

What is the public health significance of this article? 
This study demonstrates that internet-based cognitive– behavioral treatments can be implemented by 
mobile devices, extending the reach into daily routines and fostering dissemination beyond the 
prevalence of desktop computers, for example in developing countries.

treatments (ICBT) have 
shown clinical efficacy and effectiveness for a variety of mental 
disorders in a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 
Andersson, Cuijpers, Carlbring, Riper, & Hedman, 2014; Hedman, 
Ljótsson, & Lindefors, 2012). Most of the promising evidence 
comes from studies evaluating guided ICBT, a treatment format in 
which patients are supported by therapists or coaches while they

work their way through a structured self-help program (Andersson, 
2016). 
One of the most researched disorders in ICBT is social anxiety 
disorder (SAD; Hedman, Botella, & Berger, 2016). A recent 
review identified 21 studies investigating Internet-based treat- 
ments for SAD comprising a total of 1,801 individuals suffering 
from SAD (Boettcher, Carlbring, Renneberg, & Berger, 2013). 
Overall, the vast majority of the RCTs investigating ICBT for SAD 
reported substantial reductions of social anxiety symptoms with 
large within-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d (cid:3) 0.80; Boettcher et al., 
2013). Trials directly comparing ICBT for SAD with face-to-face 
therapy revealed that both conditions led to large and similar 
clinical improvements (Andrews, Davies, & Titov, 2011; Botella 
et al., 2010; Hedman, Andersson, et al., 2011). Furthermore, 
treatment gains were stable for up to 5 years after treatment 
termination and the available data also shows that ICBT can be a 
cost-effective alternative to traditional CBT for SAD (Hedman, 


Andersson, et al., 2011; Hedman, Furmark, et al., 2011). One study 
also examined negative effects of ICBT for SAD (Boettcher, 
Rozental, Andersson, & Carlbring, 2014). In this study, 14% of the 
participants described unwanted negative events that they related 
to the treatment. The emergence of new symptoms was the most 
commonly experienced negative effect, followed by the aggrava- 
tion of social anxiety symptoms and negative well-being. 
SAD is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of negative 
evaluation in social situations (American Psychiatric Association, 
2013) and is one of the most common mental disorders with 12-month 
prevalence estimates of 7– 8% in large-scale community-based studies 
(Kessler et al., 1994; Magee, Eaton, Wittchen, McGonagle, & 
Kessler, 1996). ICBT may be especially suitable for this patient 
group because the absence of face-to-face contact might reduce 
fear and thereby improve learning of psychoeducational contents 
of the treatment (Hedman et al., 2016). Furthermore, the majority 
of individuals suffering from SAD do not seek treatment or if they 
do, only after a long delay of up to several years (Wang et al., 
2005). Olfson et al. (2000) found that a considerable number of 
individuals with SAD avoid seeking treatment because of their fear 
of what others (including the therapist) might think of them. ICBT 
may lower the threshold to seek help because socially anxious 
individuals experience more control and less threat of negative 
evaluation in online interactions (Lee & Stapinski, 2012). 
So far, most evaluated Internet-based treatments have been 
delivered via desktop computers. However, the increased usage of 
smartphones presents promising opportunities to extend the reach 
of ICBT into users’ everyday life, as these devices tend to be 
always on and within an arm’s reach (Boschen & Casey, 2008; Ly 
et al., 2015). Mobile treatments might also have further advantages 
over more traditional ICBT because they allow users to perform 
and record exercises in their natural environment (Bang et al., 
2007). Furthermore, the exercise instructions and supportive ma- 
terials can be reviewed on demand in everyday situations (Watts et 
al., 2013). Moreover, assessment can occur right before and after 
critical events (Heron & Smyth, 2010) and thus may be less 
biased by, for example, postevent processing (i.e., the tendency 
for individuals with SAD to engage in a detailed review of 
events following a social interaction). This might lead to more 
valid diary entries and thereby to more specific feedback and a 
more appropriate sense of increasing progress later on (Mel- 
lings & Alden, 2000). More generally, the use of ICBT on a 
smartphone might lead to shorter but more frequent sessions 
and therefore facilitate learning (Bjork, Dunlosky, & Kornell, 
2013). Lastly, a smartphone can be used more privately than a 
desktop computer that might be used by multiple people (Yuen, 
Goetter, Herbert, & Forman, 2012). 
On the other hand, mobile treatments may also have specific 
drawbacks. For example, the small screen might cause problems 
with longer texts and the lack of a keyboard might reduce comfort. 
Consequently, contents might be skipped over and diary entries or 
exercise records might be shorter than on a computer with larger 
screens and keyboards, all lowering the depth of processing and 
thereby probably lowering outcome. 
Up to now, only few studies have evaluated smartphone- 
delivered treatments. In their systematic review, Donker et al. 
(2013) could only identify a handful of smartphone applications 
(apps) that have been empirically and systematically evaluated 
(with a total N (cid:2) 227). This low number is surprising given the 
fact that about 18% of all 13,600 apps that had been published in 
2013 targeted health behavior (Donker et al., 2013). To date, studies 
on mobile interventions target various health-related areas, such as 
depression (Burns et al., 2011; Ly et al., 2015; Ly, Trüschel, et al., 
2014; Watts et al., 2013), SAD (Dagöö et al., 2014), stress reduction 
(Ly, Asplund, & Andersson, 2014), fitness (Fanning, Mullen, & 
McAuley, 2012), weight loss (Carter, Burley, Nykjaer, & Cade, 
2013), smoking cessation (Whittaker, McRobbie, Bullen, Rod- 
gers, & Gu, 2016), and borderline personality disorder with 
substance abuse (Rizvi, Dimeff, Skutch, Carroll, & Linehan, 
2011). In an earlier study targeting SAD (Dagöö et al., 2014), 
interventions could be accessed through smartphones, tablet 
computers, and standard computers. Thus, and in contrast to the 
current study, Dagöö et al. (2014) investigated an intervention 
that was optimized for the use on various devices and did not 
evaluate an app that only could be installed and used on 
smartphones. In their rather small 
trial with a total of 52 
participants, Dagöö et al. (2014) reported that participants used 
the smartphone 42.8%, 
the computer 50.1%, and the tablet 
computer 7.1% of the time. This study gave preliminary evi- 
dence that an intervention for SAD patients could be provided 
via smartphones. However, this study compared Internet-based 
cognitive behavior therapy with Internet-based interpersonal 
psychotherapy and did not include a comparison of smartphone 
versus computer-delivered treatment, therefore, more research 
is needed regarding smartphone-delivered treatments for SAD. 
Overall, results from the abovementioned studies indicate that 
smartphone-delivered treatments might be feasible, acceptable, 
efficacious, and suited for CBT-based treatments. However, the 
available studies are rather small or uncontrolled, and larger con- 
trolled studies are needed. Moreover, some of the studies evaluated 
blended treatments in which smartphone apps and face-to-face 
therapies or regular ICBT delivered on desktop computers were 
combined (Dagöö et al., 2014; Ly et al., 2015; Proudfoot et al., 
2013). Only two pilot studies compared mobile versus PC-based 
treatment delivery (Carter et al., 2013; Watts et al., 2013) and 
found no significant differences in efficacy. However, in these 
cases, this could be explained by limitations of sample size and 
power. 

To evaluate whether a previously validated Internet-based self- 
help program for SAD remains efficacious when delivered via 
smartphone app, we conducted a RCT in which we compared 
guided ICBT disseminated by means of a personal computer (PC) 
or an app with a wait list control group (WL). We hypothesized 
that both active treatment conditions would be superior to the WL. 
With regard to the active conditions, we did not have a clear 
hypothesis. There is neither evidence nor theory that could give 
conclusive hints to how assets and drawbacks of a mobile treat- 
ment might ultimately balance out. We also analyzed negative 
effects, usage patterns and predictors of outcome in the two active 
treatment conditions. To our knowledge, the new delivery option 
has never been systematically compared to the already well- 
established PC-based distribution in a large RCT. 





Participants were recruited from the general population through 
newspaper articles, mental health related magazines, online fo- 
rums, and interviews on radio and TV. In addition, several partic- 
ipants found our recruitment page via different search engines or 
links from other sites. The study website provided general infor- 
mation on SAD and its treatment, an outline of the study, a 24-hr 
emergency phone number and a registration form. Further study 
information and an informed consent form were provided via 
e-mail after registration. 
Criteria for inclusion were (a) a minimum age of 18 years, (b) 
access to a computer and a smartphone both with Internet connec- 
tion, (b) sufficient command of the German language, (c) exceed- 
ing the cut-off score on the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale 
(SIAS) or Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and (d) a primary diagnosis 
of SAD according to DSM–IV. Criteria for exclusion were (a) a 
history of psychotic or bipolar disorders, (b) other ongoing psy- 
chological treatment, (c) prescribed medication for anxiety or 
depression if the dosage had been changed during the last month 
prior to participation, or (d) active suicidal plans. Candidates with 
active suicidal plans were referred to a local psychiatrist or psy- 
chotherapist. Excluded persons were given access to the materials 
outside of the study if they were in a stable condition and were 
referred to other treatment options when needed. 

After returning a signed copy of the informed consent form, 
participants were asked to fill in the web-based baseline question- 
naires, 
including SAD measures, questions concerning demo- 
graphic variables, current medication, and prior or ongoing psy- 
chological treatment. When exceeding predefined cut-offs on one 
of the two social anxiety measures (SPS (cid:3) 22 or SIAS (cid:3) 33; 
Mattick & Clarke, 1998; German version: Stangier, Heidenreich, 
Berardi, Golbs, & Hoyer, 1999), participants were interviewed by 
phone using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM–IV—Axis 
I disorders (SCID; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 2002; 
German version by Wittchen, Zaudig, & Fydrich, 1997). The 
interviews were conducted by the authors and 10 advanced master 
students. All of them were previously trained in a workshop and 
further educated and tested in personal trial interviews with de- 
tailed feedback. In addition, interviewers were supervised by Timo 
Stolz and Thomas Berger. Interviewers could not be kept blind 
regarding group assignment at postassessment because some par- 
ticipants disclosed aspects of the group assignment during the 
interview. 
A total of 853 individuals signed up on the study website. Two 
hundred fifteen individuals signed the informed consent and com- 
pleted the questionnaires. Out of those, 65 did not pass inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, as depicted in Figure 1. The remaining 150 
participants were then randomly assigned to one of the three 
conditions: app, PC, or WL. The digital allocation tickets were 
concealed from the investigators and were assigned using a com- 
puterized random number generator. After randomization, the par- 
ticipants received an e-mail regarding their allocation. 
This RCT compared two active groups with either mobile or 
PC-based self-help to a WL. The WL received access to the mobile 
version after the treatment groups had completed the program. In 
the PC-based condition, access to the intervention was denied for 
mobile devices; participants in the mobile condition could only use 
the app on smartphones (iPhone or Android) to prevent shifts 
between the active conditions. Both treatments were not publicly 
available, as their use required participation in the study. All 
participants were guided by individual coaches during their active 
period. All groups were followed up until 3 months after treatment 
completion, as depicted in the flowchart (see Figure 1). 
The trial was registered with controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN 
10627379) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
Canton of Bern, Switzerland (13/05/2014, ref: 063/14). 

Participants of both active groups received access to the same 
self-help materials. The intervention is based on the cognitive 
model of Clark and Wells (1995) and informed by the treatment 
manual of Stangier, Heidenreich, and Peitz (2009). The same 
materials have already been tested and proven efficacious in earlier 
RCTs (Berger, Boettcher, & Caspar, 2014; Berger et al., 2011; 
Berger, Hohl, & Caspar, 2009, 2010; Boettcher, Berger, & Ren- 
neberg, 2012; Schulz et al., 2016). The layout was adjusted for the 
smaller screen sizes of smartphones. The treatment targets both 
behavioral and cognitive maintaining factors, such as self-focused 
attention, negative automatic thoughts, experiential avoidance, 
processing of self as an object under social evaluation, ruminative 
postevent processing of social situations, safety behaviors and 
biased perception of somatic and cognitive anxiety symptoms. 


1. Motivational enhancement: Participants are engaged in 
thinking of reasons to initiate change; they define goals 
and start to record difficult situations. 


3. Cognitive restructuring: This module includes a thought 
diary to track negative beliefs in daily routine, alongside 
with exercises to formulate helpful thoughts. 


5. Behavioral experiments: A training module for planning 
and tracking in vivo exposures. This is further detailed in 
the supplementary online materials, Supplemental Figure 
S5 and S6. 
6. Summary and repetition: The treatment’s key elements in 
brief with an emphasis on the importance of repeated 
practice.

Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM–IV) Axis I disorders;

The participants were advised to work through one module per 
week and to start a new session after receiving a weekly feedback 
on their written diary entries and recent progress. At the end of the 
last module, participants were asked to repeat the exercises (e.g., 
exposure exercises) and to review the material as needed till 
postassessment at the end of Week 12. Completing one module 
unlocks the next, therefore, users are required to work through the 
contents sequentially. 
Guidance. Timo Stolz and 10 advanced master’s students in 
clinical psychology provided guidance during treatment. All 
coaches received a 1-day workshop in using the self-help program 
and on how to write the weekly feedback, based on case material 
from earlier trials. In addition, the coaches were continuously 
supervised by Timo Stolz and Thomas Berger. Each coach cared 
for seven to 20 participants, monitored their progress in the pro- 
gram, and contacted them via a secured text-based messaging 
system once a week to provide feedback and encourage further 
engagement. Besides, participants could send messages with spe- 
cific questions and expect a response within three working days. 
The coaches’ main role was to reinforce independent program use 
and keep up the participants’ motivation. In case there was no 
activity by a participant during the week, coaches offered their 
help and assistance and asked if he or she was facing any problem 
with the program or with the tasks. 





Participants completed all self-report measures using web-based 
versions at pretreatment, posttreatment (12 weeks) and follow-up 
(3 months after post). 
Primary outcome measures. Primary outcome measures as- 
sessed self-reported symptoms of SAD using German versions of 
the SPS and SIAS and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale—Self 
Report (LSAS-SR, Baker, Heinrichs, Kim, & Hofmann, 2002; 
Stangier & Heidenreich, 2004). These measures are commonly 
used in studies on SAD. The SPS and SIAS consist of each 20 
items on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 4, resulting in a 
total score between 0 and 80. The LSAS-SR has 24 items, each of 
which is rated on a scale from 0 to 3. These three measures have 
shown to be valid and reliable with very good internal consisten- 
cies (Cronbach’s alpha, SPS (cid:2) .77–.94, SIAS (cid:2) .84 –.89, LSAS (cid:2) 
.95), good retest-reliability (rtt, SPS (cid:2) .92, SIAS (cid:2) .96, LSAS (cid:2) 
.83) in English (Mattick & Clarke, 1998) and German samples 
(Stangier et al., 1999) and demonstrate similar properties when 
administered online (Cronbach’s alpha, SPS (cid:2) .89, SIAS (cid:2) .86, 
Hedman et al., 2010). In the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha for 
the SPS was .86 at pretreatment and .91 at posttreatment, the SIAS 
showed (cid:4)s of .88 at pretreatment and .94 at posttreatment, and the 
LSAS had (cid:4)s of .92 at pretreatment and .95 at posttreatment. 
Besides these self-report measures, a second diagnostic inter- 
view was conducted at posttreatment to assess the number of 
participants no longer fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of SAD. 
Secondary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures 
consisted of self-reported assessments of depressive symptoms, 
interpersonal problems, quality of life, and overall psychiatric 
symptoms using the German versions of the Beck Depression 
Inventory-II (Hautzinger, Keller, & Kühner, 2006), the Inventory 
of Interpersonal Problems (IIP, Horowitz, Strauß, & Kordy, 2000), 
the psychological subscale of the Short Form-12 Health Survey 
(SF-12, Gandek et al., 1998), and the Brief Symptom Inventory 
(BSI, Derogatis, 1993; German version by Franke, 2000). 
The Beck Depression Inventory-II is widely used to assess 
depressive symptoms both in research and in clinical practice. It 
consists of 21 items with Likert-ratings from 0 to 3 and robust 
psychometric properties for SAD clients in online assessments 
(Hedman et al., 2010). Cronbach’s alpha in the current sample was 
.90 at pretreatment and .94 at posttreatment. The IIP was used to 
assess interpersonal problems. It has shown adequate psychometric 
properties (Horowitz, Rosenberg, Baer, Ureño, & Villaseñor, 
1988) and consists of 64 items to be answered on a Likert scale 
from 0 to 4. We report mean scores over all items as a measure of 
interpersonal distress (McFarquhar, Luyten, & Fonagy, 2018; 
Tracey, Rounds, & Gurtman, 1996). Cronbach’s alpha in the 
current sample was .91 at pretreatment and .95 at posttreatment. 
The SF-12 is a briefer variant of the Short Form Health Survey 
(SF-36) and measures both physical and mental health. We only 
report the mental health subscale because physical health is not 
addressed by the treatment. Participants were asked to report the 
presence and severity of mental problems over the course of the 
last four weeks. The 12 items cover pain, psychological problems, 
as well as impairments in everyday functioning. With its good 
retest reliability and brevity, the SF-12 is widely used as an 
estimate of the general quality of life (Gandek et al., 1998). The 
BSI assesses psychological distress on nine dimensions such as 
anxiety, insecurity in social situations, depressiveness and com- 
pulsivity. In the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha for the BSI was 
.94 at pretreatment and .96 at posttreatment. The participants are 
asked to rate the occurrence of symptoms within the last week on 
a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4. In this study, we report the 
Global Severity Index (GSI), which is the mean score over all 
items. As an economic instrument with robust psychometric prop- 
erties, the BSI is commonly administered to detect prepost changes 
(Franke, 2000). 

The power analyses were conducted with G(cid:2)Power 3 (Faul, 
Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007). We aimed at detecting small 
to medium effect sizes of f (cid:2) 0.175 and larger with regard to 
Time (cid:5) Group interactions for the active conditions at an alpha 
error level of .05. Smaller effect sizes were considered to be 
irrelevant from a clinical point of view. A power analysis revealed 
that 37 participants were needed per active treatment group to 
show such an effect with a power (1 (cid:6) (cid:7)) of .80, assuming 
correlations of r (cid:2) .45 between pre- and postmeasures as previ- 
ously found in similar trials on ICBT for SAD (Berger et al., 2011, 
2009). Sample size was further estimated based on a drop-out rate 
of 25%. Based on this assumption, we would have needed 47 
participants in each treatment group. We finally decided to ran- 
domize 60 participants to each of the active conditions. A sensi- 
tivity power analysis revealed that given this sample size, a sig- 
nificance level of p (cid:2) .05, and minimum power of .80, the test of 
interaction effect was sufficiently sensitive to detect effect sizes of 
f (cid:2) 0.130 which corresponds to a Cohen’s d of 0.26. Furthermore, 
30 participants were estimated to be sufficient for the WL because 
effect sizes between the WL and treatment groups were assumed to 
be large based on the aforementioned earlier trials. 

All statistical analyses were performed with R (R Core Team, 
2016) and the packages lme4 (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker, 
2015) and mice (van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). 
Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and (cid:8)2 tests were used to detect 
differences in demographic data, pretreatment measures, clinically 
significant improvement, and diagnostic status at posttreatment. 
Patterns of dropout were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of 
variance (MANOVA) and Little’s (missing completely at random) 
MCAR test (Little, 1988). For the primary analysis of our results, 
we computed a composite score from the three social anxiety 
measures (SIAS, SPS, LSAS) to avoid multiple testing and poten- 
tial inflation of alpha-error. Z-scores were standardized based on 
the pretreatment means and standard deviations. The composite 
score and, as secondary analyses, all primary and secondary out- 
come measures were analyzed with mixed-effect models using 
unstructured covariance matrices and restricted maximum likeli- 
hood estimation (Bates et al., 2015) with time-points nested within 
subjects. This approach uses all available data of each subject 
without substituting missing values and allows the inclusion of all 
participants in the analyses, following the intention-to-treat prin- 
ciple. For robustness, these analyses were repeated using multiple 
imputation and repeated-measures ANOVA with time (prepost) as 
a within-group factor and treatment condition as a between-groups 


factor. The models were further examined using contrast analyses. 
Within- and between-groups effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calcu- 
lated based on estimated means and the pooled standard deviation 
from the observed means. In addition, differences between the two 
active conditions were analyzed using a JZS Bayes factor t test. 
This test was computed using JASP (JASP Team, 2017) and 
JASPs’ default priors together with a robustness analysis for 
various prior widths. Within-group changes in outcome scores 
from posttreatment to follow-up were analyzed for the active 
conditions only, as the WL was assigned to treatment after 12 
weeks. This was done with another mixed-effects model per out- 
come measure that involved all time points to retain as much 
information as possible in case of missing values. Changes from 
post to follow-up were then tested with Tukey’s honest significant 
difference (HSD) post hoc tests. We also report the number of 
participants who clinically significantly improved and who reli- 
ably deteriorated. Cases were counted as clinically significantly 
improved if they changed reliably according to the reliable change 
index (RCI; Jacobson, Follette, & Revenstorf, 1984) and belonged 
to a functional population at posttreatment according to criterion 
‘c’ of Jacobson et al. (1984), and under consideration of the 
normative data provided by Stangier et al. (1999). As normative 
data had been unavailable for the LSAS, cases were counted as 
clinically significantly improved when the posttreatment score was 
at least 2 standard deviations below the baseline assessment, which 
is in accordance with criterion ‘a’ of Jacobson et al. (1984). The 
following thresholds were computed for the primary outcome 
measures: for the SPS, 15.34, RCI (cid:2) 7.39; for the SIAS, 24.05, 
RCI (cid:2) 10.33; and for the LSAS, 42.24, RCI (cid:2) 23.89. Reliable 
deterioration was defined as a prepost increase on the SPS, the 
SIAS or the LSAS of at least the RCI defined above. With regard 
to clinically significant improvement we also report numbers needed 
to treat (NNT). NNT is the number of patients who need to be treated 
to achieve one additional positive outcome—in comparison to another 
treatment or a placebo. When pWL is the probability of remissions in 
the WL, and pApp is the probability of being cured by the app 
treatment, the NNT equals to 1/(pApp 



The conditions did not differ in symptom severity or demo- 
graphic variables with two exceptions: Participants in the mobile 
condition were less educated, (cid:8)2(6, N (cid:2) 150) (cid:2) 14.29, p (cid:2) .03, 
V (cid:2) 0.22, and had a higher GSI prescore, t(117.85) (cid:2) (cid:6)2.46, p (cid:2) 
.02, d (cid:2) 0.45, than participants in the PC-based condition. Table 
1 provides further details. 

In total, 39 participants (26%) did not complete the posttreat- 
ment assessment, although they had been invited three times in 
weekly intervals via e-mail (PC, n (cid:2) 14; app, n (cid:2) 18; and WL,

Furthermore, dropout was unrelated to symptom severity at 
baseline according to Little’s MCAR test, (cid:8)2(6) (cid:2) 9.34, p (cid:2) .16, 
and confirmed with a MANOVA across all primary and secondary 
measures with missingness as grouping factor, F(6, 143) (cid:2) 1.58, 
p (cid:2) .16, partial (cid:9)2 (cid:2) 0.06. 



Composite score. A linear mixed model for composite symp- 
toms showed a significant Time (cid:5) Group interaction, F(2, 
120.09) (cid:2) 14.18, p (cid:10) .01. A consecutive contrast analysis showed 
that both active treatments outperformed the WL at post, 
t(119.46) (cid:2) 5.08, p (cid:10) .01, d (cid:2) 1.07, with no significant difference 
between the active conditions but a trend in favor of the app 
condition, t(120.75) (cid:2) 1.71, p (cid:2) .09, d (cid:2) 0.30. 
Separate measures. Further linear mixed models with group 
as a fixed factor and time as a repeated factor (pre—post) were 
fitted separately for each of the dependent measures. Significant 
Time (cid:5) Group interaction effects have been found for all primary 
and secondary outcomes, F(2, 117.46 –121.83) (cid:2) 4.08 –11.71, 
ps (cid:2) .01–.02. Consecutive contrast analyses showed that both 
active treatments were significantly superior to the WL on all 
involved measures, t(113.84 –121.67) (cid:2) (cid:6)2.78 – 4.60, ps (cid:2) .01, 
ds (cid:2) 0.53–1.01. However, there was no significant difference 
among the active conditions—neither on primary outcomes, 
t(117.90 –121.49) (cid:2) 1.28 –1.61, ps (cid:2) .11–.20, ds (cid:2) 0.20 – 0.30, 
nor on secondary outcomes, t(114.85–123.14) (cid:2) (cid:6)0.71– 1.06, 
ps (cid:2) .29 –.71, ds (cid:2) (cid:6)0.11– 0.20, except for the GSI in which the 
mobile group fared significantly better, t(120.16) (cid:2) 2.06, p (cid:2) .04, 
d (cid:2) 0.38. When adjusting the p values for multiple testing, both 
active treatments still significantly outperformed the WL on all 
involved measures, all adjusted ps (cid:2) .01. 
Because neither of the active treatments was found to be supe- 
rior over the other, neither on the primary outcomes nor on the 
secondary measures, standardized differences of estimated pre-to- 
post changes are reported together with their confidence intervals 
in the supplementary online materials. On the SPS, the SIAS, and

the LSAS, the 95% confidence intervals of these differences are 
bounded to be lower than 0.12 SDs in favor of the PC-based 
version. Therefore, even in the strongest case there would only be 
a small effect in favor of the PC-based delivery option. Further- 
more, a JZS Bayes factor t test suggested that the data was 9.89 
times more likely to be observed when the mobile treatment was as 
efficacious as the PC-based version. This gives moderate evidence 
that the mobile treatment is at least not less efficacious than the 
PC-based version. Further details of the test are reported in the 
supplementary online materials, including a robustness analysis for 
a broad range of priors, Supplemental Figure S7. 

Regarding the composite score and single primary outcomes, the 
same pattern of results was found (a) on completers’ data, (b) using 
multiple imputation, and (c) when controlling for education, cur- 
rent medication or prior psychotherapy. The same pattern was also 
found for secondary outcomes, except for the GSI: The difference 
between both active groups was found to be significant with 
procedure (c) but not with procedures (a) or (b). Overall, the 
analyses of primary and secondary outcomes were robust. Never- 
theless, results regarding the GSI have to be interpreted with 
caution. The significant results found in the corresponding linear 
mixed effects model could have been biased by dropout of more 
severely affected participants. 

Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) are presented in Table 2. The between- 
groups effect sizes at posttreatment on the composed social anxiety 
measures were d (cid:2) 0.07 for app versus PC (in favor of the app), 
d (cid:2) 0.89 for app vs. WL, and d (cid:2) 0.74 for PC v. WL. Mean 
between-groups effect sizes on secondary outcome measures were 
d (cid:2) 0.10 for PC versus app (in favor of the PC-based version), d (cid:2) 
0.39 for app vs. WL, and d (cid:2) 0.52 for PC v. WL. Within-group 
comparisons on the composite outcome and based on estimated 
means revealed large effect sizes in the PC-based group (d (cid:2) 1.25) 
as well as in the mobile group (d (cid:2) 1.84; see Table 2 for detailed 
information). 


The WL had no cases of clinically significant improvement 
(CSI) on the SPS and the SIAS, but two such cases (6.7%) on the 
LSAS. 
the PC-based condition achieved higher 
amounts of such cases on the SPS (n (cid:2) 16 [26.67%], NNT (cid:2) 
3.75, (cid:3)(cid:8)2(1, N (cid:2) 90) (cid:2) 7.99, p (cid:10) .01, V (cid:2) 0.30), the SIAS (n (cid:2) 
12 [20.00%], NNT (cid:2) 5.00, (cid:8)2(1, N (cid:2) 90) (cid:2) 5.30, p (cid:2) .02, V (cid:2) 
0.24), and the LSAS (n (cid:2) 13 [21.67%], NNT (cid:2) 6.67, (cid:8)2(1, N (cid:2) 
90) (cid:2) 2.25, p (cid:2) .13, ns, V (cid:2) 0.16). The same applies to the mobile 
condition, again on the SPS (n (cid:2) 12 [20.00%], NNT (cid:2) 5.00, (cid:8)2(1, 
N (cid:2) 90) (cid:2) 5.30, p (cid:2) .02, V (cid:2) 0.24), the SIAS (n (cid:2) 10 [16.67%], 
NNT (cid:2) 6.00, (cid:8)2(1, N (cid:2) 90) (cid:2) 4.06, p (cid:2) .04, V (cid:2) 0.21), and the 
LSAS (n (cid:2) 12 [20.00%], NNT (cid:2) 7.50, (cid:8)2(1, N (cid:2) 90) (cid:2) 1.79, p (cid:2) 
.18, ns, V (cid:2) 0.14). No significant differences were found between 
the two active conditions. 

In total, 92 participants could be reached for a second clinical 
interview after the treatment (app, n (cid:2) 34 [57%]; PC, n (cid:2) 37 
[62%]; and WL, n (cid:2) 21 [70%]; with (cid:8)2(2) (cid:2) 1.50, p (cid:2) .47, for 
differences in response rate). To deal with a total of 39% of 
missing interviews, we administered several procedures to exam- 
ine the fraction of cured participants. First, we analyzed com- 
pleters only (PC: 14/37 [37.8%], app: 9/34 [26.5%]). Second, we 
considered all missings as still suffering from SAD (PC: 14/60 
[23.3%], app: 9/60 [15.0%]). Third, we considered all missings as 
still suffering from SAD unless they showed a clinically signifi- 
cant improvement on the self-reported primary outcomes (PC: 
18/60 [30.0%], app: 10/60 [16.7%]). 
Regardless of the procedure, all participants in the WL were still 
diagnosed with SAD. The PC-based group fared significantly 
better than the WL, regardless of the adopted procedure, (cid:8)2(1, N (cid:2) 
58 –90) (cid:2) 6.61–9.45, ps (cid:2) .01, V (cid:2) 0.27– 0.38. The mobile group 
showed significant differences for the first and the third procedure, 
(cid:8)2(1, N (cid:2) 55–90) (cid:2) 4.06 – 4.85, ps (cid:2) .03–.04, V (cid:2) 0.21– 0.30, but 
not for the second procedure, (cid:8)2(1, N (cid:2) 90) (cid:2) 3.47, p (cid:2) .06, V (cid:2) 
0.20. Differences between the active groups were not significant 
regardless of the approach. 

All analyses in this section only include the two active condi- 
tions, as the WL had already received access to the mobile version 
of the treatment. Mixed-models analyses including pre, post, and 
follow-up scores showed significant time effects for all scales, F(2, 
166.86 –176.07) (cid:2) 31.99 –150.09, ps (cid:10) .01. Contrast analyses 
indicate that follow-up scores improved from baseline, t(170.41– 
180.46) (cid:2) (cid:6)14.96 – 8.07, ps (cid:10) .01, ds (cid:2) 0.75–1.52, and post hoc 
tests using Tukey’s HSD indicate stability from posttreatment to 
follow-up, as no significant changes were detected, ps (cid:2) .05–.98. 
All Time (cid:5) Group interactions were nonsignificant, F(2, 166.86 – 
176.07) (cid:2) 0.23–2.04, ps (cid:2) .13–.79, thus through all time points, 
neither of the delivery options were significantly superior. 

Two participants (1.3%) achieved reliable deterioration on the 
SPS (app, n (cid:2) 1, WL, n (cid:2) 1) and one participant (0.7%) deteri- 
orated reliably in the PC-based group on the SIAS. 

Details on program usage are provided as supplementary online 
material. In summary, the mobile treatment was used less exten- 
sively in terms of (a) the number of performed exercises, (b) 
recorded diary entries, (c) number and length of messages written 
by patients, (d) single actions like clicks or taps, (e) time spent 
using the program, and (f) completed modules. In addition, residu- 
alized posttreatment outcome was predicted by active program 
usage. However, significant correlations were found in the mobile 
condition only. The most influential predictor was the number of 
tracked exposure exercises ((cid:11) (cid:2) .47, p (cid:10) .01). For these correla- 
tive analyses, residual gain scores of the composite outcome and 
computed Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were used. 


Single actions like clicks or taps were distributed differently 
over the course of the day in the two conditions (Figure 3 and 4). 
In the mobile condition, the usage was spread more evenly across 
the day, whereas members of the PC-based condition performed a 
higher fraction of their work during the night (see Figure 3). A 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test suggested nonequal distributions, D (cid:2) 
0.14, p (cid:10) .01. Furthermore, there was a significant Hour X Group 
interaction for the count of actions, F(23, 1553.87) (cid:2) 1.93, p (cid:2) 
.01, indicating a different usage pattern over time in the two 
conditions. Finally, usage decreased significantly after postassess- 
ment, however, without significant differences among the active 
conditions. 

This RCT compares the efficacy of a mobile and a PC-based 
SAD treatment program to a WL. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first large RCT comparing mobile and PC-based dis- 
semination of the same guided self-help treatment. In addition, it is 
the largest trial using smartphones to target a specific disorder. We 
found two prior pilot studies that have been either rather small 
(cid:2) 35) or were not targeting a 
(Watts et al., 2013; NPC-vs.-App 
specific psychological disorder (weight loss; Carter et al., 2013; 
(cid:2) 85). In the present study, both treatment formats 
NPC-vs.-App 
were effective in reducing symptoms of SAD and increasing 
psychological well-being after 12 weeks of treatment. The within- 
group effect sizes of d (cid:2) 1.84 (mobile) and d (cid:2) 1.25 (PC) are in 
line with recent meta-analyses on ICBT for SAD (Andrews, Cui- 
jpers, Craske, McEvoy, & Titov, 2010; Spek et al., 2007) and 
earlier trials using the same materials (Berger et al., 2009, 2010, 
2011; Boettcher et al., 2012; Schulz et al., 2016). Of all treated 
participants, 28.3% achieved clinically significant improvement on 
at least one of the primary outcome scales (mobile: 23.3%, PC: 
33.3%), compared to none in the WL. Furthermore, 19.2% of the 
participants did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria of SAD at post- 
treatment when missings were regarded as failures to provide 
conservative estimates (mobile: 15.0%, PC: 23.3%) compared to 
none in the WL. Improvements were maintained six months after 
randomization. Given that 62.0% of participants had been treated 
with psychotherapy in the past and that participants showed high 
comorbidity rates, these results can be interpreted as encouraging. 
The effect sizes between the active treatment groups and the WL 
were at d (cid:2) 0.89 (mobile) and d (cid:2) 0.74 (PC) for the composite 
social anxiety score. These between-groups effect sizes can be 
compared with the effects on traditional therapist-delivered CBT 
reported in a meta-analysis by Acarturk, Cuijpers, van Straten, and 
de Graaf (2009), in which a subgroup analysis of 35 studies with 
wait list comparisons revealed a mean effect size of d (cid:2) 0.86 on 
social anxiety measures for therapist-delivered CBT, cognitive 
therapy, social skills training, relaxation, and/or exposure. How- 
ever, the between-groups effect sizes in the current study are 
slightly below the effect sizes reported in a more recent meta- 
analysis which found standardized mean differences of Hedges’ 
g (cid:2) 1.19 for individual CBT versus wait lists (Mayo-Wilson et al., 
2014). Also, the percentage of participants who clinically signifi- 
cantly improved was below the range of that reported in studies on 
evidence-based face-to-face CBT, though comparisons are diffi- 
cult because definitions of clinically significant improvement vary 
across studies. For instance, a trial on face-to-face CBT based on 
the same approach as our study (Clark & Wells, 1995) reported 
high clinically significant improvement rates of 74% on the SPS 
and of 63% on the SIAS for individual CBT (Stangier, Heiden- 
reich, Peitz, Lauterbach, & Clark, 2003). However, the mean 
scores of the two studies at posttreatment are quite similar (e.g., 
SPS posttreatment Stangier et al.: 21.5 vs. SPS posttreatment 
present study: 22.0). Thus, the low CSI rates in the current study 
may be partly due to a conservative estimate. Another reason for 
the low CSI rates is that the present sample was highly impaired. 
Pretreatment scores on social anxiety measures in the current study 
were about half a standard deviation higher than pretreatment 
scores reported in studies on face-to-face CBT (e.g., Stangier, 
Heidenreich, Peitz, et al., 2003). The high scores at pretreatment 
could have reduced the chance of falling below the cut-off. Fur- 
thermore, the high pretreatment scores also indicate that our sam- 
ple may be representative for a severely impaired population of 
SAD patients that typically seek information about the disorder on 
the Internet (Erwin, Turk, Heimberg, Fresco, & Hantula, 2004). 
Regarding the comparison between the two active conditions, 
neither of the two treatment formats was significantly superior to 
the other, except for the GSI in which the mobile group showed 
greater improvements. However, the difference in gains is small 
and might in part be explained by regression toward the mean, as 
the mobile group had a significantly higher GSI prescore. With 
regard to the primary self-report measures, the mobile treatment 
can be considered as efficacious as the PC-based version, although 
the mobile version was less extensively used in terms of (a) 
performed exercises, (b) recorded diary entries, (c) number and 
length of written messages, (d) single actions like clicks or taps, (e) 
time spent using the program, and (f) completed modules. Taken 
together, the mobile delivery might require a smaller dose to 
achieve the same effect. This might be due to different mecha- 
nisms of change, which are indicated by the differing correlations 
of usage and outcome and, even more, by the different usage 
patterns during the course of a typical day. However, only little is 
known about the association of adherence, usage patterns, and 
outcome in Internet-based treatments (Donkin et al., 2011). Thus, 
further research should address differences in mechanisms of 
change for mobile and PC-based delivery. It could be assumed that 
exposure exercises have a stronger impact on outcome when they 
are prepared on a mobile device and then conducted spontane- 
ously, whenever the opportunity arises. It might be of further 
advantage that the exercise can then be immediately recorded. This 
immediacy prevents postevent processing from diminishing the 
sense of progress. However, and importantly, according to the 
current findings an evidence-based treatment can be presented 
both on mobile devices and on the PC without altering the efficacy. 

Several limitations of this study need to be considered. First, 
participants had to work either with a PC or with a smartphone and 
could therefore not be blinded to treatment allocation. The same is 
true for their guiding coaches and the diagnostic interviewers, as 
most of the participants unwittingly revealed their mode of treat- 
ment within the messages and/or during the interview and no 
measures were taken to prevent participants from breaking the 
blind. In addition, the interrater reliability of SAD diagnoses was 
not formally established. Second, the findings provide evidence for 


this particular treatment and cannot be easily generalized to other 
programs or disorders. However, similar results were found in 
small pilot studies on depression (Watts et al., 2013) and weight 
loss (Carter et al., 2013), which also compared mobile and PC- 
based treatments, and one trial with a mobile treatment for SAD is 
announced (Miloff, Marklund, & Carlbring, 2015). Nevertheless, 
findings from this trial should be replicated in other disorders. 
Third, the limited power of this study did not allow us to detect 
small effects between the two active groups at posttreatment. At 
the level of an individual treatment, such small effects might be 
less important than other therapy-related factors, but from a public 
health perspective, small effects with large populations can have 
great societal impact. Therefore, our findings should be replicated 
in larger samples and in an unguided format, because unguided 
treatments would be especially suitable for public health interven- 
tions. To deal with power limitations in this trial, interaction 
effects were analyzed using contrast analyses to provide a more 
sensitive estimation of differences in efficacy between the active 
conditions. Contrast analyses have more power as opposed to 
comparisons at one point in time, as they can account for repeated 
measures and thus are able to assign variance within the subjects. 
Furthermore, a JZS Bayes factor t test was added to assess the 
likelihood of similar effects for both active conditions. This test 
suggested that the data was 9.89 times more likely to be observed 
when the mobile treatment was at least as efficacious as the 
PC-based version, instead of the PC-based version being truly 
superior. Fifth, this study tested a self-selected sample with indi- 
viduals who expressed their interest in an Internet-based delivery. 
In addition, treatment expectancy was not assessed. Therefore, we 
could not establish whether the results might depend on particu- 
larly motivated patients. However, other studies indicate that 
Internet-based interventions work just as well in routine practice as 
in research (e.g., Andersson & Hedman, 2013). 

Despite these limitations, the present study extends the existing 
knowledge on ICBT by systematically testing a novel delivery 
option. Besides easier integration in daily life and routine, mobile 
CBT could have promise for low and middle-income countries due 
to a large unmet need for mental health services (Saraceno et al., 
2007), in which the coverage of smartphones with an Internet 
subscription is much higher than those of online desktop comput- 
ers might ever be (Aranda-Jan, Mohutsiwa-Dibe, & Loukanova, 
2014). 
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that SAD can be 
effectively treated with mobile self-help applications, with treat- 
ment gains being maintained 6 months after randomization.
