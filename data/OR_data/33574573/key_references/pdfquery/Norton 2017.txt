exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which 
is likely to cause pervasive distress in almost anyone. 
Predisposing factors include personality traits of 
compulsivity, asthenia or prior neuroses. Main 
symptoms include flashbacks (reliving of traumatic 
event), nightmares, emotional blunting, detachment 
from others, unresponsiveness to surroundings, 
anhedonia, and avoidance of activities and situations 
reminiscent of the trauma, a sense of hypervigilance, an 
enhanced startle reaction, and insomnia. Anxiety and 
depression are commonly associated with these signs 
and symptoms, and suicidal ideation is frequent. The 
onset follows the trauma with a latency period that may 
range from a few weeks to months. 










Anxiety that is generalized, persistent but not related to 
identifiable environmental circumstances. Main 
symptoms usually include complaints of persistent 
nervousness, trembling, muscular tensions, sweating, 
lightheadedness, palpitations, dizziness, and epigastric 
discomfort. 
Characterized by unpredictable episodes of severe 
anxiety that are not related to any specific situation. 
Main symptoms usually include sudden onset of 
palpitations, chest pain, choking sensations, dizziness, 
and feelings of unreality (depersonalization or 
derealization). Also, often reported is fear of dying, 
losing control, or going mad. 
Fear of judgement by others resulting in avoidance of 
social situations. Often associated with low self-esteem, 
fear of criticism, and accompanied by blushing, hand 
tremor, nausea, or urinary urgency. Symptoms may 
progress to panic attacks. 

 
 
 
 
 

























 
 

























 
 

























 
 

























 
 

























 
 























 
 



















Patient education intervention delivered to primary care 
patients using a smart phone app aimed at development 
of the ability to be aware and alert in the present 
moment and to practice basic meditation techniques for 
the purpose of anxiety reduction. 
The undesirable emotional state that is predominant in 
GAD and will be quantified using the tool, the GAD-7, 
developed to track severity of symptoms of the 
disorder.

Constructs 
Humanistic Philosophy 
Definition 
Reflective of a move away from the medical model 
to humanistic philosophy: 


Individuals are social animals and share a 
common humanity. 
Individuals have the potential for growth 
through awareness of and interaction with 
self and others. 

 The individual’s growth is enhanced by a 
respectful approach in validating the 
person’s ability to deal competently with his 
or her own life experiences. 
Individuals have the ability to make choices 
and to exercise control in decisions 
affecting their lives. 
Individuals cannot be categorized in that 
they are composed of many different facets 
of which none stands alone. 






Nurses participate in helping patients believe they 
are more than a diagnosis. Together they explore 
problems, understand the power of a willingness to 
change, and optimistically use their strengths to 
address problems. Each small step is celebrated, 
building optimism for recovery in the patient. 
The nurse and patient enter an equal partnership, 
characterized by everyday speech, free-flowing 
dialogue, and a holistic approach to care. Patients 
are seen as possessing the skills, or the ability to 
learn them, that will lead them to cope with mental 
illness successfully. In the end, the power to accept 
or reject nursing advice lies with the patient alone, 
and that is respected. 
There is concentration on patients’ strengths rather 
than a medical diagnosis, which offers recovery as a 
real option. 
Focus on a medical diagnosis is not helpful to 
patients. Instead, the patients’ own understanding of 
their mental health concerns is the starting point, and 
from there active participation and decision-making 
is facilitated by the nurse. 
There is an emphasis on the fact that nurses and 
patients stand on equal ground, that of being human, 
with the potential to understand the other’s 
perspective, concentrating more on how we are alike 
rather than how we are different.

approachability, and reinforces a 
common humanity with patients. 

interactions, which may not always 
occur at a healthcare facility. A home 
visit or meeting at a public location 
may increase the nurse’s insights 
regarding the patient. 
 Self-disclosure refers to the ability to 
interact in a non-judgmental manner 
with patients, even sharing some 
individual information, to help a 
patient feel understood. 
 Unscripted dialogue is used as 
appropriate to address irregularities in 
patient behaviors or location of patient 
interactions as an opportunity to effect 
change. 

open to the patient as a human being 
without limiting interactions to a 
narrow definition of providing nursing 
care. More information about a patient 
leads to a sense of common humanity. 
Individuals adopt strategies to cope with 
stress. They may manage, alter, or regulate 
their emotional responses. 
Opposite of the medical model which views 
mental illness as occurring as a result of some 
sort of pathology (external locus of control), 
patients are encouraged to accept 
responsibility for their own well-being 
(internal locus of control).
