Self-esteem is the value that we attribute to ourselves and is therefore subjective and 
depends only on our thoughts. A high self-esteem is characterized by trust in one’s own 
abilities, acceptance of mistakes or failure, the willingness to learn from mistakes and to 
praise oneself for something. 
We draw our sense of self-esteem from the many different areas of our lives. It is 
dangerous to obtain self-worth from only one source (e.g., professional success or 
appearance). Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and thus areas of life in which 
he/she is more or less self-confident. Decisive for our self-esteem is whether we only look 
at the defects or also at our strengths. Write down your strengths or areas of life in which 
you have a strength. For example, your profession, sports, leisure activities, hobbies, 
appearance, relationships…. Remember that no one is perfect and it is impossible to 
perform equally well in all areas of life. 


For many people, imagination exercises and introspection takes some getting used to. Try 
this exercise even if you have doubts − most people can still profit from this exercise 
despite doubts. Take a few minutes and, if you’d like to, close your eyes. Imagine a place 
where you feel completely safe and secure. This place can be in the treetop of a large tree 
with a thick trunk that does not tip over. Or in house by the sea, where you can look out 
over the waves and it is pleasantly warm inside. Or on a comfortable sofa in front of a 
warming fireplace. What does your place look like? Imagine in detail. Rest for a while 
inwardly in this safe place and recharge your batteries for everyday life around you. 
Whenever you need it, you can return to this resting place. 


Do you sometimes feel that your needs are being ignored? Practice making yourself heard 
in social situations or even saying “no”. For example, in situations where someone 
interrupts you all the time or won’t let you speak, make yourself noticed in a friendly way 
(e.g., “I haven’t finished talking yet”; “I would also like to say something about this”). 
Another example is a too far-reaching request from a friend. If you say no once, you’re not 
going to jeopardize losing your friendship. A real friend usually even wishes for honest 
feedback from you rather than dishonest responses or placation. Can you think of a 
concrete situation from the last week in which you wished you could have set better 
boundaries? Think about that situation and how you can react in a determined and 
friendly way. Practice setting your boundaries in your mind, and next time it will work out 
a little better in a real situation. 


 
 
 





Your posture and facial expression influence your emotions and mood, and vice versa. A 
bent posture, a sad facial expression and a soft voice promote sadness, fear and low self- 
esteem. Change your attitude and expression to promote self-confidence and joy. Stretch 
out, straighten your back and hold your head upright. Do you feel how you grow inside as 
you change your attitude? You can also cross your hands behind your head for a moment. 
Thies way you stretch your body upward and automatically make sure your shoulders 
don’t fall forward. Take it even a step further and smile. How does it feel to smile? 
Perceive for a moment how your body and face feel. After the exercise, try to keep your 
body upright all day long and to not “let yourself down”.
