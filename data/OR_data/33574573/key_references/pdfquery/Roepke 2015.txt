Objective: Technological advances have sparked the development of computer- and smartphone-based self-help 
programs for depressed people, but these programs’ efﬁcacy is uncertain. This randomized controlled trial 
evaluated an intervention called SuperBetter (SB), which is accessed via smartphone and/or the SB Web site. 
Materials and Methods: Online, we recruited 283 adult iPhone(cid:2) (Apple, Cupertino, CA) users with signiﬁcant 
depression symptoms according to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D). 
They were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) a version of SB using cognitive-behavioral therapy 
and positive psychotherapy strategies to target depression (CBT-PPT SB); (b) a general SB version focused on 
self-esteem and acceptance (General SB); or (c) a waiting list control group (WL). The two SB groups were 
instructed to use SB for 10 minutes daily for 1 month. All participants completed psychological distress and 
well-being measures online every 2 weeks through follow-up. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using 
hierarchical linear modeling. 
Results: As hypothesized, SB participants achieved greater reductions in CES-D scores than WL participants by 
posttest (Cohen’s d = 0.67) and by follow-up (d = 1.05). Contrary to prediction, CBT-PPT SB did not perform 
better than General SB; both versions of SB were more effective than the WL control. Differences between SB 
versions favored General SB but were not statistically signiﬁcant. 
Conclusions: These large effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously in light of high attrition rates and the 
motivated, self-selected sample. Nonetheless, smartphone-based/Internet-based self-help may play an important 
role in treating depression. 


ment of computer- and smartphone-based tools aimed 
at promoting mental health.1,2 These tools can augment 
conventional depression treatment by making therapy 
homework more convenient and engaging, by serving as a 
minimally invasive intervention for people with mild 
symptoms, and by offering treatment where it has been 
unavailable.2–4 Of the estimated 350 million people who 
suffer from depression, fewer than half are treated, and 
about 30% of those treated do not fully recover.5,6 High-tech 
tools present exciting opportunities to address these prob- 
lems, but do they work? 
Efﬁcacy of computer- and smartphone-based 
interventions 
Online cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) programs can 
alleviate depression, whether they are self-directed, thera- 
pist-guided, or video chat–based.7–12 These programs’ effect 
sizes are small to moderate for self-reported depression, with 
Cohen’s d ranging from 0.20 to 0.37.8,9 Their efﬁcacy is 
perhaps unsurprising, as these programs closely follow tra- 
therapy, psychoeducation, and/or bibliotherapy 
ditional 
models. 
Mobile platforms have enabled novel, creative uses of 
traditional treatment strategies. Mobile applications (apps) 
have multiple advantages: They are convenient, engaging,

user-friendly, personalized, and self-paced. Framed as 
games, apps become potentially powerful tools to promote 
well-being. "Serious games" are games designed to achieve 
goals beyond entertainment, such as improved health, cog- 
nition, and education.13 Indeed, playing games is associated 
with improved mood and decreased physical stress, as well 
as improved knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors toward 
health and exercise.14,15 Additionally, games can build sup- 
portive communities through chatrooms, forums, and social 
networking.16 
Although well-being apps and serious games have pro- 
liferated, their impact is unclear as few have been rigorously 
evaluated.17,18 Researchers and app developers can collab- 
orate to identify and evaluate apps with potential to relieve 
depression and enhance well-being. 

SuperBetter (SB) is an innovative smartphone- and In- 
ternet-based tool that uses game mechanics to increase users’ 
drive to accomplish challenging goals and to build social 
support through online discussion forums and Facebook in- 
tegration. (More information on SB is available in Supple- 
mentary Table S1 [Supplementary Data are available online 
at www.liebertonline.com/g4h].) The University of Penn- 
sylvania (Philadelphia, PA) and SuperBetter Labs, LLC (San 
Francisco, CA) collaborated to conduct a randomized con- 
trolled trial of SB’s ability to relieve depression. A version of 
SB was developed to speciﬁcally target depressive symptoms 
using principles from successful established therapies, 
namely, CBT and positive psychotherapy (PPT).19–21 This 
version (‘‘CBT-PPT SB’’) was evaluated alongside an ex- 
isting version of SB (‘‘General SB’’), not speciﬁcally de- 
signed for depression. Both versions were compared with 
each other and with a waiting list control group (WL). 
We anticipated that SB use would result in decreased 
depression. We expected CBT-PPT SB to provide the 
greatest beneﬁt, given its basis in established interventions 
for depression. According to the cognitive theory of de- 
pression, participants should beneﬁt from learning cognitive 
restructuring techniques that help them identify and correct 
distorted, negative thoughts about the self, world, and fu- 
ture.22 In addition, participants should beneﬁt from behav- 
ioral activation, a well-established technique that alleviates 
depression by increasing daily experiences of pleasure and 
mastery.23 Finally, PPT has been found to alleviate depres- 
sion symptoms by increasing positive emotions, meaning, 
and engagement.21 
We expected General SB to confer a more modest beneﬁt. 
First, it should beneﬁt participants by facilitating so-called 
common factors such as positive expectancy and social sup- 
port.24 Second, activities focused on self-esteem should ben- 
eﬁt participants by addressing depressive self-devaluation.22 
Finally, third-wave CBT approaches have recently highlighted 
the value of acceptance-based treatment strategies, which are 
included in this version of SB.25 
In addition, we expected that SB use would impact sec- 
ondary outcomes. We anticipated that SB would diminish 
participants’ anxiety, given the comorbidity of depression 
and anxiety as well as the commonalities in treatment ap- 
proaches for depression and anxiety symptoms. We also 
anticipated that SB would raise participants’ overall life 
satisfaction, self-efﬁcacy, and perceived social support, as 
SB was designed to empower participants to make positive 
changes in their lives and to connect with others. We did not 
hypothesize that either version of SB would prove superior 
with regard to these secondary outcomes. 
Thus, we tested three hypotheses: (a) Participants using 
SB will experience greater improvements in depression 
symptoms compared with WL participants. (b) Participants 
using CBT-PPT SB will experience greater improvements in 
depression symptoms compared with those using General 
SB. (c) Participants using SB will experience greater im- 
provements in secondary outcomes (anxiety, life satisfaction, 
self-efﬁcacy, and social support) compared with WL par- 
ticipants. 


Eligible participants were iPhone(cid:2) (Apple, Cupertino, 
CA) owners (as SB was available only on iOS) 18 years of 
age or older, meeting the criterion score for clinically sig- 
niﬁcant depression (16 or higher) on the Center for Epide- 
miological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D)26 
(Table 1). A priori power analyses, completed using 
G*Power software, indicated that at least 207 participants 
would be needed to detect a small effect in a repeated- 
measures design testing a within–between interaction (e.g., a 
Time · Condition interaction), assuming a error probability = 
0.05 and power (1 – b error probability) = 0.80, with a cor- 
relation of 0.40 among repeated measures. Participants 
(n = 283) were recruited online between November 2012 and 
March 2013 through announcements on the Penn Authentic 
Happiness Web site and the Craigslist.org community bul- 
letin board. The announcement guided potential participants 
to www.Qualtrics.com where they completed a CES-D 
screening and baseline assessment. 
Enrollment and random assignment were completed in an 
automated fashion on the Qualtrics Web site. After com- 
pleting the baseline assessment, participants were randomly 
assigned to one of three conditions (using the automated 
Block Randomizer in Qualtrics): CBT-PPT SB, General SB, 
or WL. Participants were aware of whether they were as- 
signed to SB or WL, but SB participants were not aware of 
the version they received or of our speciﬁc hypotheses. 
(Astute participants with knowledge of existing therapies 
may have recognized the CBT and PPT components of the 
CBT-PPT version.) Information on participant ﬂow is pro- 
vided in Figure 1. 

This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board (i.e., Human Ethics Committee) at the University of 
Pennsylvania (protocol number 816882). 
Intervention content. CBT-PPT SB targeted depression 
with two sets of activities. These participants ﬁrst down- 
loaded content adapted from PPT: (a) the 3 Good Things 
intervention,27 (b) identiﬁcation of personal strengths with 
the Values in Action Inventory,27 and (c) guidance on using 
strengths in new ways.21,27 Upon completion, they were then 
asked to download content adapted from two classic CBT

interventions: (a) cognitive restructuring (replacing depres- 
sive thoughts with adaptive ones)22 and (b) behavioral acti- 
vation (planning and carrying out activities that provide 
pleasure and mastery).23 
The General SB program focused on self-esteem and ac- 
ceptance of the present. For instance, participants were asked 
to ‘‘practice being present’’ (notice surroundings, breathe 
deeply, etc.), collect a list of ‘‘awesome qualities’’ others 
attribute to them, or ﬁnd a piece of art or music that reminds 
them to accept life’s ups and downs. Figure 2 shows SB 
screenshots. 
The two versions of SB were otherwise similar. SB users 
interacted with a game-like platform and were invited to de- 
scribe a goal (an epic win; here, overcoming depression), take 
recommended steps toward this goal (quests), complete re- 
commended mood-boosting activities ( power-ups), directly 
address speciﬁc obstacles (battle bad guys), and enlist social 
support if desired (invite allies). SB users earned points and 
‘‘leveled up’’ as they progressed through these activities. 
WL participants did not complete any prescribed inter- 
vention. They were asked only to complete surveys at 2, 4, 
and 6 weeks (as SB participants did also). All participants 
were free to concurrently use other treatment strategies (e.g., 
psychotherapy, coaching, and/or medication). Data about 
such activities were collected at each time point and used as 
time-varying covariates in analyses. 
Intervention procedure. Both SB groups were instructed 
to use SB for at least 10 minutes per day for 1 month, as 
previous literature suggests that interventions lasting p4 
weeks can effectively reduce depression symptoms.28 The 
intervention was targeted to occur on the SB iPhone app, but 
participants could also use the SB Web site on their personal 
computers. (The SB app may be somewhat easier to use than 
the Web version, mainly because participants have their mo- 
bile phones accessible when completing SB actions. Thus, 
they can record their actions in the app immediately. Also, 
fewer clicks are needed to record each action in the mobile 
app. On the other hand, some players prefer the accessibility 
of larger screens generally used with the Web version. How- 
ever, content and text are identical across versions, and other 
differences are minor.) They were encouraged to use the 
forum and recruit Facebook social support (allies), which was 
optional in order to protect privacy and conﬁdentiality. 
Measurement procedure. Data collection occurred online 
via Qualtrics surveys and via participants’ iPhones/computers. 
(SB Labs automatically logged app usage data, such as number 
of log-ins and what content was downloaded.) Participants 
engaged in the intervention and surveys in a self-directed 
manner at their location and time of choice. No incentives were 
used to increase compliance, but e-mail reminders were sent at 
2-, 4-, and 6-week assessment intervals. Data collection lasted 
through May 2013; the study concluded when the target en- 
rollment was surpassed and the ﬁnal wave of participants 
completed their 6-week follow-up assessments. 

Participants completed a total of four online surveys, each at 
2-week intervals (baseline, midpoint, posttest, and follow-up). 
The survey contained the measures and questions detailed

in Table 1. The CES-D was used to assess the primary out- 
come variable: depression at posttest.26 The CES-D is a valid 
measure of depression symptoms for both psychiatric pop- 
ulations and community samples and proved reliable in this 
study (Cronbach’s a = 0.86).29 Participants also reported 
demographic traits: race/ethnicity, gender, age, and educa- 
tion level. 

Preparatory analyses. We ﬁrst examined the data distri- 
butions and checked that the assumptions of our intended 
analytic methods were met. We tested for differences in de- 
mographic and/or psychosocial variables between conditions 
at baseline, using t tests and one-way analyses of variance (for 
continuous variables) and chi-squared tests (for categorical 
variables). When signiﬁcant differences were detected, these 
variables were used as covariates in the main analyses. 
We also examined whether intervention usage or ﬁdelity 
differed across conditions and discovered that it did: 54.41 
percent of participants using CBT-PPT SB (n = 37) down- 
loaded only PPT content and did not download or use the CBT 
content. (Unlike CBT-PPT SB, which comprised these two 
separate downloads at distinct time points, the General SB 
condition required only one download to receive all content.) 
Missing data. We retained 41.34 percent of the original 
sample at midpoint (n = 117), 26.15 percent at posttest

(n = 74), and 18.34 percent at follow-up (n = 52), a high at- 
trition rate typical for Internet-based intervention research.30 
Participants who stayed in the study through posttest were 
more satisﬁed with SB (mean = 5.26, standard deviation 
[SD] = 1.14) than those who did not (mean = 4.24, SD = 1.79) 
[t(49) = - 2.51, P = 0.02]. WL participants were less likely to 
have dropped out by posttest than either of the other groups 
[v2(2, n = 283) = 11.53, P = 0.003]. Missing data were ac- 
counted for using intent-to-treat analyses estimated with the 
maximum likelihood method in a hierarchical linear mod- 
eling (HLM) framework. 
HLM of outcomes. A series of models was used to con- 
duct an intent-to-treat analysis, modeling change in partici- 
pants’ depression symptoms (and in secondary outcome 
variables) over time. We conducted analyses using SAS 
Enterprise version 9.3 software.31 The Level-1 model captures 
within-person change in depression (and other repeatedly 
measured variables) over four time points. This within-person 
change is referred to as the slope. The Level-2 model reﬂects 
participants’ condition (CBT-PPT SB, General SB, or WL) as 
the between-persons predictor. 
For all HLM models (unless otherwise noted in Results), 
continuous measures in the Level-1 model were centered at 
pretest (i.e., the intercept), and dichotomous variables were 
coded 1/0 to allow for meaningful evaluation of parameter 
estimates. We ﬁrst tested unconstrained models to conﬁrm 
that there was signiﬁcant individual variation about the slope 
and intercept before accounting for random assignment to 
condition. Treatment effects were evaluated by examining the 
Time · Condition interaction, which reﬂects group differences 
in improvement over time and is represented by the b coef- 
ﬁcient associated with treatment condition in the Level-2 
model. The b coefﬁcient represents how much the slope of the 
dependent variable (e.g., depression symptoms) changes with 
every 1-unit change in the independent variable of interest 
(here, condition), controlling for any other variables in the 
Level-2 model. We calculated effect sizes (Cohen’s d) for 
between-group changes using the procedure recommended 
by Feingold.32 In all models, we included key covariates: 
participants’ use of other treatment (medication, therapy, and 
coaching) during the trial, age at baseline, and gender. 
Post hoc analysis examining the impact of CBT con- 
tent. As noted above, 54.41 percent of CBT-PPT SB users 
downloaded only half of the intended content. We suspect 
that this was due not to meaningful systematic differences 
across individuals, but rather to confusion about how to 
download content: Unlike General SB participants, CBT- 
PPT SB participants were asked to download content on two 
separate occasions. To better understand the impact of PPT 
versus CBT content, we conducted another HLM analysis in 
which we separately examined the impact of General con- 
tent, PPT content, and CBT content compared with WL (a 
treatment-on-treated analysis). 


There were 283 participants randomly assigned to the 
CBT-PPT SB (n = 93), General SB (n = 97), or WL (n = 93) 
groups. (Three individuals were excluded from analyses 
because they enrolled in the study twice and were assigned to 
two different conditions.) Of these, 117 completed the 
midpoint assessment, 74 completed the posttest, and 52 
completed the follow-up (Fig. 1). 



The sample was primarily white (n = 238, 84.1 percent), 
female (n = 197, 69.60 percent), and educated at the As- 
sociate’s Degree (i.e., 2-year college degree) level or higher 
(n = 261, 92.2 percent). Mean age was 40.15 (SD = 12.40) 
years. Comparing the three conditions, age differences 
approached conventional levels of statistical signiﬁcance 
[F(2, 280) = 2.89, P = 0.06], as did gender differences [v2(2, 
n = 280) = 5.57, P = 0.06]. Thus, age and gender were used as 
covariates 
in subsequent analyses. Other demographic 
characteristics, recruitment source, and key clinical charac- 
teristics did not signiﬁcantly differ across groups. Table 2 
provides detailed demographic and clinical information. 
At baseline, participants’ mean CES-D score of 33.39 
(SD = 9.41) reﬂected clinically signiﬁcant levels of depres- 
sion symptoms. At baseline, 35.7 percent (n = 101) of par- 
ticipants were using therapy as a strategy to treat depression 
and/or another condition, 43.8 percent (n = 124) were using 
medication, and 7.4 percent (n = 21) were using life coach- 
ing. Overall, 61.1 percent of participants (n = 173) were using 
one or more of these strategies. Depression symptoms and 
other psychosocial variables did not signiﬁcantly differ 
across groups (Table 2). 

This study prioritized external validity and made SB usage 
as naturalistic as possible. Treatment adherence was lower 
than might be expected in traditional clinical randomized 
controlled trials, likely because of the absence of incentives. 
Of 190 participants assigned to use SB, 75.80 percent 
(n = 144) logged in at least once. Number of log-ins ranged 
from 1 to 274 total, with a mean of 21.53 (SD = 34.27) and 
median of 9.50. Relatively few participants used the optional 
forum (n = 21) or invited allies via Facebook (n = 6), and this 
did not signiﬁcantly differ across the two SB conditions. 
Similarly, the two SB conditions did not signiﬁcantly differ 
in the number of times they signed in or used various SB 
features (power-ups, quests, battles, and extra powerpacks). 
Some CBT-PPT SB participants did not receive all in- 
tended SB content, perhaps owing to confusion about tech- 
nical aspects of the app. Of the 93 participants assigned to 
CBT-PPT SB, 72 (77.4 percent) logged in to SB. Of the 68 
(73.12 percent) who downloaded content, 37 (54.41 percent) 
downloaded PPT content only, whereas 31 (45.59 percent) 
downloaded both PPT and CBT as intended. (In contrast, of 
the 97 participants assigned to General SB, 72 [74.23 per- 
cent] logged in, and 64 of these [88.89 percent] downloaded 
all the intended content for this group.) We further examine 
this issue below. 

SB’s effects were evaluated by examining the signiﬁcance 
of the difference between the rates of change (slopes) in 
CES-D scores for the CBT-PPT SB, General SB, and WL 
conditions. All models controlled for participants’ age, 
gender, and use of other treatment (medication, therapy, and 
coaching). (Note that medication, 
therapy/coaching, and 
gender did not predict change in depression. Older partici- 
pants showed slightly greater decreases in depression [Age 
t(276) = - 2.83, P < 0.001].) Table 3 
coefﬁcient = - 0.13, 
gives means and SDs, and Tables 4 and 5 give HLM pa- 
rameter estimates and signiﬁcance tests. Generally, partici- 
pants became less depressed over time (i.e., the main effect 
of time was signiﬁcant). SB users achieved greater relief 
from depression symptoms than WL participants (Table 4), 
with an effect size (Cohen’s d) of 0.67 by posttest. The 
difference between SB and WL groups was statistically 
signiﬁcant 
[Condition coefﬁcient = - 6.13, 
t(276) = - 3.90, P < 0.001] (the Condition coefﬁcient was 
estimated in the model using scores centered at posttest). 

Participants using CBT-PPT SB did not achieve greater 
relief from symptoms than participants using General SB, 
contrary to prediction (Fig. 3). Both groups showed sig- 
niﬁcantly faster rates of improvement than WL (Table 5). 
CBT-PPT SB participants were less depressed than WL 
participants at posttest 
[Condition coefﬁcient = - 3.92, 
t(275) = - 2.06, P = 0.04], as were General SB participants

estimated difference between the two SB groups’ rates of 
change (1.06), favoring General SB, was not signiﬁcant 
[t(237) = 0.82, P = 0.41]. CBT-PPT SB yielded an effect size 
of d = 0.43, and General SB yielded an effect size of d = 0.92 
by posttest, in comparison with WL. These calculations 
should be interpreted cautiously in light of high attrition rates 
and the motivated, self-selected sample (discussed below).

depression than WL participants (d = 1.05) (Table 4). Again, 
both CBT-PPT SB (d = 0.76) and General SB (d = 1.36) 
participants improved more rapidly than WL participants 
(Table 5). Both CBT-PPT SB [Condition coefﬁcient = 
-6.99, t(275) = - 2.66, P = 0.008] and General SB [Condition 
t(275) = - 4.70, P < 0.001] partici- 
coefﬁcient = - 12.42, 
pants were less depressed than WL participants at follow-up 
(with this Condition coefﬁcient estimated using scores cen- 
tered at posttest). Again, these models controlled for age, 
gender, and use of other treatment (medication, therapy, and 
coaching). 

life satisfaction, self-efﬁcacy, and social sup- 
port. Detailed information about SB’s impact on secondary 
outcome variables is provided in Tables 4 and 5. Of note is that 
SB users experienced greater decreases in anxiety than WL 
and greater improvements in life satisfaction, self-efﬁcacy, 
and social support than WL. Again, both versions of SB were 
generally effective, and neither version proved superior to 
the other. Here too, all models controlled for age, gender, and 
use of other treatment. 

We conducted a treatment-on-treated analysis to deter- 
mine the impact of PPT content versus combined CBT-PPT 
content. We used a hierarchical linear model similar to those 
above to investigate the impact of having actually down- 
loaded PPT content only (n = 37), CBT and PPT content 
(n = 31), or General SB content (n = 64). In comparison with 
WL participants who did not use SB at all (n = 79), partici- 
pants who actually downloaded General SB or the complete 
CBT-PPT content achieved signiﬁcantly greater decreases in 
depression (Table 6). In contrast, those who downloaded 
PPT only did not fare better than participants who did not use 
SB at all. (In 14 cases it was uncertain whether a WL par- 
ticipant had downloaded SB content before or after the WL 
period had elapsed. These individuals were excluded here in 
order to make this a clean treatment-on-treated analysis.) 

Participants who used the SB tool achieved decreases in 
depression symptoms. Our ﬁrst hypothesis was supported: 
SB users demonstrated signiﬁcantly fewer depressive 
symptoms by posttest than control participants. These ﬁnd- 
ings are consistent with past research on the positive impact 
of online programs for reducing depressive symptoms.7–10 
Furthermore, these ﬁndings suggest that mobile platforms 
and game mechanics provide opportunities for creative and 
effective uses of clinical knowledge. 
Our second hypothesis was not supported. Even though 
the CBT-PPT SB version was based on empirically sup- 
ported depression interventions, CBT-PPT SB users did not 
experience greater decreases in depression than General SB 
users. Rather, both groups of SB users fared better than WL 
participants, and neither SB version proved superior; General 
SB’s apparent advantage was not statistically signiﬁcant. 
Why was CBT-PPT SB no more effective than General 
SB? First, treatment ﬁdelity issues help to explain the pattern 
of results. About half of CBT-PPT SB users failed to 
download the CBT content, and so they did not receive the 
full intervention as intended. We would not expect that 
completing just two PPT exercises would have a large impact 
on depression symptoms. Indeed, the treatment-on-treated 
analysis indicated that participants who downloaded the 
combined CBT-PPT content fared signiﬁcantly better than 
the WL, whereas those who downloaded only PPT content 
did not. There may also be substantive issues with the CBT- 
PPT SB content that can explain why it was not even more 
effective. For instance, CBT-PPT SB users may have found 
this newly developed content less user-friendly and engaging 
compared with the General SB participants who used the more 
reﬁned, established, popular SB content. In addition, the more 
complex skills involved in CBT may take longer to master or 
may require more direct and intensive guidance. Moreover, 
depressed individuals can have motivational and cognitive 
deﬁcits that cause them to be frustrated and discouraged by 
challenging, reﬂective activities; in contrast, easy, pleasant 
activities offer a simpler path to improved mood.33 
On the other hand, why was General SB more effective 
than anticipated? First, this version of SB was chosen be- 
cause it was a well-established favorite of previous SB users, 
and so it may have been much more engaging. Second, 
negative self-evaluations are central to depression, so Gen- 
eral SB’s self-esteem content may have conferred important 
beneﬁts.22 Third, there is increasing evidence that accep- 
tance is a useful approach for dealing with depression.34 
General SB’s acceptance-based content may have proved 
accessible and helpful—and it may have been easier to adapt 
to the mobile format in comparison with complex cognitive 
restructuring skills. Fourth, it is possible that both versions of 
SB exert their effects through common mechanisms such as 
increasing positive expectancy or helping users feel em- 
powered.

Negative coefﬁcients indicate that SuperBetter (SB) users had greater decreases over time compared with waiting list control participants. 
Scores were centered at pretest for these analyses, age at baseline and gender were treated as covariates, and medication and therapy/ 
coaching usage (measured at each time point) were treated as time-varying covariates. 



Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) ranged from 0.43 to 1.36. The bi- 
nomial effect size display can help make sense of Cohen’s d.35 
The binomial effect size display presents hypothetical dif- 
ferences in outcome rates across the intervention and control 
groups. An effect size of d = 0.67 (SB versus WL at posttest) 
is equivalent to a scenario in which 66 percent of interven- 
tion participants experience meaningful change and only 34 
percent of WL participants do. An effect size of d = 1.36 
(General versus WL at follow-up, the greatest effect found 
here) is equivalent to 78 percent of intervention participants 
experiencing meaningful change compared with 22 percent 
of WL participants. 

These effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously in light 
of several important limitations of the study, concerning 
treatment ﬁdelity and dosage, attrition, measurement, and 
generalizability. 
Treatment ﬁdelity and dosage. About half (54.41 per- 
cent) of participants using CBT-PPT SB (n = 37) did not 
receive the complete intervention, as explained above. This 
limits conclusions that can be drawn about differences be- 
tween the SB versions. To more accurately determine whether 
one version of SB is superior, it would be necessary to ensure 
that (in a large sample with low attrition) all participants re- 
ceived all intended content. It would also be beneﬁcial to 
measure any moderators that may make a particular version of 
SB more effective for a particular set of individuals. 
Also, although all SB participants received the same in- 
structions about how often to use SB, treatment dosage (i.e., 
number of log-ins) varied from 1 to 274 (mean = 21.53). The 
majority of participants did not in fact log in daily for 
1 month. It is notable that several participants commented 
that they would have appreciated having more content to 
download. SB encourages users to create their own content 
(quests, battles, bad guys, power-ups, etc.) if/when they 
complete all the preprogrammed content. However, it may 
be that some users disengage when they run out of novel 
predesigned content. Our log-in rates hint that to maximize 
SB’s effectiveness, it may be necessary to spur users to re- 
turn to the site daily by creating a higher volume of novel 
content or developing other motivational strategies. 
Attrition. This study had low retention rates, with only 
26.15 percent of the sample intact at posttest and 18.34 
percent at follow-up. These large attrition rates are not un- 
common in Internet-based research.30 The attrition rate is 
due in part to our prioritization of ecological validity. For 
naturalistic SB usage, incentives for compliance were not 
used. The large attrition rate limits the conclusions we can 
draw, in spite of our efforts to alleviate some of these con- 
cerns by using intention-to-treat with HLM. The relatively 
small number of individuals who stayed in the study through 
follow-up strongly inﬂuenced the parameter estimates. These 
retained participants might have been especially motivated 
or high-functioning. 
Measurement. Depression was measured using a vali- 
dated self-report instrument, not a clinical assessment. Thus, 
participants may not have met criteria for a diagnosis of 
Major Depressive Disorder, and these ﬁndings may not 
generalize to such individuals. (Nonetheless, the sample’s 
mean CES-D score was well above the CES-D’s standard 
clinical cutoff, and a majority of participants were receiving 
treatment.) 
Generalizability. This sample of iPhone owners may not 
represent the general population, as iPhone users tend to be 
more educated, liberal, and of higher income than the average 
individual.36 In addition, SB’s effects may vary for users with 
greater or lesser comfort/expertise with mobile and online 
technology. Because of the short follow-up, we also cannot 
generalize about the long-term effects of the intervention. 
It is notable that our sample was largely recruited from a 
self-help Web site, Authentic Happiness. Individuals who are 
actively seeking self-help tools may be an especially moti- 
vated, hopeful, or proactive subset of the depressed popula- 
tion. Furthermore, our participants were aware of whether 
they were in WL an or intervention group. Intervention 
participants may have enjoyed positive expectancies, hope, 
and/or increased self-efﬁcacy owing to the knowledge that 
they had accessed a new self-help resource. These factors 
could have increased the effect sizes found here. 
Thus, our ﬁndings may not generalize to all depressed 
people, particularly those in traditional clinical settings. Our 
ﬁndings are more applicable to depressed individuals seek- 
ing self-help resources. Participants did not receive any in- 
centives to take part or to comply with the intervention 
guidelines, and this increases the study’s external validity. 

There are exciting future directions for this research. Pos- 
itive changes were effectively elicited through an innovative 
therapy and psy- 
technological format unlike traditional 
choeducation. This suggests that psychological interven- 
tions may beneﬁt from embracing the creative opportunities 
provided by mobile platforms and game-like formats. In 
particular, it is important to understand how evidence-based 
treatment strategies can translate into novel formats without 
sacriﬁcing ﬁdelity or effectiveness. It will be valuable for 
researchers to replicate this study but with an emphasis 
on internal validity, namely, by minimizing attrition rates 
and maximizing treatment ﬁdelity. We also need to un- 
derstand the mechanisms of change in these new interven- 
tions and the populations for whom these interventions are 
most appropriate. 

These ﬁndings suggest that smartphone-based apps pro- 
vide promising opportunities for mental health interventions. 
The tools could be integrated with traditional psychotherapy 
approaches. For example, therapists could use mobile apps to 
assign, monitor, and collaborate with clients on homework 
between sessions. Although these tools cannot achieve or 
replace what individual therapists do, they can expand access 
to treatment. People unable to receive treatment owing to 
stigma or other barriers (cost, location, long waiting lists) 
could be helped by technology-assisted interventions. Ad- 
ditionally, smartphone-based tools could serve as appropri- 
ate and cost-effective interventions for people with minimal 
symptoms not yet requiring medication or therapy. It is our 


hope that a new wave of innovative, evidence-based online 
and mobile interventions will help to alleviate depression 
symptoms and raise well-being.
