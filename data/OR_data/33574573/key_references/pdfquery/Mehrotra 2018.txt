Abstract: There is a dearth of published research on uptake and utility of mental health apps in India, 
despite a rising global trend in the application of technology in the ﬁeld of mental health. We describe 
the development and pilot testing of a self-help intervention for depression, PUSH-D (Practice 
and Use Self-Help for Depression) for urban Indians. This guided self-help app, with essential 
and optional zone sections, was developed to provide a comprehensive coverage of therapeutic 
strategies drawn from cognitive behavior therapy, interpersonal therapy, supportive psychotherapy, 
and positive psychology. Pilot testing was carried out using a single group pre-, post- and follow-up 
design in 78 eligible participants. Participants were typically young adults with major depression 
or dysthymia and signiﬁcant impairment in functioning. Almost two-thirds of the participants had 
never sought professional mental health help. Signiﬁcant reductions in depression and improvement 
in the functioning and well-being were notedon standardized measures in participants completing 
all 10 essential zone sections. These gains were maintained at follow-up. The results were similar 
for partial completers, who completed ﬁveout of the 10 essential sections. PUSH-D is one of the ﬁrst 
indigenously developed self-help apps for depression and it shows promise in reducing the treatment 
gap for depression in India.

The potential for the use of internet-based platforms in the mental health ﬁeld has attracted 
signiﬁcant attention of scientists and other stakeholders in the last few years [1–3]. This is evident 
from the number of articles being published on this topic as well as the number of applications (apps) 
available on platforms such as Apple and Google Play stores [4]. Using the key word ‘mental health’ 
in combination with the word ‘internet-based’ as search terms on PubMed resulted in 251 articles for 
the last ﬁve-year period(2013–2017). 
A growing number of research studies on internet-based interventions in the ﬁeld of mental health 
need to be understood in the background of observations that the majority of individuals across the 
globe who need mental health interventions do not receive them. World Health Organization (WHO, 
2007) has recommended development of an optimal mix of different kinds of services for addressing 
treatment gap in mental health. This includes empowerment of communities, through provision

of low-intensity self-help interventions as a ﬁrst line in themanagement of common mental health 
problems [5,6]. Realization of the magnitude of treatment gap and the potential use of technology on 
one hand, coupled with increasing internet access on the other hand have propelled voluminous 
research on self-help interventions for psychiatric conditions that can be delivered through the 
internet [7]. Internet-based self-help interventions can play an important role in addressing unmet 
mental health needs in low-resource settings with limited availability of mental health professionals 
and poor access to mental health services. Internet-based interventions offer several advantages 
such as ease of access, low costs, ﬂexibility, privacy and convenience of use etc. [1]. Internet-based 
self-help interventions have several potential points of implementation: during the waiting period 
for meeting a mental health professional, as stepped-care for low severity problems, as preventive 
measure for individuals at risk, as relapse prevention for those with residual symptoms or as a blended 
approach when integrated with face-to-face interventions [1]. The present study focuses on examining 
an internet-based self-help intervention, primarily as a stepped-care approach. 


Numerous studies have been published on internet-based interventions for a wide variety of 
common mental health conditions and substance use disorders [3]. Cognitive behavior therapies(CBT) 
, especially for depression, have been the most popular forms of therapy approaches for which 
internet-based formats have been tested, although there are a handful of studies on other forms 
of internet-based therapies too [1,8,9]. This may be due to a variety of factors such as availability 
of empirical evidence-base for CBT as well as its structured nature, ease of transformation into 
internet-based delivery formats and potential for client-learning with minimal external assistance. 
CBT-based internet interventions have typically yielded moderate effect sizes [10]. Internet-based 
interventions that are completely unguided, as well as those involving some level of human assistance 
have both been examined for their utility. Most studies suggest superiority of interventions that involve 
some human contact (therapist or a non-professional) in terms of adherence and performance [11]. 
Unguided self-care apps tend to be associated with low adherence rates. Typically, unguided apps 
also have limited scope for contextualization depending on the needs of a user. Other limitations of 
completely unguided apps include dependence on a user’s motivation to complete the intervention 
and reliance on a user’s self-awareness about when it is required to stepup to a higher-intensity 
intervention. There is a wide array of unguided apps that have come up in the commercial marketplace 
and there is insufﬁcient information built into the description of apps to help a potential user decide 
whether a given app might best suit his/her needs [12]. 
Reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of internet-based interventions 
for depression and anxiety disorders have, in general indicated promising results in term of their 
efﬁcacy in reducing severity of symptoms [13–18]. Despite mounting evidence on efﬁcacy of 
internet-basedinterventions for common mental health problems, several concerns have been noted by 
researchers working in this ﬁeld. Some of these include low uptake of internet-based interventions 
by individuals who are provided access to the same and high drop-out rates seen in intervention 
trials. Limited use of active placebo controls in research studies and insufﬁcient evidence about long 
term gains of internet-based interventions etc. are a few other issues that have been raised [16,19,20]. 
Mushrooming of un-tested mental health apps, some of which are designed with little involvement 
of mental health professionals and promoted in the unregulated marketplace has also raised ethical 
questions [13,21,22]. 

Although there have been large-scale empirical studies on internet-based interventions for 
common mental health problems across the globe, most of these are from Western nations and only 


some of these well-researched apps are freely available to a potential user [23–25]. Relatively very 
little is known about how internet-based methods of delivery of psychological interventions may 
be received and used in non-Western cultures by individuals for whom they are designed [26–28]. 
A broad scan of literature indicated that although several papers have been published in the last few 
years on the scope of digital mental health in India, there is a signiﬁcant dearth of empirical research 
on internet-based interventions for mental health in the Indian context [29–32]. 
The ﬁndings of a recently completed National Mental Health survey spanning 12 Indian states has 
revealed high prevalence of common mental health problems and importantly, the extent of treatment 
gaps for these problems. As per this survey, one in every 20 persons is estimated to be suffering 
from major depression. What is more disturbing is the observation that about 85% of those who 
need professional intervention for depression are not able to access treatment [33]. In this context, an 
increasing penetration of the internet in India [34] provides an opportunity to examine the potential 
utility of internet-based interventions for depression in urban Indians. 
A review of free depression apps available on Android platforms for Indian users highlighted that 
most of these apps focus on psycho-education or mood monitoring, and only a few apps incorporate 
managing suicidal thoughts as a component [25]. This review also indicated that there is limited 
information built in these apps on their scope and limitations or for educating the users about when 
to reach out for a higher intensity intervention as well as how to overcome mental barriers related 
to seeking professional help. The last point becomes especially relevant in a country like India 
where stigma and negative attitudes towards help seeking make it difﬁcult for individuals to seek 
professional face-to-face interventions for mental health [35,36]. Self-care apps cannot merely help 
individuals learn skills to handle their minor mental health issues, but can also include content aimed 
at strengthening positive attitudes towards seeking professional help whenever it is needed. There is 
a need for development and testing of internet-based interventions that are culturally appropriate, 
and address common concerns in clients as seen in clinical practice, while taking in account limited 
professional resources and low levels of mental health literacy [36,37]. On the whole, the review of 
research highlighted the need for an internet-based self-help program for depression that covers a wide 
range of therapeutic components commonly utilized in clinical practice in urban India, and addresses 
some of the lacunae in free depression apps through including components on psycho-education, 
managing suicidal thoughts as well as guidance about when to step-up and reach out for professional 
support. It was in this backdrop that an internet-based self-help program for depression was developed 
and pilot tested in India. The present paper is aimed at describing the development of the program, as 
well as the result of the pilot testing of the program. Pilot testing was primarily aimed at documenting 
patterns of use, perceived gains as reported by the users and short-term outcomes on depressive 
symptoms, functioning and wellbeing. 

Program development and salient features:Practice and Use Self-help for Depression (PUSH-D) 
was developed to serve as an internet-based self-care program to help individuals deal with symptoms 
of depression. The name of the program (hereafter referred to as PUSH-D) was decided following 
brainstorming within the research team to serve as an easy-to-remember acronym. 
It aimed at 
conveying its essence: a self-help program to deal with depression with an emphasis on the role 
of practice. 

The development of PUSH-D was based on review of publications on internet-based interventions 
in common mental health conditions, review of depression apps freely available in commercial market 
place as well as multiple rounds of discussions within the research team. The content development 
process was guided by the clinical experience of the ﬁrst two authors who are engaged in providing 
psychological interventions for adults with varying severity of depression in a tertiary care teaching 


hospital as well as in a community based well-being center in a metropolitan city of South India. 
The components were drawn primarily from theoretical frameworks that have been well researched 
and are commonly applied in clinical practice with urban Indian clients. These included ingredients of 
cognitive behavior therapy, supportive therapy, interpersonal therapy as well as positive psychology. 
Thus the coverage attempted to bring the research and practice perspectives together. The other 
authors provided expertise in public health, psychiatry and use of technology as required during 
various phases of the project. The following points were taken into consideration in the development 
of PUSH-D. 
At the outset, it was decided that PUSH-D should comprehensively address a wide range of 
components that are commonly included in face-to-face individual therapies for Indian urban clients 
with depression. Based on clinical experience in the local culture(apart from empirical literature 
review), the researchers identiﬁed the following components in the initial round of discussion: 
psycho-education about depression, behavioral activation, learning to identify and correct cognitive 
errors, worry management, reducing self-criticality and enhancing self-compassion, enhancing 
self-soothing skills and enhancing an overall sense of mastery. A few additional components were also 
decided upon, based on the rationale described below. 
As prior research indicates high dropouts in internet-based interventions, it was planned to 
include a component focused on helping users with strategies to keep up their motivation to 
complete PUSH-D (e.g., scheduling and prioritizing self-care, anticipating gains through practice, 
self-reinforcement for progress etc.). Our clinical experience as well as research suggests that 
individuals in a collectivistic culture like India experience barriers to seek help for distress from 
informal sources due to a wish to avoid placing unnecessary demands on signiﬁcant others/burden 
them and the need to maintain harmony [38]. Hence it was decided to include a component focusing 
on mobilizing support from informal sources for managing distress and generating positive emotions. 
Self-care interventions are low-intensity interventions and their users need to recognize when 
self-help may be insufﬁcient and seeking face-to-face interventions is required. The review of 
depression apps indicated that several of these do not provide sufﬁcient information to the users 
regarding the limitations of self-help approach. This information is important for users of self-help 
apps in a context where stigma and lack of awareness play a major role in non-utilization of services. 
Hence the last section in the essential zone of PUSH-D aimed to help users become aware as to when 
professional help seeking might be an appropriate decision. The section also extensively covered 
various psychological barriers to seeking professional help and ways of overcoming hesitations and 
ambivalences related to seeking face-to-face interventions in times of need. The above-mentioned 
components formed the various sections of PUSH-D (Table 1) and were grouped together under the 
label of Essential Zone. 
PUSH-D also contained additional sections put together under the label of optional zone. 
These sections could be accessed by a user at any point of time depending on need or preference. 
The optional zone was developed to address additional issues that clients with depression may present 
with (viz. maintaining sleep hygiene, dealing with interpersonal relationships issues, dealing with grief, 
and learning relaxation through visualization). A section on dealing with suicidal thoughts was also 
included, though PUSH-D was not targeted at individuals experiencing signiﬁcant suicidality and the 
evaluation process identiﬁed and directed individuals with high suicidal risk to appropriate services. 
This was kept as an optional section thatwas freely accessible to clients at any point. A provision was 
made in the program to deliverautomatic prompts to clients to go to this section, when their current 
mood rating indicated high distress along with death-wishes or suicidal thoughts. These mood ratings 
on a pleasant to unpleasant continuum were captured through the presentation of a single seven-point 
smiley-based item on each log-in. In addition, the optional zone included sections that provided inputs 
on maintenance of wellbeing so as to help clients in not just reduction of depressive symptoms but 
also in enhancing an overall sense of well being over time. The optional zone also contained references 
and links relevant to the content for users interested in further reading.

A few other points were taken into consideration in the process of development of PUSH-D. 
All self-care/help strategies introduced were those thatcould be potentially learned by a user without 
face-to-face interaction with a therapist. These strategies were preceded by a clearly articulated 
rationale for the same. It was considered important to help users understand why and how certain 
strategies might help. This rationale was based on available research as well as clinical experience of 
the authors. 
It was ensured that across sections, exercises for practice/assignments for application in daily life 
were introduced after providing demonstrations/illustrations. Diverse examples from family, social 
relationships, work and academic domains were used across sections, so as to keep the content relevant 
to individuals from different backgrounds. An attempt was also made to incorporate examples based 
on commonly seen themes in clinical practice in the Indian culture (e.g., self-criticality related to one’s 
role as a parent of an adolescent, responsibilities associated with living together with parents/in-laws) 
and to avoid examples or wordings that may have low relevance for many Indians (e.g., dating). 

The salient structural features of PUSH-D as mentioned above included the division of the entire 
content into essential and optional zones. The users were expected to complete the essential zone 
section in a predetermined sequence. The sequencing of sections was designed to include the most 
basic content such as psycho-education and motivation enhancement ﬁrst, followed by behavioral 
activation, and then dealing with depressive thoughts. These were considered the basic components to 
be addressed and hence appeared at the beginning. Subsequent sections were organized so as to build 


links from one section to another, to the extent feasible. Sequential access to the essential zone sections 
was planned with the aim of minimizing random browsing and helping users progress through the 
content in a systematic fashion. Optional zone sections could be accessed by a user at any point of 
time depending on need or preference. 
The program was made available through a webbrowser as well as through a mobile app on 
the Google Play store so as to provide clients with easy access to the application, as well as allow 
access in settings with greater privacy. The browser and mobile version were synchronized so that the 
client could work on a section on one device and seamlessly continue with subsequent activities on a 
different device. 
Since the data recorded by the clients in the app were of a sensitive nature, the communication and 
storage/access of data had to be secure. HTTPS was used for secure communication to the web services. 
Access to the program was through a user-ID/password-based login. The client’s personal identiﬁable 
information (PII) was maintained separate from the clients’ program data, and all access/updates of 
such program data was through anonymized identiﬁers. 







Provision to schedule one’s next session: The users were prompted to plan their next session by 
ﬁlling in the expected date and time while logging out. This resulted in two automatic mobile 
message prompts on the scheduled date. 
Reﬂections: Space was provided to jot down the summary of what was learnt in each section at 
the end of the respective sections. 
Flagging of sections (“likely to be highly personally relevant for you”): Sections were identiﬁed 
as highly personally relevant for a given user based on pattern of responses to a checklist before 
the start of Section 1. The items on this checklist corresponded to various section-themes (e.g., for 
someone endorsing the item on very low level of activity, the behavioral activation section 
was marked as highly relevant). The sections identiﬁed as likely to be very relevant for a user 
appeared at the end of the checklist and these were also labeled as such when the user reached 
the beginning of those sections. 
Facilitating review: Provision to access one’s responses on various items and a brief section 
summary through one’s online workbook pages. 
Guided navigation through the sections in the essential zone, such that sections could be accessed 
only in sequential order as mentioned earlier. However, a user could go back to and review an 
earlier completed section at any time. 

(cid:4) Monitoring by the professional: There was a provision for the professional who carried out 
the initial evaluation to view a given client’s workbook and the session summaries entered by 
the user. 
Facilitating continued application: Provision to create new versions of various templates to 
practice or to manage different exercises (e.g., weekly monitoring of one’s activities) 
Self-monitoring: Provision to examine the time spent per log in and the number of log-ins 
for self-monitoring 
Feedback and reinforcement: Verbal and visual feedback on progress in terms of number of 
sections and number of exercises completed. 




The overall PUSH-D trial was meant to examine the socio-demographic and clinical proﬁle of 
seekers of PUSH-D, pattern of use and short-term outcomes. The present paper is focused on describing 


patterns of use, short-term outcomes and gains as perceived by the participants. Pattern of use herein 
broadly refers to the proportion of participants who logged in to the app once or more after being 
provided access to the app, number of sessions completed, average number of log-ins and duration of 
log-in time. Short-term outcomes primarily refer to changes in depression and level of functioning as 
the participants progressed from ﬁrst log-in to completion of ten sections and two months thereafter. 
A single group pre-, post- and follow-up design was used, keeping in view of a lack of availability 
of empirical data on receptivity of such an internet-based self-help program for depression in urban 
India, as well as the cost and time constraints related to this study. 
This being one of the ﬁrst studies on a mental health app in India, the sample selection criteria 
were kept minimal. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the trial were: age18 years and above; educated 
at least up to high school (ten years of formal education); ability to read and write and understand 
English; familiarity with basic use of computers and internet; depression severity score of 13 or more 
on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI II) [39]. Exclusion criteria were: (a) Those suffering from 
psychotic disorders/mental retardation/dementia or any other major neurological or psychiatric 
condition that interfered with the ability to follow instructions and complete the self-help intervention, 
as determined during the screening; (b) those reporting signiﬁcant suicidal ideations on any of the 
twoindices: frequent suicidal thoughts or low sense of control over suicidal thoughts as assessed 
through items in the basic data sheet and/or moderate to high suicidality score on MINI International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for current suicidality [40]. 
Those who were clinically adjudged to require face-to-face individual or family or marital therapy 
for major ongoing stressors (e.g., family discord/complicated grief etc.) were encouraged to seek 
such interventions at the institute where the study was carried out (or elsewhere as preferred by the 
individual), instead on being enrolled in PUSH-D trial. This was considered an ethical approach to 
adopt in view of the researchers’ awareness of the limitations of PUSH-D content to address major 
life stressors/interpersonal issues in a contextualized fashion. This was decided by the research staff 
in consultation with the investigators after completion of the initial assessment. The corresponding 
numbers are mentioned in Figure 1. 
The pilot trial was conducted after obtaining approval by the ethics committee of the researchers’ 
institute. The details regarding announcement of PUSH-D trial and recruitment process as well as basic 
and clinical proﬁle of those seeking participation in PUSH-D program trial have been described 
elsewhere in detail [41]. Participation in the pilot testing was solicited through various means. 
Poster, ﬂyers and write-ups were developed to make the potential participants in the community 
aware about PUSH-D program and its main features (self-help, internet-based intervention targeting 
depressive symptoms and utilizing techniques used in psychological interventions for depression 
in face-to-face sessions). A few core symptoms of depression were presented in the posters, to help 
people gauge if the distress they were experiencing could indicate possibility of depression. 
In 
addition, all the announcements indicated that participation in PUSH-D research trial involved initial 
screening/evaluation to determine the suitability of PUSH-D program for the given individual and in 
case it was not found suitable, referral-related guidance would be provided. Announcements were 
made on multiple ofﬂine and online platforms that included posters on notice boards of various local 
institutions, emails, an announcement on the institute’s website, as well as another website aimed at 
youth mental health promotion run by the corresponding author, and dissemination of ﬂyers during 
two health-related exhibitions in the metropolitan city where the researchers are located. Individuals 
who came across the announcement on PUSH-D and approached the resource team via phone or email 
were initially provided detailed information about PUSH-D evaluation process, it being a research 
trial as well as the nature of the PUSH-D program itself. 
About two-thirds of the seekers of PUSH-D on whom initial screening and assessments were 
carried out were treatment naïve and had never sought professional consultation. Reasons for not 
seeking professional help ranged from lack of awareness about the nature of the problem as well as 
services, timeconstraints and stigma [32,41]. 


Figure 1. Flow Chart of pilot trial. Note: S1-S10 refer to the 10 sections in the essential zone of PUSH-D 
& the ﬁgures below section numbers refer to number of users who used the respective sections 

The basic data sheet developed for the present study incorporated sociodemographic details as 
well as additional details such as major life events in recent past, ongoing stressors, availability 
of support, self-report of suicidal thoughts if any in the last few weeks, self-perception of the 
capacity to control suicidal thoughts, past consultation with a mental health professional if any, etc. 
MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 6.0 (MINI) was used to establish psychiatric 
diagnoses, if any, during the initial evaluation [40]. A Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 
Personality Disorders (SCID-5 PD) [42], an updated version of the former Structured Clinical Interview 
for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) was used for arriving at personality disorder 
diagnosis, if any. This was also used only during the initial evaluation. 


Primary Outcome measures: (a) Depression: current severity of depressive symptoms was 
assessed using Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [39,43]. 
PHQ-9 is shorter in length and hence it was introduced to quickly capture changes at midpoint 
without increasing respondent burden. (b) Functioning: Self-reported functional impairment was 
assessed using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) [44]. Higher scores indicate poorer 
adjustment. 
In addition a simple clinician-rated simple measure namely, Global Assessment of 
Functioning (GAF) [45] was also used as an index of functioning. The scores range from 0 (inadequate 
information) to 100 (superior functioning). 
Secondary outcome measures: Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [46] and the WHO-FIVE Well-Being 
Index [47] were used as additional outcomes measures. Higher scores on these measures reﬂect higher 
levels of self-esteem and well-being, respectively. 

Those interested in participating in the initial evaluation/screening process were contacted and 
evaluation was carried out either in a face-to-face session, Skype session or over telephone, with the 
consent of the participant. 
Face-to-face and Skype sessions were conducted for 45 and 14 participants respectively, while 
telephonic assessments were carried out for 43 participants. The baseline evaluation was carried out in 
the ﬁrst session after obtaining written informed consent. This consent was obtained in the face-to-face 
sessions, or it was obtained by requesting the participants to send a signed and scanned document 
over email for those who were interviewed over Skype or telephone. 
The baseline evaluation involved listening to the narration of psychological difﬁculties as 
described by the interviewees, ﬁlling of the basic data sheet, and administration of MINI and SCID-PD, 
followed by administration of the self-report questionnaires. A brief feedback was provided to the 
participants regarding the suitability of PUSH-D for their problems or the need for other forms of 
mental health interventions. User names and passwords were issued if PUSH-D was considered a 
suitable mode of intervention, while for others, referral-related guidance was provided. 
The participants who were registered for PUSH-D were recommended to complete the self-help 
intervention program within a period of six to eight weeks. It was estimated that a participant would 
be required to spend on an average of about two hours in a week with the program material (in chunks 
of 20 to 40 min) over six weeks to complete the entire program. In addition, they were prompted to 
carry out simple activities and exercises for mood management on a regular basis as is the case in a 
typical face-to-face intervention for depression. These were built-in exercises across various sections. 
The users were expected to carry them out/apply the learning between log-ins. A few examples include 
weekly monitoring of engagement in pleasurable and meaningful activities, monitoring self-critical 
thoughts and substituting them with self-compassionate thoughts, applying and recording the use of 
self-soothing techniques when in distress. 
Literature suggests that compliance and motivation management are difﬁcult issues in stand-alone 
self-help programs. The content of the internet-based program was supplemented with periodic 
telephone assistance, once every 8–12 days as the available research suggests that human contact in 
some form or the other helps improve adherence and outcomes—these calls were made by research 
staff members who were trained clinical psychologists. The telephonic assistance was meant to serve 
as minimal contact/basic assistance, clarify doubts if any, resolve technical issues in navigating, and 
motivate users to work on the content. The calls were typically brief (lasting for about 15 min) and 
the timings were ﬁxed as per users’ convenience. These also helped in monitoring severity of distress 
and addressing any need for referrals to appropriate, face-to-face professional services, if and when 
needed. Such a provision for referral was made in the research protocol as per the ethical practice. 
The plan was to exclude data of such participants who might be referred for face-to-face intervention 
at any point during the trial. However, no participant required such a referral after registration into 
the PUSH-D program. Periodic mobile prompts with suggestions to maintain efforts at self-care, and 

short quotes relevant to managing negative emotions and cultivating positive emotions were sent at a 
frequency of about once in 10–15 days. 



Assessments were carried out at four time-points (Table 2). Baseline assessment was carried out 
at the point of recruitment and soon after screening (T1); midpoint assessment was carried out after 
completion of 5 out of 10 sections (T2). Post-assessment was carried out after completion of all 10 
essential zone sections (T3). Follow-up assessment was carried out twomonths after completion of 
post-assessment (T4). While the baseline session was conducted face-to-face or via Skype/telephone, 
the remaining assessments entailed a combination of email and telephone, as per the convenience of 
the participants.

SPSS Version 16.0 was utilized for data analyses. The data entry was checked for errors. Paired 
sample t-tests were used for comparison between two points of time. Repeated measures ANOVA 
was used for within group comparisons involving more than twomeans. Mauchly’s test was used to 
examine any signiﬁcant violation of sphericity assumption. In any instance of violation, degrees of 
freedom were corrected using the Greenhouse and Geisser estimate [48] to examine signiﬁcance of 
Fratio. In cases of a signiﬁcant F ratio, signiﬁcant results on post hoc comparisons were made and 
signiﬁcant differences between any two timepoints are reported after a Sidak adjustment for multiple 
comparisons. Changes in proportions were examined using the McNemar test. Effect sizes were 
calculated in various analyses terms of correlation coefﬁcients as recommended by Field, 2005 [49].

Following baseline evaluation, 78 participants were registered for PUSH-D while 24 were not 
registered. Nine out of these 24 participants were not registered due to moderate to high levels of current 
suicidality. One or more of the following other reasons resulted in exclusion 5 participants each from 
registration to PUSH-D: lack of comfort with English language, lack of regular access to internet, absence 
of depressive symptoms and presence of other psychiatric disorders or major family or interpersonal 
concerns that were adjudged to require face-to-face individual or family therapy (Figure 1). 
The basic sociodemographic details of the participants are described in Table 3. An average 
participant was about 32 years old and both the genders were fairly represented in the sample. 
Majority of them had a bachelor’s degree and were employed. While about one-third (34.65%) were

Major life events in the preceding sixmonths were reported in 46.2% of cases. About 65% reported 
having never sought mental health consultation any time. On the other hand, 28 (35.9%) reported 
having consulted a mental health professional for current issues and it was a consultation with a 
psychiatrist for a majority of them. Out of these 28, 18 were receiving some form of intervention 
(15 being on stable dose of an antidepressant, one was undergoing counseling and 2 were receiving 
counseling and antidepressant). 



Out of 78 participants who were registered and given PUSH–D log in details, 14 participants (18%) 
did not use the program or did not complete the ﬁrst section and were termed nonusers. Thirty out 
of 64 users (47%) were categorized as partial completers as they completed 5/10 essential sections 
and provided Time-2 (T-2) repeat assessment data. Twenty out of 64 (31%) participants completed 
all the ten essential zone sections and provided Time-2 and Time-3 data (T-2 & T-3). Sixteen out of 
20 completers additionally provided follow-up assessment data (T1 to T4). Owing to different number 
of participants available at various points of time, analyses have been carried out separately for partial 
as well as full completers. These details have been depicted in Figure 1. 
The midpoint assessment (T-2) coincided typically with the end of ﬁrst month after baseline 
assessment. While, the time interval between post-assessment (T-3) and follow-up assessment (T-4) 
was ﬁxed for all the participants (2 months), post-assessment was carried out after completion of ten 
sessions. Except in case of 3 participants, post-assessment was carried out between 6th and 8th weekfor 
all the others. Three participants needed 12 weeks’ time for completion of ten sessions and providing 
on post-assessment data. The average interindividual variability in capture of post=assessment data in 
a majority of instances was of 10 days and was attributable to logistic constraints that came in way 
for some users to complete ten sections and provide post-assessment data. An average completer 
logged in 17 times and spent about 30 min on an average per log-in (standard deviation: 14 min). 
The remaining participants spent about 24 min per log-in on an average (standard deviation: 16 min). 

Mean changes on outcomes at post-assessments: Twenty registered participants completed all 
the ten essential zone sections and post-assessments. Depression scores decreased signiﬁcantly from 
baseline to post-assessment on BDI-II, and also from baseline to midpoint on PHQ-9; while the 
well-being scores increased in this period. On the other hand there was no signiﬁcant change evident 
in self-esteem from baseline to post-assessment. There was a consistent decline on impairment and 
improvement in global functioning seen from baseline to post-assessment in this subsample (Table 4).

Percentage changes on depression and impairment and shifts in severity in individual participants 
at post-assessment: Change scores from baseline to post-assessments were also calculated and these 
were and transformed into change percentages relative to the respective baseline scores. Large mean 
percentage changes in Beck Depression Inventory scores were noted (Mean: 61.79) followed by those 
on PHQ-9 (46.25) and impairment (30.98), although variability in individual level gains was evident 
from large standard deviations. 


Using the standard cut offs used for BDI-II, an attempt was made to explore the pattern of 
shifts in severity of depression in those who completed post-assessment. There was a marked shift 
in terms of drop in proportion of the sample that was in moderate and severe depression category 
(from 35% and 40% to 10% each respectively). While 75% of the participants showed a shift to a lower 
severity category, none showed worsening/shift-to-higher category. The overall shift in severity across 
categories on BDI-II was signiﬁcant (McnemarBowker test, p < 0.01). 
As far as changes in severity of impairment from baseline to post-assessment are concerned, 
a majority of participants moved from moderately severe impairment to higher levels of functioning. 
While sixty percent had moderately severe impairment at baseline, twenty percent could be so classiﬁed 
at post-assessment. The overall pattern of shift was signiﬁcant (McNemar–Bowker test, p < 0.05), with 
73% of the participants showing a shift to lower impairment category and none showing a worsening. 
Thirty participants who completed 5 out of ten essential zone sections were categorized as 
partial completers. Comparison of scores of the partial completers subsample revealed signiﬁcant 
improvements from baseline to T-2 on depression (PHQ-9). Signiﬁcant decline on impairment was 
also seen from baseline to T-2 in partial completers (Table 5).

Assessments at midpoint also provided an opportunity to track shift in severity of depression and 
impairment. There was a drop in the proportion of individuals falling in moderately severe category 
(PHQ-9) at T2 as compared to baseline (40% at baseline vs. 13.3% at post-assessment). There was a 
corresponding increase in the number of participants in mild category from 20% to 50%. 
Similarly, gains in functioning were seen in partial completers in terms of drop in proportion of 
participants who were classified as having moderately severe impairment at T2 on WSAS (46.7% vs. 26.7%). 
Stability of gains over a period of 2 months following completion of the program could be 
ascertained in 16 out of 20 completers who could be contacted for the same. Signiﬁcant gains were 
made and maintained on depression as measured by BDI-II and PHQ-9, Work and social functioning 
(decline in impairment) as well as ratings on global assessment of functioning. On BDI-II as well as 
PHQ-9 measures, depression scores declined signiﬁcantly from baseline to post-assessment and then 
further decline was evident at follow-up. PHQ-9 was also assessed at midpoint providing a picture of 
changes during the program. It was observed that depression scores tended to decline from baseline 
through midpoint to post- and follow-up assessment resulting in post and follow-up assessment scores 
being signiﬁcantly lower than the baseline. Scores on self-esteem and well-being measures improved 
from baseline to post-assessment. Further, there was a signiﬁcant improvement in self-esteem and 
well-being seen at follow-up (Table 6). 
Subjective reports of impairment decreased signiﬁcantly from baseline to post-assessment and 
this gain was stable at follow-up; the follow-up scores being signiﬁcantly improved compared to 
baseline as well as midpoint. As far as clinician ratings of functioning is concerned, there was a similar 
upward trend seen in functioning, with signiﬁcant improvement from baseline to post and midpoint 
to post-assessment, with gains being maintained at follow-up (Table 6).

Participants who completed 5 sections (i.e., 50% of the program content) and provided repeat 
assessment data (partial completers, n = 30) were compared to those who did not use or discontinued 
use before completing 5 sections and providing repeat assessment data (n = 48, 61.5%). These 2 
groups were not signiﬁcantly different from each other on gender (p = 0.48), marital status (p = 0.41), 
educational level (p = 0.46), work status (p = 0.66) presence of major depression (p = 0.32) or dysthymia 
(p = 0.27). Similarly these two groups did not signiﬁcantly differ from each other on baseline scores 
on self-esteem, well-being, work and social adjustment, PHQ-9 or BDI –II depression and global 
assessment of functioning ratings (with all p-values being > 0.05). Durations of dysthymia and major 
depression were not signiﬁcantly different (p = 0.11 p = 0.10). On the whole, no baseline variables 
assessed in the study differentiated between users who completed 5 sessions vs. those who did 
not. Further supplementary analyses with the subgroup of those who never initiated PUSH-D (after 
having been provided log in credentials) also revealed similar patterns; with no difference on baseline 
variables seen, between these participants and the partial completers. 
The PUSH-D pilot trial was meant to understand the proﬁle of seekers of such a program in urban 
India apart from assessing short-term outcomes of its usage. Also, internet-based self-help programs 
have the potential to be used as supplement to treatment as usual. Hence, no exclusion criteria were 
used regarding ongoing mental health interventions. As mentioned earlier, 18 of the 78 registered 
participants reported receiving some form of intervention at the time of baseline assessment. In the 
sample of completers and partial completers on whom main analyses have been carried out, only 
8 participants were undergoing intervention (on stable dosage of antidepressants). Re-running the 
analysis after exclusion of these 8 participants returned similar results as mentioned above. Signiﬁcant 
improvements from baseline to post-assessments were noted on both the measures of depression (BDI: 
p < 0.01, r = 0.82; PHQ-9: p < 0.05; r = 0.68) and on functioning (WSAS: p < 0.05; r = 0.79; GAF: p < 0.05, 
r = 0.93) with large effect sizes. 

There was a provision at the end of each section for a user to write down a summary of what 
was learnt in that particular section. This could be revisited/viewed by the user in his/her workbook 
section. Although all users did not have entries for all the sections; 285 entries were available for content 
analysis. Most of the content across sections could be classiﬁed into four broad categories, namely 
information, self-awareness, self-motivation, picking a strategy for use/application. Mere repetition of 
some of the factual content of a section was coded as information gained. Self-awareness was coded for 


summaries thatexpressed the participants became aware about certain aspects of themselves (e.g., “I 
realized that I often tend to engage in all-or-none thinking”/“I think that I have been too critical of 
myself”). Self-motivation was coded wherever the summary content indicated a motivating message 
that the user wrote for themselves (e.g., “I must keep going, come on, let me just do this”). Picking a 
strategy was used for putting together those summarieswhich indicated an intention/plan that the 
user wanted to apply a speciﬁc strategy learnt in the section (e.g., “I will make a list of things that are 
under my control and focus on that ﬁrst”). It was noted that the largest number of summaries reﬂected 
the user picking a speciﬁc strategy/plan and reﬂecting on the same for their use. The second largest 
category was self-motivating statements/inspirational statements for self, followed by others (Table 7).

At the beginning of each section, the user was provided with a prompt item to reﬂect on what 
they had applied/tried to apply based on learning of the previous section. This was a multiple-choice 
item. Analysis of 279 responses across users and sections on this item revealed that about 50% of 
responses reﬂected an intention to use what was learnt; while about 43% of responses indicated that 
before moving on to the next section, the participants had already used something or the other learnt 
in the previous section and had found that to be beneﬁcial to varying extent (Table 8).

Availability of PUSH-D itself made me feel that there is something to help me. This thought was 
itself motivating. 
The use of activities/exercises and other contents from PUSH-D were very interesting and it has made a 
huge impact on me. 
PUSH-D is very helpful for working people like me who can’t take out time to go to a mental 
health professional. 
The module was very engaging and insightful. 
It was very convenient to use. It will be useful to people who are not able to share their problems 
with others. 
The division of the material into knowledge point, toolbox, practice point, commitment etc. aids in 
clarity and the concepts just seep in. 
It helped me to understand that I have ways to ﬁght my depression without medications. 
It is very diverse and dynamic. It has colorful charts, posters, videos, diagrams and scales. That breaks 
the monotony and encourages engagement. 
It gives a record of how ‘I am doing’. How much time I have spent on the website, how many exercises I 
have completed, how far I have to go. 






























To the best of our knowledge, PUSH-D is one of the ﬁrst indigenous internet-based self-care 
intervention programs in the ﬁeld of mental health developed by mental health professionals in an 
academic setting with assistance from a technology partner. 















The strengths of the PUSH-D program include a comprehensive coverage of content targeting 
depressive symptoms and providing opportunities to clients to empower themselves with self-care 
strategies to deal with depression through use of informative text, videos, exercises, posters and 
monitoring tools. The content development took into account an exhaustive review of free apps on 
depression available to Indian users in addition to the existing scientiﬁc literature. It was ensured that 
the scope and limitation of self-care were emphasized adequately and a section to educate users about 
when to seek professional help and how to break mental barriers to seeking such help was included

as part of the essential zone. Mobile prompts and basic telephonic assistance were added to enhance 
chances of completion of PUSH-D, in view of available literature indicating poor rates of completion 
of unassisted internet-based mental health programs. 
A typical PUSH-D trial participant was a working young adult of either gender, with at least 
three years of college education. Most participants were suffering from major depression or dysthymia 
and only a small proportion had comorbid psychiatric condition (mostly anxiety disorder or cluster C 
personality disorder). Most participants had moderate to severe depression and signiﬁcant impairment 
in functioning at baseline. Almost two-thirds of the participants had never sought mental health 
consultation at any point in the past. 
Slightly less than one-ﬁfth of the registered participants were nonusers. A somewhat larger 
proportion of registered participants (50%) completed 40% of the sections though they did not 
complete 50% of the essential zone or provide repeat assessment (Time-2) data. No baseline variables 
differentiated between those who did not complete ﬁve sections vs. partial completers. The former 
group was also difﬁcult to connect to and engage with through weekly telephonic calls. This pattern 
somewhat mirrors observations in other studies, indicating that a signiﬁcant proportion of individuals 
do not complete internet-based mental health self-help programs. The proportion of nonusers in the 
present study was lower (17.9%) than that reported earlier. Out of the 420 participants in a study 
involving two active app based interventions, 58% did not download the apps, despite having gone 
through eligibility screens, giving consent and completing baseline evaluation. Moreover, adherences 
to both the apps declined over time [26]. Decrease in user engagement over time has been reported in 
several studies [16]. 
The available literature reviewed earlier indicates that user-uptake and retention are major 
challenges related to self-care programs. There is a need for further studies to enhance understanding 
of modiﬁable factors related to non-use of self-help intervention like PUSH-D, despite initial inclination, 
expressed interest and investment of time to undergo the evaluation process. Provision of feedback 
on progress/summary of progress built into depression apps may have some utility [16] and this 
feature was incorporated in PUSH-D. It has been observed that engagement with the app may 
be a very important variable, but it is often likely to be less than optimum due to a variety of 
reasons such as life-roles and responsibilities in addition to technical issues such as wi-ﬁ access 
etc. [13]. Clients with low treatment motivation may beneﬁt from approaches aimed at motivational 
enhancement [23]. An initial section of PUSH-D incorporated inputs to sustain motivation to complete 
PUSH-D program. In previous studies, adherence to internet-based interventions is reported in terms 
of indicators such as number of log-ins, duration of exposure to intervention, number of modules or 
exercises completed, and number of postings etc. [50]. A review indicated that about 50–70% of the 
internet-based intervention modules for depression are completed by participants of research trials [51]. 
Reviews also indicate that studies need to report as to how much of the internet-basedself-care tool 
is completed by participants who do not complete the entire tool that is offered [52]. In the present 
study, 47% of the users completed 50% of the sections (partial completers) and showed signiﬁcant 
improvements on primary outcome measures. About 39% of the users completed 90% of the sections 
(Figure 1). These data suggest adherence rates to be somewhat similar to other studies in about 
half of the users. Most completers showed sustained engagement in the program as evinced by 
consistent progress from one section to another, amount of time invested per log-in, number of log-ins 
and ease of connecting through the weekly telephonic calls. Based on average number of log-ins 
and average duration per log in, as mentioned earlier, it is estimated that an average completer 
spent 8.5 h going over the entire program content. Qualitative data presented earlier also suggested 
fair engagement with the strategies suggested in various sessions. It was difﬁcult to reach out to 
participants who did not complete 10 sections after Time-2, though attempts were made to connect 
over phone/mail. Information available from some of these participants suggested the role of factors 
such as major life event, work demands, vacation, and physical ill health or lowered felt need resulting 
in dis-continuation/non-completion. 


The examination of outcomes highlights the potential utility of PUSH-D in individuals with 
depression. The completers’ data suggests signiﬁcant and consistent decline in depressive symptoms 
during the PUSH-D program and maintenance of gains at 2-month follow-up. Mean percentage 
changes at post-assessment as compared to baseline severity were calculated. This analysis indicated 
large average gains on BDI-II (62%). In a previous study, a reduction of 17.5% on BDI-II, was reported 
to be minimal clinically important difference (MCID) while the corresponding estimate for individuals 
with longer duration depression (who were non-responders to antidepressants) was noted to be 
higher at 32% [53]. The shifts in severity of depression were examined as another approach to 
establish the clinical meaningfulness of statistically signiﬁcant changes in the present study. Majority 
of the participants with baseline levels of moderate to severe depression moved up to minimal/mild 
depression by post-assessment. Similarly, functional impairment reduced signiﬁcantly in completers 
as per self-report as well as clinical ratings. Moreover a majority of the participants moved from 
moderately severe impairment to higher levels of functioning at post-assessment. 
The partial completers’ sample provided another opportunity to examine changes in depression 
and impairment in functioning after completion of 50% of PUSH-D program. This analysis too 
showed a signiﬁcant decline in depression, improvement in functioning as well as a drop in proportion 
of partial completers falling in severe/moderately severe categories (depression and impairment) 
at Time-2 as compared to baseline. The analysis with this sample suggests that completion of all 
the essential zone sections are perhaps not required for signiﬁcant positive changes in depressive 
symptoms and improvements in functioning to manifest. This seems understandable as the ﬁrst 
ﬁve sections of PUSH-D contained a few major ingredients of the self-care intervention program 
namely, psycho-education, improving self-care motivation, behavioral activation and dealing with 
depressive cognitions apart from managing worries. Along somewhat similar lines, results of a clinical 
trial mentioned earlier [26] showed that 45–46% of the users manifested at least 50% reduction in 
depression severity by 4 weeks. This trial also highlighted that most did not use the apps as instructed 
and this was the case despite differences between apps in terms of content and user experience. 
This ﬁnding is similar to the present study observations on user engagement. 
Secondary outcomes were assessed in terms of self-esteem and well-being. On both these 
measures, there was steady improvement in scores with the overall difference between time-points 
being signiﬁcant at post-assessment on well-being. Signiﬁcant changes in these two variables were 
evident from post-assessment to follow-up period. The overall pattern suggests that changes on 
well-being and self-esteem are likely to manifest after signiﬁcant decrease in depressive symptoms and 
improvement in functioning. This ﬁnding raises the hypothesis that apps for depression may impact 
on indices of well-being, beyond reduction of depressed mood and improvement in functioning. 
Examination of effect sizes provided an estimate of magnitude of effects. Moderate effect sizes in 
terms of reductions in depressive symptoms have been noted in CBT based online interventions, but a 
meta-analysis indicated low impact on functioning [10,54]. In the present study sample, large effect 
sizes were noted in all analyses involving changes in BDI-II scores at various time points and medium 
to large effect sizes were noted on PHQ-9. Similarly moderate to large effect sizes were noted on most 
analyses of changes in level of impairment in functioning as well as on secondary outcomes. 
Summaries entered by the users at the end of various sections and user feedback at post/follow-up 
assessments provided crude pointers to factors that might have contributed to gains observed. 
These include ﬁnding and picking up a useful strategy, enhanced self-awareness and improved 
motivation to engage in self-care. The analysis of brief responses to an item at the start of various 
sections indicated that about 50% of responses reﬂected an intention to use what was learnt; while 
about 43% indicated that, the participants had already used something or the other learnt in the 
previous section and had found that to be beneﬁcial to varying extents. The feedback received at 
follow-up revealed that enhanced emotion regulation efﬁcacy and enhanced overall sense of mastery 
emerged as most frequently experienced gains, in addition to better self-awareness and a sense of 
acceptance, improved social connectedness and goal striving. These are likely to have played a role 


in enhanced self-esteem and wellbeing as documented at follow-up. Moderate to high effect sizes 
observed for almost all the outcome variables in the present sample may have been contributed by 
several factors such as (a) a large proportion having signiﬁcant distress to begin with; (b) having 
had no prior exposure to counseling/therapy; (c) comprehensiveness of content-coverage and (d) 
availability of basic telephonic support. 

The study has several limitations such as small sample sizes at various time-points, lack of 
a control group to tease out the effects of passage of time and a short follow-up. Variability in 
post-assessment time-points (between 6–8 weeks for most users) is another limitation of the study. 
Replication of ﬁndings in randomized controlled trials and longer term follow-up can help in more 
ﬁrmly establishing the efﬁcacy of the PUSH-D program Comparison with a control group (e.g., a group 
undergoing pharmacotherapy for depression) may be helpful in assessing the robustness of the 
ﬁndings. Low rates of program completion raise concerns that need to be addressed. Simpliﬁcation in 
the design of one or two initial sections of the app that involve multiple exercises as well as allowing 
users to self-select and access sections that are most personally relevant are some of the modiﬁcations 
that are being currently considered. The utility of such design changes for user-retention would require 
further study. In view of other studies that describe similar challenges in user-retention, it may be 
helpful to examine the role of self-regulation deﬁcits in non-completion of internet-based self-help 
programs [55]. 
In a country like India with multiple languages as well as the likely confound between knowledge 
of English and educational levels, PUSH-D‘s utility is most likely limited to individuals in the middle 
and upper socioeconomic strata, with some years of college education, internet access and comfort 
with English. 
Relatively higher levels of anonymity and privacy, ﬂexibility of usage, ease of access, low delivery 
costs and standardized content have been cited as some of the advantages of internet-based mental 
health interventions [1]. PUSH-D was indigenously designed to address issues such as (a) lack of 
freely available internet-based interactive self-care tool for urban Indians dealing with depression; 
(b) inadequate coverage of therapeutic components in existing apps to suit a variety of client needs; 
and (c) lack of emphasis on enhancing self-care motivation, managing suicidal thoughts, maintaining 
well-being and educating about when to step-up. Research from the Indian subcontinent indicates 
a very high treatment gap for depression with a very small proportion of individuals needing 
professional intervention receiving the same [33]. Notwithstanding the limitations of the present 
study, programs such as PUSH-D can improve self-awareness and empower users with self-care 
skills and bypass time and cost constraints related to seeking face-to-face psychological interventions 
for depression. Most of the PUSH-D participants had never availed professional services in the 
past and several had moderate-to-severe levels of depressive symptoms. Completion of PUSH-D, 
including partial completion (50% of PUSH-D sections) was associated with statistically and clinically 
signiﬁcant gains of moderate to large effect size on depression and functioning. These gains were 
stable over a two-month follow-up. Additional data from the participants in terms of intention 
as well as application of what was learned to varying extent, average time spent on the program 
and self-reported gains are encouraging. Even when applicable or utilized by only a segment of 
the population, it still has a potential to reducing overall treatment gap for depression in acountry 
with a scarcity of trained professionals, as well as low rates of people seeking professional help 
due to factors such as stigma [32,41,56]. The PUSH-D trial examined its potential use as a ﬁrst line 
of management for depression and dysthymia in line with a stepped-care approach. Its utility for 
individuals with signiﬁcant co-morbid psychiatric disorders (e.g., cluster B personality disorders, 
substance use disorders and OCD etc.) can be examined. Its additive value as a supplementary 
program in routine psychiatric outpatient settings as well as for bolstering and maintaining gains in 


those undergoing face-to-face psychological interventions individual therapy are also useful issues for 
exploration in further studies. 

The limitations notwithstanding, the overall ﬁndings suggest that internet-based self-help 
program PUSH-D has potential appeal and utility for urban Indians, especially those suffering from 
mild-to-moderate severity of depression, who have not sought professional consultation for their 
mental health concerns. Further research on PUSH-D, the use of multipronged strategies to ensure 
uptake (e.g., simpliﬁcation of design to reduce attrition, availability in the national language, i.e., Hindi, 
and enhanced public awareness) along with large-scale dissemination can provide an important avenue 
to reduce the treatment gap for depression in India.
