Smartphone app for depressive symptoms
Abstract
Depressive symptoms are common, yet only a subset of individuals receives adequate
treatment. To reduce the treatment gap, several online self-help programs have been
developed, yielding small to moderate effects. We developed a smartphone self-help
application addressing depressive symptoms. We sought to evaluate its feasibility and
efficacy in participants reporting a subjective need for help (a diagnosis of depression was not
T
mandatory). We conducted a randomized controlled trial (N = 90). The primary outcome was
P
a reduction of depressive symptoms measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-
I
9). Secondary outcomes included improved self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) and
R
quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). The intervention group obtained access to the application
C
for four weeks, the wait-list group received access after the post assessment. No group
S
differences emerged in either outcome in intention-to-treat analyses. Per protocol analyses
with frequent users (i.e., several times a week or more) yieldU ed a small effect size (η2 =
p
0.049) at trend level on the reduction of depressive symNptoms in favor of the treatment group.
However, 39% of the participants did not use the application frequently. Mobile self-help
A
applications represent a promising addition to existing treatments, but it is important to
M
increase patients’ motivation to use them.

1. Introduction
Depressive symptoms are common in the general population, with a life-time prevalence of
54.4% for any depressive disorder (Vandeleur et al., 2017), but many individuals remain
untreated (Kazdin, 2017). To illustrate, only 56% of the individuals with major depression
worldwide receive treatment (Kohn et al., 2004). Possible reasons for this treatment gap are
limited capacity of therapists and clinics, geographical restrictions and factors related to the
individuals in need of help (e.g., fear of stigmatization, restricted mobility because ofT physical
conditions or apathy; Kohn et al., 2004; Mohr et al., 2010). P
I
The treatment gap exists despite several effective treatments for depressive symptoms.
R
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is currently the most evidence-based psychotherapy for
C
depression (e.g., Driessen et al., 2016). More recently, methods of the third wave of CBT, for
S
example mindfulness-based therapy (Khoury et al., 2013), and metacognitive therapy (Wells
U
and Papageorgiou, 2004), have proven to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression
N
(Churchill et al., 2013; Normann et al., 2014; Strauss et al., 2014); and also for metacognitive
training for depression there are promising initial fAindings regarding its efficacy (Jelinek et al.,
2015; Jelinek et al., 2016). Traditional psychotherapy, however, may not be capable of
M
handling the anticipated demand for psychosocial interventions in the future (Kazdin and
Blase, 2011).
D
Technology-based interventions, both guided (requiring contact with a therapist) and non-
E
guided (used by patients on their own), are possible complementary or subsidiary approaches
T
to traditional face-to-face interventions. Technology-based interventions could be particularly
P
useful to bridge the gap when patients are untreated since patients must often wait several
E
months for their treatment to start, if treatment is sought or initiated at all. Technology-based
C
interventions are independent of geographic constraints and time (Twomey et al., 2017), they
C
offer anonymity (Young, 2005) and low delivery costs (Warmerdam et al., 2010). Also, the
A
attitude of the general population towards such interventions is positive: According to a
national survey (N = 2411), more than one-fourth (26.3%) of Germans could imagine seeking
information and help online in case of a mental disorder or emotional distress. Interestingly,
willingness to use therapeutic online counselling is higher in individuals who frequently use
the internet and related devices (Eichenberg et al., 2013). The demand for online counselling
will likely increase with growing digitalization in the future. Therefore, technology-based
treatments of psychological disorders, also known as e-mental health, have the potential to
decrease the treatment gap in the mental health system.

Several psychological online interventions (POIs) for the treatment of depressive symptoms
have been developed and evaluated in the last decade, yielding small to medium effects
(Cuijpers et al., 2011; Griffiths et al., 2010; Johansson and Andersson, 2012; Karyotaki et al.,
2017; Richards and Richardson, 2012). According to a meta-analysis by Karyotaki et al.
(2017), unguided POIs show small effects (Hedges g = 0.27) on depressive symptoms
compared to control groups.
T
While the efficacy of POIs that are accessed through one’s private computer is well
P
established, there is a dearth of research on smartphone-based interventions addressing
I
depressive symptoms. So far, however, the evidence is very promising, with an effect size of
R
Hedges’ g = 0.38 in favor of smartphone-based interventions over control conditions (Firth et
C
al., 2017). There are disadvantages associated with smartphone-based interventions, such as
S
the so-called “digital divide”, meaning that people without access to the internet cannot
U
benefit from such interventions (Bert et al., 2014), or the limited amount of words that can be
displayed on smartphones’ relatively small screens. HowNever, these types of interventions
also offer manifold advantages. Because smartphones are widely used, one advantage of
A
smartphone-based interventions is that they can reach many people. Studies find that 68% of
M
the population owns a smartphone in developed countries and 37% in developing countries
(Poushter, 2016). Furthermore, prelimin ary evidence indicates that smartphone-based
D
interventions could complement face-to-face therapies (Ly et al., 2015). The combination of
E
face-to-face and technology-based interventions is called “blended therapy”. One of the
T
challenges in technology-based interventions is to sustain treatment effects after treatment has
ended, and preliminary Pevidence from obsessive-compulsive disorder research suggests that
“booster programs”E (i.e., additional therapy sessions after treatment completion) could help to
preserve treatmCent effects (Andersson et al., 2014). Smartphone applications could help to
sustain treaCtment effects by sending frequent reminders via push notifications.
The pAresent study revolves around the efficacy of unguided smartphone self-help applications,
as these are widely available and may partially compensate for the dearth of therapists and
mental institutions (Eichenberg et al., 2013). Additionally, some researchers recommend that
studies are needed to identify moderators of positive and negative treatment outcomes in e-
mental health (Ebert et al., 2016; Schröder et al., 2016), and this applies to smartphone-based
interventions as well. One factor that might influence the efficacy of smartphone-based
interventions is willingness to change. According to the transtheoretical model by Prochaska
and DiClemente (1982), one goes through different stages of change in psychotherapy.

Willingness to change problematic behaviour was found to be a moderator in a study of
transdiagnostic face-to-face treatment (Boswell et al., 2012) as well as in an uncontrolled
study of face-to-face treatment for participants with somatoform disorders (Heider et al.,
2017). Additionally, the “action”-subscale of willingness to change was found to moderate the
effect of an online intervention addressing marijuana use among students (Palfai et al., 2016).
Therefore, willingness to change might function as a moderator in smartphone-based
treatment as well. T
P
Considering the inconclusive results to date regarding the efficacy of unguided mobile
I
interventions, the present study aims at expanding the body of research on this form of
R
intervention for depressive symptoms. We developed a CBT-based self-help smartphone
C
application called Be Good to Yourself (German: Tu Dir Gut). We hypothesized that using
S
the smartphone application would result in decreased depressive symptoms, increased self-
U
esteem, and a higher quality of life compared to a wait-list control condition. The effects were
expected to be moderated by the participants’ willingneNss to change.
A
2. Methods
The study was approved by the local ethics coMmmittee of the University of Hamburg
(Germany) and was set up as an online study with random allocation of participants to either
the intervention group (smartphone seDlf-help application) or the wait-list control group.
E
2.1 Participants
T
Recruitment was carried out via online forums and an outpatient clinic. An invitation to the
study was posted in socPial media groups and internet support networks devoted to depression.
These websites andE social media groups disseminate information about the disorder and offer
a place for peopCle with depression to exchange opinions and advice. The study invitation
summarizeCd the basic design as well as the terms and the procedure. It stressed that all
participants would receive free access to the self-help application either immediately or after a
A
four-week delay (after the post assessment).
Inclusion criteria were the subjective need for an intervention to reduce depressive symptoms,
age 18 to 65 years, and the possession of an iPhone (the application was available for the
iPhone operating system only). When participants reported high suicidal tendencies
(measured by the suicide-item on the PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2001), they were automatically
excluded from the online survey. We informed participants of the reason for their exclusion
and provided information on sources of help (e.g., telephone numbers and contact addresses
6
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Smartphone app for depressive symptoms
for specialized institutions). Only two participants were excluded for this reason. Recruitment
was stopped after 90 participants with valid responses had completed the baseline survey. One
participant was excluded afterwards because of age. As for suicidal tendencies, we
implemented a “filter” function in the online survey which was meant to exclude participants
automatically when they reported to be older than 65. Unfortunately, this automated exclusion
did not operate properly so we had to exclude one participant (aged 67) manually afterwards.
Another person withdrew informed consent when asked to take part in the post surveTy. This
resulted in a final sample size of N = 88 (see Figure 1 for a flow chart). P
I
2.2 Procedure
R
A web link in the study invitation directed potential participants to the baseline survey, which
C
was implemented using EFS Survey (www.unipark.info). The program prevented multiple
S
logins from the same computer by means of “cookies”. On the first page of the baseline
U
survey, the rationale of the study was explained. In the next step, we obtained electronic
N
informed consent from each participant.
A
At the end of the survey, participants were required to enter their email address to allow the
sending of the access codes to those in the treMatment group. Those in the wait-list group were
notified that they had been allocated to the control group and would receive their access code
upon completion of the post survey foDur weeks later.
E
Participants were randomly allocated to the treatment or the wait-list group in consecutive
order. Allocation was conceTaled, and no stratification was applied. Within 24 hours,
participants in the treatmPent group received an email with instructions on how to download
the self-help applicaEtion Be Good to Yourself. The participants in the wait-list group were
informed that thCey would receive access to the application after completion of the post survey
four weeks later. The rationale for having wait-list control groups in randomized trials was
C
briefly explained.
A
Four weeks after baseline assessment, we invited all participants via email to take part in the
post survey. If necessary, participants were reminded up to three times to participate in the
post assessment. Upon entry to the post survey, we requested participants to enter the same
email address as for the baseline survey to allow the matching of baseline and post
questionnaires. As an incentive for completing the post assessment, a PDF file with additional
mindfulness-based tasks was available for downloading at the end of the survey.
2.3 Intervention
7
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Smartphone app for depressive symptoms
The intervention Be Good to Yourself is a newly developed self-help application for the
iPhone’s operating system iOS (as this was a proof-of-concept study with limited resources,
we developed the application for one operating system only) that consists of 40 self-help
strategies and exercises. These exercises are based on CBT and its third wave. Exercises are
assigned to four categories: cognitive strategies (see Figure 2), mindfulness-based exercises
(see Figure 3), social-competence skills (see Figure 4), and activating exercises (see Figure 5).
Be Good to Yourself is intended to serve as a “companion” to the user’s daily routineT, and it
helps users take time for their own psychological well-being. Therefore, each exPercise is
described in less than 150 words and is easily read and performed in a coupleI of minutes.
R
Each exercise includes a short psychoeducational section as well as instructions for an
C
exercise.
S
The exercises appear in fixed order, meaning that all participants who use the intervention
U
receive the same sequence of exercises. However, exercises alternate among the four different
categories. Upon opening the application, the title of theN exercise is presented. The user can
either select it and read the detailed description or skip to the next exercise. A small icon
A
indicates the category of the exercise. On the title screen, the exercise can either be selected or
M
skipped up to three times. When selecting the exercise, a description appears with a
countdown that prevents premature clo sing. This way, the user needs to take at least a couple
D
of minutes to go through the exercise. Following each exercise, a motivational screen appears
E
to reinforce the user’s taking time for his or her own psychological well-being (see Figure 6).
T
The application sends daily reminders to encourage the user to take time for him- or herself.
The number of remindePrs and the times they are sent can be adjusted individually in the
settings. E

2.4 Assessments
The baseline survey included the following sections: demographic questions (e.g., age,
gender, education), medical history (e.g., previous and current treatments, medication,
diagnoses, profession of person who diagnosed depression), and a psychological section to
assess depressive symptoms, quality of life, self-esteem, and willingness to change. These
8
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Smartphone app for depressive symptoms
sections are described in greater detail below. The post survey contained the same
questionnaires as the baseline survey (see sections 2.4.1–2.4.4). In addition, completers of the
treatment condition were asked how often they had used the application (not at all, once in
four weeks, weekly, several times a week, daily, several times a day). If participants affirmed
having used the intervention, we asked them to evaluate how effective, comprehensive,
applicable, and appealing they perceived it to be (see section 2.4.5). Participants were also
given the option to leave comments in a text box. T
P
2.4.1 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
I
The self-report questionnaire PHQ-9 served as the primary outcome (KroeRnke et al., 2001),
we used the German version by Löwe et al. (2002). The PHQ-9 is an Cextract from the Primary
Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) that measures symptoms of a major
S
depression according to the DSM-IV. It consists of nine items that are answered on a 4-point
U
Likert scale. Scores range from 0 to 27 points. Higher scores indicate more severe depressive
N
symptoms. An additional item asks about the impact of symptoms on everyday life. The
A
PHQ-9 is an efficient instrument to assess depression and shows good psychometric
properties; its internal consistency is α = 0.86M – 0.89 and test-retest reliability is r = 0.84
(Kroenke et al., 2001).
D
2.4.2 Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE).
E
The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE; Rosenberg, 1965), is a 10-item self-report inventory
assessing both positive and Tnegative feelings about the self as levels of self-esteem. The items
are rated on a 4-point LPikert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The total
score ranges from 1E0 to 40 points, in which higher scores represent higher self-esteem. The
scale’s internalC consistency is α = 0.88 (Roth et al., 2008). We used the German version by
von Collani and Herzberg (2003).
C
2.4.3 AWHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF).
The WHOQOL-BREF is an abbreviated 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100, which covers
four domains of quality of life (QoL): physical, psychological, social, and environmental. We
used the German version by Angermeyer et al. (2000). The total score ranges from 26 to 130
points. A high score indicates high quality of live. In a normal German population, the
internal consistencies of the four subscales – physical, psychological, social, and
environmental quality of life – ranged from α = 0.76 to 0.88, and the discriminant validity was
reported as good (Skevington et al., 2004).

2.4.4 University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA).
Willingness to change was measured with an item subset of the University of Rhode Island
Change Assessment (URICA) in the baseline survey, in a slightly adapted version. The
URICA consists of the subscales precontemplation, contemplation, action, and maintenance.
We used the German version by Hasler et al. (2003). We included this questionnaire because
we expected willingness to change to be a moderator of the effectiveness of our self-help
application. The subscales show internal consistencies ranging from α = 0.72 to 0.86 T(Hasler
et al., 2003). P
I
2.4.5 Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8).
R
The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Attkisson and Zwick, 1982) was administered
C
in the German version (Fragebogen zur Messung der Patientenzufriedenheit, ZUF-8; Schmidt
S
et al., 1989) to participants who reported that they had used the application. We used an
U
adapted version of the ZUF-8 to assess the participants’ satisfaction with the application, such
N
as its perceived quality, feasibility, effectiveness, and applicability to their problem and their
intention to use the application in the future. The oAriginal version of the ZUF-8 assesses
satisfaction after an inpatient treatment (Schmidt et al., 1989) and was adjusted for the
M
application Be Good to Yourself (see Table 4).
D
2.5 Strategy of data analysis
Intention-to-treat (ITT), completEer, and per protocol (PP) analyses were conducted. Completer
analyses were carried out foTr participants with complete baseline and post data. Per protocol
analyses were conducted for participants who used the application as requested (i.e., several
P
times a week or more) and provided complete baseline and post data. ITT analyses considered
E
data from all subjects with available baseline data. We conducted multiple imputation to
C
estimate pre-post change scores for non-completers (i.e., no data available at reassessment
C
despite several reminders). The method of imputation was “fully conditional specification”,
A
an iterative Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, set as default by SPSS® version 24,
which assumes the pattern of missing data to be arbitrary. As imputation predictors, we used
group allocation, gender, age, education, and therapy status (e.g., medication yes vs. no). We
imputed 20 datasets (10 iterations) and report pooled p-values for the effect of group
allocation on the respective outcome. Main results were computed using ANCOVAs. For ITT
and completer ANCOVAs, we report the group difference in pre-post change scores,
correcting for baseline scores of the respective outcome. For per protocol ANCOVAs, gender
is included as an additional covariate because subsamples differed significantly regarding this
10
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Smartphone app for depressive symptoms
variable (χ² = 4.52, p = .03). However, including two covariates considerably increases
complexity to the model which might diminish results, considering the small sample size.
Therefore, we additionally calculated a second, simpler model in which we corrected for
gender only. We report effect sizes as partial eta squared (η2 ≈ 0.01 small effect, η2 ≈
partial partial
0.06 medium effect, η2 ≈ 0.14 large effect). Group differences at baseline were calculated
partial
using t-tests and chi-squared tests. Additionally, moderator analyses were conducted with the
SPSS® plugin PROCESS® (Hayes, 2013). We hypothesised that willingness to changTe at
baseline would moderate the effect of group allocation on primary and secondaryP outcomes.
All moderator models included group allocation as the independent variable,I post scores of
R
the outcome as the dependent variable, baseline scores of the outcome as a covariate, and
C
willingness to change as a covariate, as well as the interaction between group allocation and
willingness to change to test the moderation. A significant interacStion indicates that
willingness to change functions as a moderator, meaning thatU it influences the intervention’s
effectiveness compared to the wait-list control group. We used complete case data for all
N
moderator analyses.

3.1 Baseline differences
Baseline demographic and psychopathological characteristics of the treatment and the wait-
D
list group are presented in Table 1. Randomization was successful: no significant differences
E
between groups emerged for any of the demographic characteristics nor for the three
T
psychopathological variables (depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and quality of life).
P
Approximately three out of four participants were female. Symptom severity was moderate at
E
baseline (see Table 2): 14.8% of the individuals (n = 13) met the criteria for severe depressive
C
symptoms (PHQ-9 score 20–27), 18.2% (n = 16) had moderately severe depressive symptoms
(PHQ-9 scCore 15–19), 28.4% (n = 25) had moderate depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score 10–
14); 2A8.4% (n = 25) had mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score 5–9), and 10.2% (n = 9)
met the criteria for no present depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score 0–4). One of the inclusion
criteria was the subjective wish to receive a treatment. Therefore, participants without current
depressive symptoms but with, for example, a (subjective) risk of relapse, were included in
the sample as well. Approximately half of the participants received psychotherapy and/or
pharmacological treatment (see Table 1), which again was not different across groups at
baseline, nor did the therapy status change differently between groups (change of
psychotherapy: t = 0.927; p = 0.356; change of medication: t = 0.899; p = 0.371).

3.2 Completion
The completion rate was 84%, and it did not differ between the treatment group and the wait-
list group (see Table 1). Non-completers were not significantly different from completers on
baseline demographic and psychopathological variables except for gender, χ2(1, 88) = 12.43,
p < 0.001; only 58% (11 out of 19) of the males completed both assessments while 91% (63
T
out of 69) of the females completed both assessments. The test-retest reliability of the
outcome variables was satisfactory to good (PHQ-9: r = 0.70, p < 0.001; RSE: r P= 0.79, p <
0.001; WHOQOL: r = 0.88, p < 0.001). Despite the high completion rate, onIly 39% of the
R
participants in the intervention group actually used the application frequently (i.e., several
C
times a week). Willingness to change was not correlated with self-reported frequency of usage
S
(r = 0.05, p = 0.805).
U
3.3 Intention-to-treat and completer analyses
N
We conducted intention-to-treat (ITT) ANCOVAS for primary as well as secondary
A
outcomes. All models included pre-post change scores as outcomes, with baseline scores of
the respective outcome variable as covariates.M The combined model-estimated marginal
means of the pre-post change scores and corresponding standard errors (in brackets) are as
follows. PHQ-9: change score = 1.70D (0.86) for the wait-list group vs. change score = 1.78
(0.87) for the intervention group; RSE: change score = −2.97 (1.12) for the wait-list group vs.
E
change score = −1.20 (1.11) for the intervention group; WHOQOL: change score = −2.30
T
(1.43) for the wait-list group vs. change score = −1.57 (1.62) for the intervention group.
P
Positive change scores indicate a decrease and negative change scores indicate an increase
E
from pre to post assessment. The results, summarized in Table 2, show no difference between
C
groups at all. Likewise, the completer analyses did not show any significant difference
C
between groups (see Table 2). The combined model-estimated marginal means of the pre-post
changAe scores and corresponding standard errors (in brackets) are as follows. PHQ-9: change
score = 1.52 (0.69) for the wait-list group vs. change score = 1.94 (0.72) for the intervention
group; RSE: change score = −2.89 (0.83) for the wait-list group vs. change score = −1.43
(0.88) for the intervention group; WHOQOL: change score = −2.04 (1.28) for the wait-list
group vs. change score = −2.42 (1.37) for the intervention group. Subsidiary paired t-test
analyses showed that both the wait-list and intervention group improved over time on
depressive symptoms, whereas only the wait-list group improved on the self-esteem scale
over time (see Table 2).

3.4 Per protocol analyses
Participants of the wait-list group (n = 39) were compared to the per protocol users (i.e., those
who used the application several times a week; n = 19) of the intervention group in a
complete case analysis. For models with baseline scores and gender as covariates, the
combined model-estimated marginal means of the pre-post change scores and corresponding
standard errors (in brackets) are as follows: PHQ-9: change score = 1.68 (0.69) for the waitlist
group vs. change score = 3.77 (1.01) for the intervention group; RSE: change score =T −2.91
(0.90) for the waitlist group vs. change score = −2.92 (1.31) for the intervention Pgroup;
WHOQOL: change score = −2.20 (1.25) for the waitlist group vs. change scoIre = −4.76 (1.81)

3.5 Subjective benefit
Table 4 provides data on the subjective evaluation and satisfaction with the self-help
application (this includes only the participants in the intervention group who used the
application). The majority of participants evaluated the self-help application as positive and
intended to use the application in the future.
3.6 Moderator analyses
13
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Smartphone app for depressive symptoms
Willingness to change did not moderate the effect of group allocation on post-treatment
depression scores, self-esteem, quality of life, or psychological quality of life (all p-values ≥
0.35). Therefore, participants’ willingness to change did not influence whether the
intervention was effective compared to a wait-list control group.
4. Discussion
The study investigated the feasibility and efficacy of a novel smartphone application for
T
depressive symptoms, Be Good to Yourself, which is currently available in German for the
P
iPhone operating system. It was expected that depressive symptoms would decrease with the
I
use of the self-help application and that self-esteem and quality of life would increase.
R
4.1 Primary outcome C
Depressive symptoms decreased in both groups during the intervSention time of four weeks,
therefore no significant difference between the treatment groUup and the control group
emerged for the primary outcome. The improvement in the control group might be
N
attributable to the passing of time, self-efficacy, patients’ use of treatments other than Be
A
Good to Yourself (see Table 1), or spontaneous remission (Whiteford et al., 2013).
M
The high rate of participants who did not use the application on a regular basis was striking.
Determining the reasons for those high rates should be a high priority in future research
D
projects (e.g., is e-mental health less binding than face-to-face therapy? does e-mental health
E
overburden users?). This high rate is congruent with other studies (Christensen et al., 2009;
T
Richards and Richardson, 2012; Titov, 2011) and seems to be one of the biggest barriers to
online interventions in gPeneral, that have an average non-completion rate of 31% (Melville et
al., 2010). The highE attrition rate can possibly be overcome by combining the smartphone
application withC classical psychotherapy, as studies have shown that adding online sessions to
face-to-facCe interventions (i.e., blended therapy) can increase treatment adherence (van der
Vaart et al., 2014).
A
In per protocol analyses, the treatment group improved in depressive symptoms at trend level
with a small effect size compared with the wait-list group when correcting for baseline scores
and gender. When correcting for gender only, this difference reaches statistical significance at
a medium effect size. This last finding is congruent with results of a meta-analysis on the
effectiveness of unguided online self-help treatments (Karyotaki et al., 2017), although in our
study the result is restricted to the per protocol group only. The meta-analysis included studies
that investigated more time-consuming and extensive web-based interventions. Therefore, the
14
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Smartphone app for depressive symptoms
only partially significant results found in our study could be due to the brevity of the
smartphone application (the short exercises). The sample size of the treatment group in the per
protocol analyses was small (n = 19) which limits the generalizability. Additionally, studies
show that more severely affected participants seem to benefit more from low intensity
interventions for depression (Bower et al., 2013), and as the treatment group in the per
protocol analyses was more severely depressed at baseline, our results only reached statistical
significance when no correction for baseline depression was applied. Further researchT is
needed to substantiate our per protocol results. Because of the high number of paPrticipants
who did not use the application frequently, the issue of how to better motivatIe participants
R
deserves further research. A post-hoc analysis revealed that willingness to change was not
C
correlated with self-reported frequency of usage, but there may be other factors that influence
how frequently an application is used. For this study, the applicaStion presented self-help tasks
in a standardized order. It should be evaluated whether the frUequency of usage can be
increased via the opportunity to save preferred tasks on a list and whether the implementation
N
of gamification elements would motivate participants to use the intervention more often.
A
Gamification is the usage of game design components and game principles in a non-game
M
context, for example, by using a visual reward system (for detailed information see Deterding
et al., 2011).
D
4.2 Secondary outcomes
E
Both of the secondary outcomes, that is, self-esteem (RSE) and quality of life (WHOQOl),
T
showed no difference between groups, neither in the ITT, completer, nor per protocol
P
analyses. Although participants improved overall in the two secondary measures between pre
E
and post, the results did not indicate improved self-esteem or quality of life due to the self-
C
help application.
C
4.3 Feasibility
A
The results of the Client Satisfaction questionnaire (ZUF-8) suggest that users evaluated the
application positively. Especially striking is the overall positive evaluation of the quality of
the application, the high percentage of participants who would recommend the application,
and the high percentage of participants who would use it in the future. However, the results
indicate that the application did not meet the needs of almost half of the participants, which
leads to the conclusion that it should be further modified. To generate ideas on how to
improve the application we inspected the feedback provided by our participants. Several
participants mentioned that the countdown, which we implemented to ensure that participants
15
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Smartphone app for depressive symptoms
took enough time for a task, was too slow or perceived as unnecessary. This is an important
point of critique as it illustrates how a feature can lead to frustration although it was
intentionally implemented to improve users’ experiences. Other participants criticized the
quality of audio files. Yet another critical feedback concerned the reward message that
participants received after completing a task (reinforcement screen, see Figure 6). As the
message was always identical, one participant reported that seeing the reinforcement screen
was not experienced as rewarding anymore after reading it several times. T
P
Since participants answered all questions on satisfaction positively, with more than 50%
I
approval (we set the threshold criterion for feasibility a priori at 50%), our application seems
R
to be a feasible intervention to address mild to moderate depressive symptoms. The self-help
C
application should be optimized, however, and it should be adapted for other operating
S
systems so it can reach more people.
U
4.4 Strengths and limitations
N
The research project was conducted with a limited budget and therefore limited technical
A
expertise. Because of these reasons, the self-help application was only developed for the
operating system iOS, which runs on iPhonesM. The sample for this study therefore includes
only iPhone users. In future research projects, self-help smartphone applications should be
evaluated for a wider variety of operaDting systems. Also, groups differed at trend level
regarding participants’ therapy status (see Table 1). In the intervention group, more
E
participants received therapy from an individual therapist which might have led to an
T
overestimation of treatment effects.
P
A diagnosis of deprEession was not an inclusion criterion, which means that the sample was
very heterogeneCous regarding depression severity. On the one hand, this is a strength of the
study since we reached individuals who subjectively felt the need for psychological treatment,
C
irrespective of diagnosis, which may have led to a representative sample. On the other hand,
A
research shows that participants with more severe symptoms consistently benefit more from
psychological interventions. Thus, the broad inclusion criteria may have increased the
likelihood of a type I error, resulting in an underestimation of the intervention’s true potential.
Another strength of this project is the high completion rate even though participants did not
use the application frequently.
5. Conclusion
16
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Smartphone app for depressive symptoms
Smartphone-based self-help applications could represent a promising complementary tool to
address depressive symptoms in patients who show high adherence in terms of frequent
usage. Also, patients who don’t have access to a computer might benefit from such
applications. Our intervention was only effective at trend level in frequent users (per
protocol), and reached significance only when uncorrected for baseline depression. We are
currently investigating how the efficacy of the application can be augmented, such as by
providing the possibility of selecting favourite exercises that would be presented morTe often
or by implementing gamification elements that might motivate users. Moreover, Pit has not yet
been established whether the magnitude of the effect could be enhanced throIugh blended
R
treatment.

Sources of Self-Esteem
What are your sources of self-esteem?
Self-esteem is the value that we attribute to ourselves and is therefore subjective and
depends only on our thoughts. A high self-esteem is characterized by trust in one’s own
abilities, acceptance of mistakes or failure, the willingness to learn from mistakes and to
praise oneself for something.
We draw our sense of self-esteem from the many different areas of our lives. It is
dangerous to obtain self-worth from only one source (e.g., professional success or
appearance). Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and thus areas of life in whicTh
he/she is more or less self-confident. Decisive for our self-esteem is whether we only look
P
at the defects or also at our strengths. Write down your strengths or areas of life in which
you have a strength. For example, your profession, sports, leisure activities,I hobbies,
R
appearance, relationships…. Remember that no one is perfect and it is impossible to
perform equally well in all areas of life.

Peaceful Place
N
Imagine your place of peace.
For many people, imagination exercises and introsApection takes some getting used to. Try
this exercise even if you have doubts − most people can still profit from this exercise
despite doubts. Take a few minutes and, if yoMu’d like to, close your eyes. Imagine a place
where you feel completely safe and secure. This place can be in the treetop of a large tree
with a thick trunk that does not tip ove r. Or in house by the sea, where you can look out
D
over the waves and it is pleasantly warm inside. Or on a comfortable sofa in front of a
warming fireplace. What does your place look like? Imagine in detail. Rest for a while
E
inwardly in this safe place and recharge your batteries for everyday life around you.
Whenever you need it, you Tcan return to this resting place.
Figure 3. Example of a Ptask in the category mindfulness-based exercises.
E
Boundaries
C
Practice setting boundaries in your thoughts.
C
Do you sometimes feel that your needs are being ignored? Practice making yourself heard
in socAial situations or even saying “no”. For example, in situations where someone
interrupts you all the time or won’t let you speak, make yourself noticed in a friendly way
(e.g., “I haven’t finished talking yet”; “I would also like to say something about this”).
Another example is a too far-reaching request from a friend. If you say no once, you’re not
going to jeopardize losing your friendship. A real friend usually even wishes for honest
feedback from you rather than dishonest responses or placation. Can you think of a
concrete situation from the last week in which you wished you could have set better
boundaries? Think about that situation and how you can react in a determined and
friendly way. Practice setting your boundaries in your mind, and next time it will work out
a little better in a real situation.

Posture
Let your body influence your mood.
Your posture and facial expression influence your emotions and mood, and vice versa. A
bent posture, a sad facial expression and a soft voice promote sadness, fear and low self-
esteem. Change your attitude and expression to promote self-confidence and joy. Stretch
out, straighten your back and hold your head upright. Do you feel how you grow inside as
you change your attitude? You can also cross your hands behind your head for a moment.
Thies way you stretch your body upward and automatically make sure your shoulders
don’t fall forward. Take it even a step further and smile. How does it feel to smile? T
Perceive for a moment how your body and face feel. After the exercise, try to keep your
P
body upright all day long and to not “let yourself down”.
