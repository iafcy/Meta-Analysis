Abstract
Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been studied extensively and the evidence
is now credible that even brief techniques, delivered electronically using web-based
applications (apps), easily accessed by smart phone, computer, or tablet, are consistently
effective at anxiety reduction as well demonstrating efficacy in other commonly
occurring comorbidities such as depression, stress, and panic symptoms. The purpose of
this DNP project was to examine feasibility and the effect of the app, Calm.com, on
anxious adult patients in primary care, using the Recovery Alliance Theory as its
theoretical foundation. This pilot study was longitudinal, using a pre-test/post-test
measurement of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Seven-Item Scale (GAD-7), electronic
collection of time the app was used, and qualitative measures in a group of 15 adult
primary care patient volunteers. The MBI consisted of 28-sessions, varying in length
from 9-18 minutes consisting of education on mindfulness and guided meditation
practice. Changes in the pre/post GAD-7 scores were significant (p= 0.01), with a trend
toward improvement in symptoms with more use of the app, but the changes were
statistically insignificant (p= 0.20). The qualitative data confirmed participants’ belief
that the app was beneficial in helping them learn to relax, using short educational
sessions. This project adds to the evidence that a web-based app is an evidence-based
option for management of anxiety in adult primary care patients.

Acknowledgments
I chose Gardner-Webb University in tribute to my late father, who had such
admiration and respect for this institution because of its relationship with the Baptist
State Convention of North Carolina. It was my mother, who instilled in me the notion
that I could do anything I wanted to do. Thank you both for your contribution toward this
accomplishment.
Once on campus, I quickly bonded with our diverse cohort, “Sisters and Neil”,
and will forever be grateful for the unconditional love and support they have provided.
We are bound forever and I would not have made it without you.
I want to thank each of my instructors for their contribution in my growth as a
nurse and as a person. Every course was interesting, challenging, and well-taught.
However, I want to give special thanks to Dr. Cindy Miller, my committee chair, for
never giving up on me, though my DNP project process was challenging in so many ways
for both of us. She exemplifies the heart and soul of a nurse educator. A heart-felt thanks
also to Lugene Moore, administrative assistant, often my life-line of information and
support.
Thank you, Dona Caine-Francis, my valuable resource, as committee member,
counselor, and friend. Your willingness to help me has been astounding.
Thanks to Calm.com for free vouchers for a month’s use of their amazing app for
my project participants. It was chosen, after review of many, because it most closely
reflected the science of mindfulness meditation I found in the literature.
I am also very grateful to my work colleagues who believed in me, were willing
to change my schedule to accommodate my educational needs, and to my dear patients
iv
who endured with me until the end. It was to serve you better, that I took on this
challenge.
Thank you, David, my amazing husband, who handled everything, so I could
concentrate on work and school. Your unselfish contribution to this process was critical
and your undying belief in me is humbling. I promise I will learn to wash clothes and
cook again.
Finally, and for emphasis, I want to thank God for answering prayers, for
honoring His promises, and for being with me through it all.
Isaiah 41:1 Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will
strengthen you, yes, I will help you. I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

CHAPTER I
Introduction
Anxiety disorders are the most commonly diagnosed mental disorders in
Americans, affecting 18.1% of adults in any given year and posing a 28.8% lifetime risk
(National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], n.d.). However, prevalence in primary care
has been shown to be higher than in the general population (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams,
Monahan, & Lowe, 2007). Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
preferentially present to their primary care providers (PCP) rather than a psychiatrist,
frequently complaining of multiple, seemingly unrelated somatic symptoms at visits
characterized by limited time constraints (Shear & Schulberg, 1995). Coupled with lack
of familiarity with psychiatric diagnoses and a strong predisposition to rule out physical
pathology first, these patients often generate costly, unnecessary, time-consuming work
up with ultimate failure to appreciate or treat the actual diagnosis (Allgulander, 2006).
The economic burden to society, including both direct and indirect costs has been
estimated to be on the order of $48 billion dollars annually (Shimeshan, 2014). The four
anxiety disorders most often encountered in primary care are generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
with about a third of these patients having two or more anxiety disorders (Kroenke et al.,
2007). Descriptions of these disorders (World Health Organization, 2016) are given in
Table 1. Of these four anxiety disorders, GAD is associated with the highest rates of
comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, as well as with depressive disorders, chronic
pain, unexplained physical complaints, and sleep disorders (Nutt, Argyropoulos, Hood, &
Potokar, 2006). Not surprisingly, patients diagnosed with GAD generate nearly twice the
annual costs in primary care when compared to patients without GAD ($2,375 versus
2
$1,448) and generate about $2,000 more in total health care costs yearly than patients
with any other anxiety disorder (Revicki et al., 2012).

(World Health Organization, 2016)
ICD 10 Descriptions of Most Common Anxiety Disorders Encountered in Primary Care
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Anxiety that is generalized, persistent but not related to
identifiable environmental circumstances. Main
symptoms usually include complaints of persistent
nervousness, trembling, muscular tensions, sweating,
lightheadedness, palpitations, dizziness, and epigastric
discomfort.
Panic Disorder Characterized by unpredictable episodes of severe
anxiety that are not related to any specific situation.
Main symptoms usually include sudden onset of
palpitations, chest pain, choking sensations, dizziness,
and feelings of unreality (depersonalization or
derealization). Also, often reported is fear of dying,
losing control, or going mad.
Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) Fear of judgement by others resulting in avoidance of
social situations. Often associated with low self-esteem,
fear of criticism, and accompanied by blushing, hand
tremor, nausea, or urinary urgency. Symptoms may
progress to panic attacks.
Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Arises after a stressful event or situation of an
exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which
is likely to cause pervasive distress in almost anyone.
Predisposing factors include personality traits of
compulsivity, asthenia or prior neuroses. Main
symptoms include flashbacks (reliving of traumatic
event), nightmares, emotional blunting, detachment
from others, unresponsiveness to surroundings,
anhedonia, and avoidance of activities and situations
reminiscent of the trauma, a sense of hypervigilance, an
enhanced startle reaction, and insomnia. Anxiety and
depression are commonly associated with these signs
and symptoms, and suicidal ideation is frequent. The
onset follows the trauma with a latency period that may
range from a few weeks to months.
3
There is considerable functional impairment associated with GAD. Kroenke et al.
(2007) used the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-20 (SF-20) to measure and
compare functional status in primary care patients with GAD to primary care patients
with no anxiety disorder diagnosis, and found that the patients with GAD had
significantly poorer scores in all domains: mental health, social function, role function,
general health, bodily pain, and physical function, as well as more self-reported disability
days. Insomnia and related sleep disorders plague patients with GAD, who report more
difficulty falling and staying asleep, poor sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness and
dissatisfaction with sleep in all age groups when compared to individuals without anxiety
(Choueiry et al., 2016; Brenes et al., 2009). Romera et al. (2010) looked at over 7,152
patients in 87 different primary care sites and found a significantly increased prevalence
of painful physical symptoms, including increased pain severity, poorer daily functional
status, as well as more primary care and emergency department visits in patients with
GAD versus controls at 59% versus 28.3% respectively. These researchers documented
the highest incidence of painful symptoms and impairment in patients with comorbid
GAD and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a common presentation in primary care, at
78% (Romera et al., 2010).
Treatment for GAD
Traditionally, treatment choices for GAD have included psychotropic
medications, psychotherapy, or both, depending on patient preference (National Institute
of Mental Health [NIMH], 2016). Response rates to psychotherapy using cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT), the most studied psychotherapeutic modality are between 47-
75% and medication helps 44-81% of patients (Bandelow et al., 2013). However, in
reality, patients face significant barriers either in obtaining or tolerating their particular
4
choice of treatment with 41% of patients surveyed reporting no current treatment
(Kroenke et al., 2007).
Challenges Associated with Traditional Treatment Strategies
Adherence to pharmacologic treatment regimens involving prescription
medications is poor in GAD. Patients stop taking prescribed antidepressants, the first line
choice for treatment of GAD, within the first six months at rates of 50% for the newer,
best-tolerated drugs and at 85% for the older, less expensive medications (Sheehan et al.,
2008). Benzodiazepines, or “tranquilizers”, are known to be positively associated with
abuse and dependence, and are not good choices for long-term therapy (Bandelow et al.,
2013). However, because they provide immediate, though temporary, relief of symptoms,
these drugs are often sought out by patients, raising suspicion and concern in prescribers
not wanting to cause harm or perpetuate the epidemic of benzodiazepine dependence,
especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly (Widitz & Marin, 2002). Finally,
there is a subgroup of individuals that avoid treatment with psychiatric medications
altogether due to the stigma of being labeled mentally ill (Boyd, Juanamarga, & Hashemi,
2015).
Adult patients of all age groups have shown an overwhelming preference for non-
pharmacologic treatment for anxiety (76%) versus pharmacotherapy (13%) or for
combination therapy (11%) (Mohlman, 2012). The preferred settings for psychotherapy
were primary care (34%); private mental health practices (28%); university settings
(20%); church, temple or synagogue (10%); or in their own homes (8%) (Mohlman,
2012). Despite overwhelming evidence that mental health diagnoses occur frequently in
our population and even more frequently in patients with chronic diseases, there remains
a disparity between reimbursement for physical versus psychological maladies, thereby
5
reducing availability and access to mental health services (Alter, 2006). One community-
based cohort study of 1,642 individuals diagnosed with anxiety and depression were
interviewed at baseline and again about three years later only to find that of those that
were still ill, only 19% had received counseling four or more times in the past year
(Young, Klap, Shoai, & Wells, 2008). Even when treatment is readily available at no
cost to patients, such as in the case of the Veteran’s Administration patient population,
less than 30% of patients diagnosed with depression, post-traumatic stress, or anxiety
disorder utilized psychotherapy services in 2010 (Mott, Hundt, Sansgiry, Mignogna, &
Cully, 2014).
Mindfulness-Based Treatment for GAD
Traditional approaches help some patients somewhat, but further treatment
options with demonstrated efficacy that can be offered in the primary care setting are
needed. One particularly promising type of therapy is mindfulness meditation. The term
mindfulness refers to “paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present
moment, and nonjudgmentally” (Kabat-Zinn, 1994, p. 4).
Use of mindfulness-based interventions in US health care is not new. Its origins
date back to 1979 when pioneer and father of the movement, Jon Kabat-Zinn, a molecular
biologist, introduced a course in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) at the
University of Massachusetts Medical School (University of Massachusetts Medical
School, 2014). Kabat-Zinn designed an eight week group intervention designed to teach
meditation and relaxation techniques to patients diagnosed with a wide variety of health
problems, various chronic pain syndromes and medical conditions with a secondary
diagnosis of anxiety and/or panic (University of Massachusetts Medical School, 2014).
The content was derived from ancient Buddhist teachings, and over the years the program
6
has demonstrated effectiveness for enduring reduction of symptoms of a multitude of
disorders, as well as for instilling self-efficacy in patients regarding the ability to enhance
their own health and well-being using meditation, yoga and continued awareness of the
present moment (University of Massachusetts Medical School, 2014).
Recent advances in neuroimaging have elucidated even more important benefits
of mindfulness and meditation, as it has now become clear that structural and functional
changes in the brain, a concept known as neuroplasticity, occur with continuing practice.
Mindfulness and meditation practices seem to serve as a type of mental exercise program
that improves brain function and emotional stability. Davidson and Lutz (2008)
summarized the findings of several studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and put simply, meditators were more attentive to a flow of stimuli and less likely
to become fixated and miss new stimuli, and were less reactive to emotionally-charged
stimuli when compared to controls (Davidson & Lutz, 2008). A later literature review
examining several types of evidence including fMRI reinforced these findings, again
showing less emotional reactivity and increased gray matter in the regions of the brain
associated with memory (Leung, Lo, & Lee, 2014). Another study compared age and
educationally-matched novice and experienced practitioners of loving-kindness
meditation (LKM), a specific type of meditation with a focus on wishing one’s self and
others well, and documented increased gray matter in brain structures associated with
emotional regulation of empathy, anxiety, and mood (Leung et al., 2013).
Although evidenced-based, one obvious caveat of widespread adoption of this
treatment for GAD is the impracticality of making this specialized instruction available to
those without access to Kabat-Zinn’s program or the few replications of the course across
the US currently. However, the mainstream popularity of this ancient philosophy coupled
7
with current smart phone technology has made available a plethora of applications (apps)
that offer basic instruction in mindfulness and meditation. A recent Pew Research Center
study (Smith, 2015) found that two thirds of Americans have access to a smart phone,
making it very possible to prescribe the use of certain vetted apps that provide instruction
in mindfulness and meditation.
Problem Statement
GAD is a common and serious medical problem causing significant disease
burden in those affected and a marked financial burden to society. Although there are
effective treatment options available, there are limitations and barriers to traditional
treatment of GAD that leave a significant portion of patients either untreated or
undertreated.
Justification of Project
There is a need for an innovative, efficacious, cost-effective treatment strategy
that could be offered to patients with GAD either as monotherapy or safely combined
with pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy to improve outcomes. Teaching patients to
practice mindfulness meditation to manage anxiety could be an efficacious addition to
treatment as usual in primary care.
There are several limitations regarding anxiety treatment that this project will
address. Primary care appointments are time and resource limited, so the bulk of the
instruction must occur outside the parameter of the actual appointment. By far, the bulk
of the evidence showing benefit for MBSR on anxiety has come from studies using
lengthy interventions; however, there are examples of success with significantly
abbreviated versions of the intervention (Bergen-Cico, Possemato, & Cheon, 2013;
Mitchell & Heads, 2015). Although there are examples of the efficacy of smart phone
8
apps in social anxiety disorder and depression, there are no published studies using a
smart phone app to treat GAD. However, the widespread adoption of smart phones has
created the perfect opportunity to utilize this technology, by means of an app, to teach the
techniques of mindfulness as well as provide reminders to patients and tracking of
practice ("Calm.com," n.d.). A primary care clinician would discuss symptoms with the
patient during the presentation visit and review previous and current treatments to
determine if the patient is a candidate for this autonomous intervention. If there are no
urgent concerns, the PCP would briefly present the evidence for mindfulness and
meditation and refer a patient with a smart phone to the website to begin. A routine
follow-up appointment in about two or three weeks would be recommended as well as
instructions to call if there were questions, problems with the treatment or for any other
reason the patient deemed necessary prior to the next visit.
Purpose
The purpose of the DNP project was to identify, implement, and evaluate an
educational module to help patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders to manage
symptoms, improve outcomes, and utilize the least amount of the limited resources
available in the primary care environment. Also of great interest to the project
administrator is experimentation with delegation of a portion of the education of patients
to readily available smart phone apps rather than having to rely on human capital housed
in “bricks and mortar” facilities that are expensive to build and maintain, often
inaccessible, keep patients in a dependent position of having to make and keep
appointments and pay for services rendered by these professionals.
9
Project Question/Hypothesis
This DNP project sought to answer the following questions:
1. What is the effect of the use of a mindfulness meditation app on
anxiety in adult primary care patients?
2. Do patients that use the app more often or for more total time see an
increased reduction in anxiety?
3. What feedback do patients provide regarding the use of a mindfulness
meditation app?
Definition of Terms
For the purpose of this project, the use of mindfulness meditation will be the
independent variable, with patients’ anxiety levels and their qualitative reviews of the
intervention defined as the dependent variables. Operational and conceptual definitions
are listed below in Table 2.

Summary
Anxiety disorders are prevalent and most often present in primary care. However,
these patients often complain instead of insomnia, somatic complaints, or difficulty
concentrating, which not only confuses the issue, but creates increased spending on
unnecessary testing. Although there are efficacious medications available to treat this
disorder, side effects, cost, and negative stigma cause an overwhelming majority of
patients to discontinue therapy. Counseling is overwhelming preferred by patients, but is
often unavailable to them or expensive and is either never initiated or discontinued
prematurely by the patient in most of the cases.
Treatment strategies that encourage patient autonomy and self-directed care must
be tested as technology has made new options available. Smartphone apps are a viable
option for patient education, tracking of progress, and communication. This project lends
valuable information on primary care of patients with GAD as we continue to innovate to
provide evidence-based care at a lower cost, utilizing technology to improve outcomes.

CHAPTER II
Research-Based Evidence
Anxiety is a commonly occurring condition and a known burden to patients, their
loved ones, and to society at large. This condition causes significant disability and
complicates the diagnosis and treatment of any other condition(s) the patient may have
(Kroenke et al., 2007). One recent estimate of the annual direct and indirect costs of this
diagnosis alone was approximately 48 billion dollars (Shimeshan, 2014).
These patients preferentially seek care from their primary care providers (PCP)
(Shear & Schulberg, 1995). Commonly, patients are offered a trial of medication(s), a
referral to a mental health specialist, or both. However, it is important for the PCP to
have access to multiple treatment strategies to recommend a course of treatment suitable
to each patient’s particular preferences, as many patients decline medication and
counseling (Boyd et al., 2015; Young et al., 2008).
Mindfulness meditation practice has been shown to be an efficacious intervention
in anxiety (University of Massachusetts Medical School, 2014). The original program,
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was offered to patients at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School in 1979 and consisted of an eight week course in which
patients were taught to increase their attention to the present moment, striving for
acceptance of whatever state they found themselves in, as well as to engage in daily
sessions of meditation, and concentrating their attention on the breath (University of
Massachusetts Medical School, 2014).
An initial broad look at the literature elucidated numerous replications of the
program, as well as modified versions characterized by greatly reduced time
commitments by patients and staff. Another innovation that is finding its way into mental
12
health treatment is use of the internet accessed by computer, smartphone, and tablet. The
purpose of this DNP project was to identify, implement, and evaluate an educational
module to help patients suffering with anxiety to manage symptoms and thereby improve
outcomes while utilizing the least amount of the limited resources available in the
primary care environment. One way to greatly reduce the cost of equipping patients with
these skills would be to capitalize on the significant adoption of the internet and
particularly smartphones.
Review of Literature
A review of the literature was performed with the idea of gaining insight from
successful implementation of effective treatment strategies for anxiety applicable to the
primary care setting. Mindfulness meditation was of particular interest due to its
amenability as a complementary intervention that could be used alone or in conjunction
with traditional therapies such as pharmacotherapy, with or without psychotherapy. Also
appealing, mindfulness meditation, once mastered, is a practice which can be employed
by a patient in an autonomous manner and is always available without cost. The main
questions to be answered included: (1) what types of mindfulness meditation programs
have been studied in patients with anxiety, (2) are there brief interventions that show
efficacy, and (3) can technology, especially smart phones, computers, and tablets, be
utilized to facilitate patient education and treatment?
A search of the literature using the databases Cumulative Index to Nursing and
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Elton B. Stephens Company (EBSCOhost), the
National Library of Medicine using PubMed, and the search engine Google Scholar from
the years 2006 to 2017 was performed. The key terms searched were mindfulness
meditation, smartphone apps and anxiety, mindfulness and anxiety, brief mindfulness
13
intervention, and primary care and anxiety disorders. The search led to an abundance of
evidence to support mindfulness meditation as an efficacious choice in treatment of
anxiety as well as the commonly occurring comorbidities of depression, panic symptoms,
and high levels of stress.
Landmark Study
As the originator of the first formal program to teach mindfulness meditation as a
medical intervention, it is important to acknowledge the landmark study conducted at the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center by Jon Kabat-Zinn et al. (1992) which was
designed to test the efficacy of mindfulness meditation in patients formally diagnosed
with anxiety disorders using DSM-III-R criteria and to determine whether intake
variables would predict outcome. At that time, there were three strategies in place aimed
at self-regulation of anxiety: meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback, all with evidence
of reduction of anxiety in the general population, and the latter two with variable
therapeutic effects in anxious populations. Although no studies had yet formally
evaluated the efficacy of mindfulness meditation in patients professionally diagnosed
with anxiety disorders, participation in the mindfulness meditation program had shown
reduction in both physical and psychological symptoms in patients in numerous
diagnostic categories, and the maintenance of effect persisted in some groups at a four-
year follow up.
The study was conducted at Kabat-Zinn’s clinic at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center and subjects were selected from referrals to the program
during the spring and fall of 1988 that screened positive for potential anxiety disorders
and agreed to participate. These individuals were then interviewed by either a
psychologist or psychiatrist, trained to administer testing to formally arrive at diagnostic
14
criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder with or without
agoraphobia. Those with significant other psychiatric diagnoses or current alcohol or
substance abuse problems were excluded. As the study was a pilot program, the sample
was intentionally kept small with 24 patients selected and 22 completing the study. A
second group of patients that met criteria for participation, but were not invited to enroll
were deemed non-study participants and exposed to the same mindfulness program as
participants, but were not evaluated to the extent that participants were. Both study and
non-study participants were assessed prior to treatment and afterwards using the Medical
Symptom Checklist and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Participants
were also interviewed weekly by telephone from the time of recruitment to post study and
then monthly for three months after program completion using the following measures:
The Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and ratings of frequency
and severity of panic attacks. In addition to these measures, participants completed the
following at recruitment, start of the program, end of the program and at the three month
follow up: the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, the Hamilton Rating Scale for
Depression, the Fear Survey Schedule, and the Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia.
Participants were also evaluated at recruitment to rate their expectancy to improve with
treatment using a 5-point scale, use of psychotropic medication was noted and tracked,
and a compliance questionnaire was completed at program’s end and again at the three
month follow up.
The intervention had already been in place for 10 years at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center and at that time was referred to as the stress reduction and
relaxation program, an eight week course that met weekly for two hours of instruction
and practice with a seven and a half hour weekend silent meditation retreat scheduled at
15
week six. Patients were given homework consisting of various meditation techniques that
would later be discussed during class. Five classes ran concurrently and were led by one
instructor each who was blinded regarding study participation or DSM-III-R diagnosis.
Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare
recruitment, pretreatment, posttreatment, and three month follow up scores and matched t
tests were used to assess the effect of the intervention in subjects and to compare study
participants with non-study participants.
The results were remarkably positive regarding reduction of anxiety symptoms in
this cohort of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for anxiety and panic disorder with and
without agoraphobia. Statistically significant improvement in both anxiety and depression
scales occurred in the group as a whole and in 20 of the 22 individual subjects. Scores on
the Fear Survey Schedule and Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia were also
significantly improved as were the number of patients experiencing panic attacks. There
was no difference in scores of subjects receiving psychotropic medication when
compared to those not using medication. Expectancy ratings did not predict outcome.
Self-reported practice compliance did not correlate with any study outcome. No
differences were noted between patients diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder with or
without agoraphobia, or in those with co-morbid major depression. Study and non-study
participants demonstrated equivalent significant symptom reduction on the Medical
Symptom Checklist and the SCL-90-R, which would be expected given both groups
received the intervention and the only difference between groups was the degree of
surveillance.
This study clearly demonstrated enduring positive results on reduction of anxiety
and panic using mindfulness meditation. The rate of completion was high at 92% (22/24)
16
and subjects continuing to practice the techniques at the three month follow up was also
high at 91%, with 84% practicing three or more times a week. This study was the first to
use degreed mental health professionals to diagnose participants using DSM-III-R criteria
to distinguish them from the general population reporting anxiety symptoms when
evaluating the effect of meditation on anxiety. However, obvious limitations were the
small sample size and the fact that there was no real control group, as the only difference
between the two groups was the administration of tools to measure aspects of anxiety.
Meta-Analyses of MBSR Programs
The value of meta-analyses is their broad stroke of a topic, combining findings of
many studies which increases the number of study participants and when executed well,
provides information on the efficacy of an intervention, the need for future research on a
topic and elucidates the weaknesses of previous study designs. The disadvantage of this
method includes heterogeneity in study settings, populations chosen, and research
methods as well as lack of a control group in some. Therefore, meta-analyses must be
critically examined and utilized for what they are intended; a generalization of findings
on a topic.
Meditation programs have been widely used in medical settings as a treatment for
stress and stress-related diagnoses, with little known about these programs and how they
should be used to improve health outcomes. A team from John Hopkins University
determined that clinicians needed to know more about these programs, the populations
that may benefit from these interventions, and exactly what, in the way of results could
be expected (Goyal et al., 2014).
Their objective was to use a systematic review of meditation programs to assess
their effectiveness on a range of positive and negative mental states. They questioned
17
whether meditation demonstrated efficacy in mitigating negative mental states such as
anxiety, and enhancing positive mental affect, thereby reducing the likelihood of negative
health behaviors such as substance abuse.
Selection was scientifically rigorous using the Methods Guide for Conducting
Comparative Effectiveness Reviews to select 47 trials from the group’s review of 18,753
citations and 1,651 full-text articles (Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality, 2007).
Only randomized controlled trials (RCT), with one or more control groups, given time
and attention equivalent to the meditation intervention were selected from an
impressively large number of well-known databases such as MEDLINE, PsychINFO, the
Cochrane Library, and others. There were no restrictions placed on date of publication or
language in which the reports were published. Only studies using adult populations with a
medical diagnosis and some sort of stressor were selected. The interventions employed
included a variety of meditation techniques (i.e., mindfulness based stress reduction,
mindfulness based cognitive therapy, Zen, transcendental meditation, and others) that
used a structured program of four or more hours of participant training and instructions to
practice the technique outside of class time. Study settings were varied, but subjects
resembled a general primary care population.
The review confirmed the value of meditation programs regarding the reduction
of the negative aspects of stress. Mindfulness meditation showed efficacy related to
study outcomes more often when compared to other meditative techniques. However, the
researchers quantified the effect of mindfulness meditation as moderate, demonstrating
non-inferiority rather than superiority when compared to specific controls using well-
known interventions such as exercise as an example. Mindfulness meditation improved
scores measuring negative affect such as anxiety, depression, pain, and stress/distress as
18
well as improvement of health-related quality of life. The effect on anxiety and
depression was strong enough to match that of antidepressants, but, it should be noted,
without the associated potential for injurious effects. Researchers found no evidence of
harm to participants, though most studies failed to report on harms.
The researchers concluded that even though the literature on meditative
techniques was limited, there was evidence that mindfulness meditation programs were
an effective strategy for treatment of anxiety, depression, and pain. Therefore, clinicians
should be prepared to discuss the benefits of these interventions with their patients.
The authors suggested that future studies should be designed to evaluate critical
details needed by clinicians to effectively advise patients in the therapeutic use of
meditative techniques. Despite the choice of technique, it will be important to understand
the significance of instructors’ level of training and expertise, time spent instructing
participants, and the amount of home practice by participants to see meditation evolve to
the status of evidence-based practice.
Strengths of this study included the meticulous detail in selection of studies. Two
experienced investigators worked independently searching eight respected medical
databases using the same subject heading terms and words found in the texts of
foundational work. They reviewed the reference lists of each article to locate studies
missed in the database searches. Appropriate studies in any language or date of
publication were considered if inclusion criteria were met. After the list of articles was
compiled, a second team of two investigators independently reviewed each full-text
article and added their decision regarding inclusion. Disagreements were settled by
consensus. Using only studies with controls is considered best science; these researchers
went even further and did not consider individuals on a wait list or those receiving
19
“treatment as usual” as meeting scrutiny as control groups. Control groups for included
studies were defined as individuals receiving the same time and attention as the
intervention group.
The limitations of this meta-analysis are among those common to this type of
research. There were studies that lacked sufficient description of study design to properly
assess the potential for bias. There was a lack of standardization regarding trainers’
preparation, measures, outcomes, and participant practice time that prevented analysis of
effect modifiers. Sample sizes varied, but nearly half the studies enrolled less than 50
subjects. Finally, even though the researchers included only RCTs with control groups,
there was often a lack of blinding of outcome assessment, high attrition rates, lack of
allocation concealment with recruitment, and failure to provide intention-to-treat
analysis.
Noticing the popularity of mindfulness meditation as an adjunct treatment in a
wide variety of conditions, scientists from Erasmus Medical Center; Rotterdam, the
Netherlands; Harvard University and Medical School, and Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, aimed to review the literature to determine more
about which patient populations benefitted from these types of interventions (Gotink et
al., 2015).
The ancient concept of mindfulness was first introduced to Western healthcare by
Jon Kabat-Zinn as a treatment for chronic medical conditions using a standardized style
of mindfulness, which he called MBSR, now widely accepted as a valid intervention for
numerous diagnoses (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992). Teasdale et al. (2000) incorporated Kabat-
Zinn’s mindfulness techniques into traditional cognitive psychotherapy, creating MBCT,
initially aimed at reduction of recurrent depressive episodes.
20
Teasdale and colleagues’ study was a meta-analysis of meta-analyses. The
Cochrane Guidelines (Higgins, 2009) were followed as the basis for a systematic review
of RCTs utilizing either MBSR or MBCT for treatment or prevention for any health
outcome measure. The search for articles was conducted by two independent reviewers
and utilized six medical databases using key terms. Any article selected had to be agreed
upon by both researchers. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Articles that
described the use of other techniques in combination with MBSR or MBCT were only
included if results were reported separately. Control groups were defined as wait list,
treatment as usual, or other active treatment. Once the preliminary screening was
completed, 23 reviews were selected, representing 115 unique studies and 8,683 subjects
from many countries, including children and adults, patients with psychological
diagnoses, medical conditions, and well individuals.
Results were categorized by diagnosis. They included 13 RCTs with 1,244
patients diagnosed with various anxiety disorders. Mindfulness interventions improved
symptoms in patients with anxiety by about 50% compared to controls. Interestingly,
results were significantly higher in Western populations versus others studied. There was
also a definite dose-response effect, as increased time spent practicing enhanced the
effect.
Even though many primary care clinicians are skeptical regarding MBSR and
MBCT, the fact is that they show significant improvement in depression, anxiety, stress,
and quality of life in patients with mental disorders. Perhaps the greatest value of
mindfulness interventions in primary care is in adding them to the usual treatment of
common diagnoses such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, and chronic
somatic conditions. As well as primary prevention of mental disorders.
21
These techniques are relatively easy to implement and empower patients to take a
more active role in their treatment. Mindfulness interventions have been found to present
no significant harm to patients and are cost effective, as one instructor can impact large
numbers of patients who engage in most of the therapy at home without the involvement
of clinical staff.
This study represents the largest analysis of mindfulness-based interventions to
date and evaluated the intervention effect on numerous diagnoses commonly presenting
in primary care. The authors suggest that the variety in populations and settings across
the globe increases the ability for clinicians to generalize findings. The researchers were
careful to control for duplication of results given the high probability that published
meta-analyses often included some of the same studies in their work.
Any meta-analysis is inherently limited as included studies differ regarding
populations, settings, measures, and many other characteristics. This study presented an
enormous problem of heterogeneity. The authors created a category designated as mixed
populations, but admit that interpretation of effect in this group would be problematic.
Due to the nature of the interventions, double blinding was not an option, thereby
skewing results.
However, since the interventions require active participation by subjects to
achieve the therapeutic benefit, any randomization that placed disinterested individuals in
the intervention group would minimize the positive effect of the intervention.
Meanwhile, interested subjects in the control group could either become worse, out of
frustration of not being chosen for the intervention or simply start the practice on their
own, both responses skewing results. Bias exists inherently in these types of studies.
22
Brief Programs
Jon Kabat-Zinn’s MBSR program is an eight-week program during which
participants attend a structured two-hour class each week, a day-long meditation retreat
off-site, and are asked to practice at home 45 minutes daily (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992).
This represents quite a time commitment; approximately 24 hours of instructor time and
about 60 hours for participants. To overcome this perceived barrier, there have been
many adaptations of the program that lessen the time commitment for both instructors
and participants.
The advantages of a briefer program are appealing, but only if efficacy is not
comprised. Sponsoring institutions could decrease the cost of any program that used less
staff time and classroom space. Potential participants would likely be more interested in
shorter time commitments. The following three articles are recent examples of the
research of brief programs.
Anxiety is very prevalent among college students. The American College Health
Association reported in its most recent survey of the nation’s colleges and universities
that 59% of undergraduate students reported feelings of overwhelming anxiety within the
previous 12 months, and only 17% of them reported receiving any mental health services
(American College Health Association, 2016). This high incidence of anxiety, coupled
with low rates of seeking counseling, led to development of a MBSR program which was
incorporated into an elective academic undergraduate course on addictive behaviors
(Bergen-Cico et al., 2013). The aim of the study was to learn whether participation in a
five week MBSR would lead to improvement in self-compassion, mindfulness skills, and
trait anxiety among a group of non-clinical university undergraduates. A secondary aim
was to determine the feasibility of modifying higher education curricula to incorporate a
23
brief MBSR component with potential of positive psychological benefit to students,
without compromising the academic mission of institutions of higher learning. The
authors hypothesized that the intervention would yield benefit.
The project took place on a college campus between January 2010 and May 2012.
Participants were a group of 119 undergraduates, with 72 students in the treatment group
and 47 in the control group. The treatment group met during five consecutive classes for
two hours, or just 10 hours, engaging in sitting and breath work, guided body scan, and
movement such as yoga or walking, led by their professor who was trained in MBSR
through the University of Massachusetts Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health
Care, and Society. The control group participants were simultaneously enrolled in the
same class, but a different section, taught by the same professor at a different time. Both
groups completed “baseline” surveys at week one and a “follow up” survey at week six.
The survey consisted of four measures; the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills
(KIMS) and the Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLM), which measure mindfulness
skills; the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), which measures one’s self-forgiveness mindset,
and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Form Y-2 (STAI-T) for
measurement of anxiety.
After participation in a five-week MBSR, students in the intervention group
improved mindfulness skills as demonstrated by significant pre-and-post scores on the
KIMS and the PHLM (p < .001). Self-compassion increased significantly (p<.001) as
measured by the SCS. There were no changes in the control group’s scores of the KIMS,
PHLM, or the SCS. The treatment group showed non-significant improvement in the
STAI-T, whereas the control group scores demonstrated increased anxiety.
24
College undergraduates participating in the brief MBSR received psychological
benefits compared to controls. The gains centered around increased mindfulness and self-
compassion. Although the MBSR group showed only slight reduction in anxiety, it must
be noted that the control group’s anxiety scores increased. The authors surmise that the
trait for anxiety may be more resistant to change and may require longer MBSR
programs. Also mentioned was the possibility that another measure, with increased
sensitivity to the construct anxiety, may have captured changes missed on the STAI-T.
A significant contribution to the literature, this study demonstrated positive
changes in an authentic student population as compared to study designs that may not be
applicable to this high-risk group. Incorporation of MBSR into typical curricula reduced
barriers of time and travel to attend a program, thereby impacting a much greater number
of students. The utilization of a formally-trained facilitator, a graduate of the program
originated by Jon Kabat-Zin, increased validity of the intervention and the study as a
whole.
There were a few weaknesses of the study. This study used convenience samples
rather than including a wider selection of students and lacked randomization. The authors
admited that the timing of post-intervention survey administration may have been
affected by the fact that students were in the midst of preparing for mid-term exams,
which likely captured exceptionally high levels of stress for both populations. Finally, a
follow up survey, several weeks or months after the MBSR-infused class, would have
elucidated whether the changes were enduring.
Another high-risk group for stress-related symptoms is health care workers. To
address this issue, a Washington state community hospital implemented a brief
mindfulness-based program for physicians, using a combination of in-person class time,
25
video modules on mindfulness, and teleconferences (Pflugeisen, Drummond, Ebersole,
Mundell, & Chen, 2016). The aim of the program was to assist physicians in high-stress
roles to develop mindfulness skills to reduce stress and improve well-being. The
application of video modules to convey most of the content as opposed to face-to-face
class time was intended to increase ease of participation by staff and decrease
institutional costs.
Researchers introduced the program to their physician staff as part of a wellness
initiative on a first-come, first-served basis. A total of 23 physicians enrolled and 19
completed the program. Baseline, end of program, and 16-week follow up surveys were
administered, designed to measure stress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), burnout
using Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and mindfulness skills using the Kentucky
Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS). Significance was set at a p value of 0.05. The
intervention consisted of three 90-minute live sessions (weeks 1, 4, and 8), eight online
videos of five to seven minutes in length, and weekly one-hour teleconference coaching
calls scheduled at a time to accommodate the majority of participants. An audio library of
resources was made available to participants and they were sent a brief daily email
related to the week’s lesson. Participants self-reported their use of the program materials
each week.
The program proved to be very effective, with significant changes in seven of the
eight outcomes from baseline and end-of program, post-intervention or both. A
significant reduction in stress from baseline to program end were striking (p<.0005) and
even improved at the post-test (p<.00001). Other significant changes persisting at the
follow-up survey were: increase in sense of personal accomplishment and use of
mindfulness skills.
26
At study’s end, it was concluded that a brief version of MBSR using video-
modules was an effective and practical means for meeting the needs of busy physicians
needing flexibility regarding educational programs. Most importantly, after the modules
were produced, they can be used over and over as a very cost-effective means of reaching
many more employees. Program graduates could even be used to facilitate the in-person
classes and teleconferences, creating self-sustainability.
The strength of this pilot study was in its design with goals of providing
economically feasible and flexible education to solve institutional problems. As a pilot
program, it served its purpose, however, the weaknesses included a very small sample
size, the lack of randomization and utilization of a control group.
Very brief mindfulness programs, beginning to show efficacy, attracted interest as
they could be used widely due to low cost and the ability to target large numbers of
people. Researchers from Wake Forest University School of Medicine and the
Department of Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, NC designed
a very brief (60 minutes) mindfulness intervention to test its effect on psychologic
distress, anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure on well undergraduates (Zeidan, Johnson,
Gordon, & Goolkasian, 2010). They also included a sham meditation group to tease out
any differences between the actual practice of meditation and an intervention of deep
breathing and relaxation that would be introduced as meditation training as a deceptive
technique. A third group, another control group, also met for 60 minutes, but received no
actual intervention. There was no expectation that such a brief exposure to MBSR would
discern changes in depression, fatigue, or vigor, but they did hypothesize that both groups
would exhibit a decrease in anxiety levels.
27
The study took place in the psychology department of one of the universities after
88 subjects were selected from a pool of student volunteers who had expressed a desire to
learn to meditate, but had no prior experience with meditation. Six students did not
complete the program, leaving a final group of 82 subjects. There were three arms of the
study: a meditation group (n = 29), a sham meditation group (n = 27), and a control group
(n = 26). The experiment took place over three consecutive days for 20 minutes each. The
subjects, 5-8 per session, met in the same room at about the same time each day.
The meditation group was led by an instructor with eight years of training in
mindfulness meditation interventions. The subjects were not asked to practice outside of
class, unlike most MBSR programs. During class, they were instructed to sit in a chair,
close their eyes and relax. Then, they were taught to focus on the flow of their breath and
to just let go of any thoughts that occurred and then return their focus and attention back
to their breath. The 20-minute sessions included brief instructions and then seven minutes
of silence in which to practice the technique. At the end of each session, all subjects
answered “yes” when asked individually if they felt like they were truly meditating.
The same facilitator led the sham group and began the sessions with an
introduction of mindfulness meditation; however, the emphasis was on breathing
exercises while they were being given just the notion that they were meditating. As with
the meditation group, the last seven minutes were held in silence for practice of the
breathing technique. The critical missing piece of this group’s training was the lack of
guided instruction to focus on the flow of the breath, which is the very basis of
mindfulness meditation. Everyone in this group also responded “yes” when asked if they
felt like they were truly meditating.
28
The control group was a test of non-manipulation. This group of students was also
told that they were registered for a mindfulness intervention, but were only told to sit still
in their chairs for the 20-minute session. They could speak, but were not allowed to do
homework or sleep.
The measures chosen were all credible and found elsewhere in the literature. The
Profile of Mood States (POMS) was chosen to measure psychologic distress using six
domains: tension, depression, confusion, fatigue, anger, and vigor. Anxiety was measured
using The State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The cardiovascular measures were
blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) measured by an automatic device, the Dinamap
5000. All measures were administered just prior to the first session and afterwards BP
and HR were checked and the STAI was re-administered. The STAI was administered
before and after the second session. Participants completed the STAI and had their BP
and HR measured prior to the third session and all the measures were administered
afterwards.
After the data were analyzed, a significant decline in negative mood,
demonstrated by reduced scores of the POMS, was seen in each group, but the meditation
group demonstrated a significant reduction in total pre-and-post total scores as well as the
sub-scales when compared to the other groups. STAI scores demonstrated significant pre-
and-post session decreases in anxiety by the meditation and sham groups, but did not
differ significantly with pre-and-post study results. The control group did not show any
significant changes. Each group demonstrated pre-and-post session reductions in HR, but
only the mindfulness group showed a significant total pre-and-post study decrease in
heart rate. Systolic BP decreased in each group measured before and after each session,
but there was no significant intergroup effect. Diastolic BP was a little lower in each
29
group before and after the sessions, but not significantly so and there was no intergroup
effect.
This study showed that a very brief meditation intervention significantly improves
overall mood; specifically, depression, tension, fatigue, confusion, and anxiety. Brief
meditation also reduced heart rate when compared to sham meditation and a control
group. There were no significant changes of systolic or diastolic BP, but it is noteworthy
that this young population began each session with normal blood pressure readings;
therefore, it may not be realistic to expect significant reductions. The authors proposed
that perhaps the reduced blood pressure effect would occur if the population was
subjected to high level stressors.
The strengths of this study centered on its inclusion of a sham meditation group, a
reasonably designed control group, and randomization of an acceptable number of
subjects. However, because the study population included only young, well college
students, generalization of findings to any other population would be inappropriate. The
authors, themselves, mentioned the fact that the same instructor led both the meditation
and sham groups, therefore creating the possibility of bias. A longitudinal study
measuring subjects again after some time had passed, would answer the question of
whether the effect of such a brief intervention was enduring. Overall, this study
contributed greatly to the state of the science as there is a need for brief interventions and
this mere 60-minute intervention demonstrated significant improvement of several
important health variables.
Internet-Based Interventions (smart phones, tablets, and computers)
Meta-analyses. The wide-spread use of smart phones capable of downloading
applications (apps) for various uses has led to development of numerous products aimed
30
at improvement of mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia,
substance abuse, and eating disorders. It has not gone without notice that use of this
portable technology could provide services to many more people than currently served by
traditional means. Research is just beginning to test the efficacy of these apps delivered
via smart phones and other devices.
Little quality research regarding the efficacy of mental health apps had been done
while the use of such apps was proliferating; therefore, Donker et al. (2013) performed a
literature search, using seven widely accepted databases to identify reports published in
English from January 1, 2008 (release of the first app) to May 30, 2013. To be included
in the review, studies had to use a mental health app that was downloadable to both the
Android and iPhone from their respective app store. The study had to use a pre-post
design with a control group defined as individuals on a wait list, receiving treatment-as-
usual, or receiving some other treatment. Eight studies representing 227 participants
using five unique apps were selected. The population included community-residing
adults, patients from an outpatient clinic, adults from their workplace, adolescents from a
general medical practice, and female university students.
The quality of the studies was judged to be generally low according to the
authors, mainly due to missing information such as methods of randomization, dropout
rates, details of blinding, or lack of description of statistical analyses. The scales used to
assess depression and anxiety were PHQ-9, GAD-7, STAI, Quick Inventory of
Depression Symptoms-Clinician Rated (IDS-C), Depression and Anxiety Scale (DASS),
and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II).
The results were inconsistent. Out of the four studies that measured depression,
two studies showed significant improvement from baseline to the end of the study, but
31
the other two failed to demonstrate benefit. The latter two studies’ population was
adolescents from a general practice. However, there was very little difference between
the intervention group and the control group. Both received the same therapy, but the
intervention group used their smart phones to utilize Ecological Momentary Assessment
(EMA), a method of data collection that allows participants to report their symptoms,
mood, or behavior in real time or close to their experiences of interest to researcher(s).
Three trials measured anxiety and stress. Each showed statistically significant
positive changes in anxiety and stress. One study also demonstrated significant
improvement in coping skills in studies using oncology nurses and female college
students.
Although the use of this technology is relatively new and many of the trials lack
quality, there is potential to use smart phone apps to increase access to mental health care
at low cost. However, there is a need for large, scientifically sound studies of the apps
themselves as well as acceptance and use of smart phones by the public to improve
mental health symptoms.
This was a difficult meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of almost every
element of interest in the trials selected, but this is the way information about innovations
is introduced. The main strength of this study was that the researchers used what was
available to them from just a few trials to report on this new technology to the scientific
community. Limitations of the studies themselves included lack of long-term follow up,
small sample sizes, and lack of evidence that the apps were designed around evidence-
based practice.
Again, observing the proliferation of on-line mindfulness-based interventions
(MBI) for a wide variety of psychological diagnoses or symptoms, Spijkerman, Pots, and
32
Bohlmeijer (2016) set as their aim to estimate the effect of these interventions on mental
health. After an extensive review of the literature (any published study up to March 23,
2015), they selected 15 trials that met their criteria. Only on-line RCTs of MBIs using
validated measures for effect on depression, anxiety, stress, or well-being in adults (18
years or older) were chosen.
The total population of included studies was comprised of 2,360 participants,
1,211 in the intervention groups and 1,149 in the control groups. The majority of the
samples were comprised of more female subjects than male, and all subjects were adults
ranging in age from 18-58 years. There were five studies using subjects with somatic
complaints, three studies of patients with psychological conditions, and the remaining
seven studies used populations of students, employees or other non-clinical subjects.
Their findings showed that on-line MBIs were more effective on psychological
versus somatic variables. Stress and mindfulness showed the highest pre-and-post
improvements (p<.001), depression and well-being were improved (p<.01) as was
anxiety (p<.05). Adherence rates, defined as the percentage of the population that
completed 100% of the program, were 39.5-92%. The effect of therapists’ input as part of
the program or if there was a dose response could not be determined due to under
powering. Their conclusion was that MBIs appear to be effective at improvement of
mental states, but much more investigation is warranted.
The authors were limited as to the number of studies that could be included due to
poor design, thereby decreasing the generalizability of the findings. There were also
limitations regarding sub-group analysis because the studies were underpowered.
Heterogeneity of study characteristics had a limiting effect regarding generalization. The
authors faced all the above issues and yet provided another early look at the use of MBIs
33
in healthcare. Their suggestions for future research will prove helpful regarding study
design (more longitudinal studies, less use of non-clinical populations, and exploration of
characteristics of study drop outs).
As trends suggesting the efficacy of using computer-based mindfulness
meditation interventions to treat mental health problems grew, interest in the efficacy of
use of apps alone also grew. Fish, Brimson, and Lynch (2016) conducted a review of
studies using mindfulness techniques delivered electronically without facilitator
involvement to measure the effect on stress, depression, and anxiety in a variety of
populations. The impetus of their investigation was to determine if technology alone, a
very cost-effective treatment modality, would produce results equivalent to those
reported by face-to-face interactions with health care providers.
They began their work by searching three electronic databases, Ovid Medline,
PsychINFO, and Embase, using key words, titles, and medical subject headings (MeSH)
derived from “mindfulness” and “technology”. Ten studies met their inclusion criteria:
mindfulness courses delivered by technology only, inclusion of clinical outcomes in
study reports, interventions without direct facilitation, and access to the full paper
published in English.
Population characteristics of selected studies represented a range of 15 to 273
subjects, all adults from 25 to 56 years of age. A distinct gender bias was noted with 71-
98% female participants, but this finding is similar to face-to-face intervention statistics.
Study participants consisted of students, individuals diagnosed with cancer, or
fibromyalgia.
The interventions were all web-based except one which used audio compact discs
(CD’s). Four of the ten studies measured changes in anxiety using widely-accepted tools,
34
including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), GAD-7, Responses to
Stress Questionnaire (RSQ), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The courses varied
in duration from one to three months. Two studies used patient reminders and two did
not, but all required homework which varied widely (30 minutes a day to almost two
hours daily) and was not always measured. Only one of the four studies used a control
group, which was described as a discussion group.
Each study demonstrated positive results on anxiety, however only two of the four
studies tested the significance of subjects’ pre-and-post scores. A reduction in rumination
was observed in one study, but no meaningful statistics were provided. The one study that
used a control group found considerable improvements in patients in the intervention
group (p<0.01).
Although the use of web-based technology as a means for care delivery is in its
infancy, it appears to be a viable alternative to costly one-on-one therapies. Most studies
showed positive effects, but study design must also evolve to match the standards that
health care professionals have come to expect before adopting a change in practice.
The fact that the authors did not try to meet the standards required for a formal
meta-analysis is a strength, considering the quality of the available studies, and termed
their project a review with report of findings. The main issues continue to be: large drop-
out rates, lack of control groups, lack of follow up to document endurance of effect, poor
measurement of participants’ usage of the intervention, lack of documentation of
expertise and qualifications of course designers, and an observed population bias with
high numbers of women and students which make any results non-generalizable.
Individual studies. There is a greater demand for mental health services than
supply in most parts of the US (Alter, 2006). As this is also the case in the United
35
Kingdom (UK), a group of researchers tested a web-based MBSR/MBCT intervention to
determine its feasibility to provide services to individuals with increased stress, anxiety,
and depression (Krusche, Cyhlarova, and Williams, 2013). They hypothesized the
following: that perceived stress, anxiety and depression would be improved after
completion of the web-based course; the improvements would be maintained at the one-
month follow up; that participants that practiced more would see more improvement in
symptoms; and the efficacy would be comparable to other types of mental health
interventions.
The course was a collaboration between the Mental Health Foundation, Wellmind
Media and leading UK mindfulness instructors. Participants self-selected the online
course and paid about $90 (US) for its use. A total of 5,094 people signed up for the
course and 1,497 completed the course and the one-month follow up questionnaire
(29%). The sample was mostly female (78%), with an average age of 47.7 years.
The course consisted of 10 instructional videos led by two instructors, one male
and one female. Formal meditation skills were taught (body scan, mindful movement,
sitting meditation, and focus on breathing) as well as incorporating mindfulness into daily
life, such as mindful eating. There were assignments to complete and motivational
emails. Participants were also asked to practice at least one formal meditation using one
of the video resources and one informal practice daily and at least one extra practice or
task. Prompts to self-report program activity and homework were strategically included.
Measures were carefully selected to measure outcomes. The Perceived Stress
Scale (PSS) measures perception of events as uncontrollable and overwhelming. Anxiety
was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) and
36
depression was measured with the Patient Heath Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Participants
completed surveys pre-and-post intervention and at one month after course completion.
Baseline scores on all the measures were significantly higher than the general
population. The average PSS score confirmed that participants were “highly stressed”,
the GAD-7 showed an average of at least “moderate anxiety”, and the PHQ-9 scores were
consistent with “moderate depression”. After course completion, PSS scores were
significantly reduced and there was significant reduction from course completion to the
one-month follow up testing. The same pattern was demonstrated with the GAD-7 and
PHQ-9. Patients with higher baseline test scores were found to practice less, and to see
less improvement. However, when controlling for baseline symptom severity, more
practice was associated with greater change in pre-and-post intervention scores.
It can be concluded from the results that use of an online mindfulness course
produced significant change in stress levels, anxiety, and depression. A dose response
was positively associated with improvement. Interestingly, a phenomenon of less
participation was observed in participants with the highest baseline scores, suggesting
that severe symptoms may be responsible for a degree of disability preventing
participation in self-help programs. These individuals may require a different type of
therapy to meet their specific needs.
There were many strengths to this study. The population was large and because
subjects self-selected they likely represent a section of society that would be seen in
primary care offices. The intervention appeared to be of high quality due to the
collaborative efforts of very credible experts. The fact that there was a cost to use the
website, would seem to represent buy-in from subjects, but the attrition in this trial was
71%. It would have been interesting if the researchers had attempted to understand the
37
differences between enrollees that dropped out and those that completed the intervention.
One must also wonder if cost was a barrier for some potential subjects. Other weaknesses
include self-reported participation and the lack of a control group.
The standard therapies for SAD are CBT and pharmacotherapy, both of which
miss certain segments of the population. Many affected individuals decline seeing a
therapist at all, or for less than the recommended number of treatments. Others shun
pharmacotherapy due to frequent side effects, cost, and not wanting to depend on daily
medications for this or any disorder. Both treatment modalities are charged with stigma.
Therapy delivered by smart phone or other devices via the internet overcome many of
patients’ objections.
Two different treatment methodologies, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and
interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) were formatted to be delivered via smartphone as well
as computer and tablet to test their effect on patients diagnosed with social anxiety
disorder (SAD) (Dagoo et al., 2014). CBT is characterized by changing non-productive
thoughts and patterns of reaction to stressors by teaching patients to challenge negative
thoughts and patterns, thereby significantly controlling the symptoms of anxiety. IPT’s
focus is on improvement of problematic interpersonal relationships, which then lower
patients’ psychological distress.
In this study, the CBT group was the main intervention group and the IPT group
served as an alternate treatment group. It was hypothesized that CBT delivered by a
smartphone app would show a significant decrease in symptoms of SAD, but no
hypothesis was formulated regarding the IPT group as this therapy was a much less-
studied treatment for this disorder.
38
This randomized controlled study was advertised nationally in the Swedish press
which directed interested parties to the study’s website. Inclusion criteria were designed
to identify the diagnosis of SAD in adults (18 year or older), while eliminating
individuals with co-morbidities of suicidal ideation, alcohol abuse or dependence,
psychosis, or bipolar disorder. Potential candidates would not currently be engaged in any
form of psychotherapy, nor would they have received CBT within the last four years, and
if on psychotropic medication, the patient would be stable and the dose unchanged for at
least the last three months.
A total of 235 applied to participate in the study, but after the thorough screening,
only 52 were selected to participate. The population was about equally split between
males and females (48.1% and 51.9% respectively) and ranged in age from 20-65 years.
Half the group had completed high school and 46.2% had attended a university for an
average of 2.3 years. This population represented a typical segment of Swedish society.
Participants were randomized to one of the two arms of the study using an
electronic randomizer. Each group was exposed to a nine-week program consisting of
nine modules and weekly homework. Access to the material required use of a secure
password. Only the IPT group received weekly contact with a therapist limited to 15
minutes; however, there was no description of this contact regarding method of delivery.
The primary outcome was improvement in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self
Report (LSAS-SR), a tool used to measure avoidance and fear in social situations.
At the end of nine weeks, 30 participants (57.7%) had completed the treatment
modules, 63% of the CBT group and 52% of the IPT group. Since participants could
access the material using smart phone, computer, or tablet, the researchers noted that
usage was 42.8%, 50.05%, and 7.14% respectively. Both groups showed significant
39
improvement using pre-and-post LSAS-SR scores using p<.05 as significance level, but
the CBT group changes reached a significance level of p<.001 whereas the IBT group
changes showed a significance level of p<.01. When participants were assessed for
significant improvement individually, the CBT group had a 55.6% rate of response
compared to an 8% in the IBT group. Both groups demonstrated stability of change at a
three-month follow up analysis.
The results lead to the conclusion that patients are willing to utilize electronic
devices as a treatment modality for anxiety, although in this case, the smart phone was
used a little less often to access the treatment modules when compared to the computer.
There were technical difficulties encountered with the smart phone platform that may
have impacted the results. Future studies could limit access to just a smart phone app to
get more precise data regarding its real acceptance by patients; however, patients may
prefer having options regarding access.
Study limitations are basically the same ones that plague this emerging science
and its research. There was not a control group, though at least a new therapy was
compared to one that has demonstrated success when delivered in one-on-one sessions,
group therapy, and even a few instances of success using a smart phone app. The sample
sizes were small and the attrition rates high, which resulted in a study that was not
powered to fairly compare the treatment groups. Another issue is that the population was
gleaned of patients with most of the commonly-occurring co-morbidities, and even
though this group looked like a typical segment of the population, they were likely not
the group one would encounter in a treatment setting, therefore limiting generalizability
of results
40
Researchers from Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) were interested
in whether mindfulness training could make a difference in stress and cognitive decline in
seniors, but wanted to test feasibility of a web-based care delivery system since the
benefits of reduced cost and wider access are known to be advantages associated with this
technology (Wahbeh, Goodrich, & Oken, 2016). A randomized, controlled trial, in the
form of a pilot study, using the Internet Mindfulness Meditation Intervention (IMMI),
developed by the research team, was compared to a control group given a generic health
and wellness education program. Once screening was completed, participants were
enrolled in the study. The two groups were evenly matched, varying in age from 65-90
years of age, 88% Caucasian, and 50% female. The drop-out rate was rather low at 24%
and when questioned as to the reason for not completing the study, they consistently
reported a problem of lack of time to participate fully.
Pre-and-post study data was collected in participant’s homes by a research
assistant blinded as to randomized group assignment and an unblinded research assistant
visited to instruct participants in use of the technology. Study modules were initially
accessed using the iPad tablet, but many participants had difficulty with this device, so
they were allowed to use their home computers if they chose. The interventions consisted
of six weekly modules, an hour long, with homework assignments of 30 minutes daily.
Program use was collected electronically.
Acceptability was found to be high, based on client satisfaction questionnaires.
There were no differences in stress or cognition scores or program usage, as researchers
expected due to the short study period and small sample size.
The study was well designed. It included a control group and made data collection
easy for participants. Care was taken to give one-on-one instruction in use of technology
41
as this age group varies in adoption of and expertise regarding use of electronic devices.
Although the sample size was small, the groups were well balanced regarding age,
gender, education, marital status, and cognition. As there was difficulty noted with use of
the iPad, seniors’ comfort with technology may have been underestimated. Another
problem identified in this pilot study was the length of time participants took to type in
narrative responses to homework questions. Revisions have been made for the follow up
study requiring selection of multiple-choice check boxes. The authors admitted that it
was likely that only a segment of the senior population are candidates for this type of care
delivery system due to difficulty with novel technology.
Neuroplasticity and Mindfulness Meditation
It is now a well-known fact that the human brain is capable of changes in volume,
activity levels, blood flow, and hard wiring of neural pathways and connections, an
attribute known as neuroplasticity. The following articles represent examples of research
demonstrating positive changes in the brain in response to mindfulness meditation
techniques.
A multi-disciplinary team of researchers wanted to learn more about the
mechanism(s) of improvement in the brain’s white matter in response to a mindfulness
meditation training program, Integrative Body-Mind Training (IBMT) compared to a
control group using relaxation training (RT) (Tang, Lu, Fan, Yang, & Posner, 2012).
They hypothesized that the positive effects of IBMT were due to a change in brain
structure, or neuroplasticity, rather than a training effect of an existing neural network.
In this study, 68 Chinese undergraduates were randomly and evenly assigned to
one of the two groups, both of which were four weeks in length consisting of ten hours of
training and practice, with no other details of the interventions reported. Diffusion tensor
42
imaging (DTI), a type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), capable of providing
detail of white matter fibers, was administered at pre-test, week two, and week four of the
study. Significant improvements were noted in the structure and size of white matter
fibers and an increase in myelin, the outer insulating layer of nerve fibers, in the IBMT
group only. The changes were noted most in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region of the
brain known to regulate decision making, impulse control and emotions.
These findings are important because the minute structural changes in the white
matter fibers elucidate the structural changes that took place in response to a four-week
practice of IBMT, thereby further supporting the concept of favorable neuroplastic
changes with this mindfulness practice. The study report was written documenting the
specifics of the imaging techniques, which is important for future research. Limitations
would include a relatively small sample size.
A group of Chinese researchers were interested to learn of any unique structural
or functional differences in practitioners of Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM) and if
there were differences between experts and novices (Leung et al., 2013). Because LKM is
based on the practice of consciously wishing wellness, happiness, peacefulness, and
safety for one’s self and others (Fronsdal, 2008), the researchers hypothesized that they
would find more gray matter in areas of the brain associated with social cognition and
emotional processing.
The population was composed of 25 healthy Chinese men, 10 of which had long
term experience with LKM and were considered experts. There were 15 others who
expressed interest in LKM, but had only seven hours of basic training and self-practice.
All subjects were right-handed, and had no history of traumatic brain injury, medical
43
problems or mental health disorders that could possibly affect brain structure. Each
underwent brain imaging using high-resolution MRI.
The LKM group demonstrated increased gray matter volume in the right angular
and posterior parahippocampal gyri, regions important in emotional regulation such as
empathy, anxiety, and mood. There are known psychological diagnoses associated with
low volume gray matter or impaired connectivity in these two regions such as depression
(Gilbert et al., 2010), bipolar disorder (Chen, Suckling, Lennox, Ooi, & Bullmore, 2011),
and schizophrenia (Gradin et al., 2011). This is an important finding as the logical
conclusion would be the potential of non-pharmacological treatment for these common
disorders.
Again, the weaknesses lie in small sample size and lack of longitudinal follow up.
It is also worth mentioning that the entire population was male, making the generalization
to the findings in females scientifically invalid.
There are certain EEG patterns of the frontal lobes of the brain that have been
associated with positive mood, particularly an asymmetry favoring more activity in the
left frontal region. Therefore, a team of researchers hypothesized that this pattern could
be duplicated using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning in
subjects trained in IBMT when compared to a control group using simple relaxation
techniques (RT) (Tang, Lu, Feng, Tang, & Posner, 2015).
Forty right-handed Chinese undergraduates were randomly assigned to IBMT or
relaxation group with 20 subjects in each group. All subjects were screened to ensure that
they had no prior meditation training and no history of psychiatric or neurological
conditions which would skew results. Their mood was evaluated with a brief self-report
mood scale, similar to the short form of Positive and Negative Affect Schedule
44
(PANAS). Participants received 30 minutes of IBMT or relaxation training for a total of
2.5 hours over a five-day period. IBMT involves relaxation, mental imagery, and
mindfulness training, guided by a coach, and reinforced using a compact disk. The RT
group was trained in an ordered progressive relaxation of muscle groups. Both groups
underwent SPECT scanning of the brain, pre-and-post intervention, after a 10 minute
preparation period of relaxing in a dark room with eyes closed.
The IBMT group showed significantly better post-intervention scores in mood in
comparison to the RT group and the IBMT group alone showed significant post versus
pre-intervention mood scores. (all p < 0.05). The IBMT group, but not the RT group,
demonstrated a significant cerebral blood flow (CBF) increase in subgenual/adjacent
ventral anterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, and insula after training
(all p < 0.05).
This study, using the finding of frontal lobe asymmetry, showing more blood flow
to the left frontal lobe, suggests that a few hours of training produces this effect in both
groups, but IBMT’s increase was greater than RT. Therefore, there may be potential in
the use of IMBT to improve mood by increasing blood flow to a region of the brain
associated with attention and self-regulation. Very importantly SPECT scanning of
subjects demonstrated a physiological mechanism for improvement in mood using a
meditative technique. Increasingly, evidence is coming forward to suggest that the use of
meditation could be a valid intervention for mood disorders and other mental and
physical malfunctions in the brain.
A large multidisciplinary team of scientists associated with universities in Spain
and Germany set about to determine the effect of a mindfulness meditation intervention
on the functional connections or linkages between different parts of the brain associated
45
with mood regulation using fMRI technology (Yang et al., 2016). They hypothesized that
the intervention would show positive results in all areas measured.
The subjects selected were 13 university students (three males and ten females)
recruited by university advertisement to participate in a 40-day mindfulness meditation
course. They were screened and found to have no psychiatric or neurological disorders
and no prior exposure to meditation. All subjects were right handed with a mean age of
24.53 years.
The intervention was a blend of MBSR and acceptance and commitment therapy.
The course consisted of eight 1.5-hour classes and an expectation to practice on their own
45 minutes a day. The actual amount of time spent was self-reported. Three measures
were administered pre-and-post intervention; the POMS (assessment of six domains of
mood), the STAI (measures anxiety state and trait, or likelihood to respond to stimuli
with increased anxiety), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
[(CES-D), (a measure of degree of depression)]. They also underwent a resting fMRI
prior to the intervention and again after the mindfulness meditation course. The post-
intervention imaging consisted of both a resting and an active meditation scan.
The subjects demonstrated changes in connectivity between several regions of the
brain both in the pre-test/post-test imaging during rest and between the resting versus
meditation images acquired after eight weeks of mindfulness meditation training. The
neural connections were essentially re-wired in a way that favored self-regulation and
less anxiety and depression. All three measures showed significant changes; the CES-D
dramatically so, with scores dropping from 16.23 (+ 9.54) to 9 (+6.20) and trait anxiety
from 21.30 (+8.6) to 16.84 (+9.56), as well as the tension domain of the POMS from 8.00
(+3.36) to 5.38 (+5.18).
46
Again, the use of meditation for eight weeks improved scores on standard
measures and demonstrated favorable neuroplasticity. Previous studies reported on the
changes in the volume and characteristics of gray and white matter, but this was the first
study to investigate functional connectivity between several regions of the brain. Not
only do these findings represent an opportunity to treat mood disorders with meditation,
but may even begin to explain the physiological hardwiring needing readjustment in
serious psychological diagnoses such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
others, which are very difficult to treat with currently available therapies.
The study of neuroplasticity is in its beginning stages and the work requires
complex and expensive testing which explains the small sample sizes. Although there
were important changes associated with the meditation intervention, there was no control
group in this experiment. The authors point out that the mean pre-intervention scores on
the CES-D were positive for depression, as a score of 16 is the point at which depression
is diagnosed. This likely represented mild, sub-clinical depression in several subjects, but
contend that sub-clinical depression is very common in society and accurately represents
a segment of the population that presents in the primary care setting regularly. It would
have been interesting to test the subjects again at a much later date since mindfulness
meditation is a skill set that appears to improve over time.
Cost-Effectiveness of MBSR Interventions
A group of Canadian researchers, concerned about the increasing demands and
decreasing resources in healthcare, performed a prospective study of 1,730 patients who
had attended a MBSR program associated with their healthcare system, St. Joseph’s
Health Centre in Toronto, Canada (Knight, Bean, Wilton, & Lin, 2015). They were
especially interested in whether patients’ attendance of a MBSR program, known to
47
decrease stress, had an impact on health care consumption. Stress and its related
comorbidities, anxiety and depression, have been shown to be a risk factor for
approximately twice the health care consumption when compared to low-stress groups,
and these researchers wanted to shift at least partial responsibility to patients (Revicki et
al., 2012).
The study’s intervention group had attended a 10 week course consisting of a
screening conducted the first week to determine if there was sufficient interest and ability
to take part in the course. The next nine weeks involved a formal weekly class, three
hours in length as well as daily homework. The group also attended a one-time seven-
hour class. Of the 1,770 participants who had attended the course from May 2002 to
April 2007, 1,730 gave permission for their data to be used in the study (97.7%).
The initial computation was the pre-and-post healthcare consumption of the
MBSR group after all unique identifiers were removed. Comparison groups (or control
groups) were formed, matching three similar individuals to each MBSR patient using five
different databases. Variables considered were demographic information (age, gender,
neighborhood and neighborhood average income, rural versus urban areas, acuity level,
and number of insurance claims).
The comparison of healthcare consumption of the MBSR group with the controls
showed that the MBSR group consumed more than twice as much in healthcare dollars
before the intervention. When the MBSR group was measured pre-and-one-year-post
intervention, there was a decrease in cost of services of $244-$279 per participant,
representing an average of $375,000 for each 1,500 participants ($250). This effect was
no longer detected at a two-year comparison.
48
Therefore, it may be concluded that even though the savings seem small, it would
cover the small cost of the MBSR program and add to that the increased satisfaction by
patients to feel better and spend less time in health care clinics. A very important finding
in the study was the fact that the effect only lasted about a year. This needs to be explored
so mindfulness can become a lasting trait, thus providing a more lasting or even increased
effect.
It is important that the actual cost savings of the intervention were calculated just
to reassure healthcare administrators that at least MBSR was not a loss leader and may
likely be honed over the years to become more efficient and long-lasting as more
knowledge is obtained regarding the specifics of program design and how to capture the
best results. Prospective studies have an innate weakness of demonstrating association
rather than cause and effect, but much attention was given to removing bias with three
well-matched controls for each MBSR participant. Another issue is that the prospective
studies have limitations such as the ability to examine if and for how long, participants in
the MBSR program continued the practices learned. It is very likely that the loss of
savings in the second year was due to lack of continued practice, but there was no way of
knowing. Another limitation was that any out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare were not
accounted for.
Gaps in the Literature
Since MBSR has been utilized in the medical setting since 1979, there is a great
deal of literature available on the topic. However, use of MBSR and similar mindfulness
meditation techniques delivered by internet-connected devices, not closely managed by
clinicians, represents the most neglected area of research. Due to the ability to greatly
reduce the cost of treating patients with anxiety symptoms using electronic technology,
49
augmenting the available evidence-based therapies (CBT and pharmacologic agents), and
giving patients some autonomy and responsibility for their care, clearly this is the area
where more exploration is needed. This gap further strengthens the argument that this
DNP project is justified.
Strengths and Limitations in the Literature
Although the strengths and limitations in the literature were addressed with the
reporting of each study, a concise review will clarify this important aspect of the
literature review. Table 3 details this information.

Theoretical Framework
This DNP project was motivated by and built around the Recovery Alliance
Theory of Mental Health Nursing (RAT), a mid-range nursing theory, originally
proposed for application in mental health nursing settings (Shanley & Jubb-Shanley,
2007). Even its name reflects the power of relationship between patient and nurse to
effect recovery. Below is a diagrammatic view of the RAT in Figure 1. The theory is
characterized by six outer constructs (humanistic philosophy, common humanity,
empowerment, strengths focus, partnership relation, and recovery) which underpin the
theory and are described in Table 4. There are three concepts that describe the way the
constructs are translated into nursing practice, a working alliance, coping, and self-
responsibility/control and are summarized in Table 5.

The Constructs of the Recovery Alliance Theory (Shanley & Jubb-Shanley, 2007)
Constructs Definition
Humanistic Philosophy Reflective of a move away from the medical model
to humanistic philosophy:
 Individuals are social animals and share a
common humanity.
 Individuals have the potential for growth
through awareness of and interaction with
self and others.
 The individual’s growth is enhanced by a
respectful approach in validating the
person’s ability to deal competently with his
or her own life experiences.
 Individuals have the ability to make choices
and to exercise control in decisions
affecting their lives.
 Individuals cannot be categorized in that
they are composed of many different facets
of which none stands alone.
Recovery Nurses participate in helping patients believe they
are more than a diagnosis. Together they explore
problems, understand the power of a willingness to
change, and optimistically use their strengths to
address problems. Each small step is celebrated,
building optimism for recovery in the patient.
Partnership Relation The nurse and patient enter an equal partnership,
characterized by everyday speech, free-flowing
dialogue, and a holistic approach to care. Patients
are seen as possessing the skills, or the ability to
learn them, that will lead them to cope with mental
illness successfully. In the end, the power to accept
or reject nursing advice lies with the patient alone,
and that is respected.
Strengths Focus There is concentration on patients’ strengths rather
than a medical diagnosis, which offers recovery as a
real option.
Empowerment Focus on a medical diagnosis is not helpful to
patients. Instead, the patients’ own understanding of
their mental health concerns is the starting point, and
from there active participation and decision-making
is facilitated by the nurse.
Common Humanity There is an emphasis on the fact that nurses and
patients stand on equal ground, that of being human,
with the potential to understand the other’s
perspective, concentrating more on how we are alike
rather than how we are different.
53
Table 5
The Concepts of the Recovery Alliance Theory (Shanley & Jubb-Shanley, 2007)
The Concepts of the Recovery Alliance Theory
Concept Definition
Working Alliance  Everyday speech, avoiding
professional jargon, enhances
approachability, and reinforces a
common humanity with patients.
 Variable context and times of
interactions, which may not always
occur at a healthcare facility. A home
visit or meeting at a public location
may increase the nurse’s insights
regarding the patient.
 Self-disclosure refers to the ability to
interact in a non-judgmental manner
with patients, even sharing some
individual information, to help a
patient feel understood.
 Unscripted dialogue is used as
appropriate to address irregularities in
patient behaviors or location of patient
interactions as an opportunity to effect
change.
 Holistic perspective refers to being
open to the patient as a human being
without limiting interactions to a
narrow definition of providing nursing
care. More information about a patient
leads to a sense of common humanity.
Coping Individuals adopt strategies to cope with
stress. They may manage, alter, or regulate
their emotional responses.
Self-Responsibility/Control Opposite of the medical model which views
mental illness as occurring as a result of some
sort of pathology (external locus of control),
patients are encouraged to accept
responsibility for their own well-being
(internal locus of control).
54
Studies Using the Recovery Alliance Theory of Mental Health Nursing
Treatment of mental illness has changed over the years, but perhaps one of the
most refreshing changes is a move from the medical model of treatment of a disease,
which focuses on a diagnosis, to treatment of the patient holistically. Gandi and Wai
(2010) designed a three-month intervention, Partnership-in-Coping, to address mental
health needs in a group of patients being treated at the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric
Hospital in Kaduna, Nigeria.
The participants, 56 of 230 in-patients and out-patients, were randomized to
receive either the Partnership-in-Coping intervention or to receive treatment as usual. The
groups consisted of 29 males and 27 females with schizophrenia, depression, mania,
anxiety disorders, and drug-induced psychosis, all equally distributed between the two
groups. Participants’ ages ranged roughly from 16-60 and were evenly split between
inpatients and outpatients.
Ten research assistants provided most of the care rendered to the intervention
group. Interestingly, these ten individuals were selected from among the multidisciplinary
facility staff after scores on the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL R-IV)
demonstrated a “willing attitude and a teachable disposition” (Gandi & Wai, 2010, p.
325). Study participants were measured once, at the end of the study using the well-
validated Mental Health Recovery Measure (MHRM), a self-evaluation tool that
quantifies recovery from mental illness with possible scores of 0 (no recovery) to 120
(high degree of recovery).
After orientation of the research assistants, they acted as the patients’ advocates
by partnering with them as they met with appropriate healthcare professionals regarding
medication regimens and attending both one-on-one and group counseling sessions. The
55
essence of the intervention was the dynamic partnering relationship between the research
assistants and the participants. After the three-month period, all 56 participants were
assessed using the MHRM.
The Partnership in Coping intervention group showed dramatic improvement
when compared to the treatment as usual group. The mean score for the experimental
group was 97.79 versus 34.93 in the control group (p<.001). This finding appears to
validate the efficacy of structuring interventions in mental healthcare consistent with the
Recovery Alliance Theory’s constructs (humanistic philosophy, common humanity,
empowerment, strengths focus, partnership relation, and recovery).
Although the researchers were very careful to match the two groups as to age,
religion, education, and main diagnosis, a definite strength of the study, there was no pre-
test MHRM measurement of the control group. Therefore, one must assume that because
the groups were statistically homogeneous, they would have started the study with
statistically non-differing baseline scores, a study limitation. However, a strength of the
study was the careful choosing of research assistants using the ProQOL R-IV, so as to
expose each participant in the intervention group to the same degree of quality partner,
demonstrating characteristics the researchers believed to be essential in administering
their intervention.
The originators of the RAT, Shanley and Jubb-Shanley (2007) translated their
theory into a method of mental health nursing practice, Coping Focus Counselling (CFC)
(Shanley & Jubb-Shanley, 2012). In this paper, they note that there are several counseling
techniques, each with their strengths and weaknesses, but they proposed integration of
several widely-used techniques (i e. Gestalt, CBT, Client-centered Therapy, and
Attachment Theory), removing the professional jargon (instead, they value everyday
56
speech) in order to promote insight in patients’ symptoms and behaviors rather than
grouping them in a diagnostic category as is promoted in the medical model. Patients
begin to understand that the nature of humanity involves struggle and the counselor
(mental health nurse) fosters self-efficacy in the development of coping by cultivation of
an authentic alliance-type relationship.
The ultimate goal of CFC was to facilitate productive coping strategies centered
around an individual’s mental health concern(s). Emphasis was placed on the patient’s
coping concern and was never labeled as a diagnosis, thus amenable to learning and
unlearning, which was empowering and emphasizes an internal locus of control. A
patient’s reluctance to engage in therapy was seen as a form of coping (though it may be
mal-adaptive), and not as non-adherence or some other negative term often used by
providers. The working alliance was characterized by interactions between two equals,
rather than healthcare provider (superior) to patient (inferior), and patients’ coping
strategies are explored and understood by this therapeutic dyad, providing the option for
patients to choose more productive coping patterns.
The CALM Project was developed using the RAT constructs as the rationale for
many of the elements such as project topic, content, population, and setting based on the
project administrator’s own clinical experience as a nurse practitioner providing primary
care in an internal medicine clinic. As a group, patients with anxiety generally present
initially, as described earlier, with somatic complaints. Eventually, once physical
pathology is ruled out, patients are usually quick to agree that their pattern of coping with
life’s uncertainties is to worry and experience anxiety. All the barriers to counseling
and/or pharmacotherapy described in the literature can be confirmed by this project
administrator’s own experience.

The RAT was based on a concept of a recovery-based approach to the treatment
of mental disorders using a working alliance between the nurse and patient. A search for
evidence-based alternative or adjunctive therapies that could be initiated in a busy
primary care office favored mindfulness-based meditation as a logical choice due to low
cost and no need for additional staff, such as would be the case with other treatments (i e.
acupuncture, massage, in-house behavioral health counseling, etc.). Figure 2
demonstrates how the project aligns with the constructs of the theoretical framework.

Summary
This literature review represents research of the mindfulness movement from its
infancy beginning in 1979, with Jon Kabat-Zinn’s MBSR program at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School, to the most current work involving highly technological
methods in an attempt to understand the neuroplasticity observed in practitioners of
MBSR and similar mindfulness meditation techniques. After years of research involving
a wide variety of populations, settings, and study methods, the research bears out the
efficacy of mindfulness meditation as a therapeutic technique which has earned its place
in the practice of evidence-based healthcare.
However, adoption of MBSR by primary care clinicians was lagging due to the
lack of a simple, cost-effective way to introduce the technique to appropriate patients
within the constraints of a time-limited office visit. Therefore, it is essential that there is
more testing of computer-based apps, presented to patients in their PCP’s office,
requiring just a few minutes of clinician time. This was where the justification of the
CALM Project lies.

Chapter III
Project Description
Anxiety disorders are common and costly, both in the degree of patient suffering
and in dollars spent annually treating the disorder. The purpose of this DNP project was
to measure the effect of the use of a computer-based mindfulness meditation app on
anxiety levels in adult primary care patients. Also, since there is mixed evidence
indicating a positive dose response to this intervention, this project included tracking of
client usage of the program to recognize any relationship between amount of time the app
was used and improvement in anxiety levels at the end of the project. Qualitative
feedback from participants regarding their experience of using the app was also of
interest to determine feasibility of the intervention, and learn of any common technical
problems.
Hypothesized outcomes are as follows:
1. Use of the app (Calm.com) would reduce anxiety levels in participants.
2. Due to the mixed data on dose response, no hypothesis was made.
3. There would be important themes in participant feedback that could
improve on aspects of the intervention for future use.
Project Implementation
This DNP project was a longitudinal study collecting a mix of quantitative and
qualitative data. Prior to implementation of the project, Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approval was granted by the project administrator’s university. Permission was obtained
from the project clinical site.
The project administrator first collaborated with the chief medical officer of an
urban primary care practice located in Southeastern North Carolina to establish a
60
relationship and buy-in to perform the project at this site. A meeting was scheduled for
the project administrator to meet the clinic providers during which a Power Point
presentation describing the project was shown. Flyers promoting the benefits of
mindfulness meditation on anxiety and related symptoms were posted throughout the
facility, giving patients the opportunity to self-refer as participants. Clinicians also
provided contact information of patients with which the project was discussed during an
office visit, with a mutual decision made by clinician and client to participate. The project
coordinator was on site weekly to answer questions, enroll subjects, and to collect pre-
and-post data for six weeks during March and April of 2017.
Setting
The CALM project setting was a federally-funded urban primary healthcare clinic
supported and subsidized by the Bureau of Primary Care. This clinic offers primary care,
dental care, and behavioral health services to patients of all ages. The clinical staff
included three family physicians, three family nurse practitioners, one pediatrician, two
licensed medical social workers, one psychiatrist, and a staff of dentists, dental assistants,
dental hygienists, lab technicians, pharmacists and pharmacy assistants.
Sample
Subjects were recruited using posted flyers as well as by recommendation from
their PCP. There was no attempt to select subjects based on any formal psychiatric
diagnosis, but rather, individuals who described themselves with anxiety symptoms of
any degree were accepted. The age range of participants was 23-67 and overwhelmingly
female (F=14, M=1).
61
Project Design
This project was designed as a pilot study (pre-test/post-test) to determine the
feasibility of using a smart phone, computer, or tablet to educate interested individuals
with symptoms of anxiety in the primary care setting on mindfulness meditation. The
education was delivered by a computer-based smart phone app, Calm.com.
Complimentary vouchers supplied by Calm.com provided free access to the app for 30
days.
The app provided a 28-day course in the use of mindfulness meditation with
opportunities to practice using guided meditation. Sessions varied in length from 9-18
minutes each. The app screen displays are composed of a number of calming visual
scenes, complete with accompanying sound and motion, that may be changed by the user
according to preference or need for variety. There are other guided meditations on a
variety of topics available in case a participant wanted to supplement the basic course.
There are sleep aid features using guided meditation and a feature known as sleep stories,
bedtime stories for adults. Time-keeping is done automatically by the app, so the inherent
limitation of patient self-report regarding time spent using the intervention was averted.
Protection of Human Subjects
Prior to the start of the project, the project administrator completed an orientation
to the clinic site and completed their HIPAA course. During enrollment, subjects signed a
consent to engage in the project. Questions were elicited and answered by the project
administrator. All participants were given full disclosure that participation was voluntary
and discontinuation would be an option at any time. It was emphasized that the project
administrator would not have access to their medical records or any private information
about the participants, nor would the project administrator share any information with
62
clinic providers or staff. It was also stressed that the information collected during the
project would not become a part of the patient’s medical record. As a token of
appreciation for participation, a $10 gift card was given to each participant.
All data was locked in a drawer in the project administrator’s office. Participants
were reassured that the reporting of any data would be presented as aggregate data only.
There would be no means by which any individual participant could be identified.
Instrument
The instrument chosen to measure anxiety was the Generalized Anxiety Disorder
7-Item Scale (GAD-7) created by Spritzer, Kroenke, Williams, and Lowe (2006). The
scale is shown in Figure 3. It has become a very well-accepted measure used in many
practice settings and is in the public domain. There are seven questions, and a level of
difficulty that any selected item(s) interfered with “ability to do your work, take care of
things at home, or get along with other people” (Spitzer et al., 2006, p. 1094). Scoring of
the scale is displayed in Table 6. The internal consistency of the tool is excellent
(Cronbach α = .92). The procedural validity and test-retest reliability were assessed by
calculation of the intraclass correlation coefficient (0.83). Sensitivity and specificity
were maximal (89% and 82% respectively) at a score of ten. Therefore, the authors
recommended using a score of > 10 as the marker for the need for further evaluation
and/or treatment.

Data Collection
All data from The CALM Project was collected by the project administrator
between March 15 and April 26, 2017. The majority of the data was collected during a
face-to-face meeting, but in several cases data was collected by telephone due to
participants’ inability to come in to the clinic. Demographic data included the age and
gender of the participant as well as a preferred method of contact. The GAD-7 was
administered at the enrollment visit and again at the end of the project. A questionnaire
was also administered at the end of the study to collect qualitative data regarding the
study as well as time spent using the app.
Data Analysis
Data from the study was initially recorded in an excel spreadsheet by the project
administrator. Descriptive statistics were calculated on the GAD-7 pre-scores, post-
scores, and difference score (i e. post-score minus pre-score). Pre-and-post scores were
compared using the paired t-test. To test for associations between minutes used and
difference in scores, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. P-values less than
0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis was performed using
SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Budget
The budget included travel from project administrator’s home to the clinical site,
although no mileage was recorded. There was minimal cost for printing to create patient
packets. Gift cards to patients at study’s end equaled $150, or $10 for each of the
participants completing the project. Statistician’s fee was $250 dollars.
65
Limitations
Improvisation regarding enrollment and data collection occurred in a few
instances when the participant could not meet with the study administrator in person. Due
to limitations in time to complete the study, there was no post-study follow up to
document endurance of the effect of the intervention.
Summary
The need to know if primary care patients suffering from anxiety symptoms
would use a smart phone app to learn mindfulness meditation as a possible solution to
symptom relief is needed information as there are known barriers to other therapies. New,
practical evidence-based interventions will be critical as we continue to see the gap
increasing in demand for services and diminishing resources.
The theoretical framework chosen for the CALM Project fits well to this patient
population. The relationship between the PCP and the patient with anxiety is indeed a
partnership between two human beings who can work together to accomplish coping
strategies to life events that are more useful than anxiety and panic. Patients, especially
those who have experienced these symptoms for long periods of time, or believe that “it’s
genetic”, need to know that recovery is indeed possible and that the solution may lie
within an app on their smart phone.

Chapter IV
Results
The CALM Project was designed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of
using a smart phone app (Calm.com) as an educational tool to teach mindfulness
meditation to primary care patients suffering from anxiety. The study participants were
given free access to the app for one month, with instructions to access a daily lesson
lasting just a few minutes for 28 days. The vouchers were supplied by Calm.com, but this
is a routine practice, so clinicians can introduce the app without cost to patients they
discern are candidates for mindfulness meditation.
Sample Characteristics
Twenty primary care patients identified interest in being a participant in the
CALM Project. Three patients were lost to follow up, meaning no post-test data was
obtained (after several attempts to contact). Two patients expressed interest during a visit
with their primary care clinician, but failed to respond to attempts made by the project
administrator to enroll using their preferred method of contact. The final count of
participants with pre-and-post data was 15, or a 75% completion rate. The population
consisted of 14 females and one male. The age range was 23-67 years, with a mean age
of 46.7 years.
Major Findings
Quantitative Results
There were statistically significant findings in several analyses. First, the average
total GAD-7 score decreased from a pre-test mean score of 10.2 (SD 5.5) to post-test
mean score of 5.9 (SD 3.4) with a p-value of 0.01. There was also significant reduction
of scores with regard to each question of the GAD-7 except Question 2 and Question 5.
67
No significant change was noted in level of difficulty experienced by participants
regarding doing their work, taking care of things at home, or getting along with other
people. The results are shown in Table 7.

Qualitative Results
The qualitative data analysis was performed in three steps: (1) the data was
organized by question, (2) analysis of trends and patterns emerged allowing a
compression of the data due to homogeneity, and (3) a synthesis of the findings was
reported (Seers, 2012).
Overall, the participants found the app helpful. Learning to relax was the
predominant theme as to the manner in which the app specifically helped. Participants
also commented on the value of short, structured sessions. Most of the participants did
not experience technical difficulties using the app, but there was an issue with some
participants of not being able to easily move from screen to screen. For a compilation of
results, see Table 9.

Summary of Results
The project questions were all answered by the conclusion of the project. The use
of a web-based computer app was significantly effective at reducing GAD-7 scores
(p=0.01) in primary care patients experiencing anxiety. Even though there was
improvement in GAD-7 scores in participants associated with more use of the app, the
improvements did not reach statistical significance. Important themes were noted with
analysis of the qualitative data. The app was found to be helpful by all participants and
relief of anxiety was the predominant theme. Although most participants experienced no
technical issues with the app, some participants found it difficult to move about within
the app with ease.
72
Chapter V
Discussion
The purpose of the CALM Project was to test the feasibility and efficacy of using
a computer-based app to teach primary care patients to manage anxiety by using
mindfulness meditation. Another point of interest was whether this population
demonstrated a dose response, meaning, more use of the app would affect more change.
Finally, participants’ feedback regarding use of the app would provide more
understanding of their experiences and advice regarding future use of the intervention.
Implication of Findings
The literature was rich with documentation of successful interventions using
mindfulness meditation to relieve anxiety in many settings and populations. This was an
important motivating factor involving the choice of intervention to test with primary care
patients. Just as expected, there was significant reduction in anxiety as measured by the
GAD-7. There was a trend toward association with more use of the app as a factor for
decreasing anxiety, but the association did not reach statistical significance. This mirrors
the findings in the literature. The qualitative data demonstrated feasibility and acceptance
of this novel intervention and relief of anxiety symptoms was significantly experienced
by participants. As with any technology, there can be glitches, however the majority of
participants experienced no problems.
Application to Theoretical Framework
The positive results seen in the CALM Project reinforce the constructs of the
Recovery Alliance Theory (RAT) (Shanley & Jubb-Shanley, 2007). Likely more impact
will be experienced ongoing, as the project administrator uses the app with her own
primary care patients, with which she has already built a partnership relation. Now that
73
the theory has been used as a guiding framework for the CALM Project, the value of the
constructs is clear. Helping patients to see that recovery is possible and empowering them
to change their coping responses by concentrating on their strengths is the basis of
holistic nursing care. The only obvious conflict is with the construct of humanistic
philosophy versus a medical model diagnostic code as without it, there would be no
reimbursement for care. However, this aspect of the care can easily be minimized during
contact with patients.
Limitations
Limitations of this pilot project were consistent with many other studies described
in the literature review. The sample size was small and over-populated with female
participants, therefore not adequately powered to answer the question of if there is a dose
response effect. There was no control group, therefore no randomization was possible.
The sample could be described as a convenience sample and participants interacted with
an outsider rather than their own PCP. The questions eliciting qualitative data could have
been asked in a way to glean a deeper understanding of participants’ lived experience.
Even though the app has the capacity to track usage (time used in hours and minutes and
number of sessions) and share this data with others easily by email, this feature was not
used, due to the need for simplicity in this pilot study. Participant self-report was the
method used instead, which is known to be less accurate. Technical difficulties
experienced by some participants likely influenced usage and possibly impacted
outcomes.
74
Implications for Nursing
This DNP project demonstrated the value of a brief mindfulness meditation
intervention, introduced in the primary care setting with just a few minutes of instruction.
This translates into a meaningful treatment option to suggest in patients with anxiety.
Recommendations
This intervention is not just for patients, but for anyone struggling with stress and
anxiety. A future project involving a mix of healthcare workers is warranted. Other
populations of interest may include caregivers and patients experiencing the stress and
grief of the loss of a spouse or close loved one.
Modifications to the method of a repeat project are suggested. Taking the time to
arrange for sharing of usage data would be quite valuable as the question of the existence
of a dose response has not been answered conclusively. Gathering this data electronically
would be highly superior to participant self-report. Also, since some participants
experienced technical problems using the app, orientation to the content available,
navigation from screen to screen, and assistance in setting up preferences would most
likely decrease the likelihood of most problems.
Conclusion
The use of mindfulness meditation education, offered inexpensively using a
computer app, is a viable strategy for treating anxiety in many patients encountered in
primary care. The intervention demonstrated a significant decrease in GAD-7 scores and
proved to be feasible and well-adopted by project participants.
