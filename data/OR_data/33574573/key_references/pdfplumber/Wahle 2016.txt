Abstract
Background: Depression is a burdensome, recurring mental health disorder with high prevalence. Even in developed countries,
patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional
for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in
monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention
support.
Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information
to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention
delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms.
Methods: A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS),
collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy.
Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject’s preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to
time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9)
to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis
was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based
on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models
used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery.
Results: A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for ≥2 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9≥11) at baseline and
adherence ≥8 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between
adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=−.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples
(n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9≥11, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted
in 60.1% and 59.1% accuracy, respectively.
Conclusions: Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver
context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended
period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features
extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for
the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to
proof causation, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide
context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states.
