Abstract
Background: Available smartphone-based interventions for depression predominantly use evidence-based strategies from
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), but patient engagement and reported effect sizes are small. Recently, studies have demonstrated
that smartphone-based interventions combining CBT with gamified approach-avoidance bias modification training (AAMT) can
foster patient engagement and reduce symptoms of several mental health problems.
Objective: Based on these findings, we developed a gamified smartphone-based intervention, mentalis Phoenix (MT-Phoenix),
and hypothesized the program would both engage patients and produce preliminary evidence for the reduction of depressive
symptoms.
Methods: To test this hypothesis, we evaluated MT-Phoenix in a randomized controlled pilot trial including 77 individuals with
elevated depression scores (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores ≥5). Participants were either instructed to train for 14 days
with MT-Phoenix or assigned to a waitlist control condition. Engagement with the intervention was measured by assessing usage
data. The primary outcome was reduction in depressive symptom severity at postassessment.
Results: Data from this pilot trial shows that participants in the intervention group used the smartphone-based intervention for
46% of all days (6.4/14) and reported a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms than did participants in the control
condition (F =19.34; P=.001), with a large effect size (d=1.02). Effects were sustained at a 3-month follow-up.

Conclusions: A gamified smartphone-based intervention combining CBT with AAMT may foster patient engagement and
effectively target depressive symptoms. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in a phase 3 trial
using clinical samples. Moreover, the intervention should be compared to active control conditions.
