ABSTRACT
The Effects of Using Pacifica on Depressed Patients
by Daniel Bustillos
Depression is a psychiatric condition that affects millions of Americans each year. It is a concern
in today’s society that needs to be treated and addressed with more care. According to the World
Health Organization, major depression is the second largest health care problem worldwide when
it comes to disability. Cognitive behavioral therapy has demonstrated positive outcomes in
W
patients with depression. With advanced technology, millions of people are using the Internet to
find a solution to their depressive symptoms. Pacifica is a mobile application that offers
E
relaxation activities such as deep breathing, calming strategies, positive visualization,
I
mindfulness, muscle relaxation, visualization, caVlming sounds, guided meditation, support
groups, and daily tracking (Pacifica, 2017). A research project was completed by asking 30
E
individuals to participate in the study. Twenty-four of the 30 participated, but only 19 completed
R
the pretest and posttest. The Beck Depression Inventory was analyzed pre- and post-intervention,
P
along with a paired samples t-test and descriptive statistics.

Effects of Using Pacifica on Depressed Patients
Depression has been known about for years; in the past, it was viewed as a demonic
disorder by many. One in every six Americans suffers from the mood disorder, which can lead to
the development of medical conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease and, even
more seriously, suicide. Unfortunately, only 50% of people suffering from major depression
receive treatment, and only 20% follow the guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association
(Andrew, 2016). Various research articles have concluded that patients with depression have a
W
shorter life span and are more likely to partake in risky behavior. Various approaches to the
treatment of depression have been attempted, and cognitivEe behavioral therapy has demonstrated
positive results. A new approach to cognitive behavioral therapy has been analyzed based on the
I
V
use of the Internet and a mobile application. Advanced practice registered nurses are in a great
position to help alleviate the shortage of mEental health providers due their diverse scope of
practice.

Chapter I: Background and Significance

Background and Significance
Depression is a psychiatric condition that affects an estimated 17.6 million Americans
each year (“Depression and Suicide Risk,” 2014). It is a concern in today’s society that needs to
be treated and addressed with more care; a great number of patients are living with psychiatric
conditions that involve daily suicidal ideation, causing them to move in and out of psychiatric
facilities. There is also a lack of psychiatric providers and therapies to help patients diagnosed
with depression. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth
edition), depression is defined as a loss of interest or pleasure in the activities of daily living for
more than two weeks (Reynolds & Kamphause, 2013).

Five of the following nine symptoms need to be present nearly every day in order for one
to be diagnosed with depression. The symptoms include depressed mood or irritability, decreased
interest or pleasure, significant weight changes (+ /- 5%), changes in sleep, changes in activity,
loss of energy, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, diminished concentration, and suicidal ideation
(Reynolds & Kamphause, 2013). When depression becomes too strong for a patient to bear,
many times, he or she will resort to what is, in his or her eyes, the only solution: suicide.
Depression is the psychiatric condition that is most commonly correlated with suicide.

Assessment of the Phenomena (Problem Statement)
Depression is an issue of concern that has a great economic burden; it shortens the lives
E
of the people diagnosed and results in a high suicide rate among individuals. Depression has a
I
great impact on the economy of the United StateVs. One clinical trial analyzed the impact of
depression on quality-adjusted life expectancy (QUALE). The research concluded that at age 18,
E
QUALE was 28 years higher for depressed adults and 56.8 years higher for non-depressed
R
adults. In essence, there was a 28-year loss for patients with depression starting at age 18 (Zack,
P
Thompson, Crosby, & Gottesman, 2015). According to the World Health Organization (2018),
major depression is the leading health care problem worldwide when it comes to disability.
Major depression affects approximately 17% of individuals during their lifetimes. Sadly,
approximately 15% of all depressive patients will commit suicide over a period of 10–20 years.
Antidepressant medications remain the primary treatment for depression. However, meta-
analysis has demonstrated that antidepressants only have beneficial effects for severely
depressed patients (Jakobsen, Hansen, Storebø, Simonsen, & Gluud, 2011). Data such as this
emphasize the importance of developing new research and treatments for patients with
