Abstract
Background: Most people with mental health disorders fail to receive timely access to adequate care. US Hispanic/Latino
individuals are particularly underrepresented in mental health care and are historically a very difficult population to recruit into
clinical trials; however, they have increasing access to mobile technology, with over 75% owning a smartphone. This technology
has the potential to overcome known barriers to accessing and utilizing traditional assessment and treatment approaches.
Objective: This study aimed to compare recruitment and engagement in a fully remote trial of individuals with depression who
either self-identify as Hispanic/Latino or not. A secondary aim was to assess treatment outcomes in these individuals using three
different self-guided mobile apps: iPST (based on evidence-based therapeutic principles from problem-solving therapy, PST),
Project Evolution (EVO; a cognitive training app based on cognitive neuroscience principles), and health tips (a health information
app that served as an information control).
Methods: We recruited Spanish and English speaking participants through social media platforms, internet-based advertisements,
and traditional fliers in select locations in each state across the United States. Assessment and self-guided treatment was conducted
on each participant's smartphone or tablet. We enrolled 389 Hispanic/Latino and 637 non-Hispanic/Latino adults with mild to
moderate depression as determined by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score≥5 or related functional impairment.
Participants were first asked about their preferences among the three apps and then randomized to their top two choices. Outcomes
were depressive symptom severity (measured using PHQ-9) and functional impairment (assessed with Sheehan Disability Scale),
collected over 3 months. Engagement in the study was assessed based on the number of times participants completed active
surveys.
Results: We screened 4502 participants and enrolled 1040 participants from throughout the United States over 6 months, yielding
a sample of 348 active users. Long-term engagement surfaced as a key issue among Hispanic/Latino participants, who dropped
from the study 2 weeks earlier than their non-Hispanic/Latino counterparts (P<.02). No significant differences were observed
for treatment outcomes between those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or not. Although depressive symptoms improved (beta=–2.66,
P=.006) over the treatment course, outcomes did not vary by treatment app.
Conclusions: Fully remote mobile-based studies can attract a diverse participant pool including people from traditionally
underserved communities in mental health care and research (here, Hispanic/Latino individuals). However, keeping participants
engaged in this type of “low-touch” research study remains challenging. Hispanic/Latino populations may be less willing to use

mobile apps for assessing and managing depression. Future research endeavors should use a user-centered design to determine
the role of mobile apps in the assessment and treatment of depression for this population, app features they would be interested
in using, and strategies for long-term engagement.
