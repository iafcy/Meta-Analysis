Abstract
Background: Thispaper reports the results of a pilot randomized controlled trial comparingthe delivery modality
(mobile phone/tablet or fixed computer) ofa cognitivebehavioural therapy interventionfor thetreatment of
depression. The aim was to establish whether a previously validated computerized program (The Sadness Program)
remained efficacious when delivered via a mobile application.
Method: 35 participants were recruited with Major Depression (80%female) and randomly allocated to accessthe
program using a mobile app (oneither a mobile phone or iPad) or a computer. Participantscompleted6 lessons,
weekly homework assignments, and received weekly emailcontact from a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist until
completion oflesson2. After lesson 2emailcontact was only provided in response to participant request, or in
response to a deterioration inpsychologicaldistressscores. The primary outcome measure was thePatient Health
Questionnaire 9(PHQ-9).Ofthe35 participants recruited, 68.6% completed6 lessons and 65.7% completed the
3-months follow up. Attrition was handled using mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA.
Results: Both theMobile and Computer Groups were associated with statistically significantly benefits in thePHQ-9
atpost-test. At3monthsfollow up, thereduction seen for both groups remained significant.
Conclusions: These results provideevidence to indicatethatdelivering a CBTprogram using a mobile application,
can result in clinically significant improvements inoutcomesfor patients with depression.

Descriptionoftreatment
The Get Happy Program was based on the principles of
CBTand is aversion of the previously evaluated Sadness
Program [11,12]. The program consisted of 6 lessons
conducted over an 8 week period. The lessons read like
a comic book and participants follow the story of Jess, a
comic character that has depression, and through her
story learn how she comes to manage her symptoms,
and participants can then apply these principles to their
own life. The size of the font was adapted for the mobile

relevant homework activities and review the lesson.
Additional resources, such as information on assertive- Cliniciancontact

participant’s experiences were also available Figure 2, ician, until completion of Lesson 2 because our previous
Figure3. research study has found that additional clinician sup-
port does not add any further benefit to participants
[13]. Following this, the only clinical contact was when
the participant initiated contact, or when a clinician
instigated contact due to a deterioration in the K-10
score [23]. The K-10 is a measure of psychological dis-
tress andwascompleted priortobeginning eachlesson.
Outcomemeasures
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [24] is a
brief 9-item self-report scale that measures each of the
DSM-IVcriteria for MDD with scores ranging from 0 to
27. Participants rate the frequency of symptoms over the
last fortnight on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3
(nearlyeveryday),where1=severaldays,2=morethan
half of the days. A PHQ-9 score of ≥10 is used as a clin-
icalcut-offfor probable DSM-IVdiagnosisofMDD[25].
ThePHQ-9hasbeen shown to have goodsensitivity and
specificity [26]andexcellentreliabilityandvalidity [24].
The Kessler 10-item Psychological Distress scale (K-10)
[23] is a measure of non-specific psychological distress
over the past 14 days. Scores can range from 10 to 50,
with higher scores indicating higher distress. The K-10
has good psychometric properties and can discriminate
between cases and non-cases of DSM-IVaffective disor-
ders[27].
Beck’s Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) [28]
