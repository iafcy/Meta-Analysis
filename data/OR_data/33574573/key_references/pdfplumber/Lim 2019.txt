Background: Loneliness is an emerging issue for young people, but yet many
interventions to address loneliness in this group focus on providing social opportunities.
While these sorts of interventions may appear to increase social connections, loneliness
is more related to quality rather than quantity of social relationships. Thus, interventions
addressing loneliness should focus on maximizing the quality of current relationships.
Together with youth consumers both with mental ill health and those without, we
developed a digital smartphone application (app) called +Connect. The 6-week program
