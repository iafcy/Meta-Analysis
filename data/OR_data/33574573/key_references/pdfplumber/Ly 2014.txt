that could interfere with the treatment (eg, bipolar dis-
order or schizophrenia, assessed during a clinical inter-
view), (6) not having other primary medical problems
which would need other treatments first hand, (7) not
having severe alcohol problems, (8) no assessed risk of
being suicidal (see below for details) and (9) suffering
from major depression according to the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV, with at

Treatment credibility
To measure participants’ perceived treatment credibility,
Borkovec and Nau’s Credibility/expectancy scale
(C-Scale)43 was used. The C-scale measures the way in
which the participants view the logic of the treatment
(credibility) and the improvements that can be achieved
(expectancy) and includes five items on a 10-point scale.
Assessment was made after the first weekoftreatment.
Administration format of self-report measures
We used an online platform to administer the BDI-II,
PHQ-9, BAI, QOLI, AAQ-II and the C-scale. Previous psy-
chometric research has validated Internet-administration
of self-rating scales for depression, quality of life and
anxiety.44–46
Procedureand design
For those participants included in the study, the results
from the online screening were used as pretreatment
assessment. After the recruitment, the participants were
allocated using an online randomisation tool (http://
www.random.org), handled by an independent person
whowas separate from the staff conducting the study.

PHQ-9. The participants were considered to suffer from
higher severity of depression if they scored ≥10 on
PHQ-9 and if they fulfilled the criteria for an ongoing
primary diagnosis of major depression of moderatechar-
acter (n=51). Participants not fulfilling these criteria
were considered to suffer from lower severity of depres-
sion (n=30).
Data analysis
All the analyses were performed using SPSS V.20 (SPSS,
Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Independent t tests and
χ² tests were used to test for group differences in demo-
graphics, pretreatment data and recovery rates. In order
to adhere to the intention-to-treat principle, the con-
tinuous outcome variables were analysed using mixed
effects models, given their ability to handle missing
data.51Alltheanalysesusedmaximumlikelihoodestima-
tion. Random intercept models were selected for all
measures. Differences between the BA treatment and
the mindfulness treatment were primarily investigated by
modelling interaction effects of group and time. For the
PHQ-9 and the AAQ-II, where weekly measures were
available, the covariance between the random intercept
and slope was not significant, and therefore was not
included in the model. Hence, a random intercept
model was also used for these measures. Between-group
differences at post-treatment were analysed using inde-
pendent t tests. Power analysis indicated an 89% chance
of detecting a between-group effect size of d=0.60
(α level=0.05, one tailed). Within-group and between-group

unimproved in the data analysis. In the 6-month
follow-up, 69 participants from the two treatment groups
(totalling 85.2%) provided data on the self-report mea-
sures, with a distribution of 35 participants from the BA
group and 34 participants from the mindfulness group.
Fifty-nine participants (72.8%) were reached for the M.I.
N.I. telephone interview. Once again, those unreachable
were classified as unimproved in the data analysis.
In astudy byAnderssonetal,53the numberofpostings
in a discussion group was used as a process factor.
Therefore, we defined adherence to treatment as the
number of weekly reflections the participants sent to
theirtherapist.Inorder tobeconsidered asacompleted
week, at least one reflection had to have been sent to
the therapist during that week. Of the 81 participants,
57 (70%) succeeded to adhere to all the 8weeks.
Of these, 25 (63%) were in the BA group and 32 (78%)
were in the mindfulness group. No significant difference
in adherence was found between the two groups
(χ2 (N=81, df=1)=2.35, p=1.00). The participants suc-
ceeded to adhere to, on an average, 6weeks (M=5.8,
SD=2.47).
Primaryoutcome measures
No significant interaction effects of group and time on
the PHQ-9 and the BDI-II were found between the
groups, either from pretreatment to post-treatment
(PHQ-9 (F(1, 501.47)=0.28, p=0.60); BDI-II (F(1, 74.11)
=0.28, p=0.60)), or from pretreatment to the 6-month
follow-up (PHQ-9 (F(1, 571.49)=0.36, p=0.55); BDI-II
(F(1, 147.96)=0.09, p=0.77)). However, as evident from
table 2, large within-group effect sizes were found on
PHQ-9 and BDI-II, between pretreatment and post-
treatment, as well as between pretreatment to the
6-month follow-up. This was the case for the BA treat-
mentand the mindfulnesstreatment.
Subgroup analyses
For the participants (total n=51, BA n=23, MF n=28) suf-
fering from high severity of depression (≥10 on the
PHQ-9 and an ongoing primary diagnosis of major
depression of moderate character), a mixed-effects
model analysis on the PHQ-9 revealed significant inter-
action effects of group and time in favour for the BA
group from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up, but not
on pretreatment to post-treatment. Thus, the results
indicated a difference between the BA group and the
mindfulness group from pretreatment to 6-month
follow-up (F(1, 362.1)=5.2, p<0.05) for the participants
suffering from higher severity of depression. As seen in
table 2, the effect size between the groups at 6-month
follow-up was moderate (Cohen’s d=0.47; CI −1.46 to
2.40). No difference between the groups from pretreat-
mentto post-treatment was found.
For the more mildly depressed participants (total
n=30, BA n=17, MF n=13), there was a significant effect
in favour of the mindfulness group from pretreatment
to 6-month follow-up on the PHQ-9 (F(1, 69.3)=7.7,
