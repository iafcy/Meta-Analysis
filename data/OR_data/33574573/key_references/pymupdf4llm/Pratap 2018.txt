### Abstract

**Background:** Most people with mental health disorders fail to receive timely access to adequate care. US Hispanic/Latino
individuals are particularly underrepresented in mental health care and are historically a very difficult population to recruit into
clinical trials; however, they have increasing access to mobile technology, with over 75% owning a smartphone. This technology
has the potential to overcome known barriers to accessing and utilizing traditional assessment and treatment approaches.
**Objective:** This study aimed to compare recruitment and engagement in a fully remote trial of individuals with depression who
either self-identify as Hispanic/Latino or not. A secondary aim was to assess treatment outcomes in these individuals using three
different self-guided mobile apps: iPST (based on evidence-based therapeutic principles from problem-solving therapy, PST),
Project Evolution (EVO; a cognitive training app based on cognitive neuroscience principles), and health tips (a health information
app that served as an information control).
**Methods:** We recruited Spanish and English speaking participants through social media platforms, internet-based advertisements,
and traditional fliers in select locations in each state across the United States. Assessment and self-guided treatment was conducted
on each participant's smartphone or tablet. We enrolled 389 Hispanic/Latino and 637 non-Hispanic/Latino adults with mild to
moderate depression as determined by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score≥5 or related functional impairment.
Participants were first asked about their preferences among the three apps and then randomized to their top two choices. Outcomes
were depressive symptom severity (measured using PHQ-9) and functional impairment (assessed with Sheehan Disability Scale),
collected over 3 months. Engagement in the study was assessed based on the number of times participants completed active
surveys.
**Results:** We screened 4502 participants and enrolled 1040 participants from throughout the United States over 6 months, yielding
a sample of 348 active users. Long-term engagement surfaced as a key issue among Hispanic/Latino participants, who dropped
from the study 2 weeks earlier than their non-Hispanic/Latino counterparts (P<.02). No significant differences were observed
for treatment outcomes between those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or not. Although depressive symptoms improved (beta=–2.66,
_P=.006) over the treatment course, outcomes did not vary by treatment app._
**Conclusions:** Fully remote mobile-based studies can attract a diverse participant pool including people from traditionally
underserved communities in mental health care and research (here, Hispanic/Latino individuals). However, keeping participants
engaged in this type of “low-touch” research study remains challenging. Hispanic/Latino populations may be less willing to use

mobile apps for assessing and managing depression. Future research endeavors should use a user-centered design to determine
the role of mobile apps in the assessment and treatment of depression for this population, app features they would be interested
in using, and strategies for long-term engagement.

### Introduction

Technology is being leveraged as a way to perform large-scale
clinical research targeting typically underrepresented
populations. Given the extensive use of mobile devices across
communities, remote research methods are becoming widely
used. Additionally, technology is also seen as a potential method
for bridging health disparities, which are typically driven by
limited resources and stigma most apparent in minority
communities. Of particular interest is the Hispanic/Latino
community: Although they comprise one of the fastest-growing
demographic segments in the United States [1], Hispanic/Latino
populations are half as likely as their non-Hispanic white
counterparts to receive mental health services [2]. This
population is very difficult to recruit into research [3,4], and as
a result, there is limited science to support treatment
recommendations for this population. Recruitment of
Hispanic/Latino samples into clinical research is particularly
challenging in studies of mental health.

The widespread availability of digital technology has the
potential to drive a sea change in access to psychosocial
treatment for mental health problems in Hispanic/Latino
communities [5]. Internet-based interventions have already
demonstrated comparable treatment outcomes as traditional
face-to-face psychotherapy [6], and given that 75% of
Hispanic/Latino individuals own a smartphone [1], mobile-based
mental health apps have the potential to increase treatment
accessibility and engagement. Although there is potential for
treating depression in Hispanic/Latino individuals using mobile
devices, there is relatively little information about how this
population interacts with apps, given their underrepresentation
in mental health research. In particular, whether Hispanic/Latino
smartphone owners (including both Spanish and English
speakers) actually use mental health apps, and when they do,
whether they follow the app protocols. We recently tested
similar questions among a majority non-Hispanic white sample
in a recent, fully remote trial (BRIGHTEN V1 [7,8]) and found
that their interest in depression apps was high. It was far less
challenging to recruit participants into our remote clinical trial
compared with traditional in-person treatment trials. However,
long-term engagement with the assigned apps trailed off
significantly each week in the study, a finding that has been
demonstrated in other studies [9]. However, Hispanic/Latino
individuals, especially non-English speakers, do not typically
have the same opportunity as majority groups to utilize mental
health services and therefore may find mental health apps a
useful alternative to traditional care. There is an immediate need


for further research to develop and evaluate new solutions for
mental health care for this population that are economically
viable, scalable, and focused on engaging users to inform timely
and evidence-based clinical interventions.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the feasibility
of conducting remote research with a Hispanic/Latino adult
sample of smartphone users, how they interact with depression
apps, and the potential clinical impact mHealth apps may have
on treating depression in this population. We report recruitment,
engagement, and cost in this 12-week, fully remote randomized
controlled trial among Hispanic/Latino individuals with
depression and a cohort of non-Hispanic/Latinos with depression
to act as a direct comparator group (and extend our previous
findings).

### Methods

##### Approval

Ethical approval for the trial (NCT01808976) was granted by
the Institutional Review Board of University of California, San
Francisco. Specific research methods for this project replicated
the BRIGHTEN V1 study and are described elsewhere [7,8],
but are summarized here. Briefly, this was a fully remote
treatment trial for depression, consisting of engagement with
one of three treatment apps and periodic assessments detailed
below.

##### Recruitment

Three different types of recruitment approaches, including
traditional, social networking, and search-engine strategies,
were used (Figure 1). Traditional methods consisted of
Craigslist.org postings throughout the United States, specifically
posting to the “Volunteer” and “Jobs etc” pages within Craigslist
in at least one major city in every state. Social networking
methods included regular postings on sites such as Facebook
and Twitter and contextual-targeting methods to identify and
directly push recruitment ads to potential participants, based on
their Twitter and other social media comments. This approach
was led entirely by Trialspark.com, which designed specific
recruiting campaigns using machine learning approaches to
create optimal advertising. Furthermore, we reached out to
Hispanic/Latino Catholic Ministries in at least one city in every
state to see if they would be willing to help with the recruitment
for this study and post fliers in their communities. Each approach
(described further in Multimedia Appendix 1 provided
potentially interested participants a link to our custom study
website, which was translated entirely for Spanish speakers and


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Pratap et al


included a welcome video featuring bilingual Hispanic/Latino
researchers describing the goal of this study in Spanish. All
translations involving text in the treatment apps were done by
a combination of native Spanish speakers associated with this
study and professionals at Babble-on.

##### Procedures

This study used an equipoise stratified clinical trial design [10],
which factors participant preferences for treatment into
randomization. Participants were randomly assigned one app
among their two preferred intervention types and were asked
to use it daily for 4 weeks. Participants completed primary
outcome assessments, including the Patient Health
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [11] and Sheehan Disability Scale
(SDS) [12] once a week for 3 months, with other secondary
measures (described below) completed at daily, weekly, or
biweekly intervals. All treatments and assessments were
delivered remotely via custom apps.

##### Screening

Interested participants completed a brief Web-based screening
consisting of questions about their ability to speak Spanish (“Do
you speak Spanish?; ¿Hablas Español?”) and mobile device
ownership (“Do you have an iPhone or Android smartphone?”).

##### Consent

Participants were given the University of California, San
Francisco consent form to read and were instructed to watch a
video that highlighted the goals and procedures of the study, as
well as risks and benefits of participation. After viewing the
video, participants had to pass a quiz that confirmed their
understanding that participation was voluntary, was not a
substitute for treatment, and that they were to be randomized
to treatment conditions. Each question had to be answered
correctly before moving on to baseline assessment and
randomization. Eligibility was established after consent was


obtained. Upon being eligible, participants were sent a link to
download their assessment app (Surveytory).

##### Participant Eligibility

Participants had to speak English or Spanish, be 18 years old
or older, and own either an iPhone with Wi-Fi or 3G/4G/LTE
capabilities or an Android phone along with an Apple iPad
version 2.0 or newer device. An iOS-based device was required
as one of our intervention apps was only available on iOS
devices at the time of the study. If a user had an Android phone,
he or she was only eligible to participate if he or she also owned
an Apple iPad version 2 or newer iOS tablet device. Participants
had to endorse clinically significant symptoms of depression,
as indicated by either a score of 5 or higher on PHQ-9 or a score
of 2 or greater on PHQ item 10 (indicating feeling disabled in
his or her life because of mood).

##### Assessment

**Baseline**
The baseline assessment included collecting demographic
variables including age, race/ethnicity, marital and employment
status, income, education, smartphone ownership, use of other
health apps, and use of mental health services, including use of
medications and psychotherapy. We collected information on
mental health status using PHQ-9 [11] for depression and SDS

[12] to assess self-reported disability. PHQ-9 rates the presence
and severity of depressive symptoms across 9 items, with higher
scores signifying more severe symptomatology (range 0-27).
This is a reliable and well-validated screening instrument [13]
that is responsive to depression treatment outcomes over time

[11] and is included in the US Preventive Services Task Force
recommendations for depression screening in adults [14]. PHQ-9
has been translated into several languages; we used both the
original English language form and the validated Spanish
translation [15]. The baseline PHQ-9 demonstrated good internal
consistency in our sample (Cronbach alpha=.85, 95% CI
0.83-0.87).

SDS assesses perceived functional impairment across 3 domains
(work/school, social life, and family/home responsibilities),
yielding a sum score of 0-30, in which higher scores represent
greater disability. SDS is popular in clinical trials given its
sensitivity in detecting treatment effects [16]. As one of the
official World Health Organization’s measures of disability,
this measure has also been translated into several languages;
we used both the original English version and a validated
Spanish translation of this scale [17]. SDS also demonstrated
good internal consistency in our sample (Cronbach alpha=.89,
95% CI 0.87-0.91).

**Follow-Up Assessments**
Our custom mobile app, Surveytory, was used to collect all
outcome and passive data. The assessments to measure changes
in mood (PHQ-9) and disability (SDS) were administered
weekly. Daily changes in mood were assessed using the PHQ-2
survey. Passive data collection included daily phone usage logs
(call/text time, call duration, and text length) and mobility data
(activity type and distance traveled using the phone’s
accelerometer and Global Positioning System). Participants
were automatically notified every 8 hours for 24 hours if they
had not completed a survey within 8 hours of its original
delivery. A built-in reminder also prompted the participant to
check for any surveys on a daily basis in case they missed a
new survey notification. An assessment was considered missing
if it was not completed within a 24-hour time frame.

**Treatment**
After confirming completion of baseline assessments (or 72
hours after the initiation of these assessments, whichever came
first), participants were sent a Web-based survey that described
each of the 3 treatment arms. Following this description,
participants were asked to select which 2 apps they were most
inclined to use in this study. Participants were then randomly
assigned to one of these 2 preferred conditions and sent a link
to download the intervention app, which included a brief video
explaining how to download and use the assigned treatment
app. This download also included a custom dashboard to monitor
their study progress. Participants were asked to use their
assigned app for 1 month.

The first app was a video game-inspired cognitive intervention
(Project Evolution, EVO) designed to modulate cognitive control
abilities, as declines in these abilities have been associated with
depression [18]. This intervention has preliminary evidence for
being an effective treatment for depression [18]. The second
intervention was an app based on internet-based problem-solving
therapy (iPST), an evidence-based treatment for depression,
which has been shown to be both acceptable and efficacious for
US-dwelling Hispanic/Latino populations. The final intervention
app, an information control, provided daily health tips (HTips)
for overcoming depressed mood such as self-care (eg, taking a
shower) or physical activity (eg, taking a walk; see [8] for
further descriptions of each).

Each of the 3 apps represented the most common type of
self-guided depression apps available at the time of the study:
apps based on psychotherapy principles, apps that claim to
improve mood through therapeutic games, and apps that provide
suggestions for mindfulness and behavioral exercises. Similar


to the assessment notifications, each intervention app was
equipped with built-in reminders asking the participant to use
their app on a daily basis (reminders were sent once daily).

**Incentives**
Randomized participants were paid a total of US $75 in Amazon
gift vouchers for completing all assessments over the 12 weeks.
Participants received US $15 for completing the initial baseline
assessment and an additional US $20 for each subsequent
assessment at the 4-, 8-, and 12-week time points.

**Procedures to Reduce Gaming**
“Gaming” is a situation where a user enrolls in a study solely
to acquire research payment or attempts to influence specific
methodological aspects of the study. We utilized the following
safeguards to prevent this: (1) locking the eligibility or treatment
randomization survey if a participant tried to change a submitted
answer so that only the initial answer was utilized, (2) using
study links that are valid for one user/device, and (3) tracking
internet protocol addresses to minimize duplicate enrollments.

##### Statistical Analyses

Participant self-reported race/ethnicity was used to create 2
groups of Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino adults (eg,
all other races and ethnicities) to test our main study aims.
Sample demographics and clinical characteristics were
calculated using appropriate descriptive statistics. Comparisons
between participant demographics were done using a chi-square
test of independence for categorical variables and one-way
analysis of variance to compare continuous variables across the
groups. To assess the marginal effect (ie, association in the
entire sample) between longitudinal weekly PHQ-9 and SDS
scores and treatment arms, we used generalized estimating
equations (GEEs) [19]. Briefly, GEE models extend generalized
linear models to longitudinal or clustered data. GEEs use a
working correlation structure that accounts for within-subject
correlations of participant responses, thereby estimating robust
and unbiased SEs compared with ordinary least squares
regression [19,20]. We adjusted for age and gender to account
for any potential confounding effects between outcome and
main covariates of interest. Treatment response was further
categorized into 3 groups based on a change of at least 5 points
on PHQ-9 [11], the minimal clinically important difference

[11], to comprise treatment responders (decrease PHQ-9≥5
points), nonresponders (change in PHQ-9<5 points), and those
that deteriorated over treatment (increase in PHQ-9≥5 points).
To assess participant engagement, we examined the proportion
of participants who completed at least one activity in any given
week. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the
daily, weekly, and overall participation differences between
Hispanic/Latino and other participants. Univariate estimation
of time to drop out from the study between Hispanic/Latino and
non-Hispanic/Latino participants was computed using survival
analysis. The distribution of survival days (total days active in
the study) and nonparametric estimates of the survivor function
was computed using the Kaplan-Meier method [21]. Log-rank
test [22] was used to test for differences in survival between
Hispanic/Latino and other participants. To compare dropout
rates among the 3 interventions, a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis
test was used. Passive data was only used to compare user

engagement with active survey-based tasks. Given this study
design is similar to that of our previous work [7], we used the
same power analysis for this study. It indicated that 200
participants per intervention arm would provide 0.80 power to
detect a medium treatment effect (eg, 2 points change on PHQ-9
scale, Cohen _d=0.4) with an assumption of 50% participant_
dropout. However, this study was a feasibility trial of an
understudied Hispanic/Latino population and was not
sufficiently powered to detect a moderate effect size across the
3 interventions. All analyses were carried out using R (R Core
Team, Vienna, Austria), statistical computing language version
3.4.2 [23].

### Results

##### Recruitment and Enrollment

The BRIGHTEN V2 study started recruitment in August 2016
with screening and enrollment continuing for 7 months. A total
of 4502 people were screened, and 23.10% (1040/4502) adults
met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study. Of
these, 37.40% (389/1040) reported being Hispanic/Latinos. As
in BRIGHTEN V1 study [7,8], the use of Craigslist.org was the
most effective approach in recruiting, with more than 80%
(843/1040) of our participants coming from this approach. An
additional 8% (86/1040) were referred by friends or colleagues.

Enrolled participants lived throughout the United States, with
all the metropolitan areas represented (Figure 2). Only 33.46%
(348/1040) of the initially enrolled participants were active in
the study (active cohort), as defined by completing at least one
postenrollment weekly PHO-9 assessments or providing passive
phone usage data within the first 12 weeks. The remaining
66.54% (692/1040) participants did not respond to any
postenrollment surveys or provide passive data and were
therefore considered to be study dropouts (Figure 3). Income,
education, and race were significantly different between those
who dropped and those who did not (P<.005; Multimedia
Appendix 1). A large proportion of individuals who reported
that they “can’t make ends meet” with regard to their income
dropped out of the study (238/692, 34.4%) this effect was more
pronounced for Hispanic/Latino individuals (135/283, 47.7%).
Over half (171/283, 60.4%) of the Hispanic/Latino participants
who dropped out of the study reported making US $20,000 or
less annually compared to with 28.10% (112/398) of
non-Hispanic/Latinos who dropped out. Of the 348 active
individuals, 74 did not complete the treatment randomization
survey and thus were not assigned an intervention. However,
they continued to complete self-report surveys during the study
period. For this reason, we categorized these participants as
enrolled but not randomized (EnR) category. All further analyses
were restricted to active individuals consisting of those in
treatment (n=274) or EnR (n=74; total N=348) arms. See Figure


3 for the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram
illustrating participant flow through the study.

Of those who were randomized, 31.8% (87/274) attempted to
change their assigned intervention by hitting the “back” button
to return to the randomization page, while an additional 10.2%
(28/274) participants returned to the survey a second time to
change their preferences (9/274, 3.2%) of these individuals used
both methods). Note that these attempts were unsuccessful
because participant randomization was determined by the first
answer given by a participant, and not any of the subsequent
attempts made.

##### Sample Demographics

See Table 1 for participant characteristics, including
comparisons across those identifying as Hispanic/Latino and
not. The participants were predominantly young, with 69.81%
(238/345) aged less than 40 years (mean 34.90, SD 10.92);
female (205/266, 77.19%); and non-Hispanic white (98/184,
53.3%), with 30.7% (33/106) of our sample reporting
Hispanic/Latino identity. The majority (168/241, 69.9%)
reported some form of employment, and 87.8% (266/303) of
all participants were iPhone users. There were significant
differences between Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino
participants; notably, a greater proportion (43/106, 40.6%) of
Hispanic/Latino participants reported annual incomes of less
than US $20,000, compared with only 24.7% (59/239)
non-Hispanic/Latinos. Likewise, non-Hispanic/Latino
participants were significantly more likely to be employed and
more likely to have obtained a university education relative to
Hispanic/Latino participants. Finally, Hispanic/Latino
participants were slightly younger than their counterparts,
although both groups were on average in their early-to-mid 30s.

##### Clinical Characteristics

Overall, the cohort reported moderate depressive
symptomatology with a mean baseline PHQ-9 of 13.61 (SD
5.46). There was no difference in baseline depression between
Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino participants (P=.07),
and neither age nor gender showed a significant association
with baseline PHQ-9 scores (age: =−0.09, _P=.06; gender:_
_F1336=3.16,_ _P=.07). Income satisfaction showed a moderate_

effect on baseline PHQ-9 scores (f[2]=0.265, _P<.001)._ Table 2
summarizes the associations and effect sizes of all baseline
variables with baseline PHQ-9 scores. Participants who reported
income satisfaction as “can’t make ends meet” showed
significantly higher depression symptomatology (delta
PHQ-9=+3.9, P<.001) than those who reported income level as
“comfortable” (Figure 4). However, this discrepancy in
depressive symptoms between income levels was not
significantly different between Hispanic/Latinos and
non-Hispanic/Latinos across other categories of income
satisfaction.

##### Cost

Study costs beyond the initial infrastructure developed for
BRIGHTEN V1 included participant payments (US $7540),
website/enrollment portal/database development (US $4601),
and total recruitment efforts (US $14,471; see Table 3). A bulk
of recruitment spending was for 217 Spanish language ads
placed on Craigslist throughout the country (US $5725), while
only US $946 was spent on 33 English ads to obtain the reported
enrollment. Furthermore, US $7800 was spent on targeted social
media recruitment specifically for Spanish speakers via
Trialspark.com; however, only 86 unique registrants came
through this portal. Thus, participant acquisition costs differed
dramatically between Spanish (US $31 per enrolled participant)
and English speakers (US $1.49 per enrolled participant).

##### Engagement

Overall participation in the study (as measured by assessment
completion, as opposed to intervention app use) decreased by
approximately 50% from week 1 to week 4, with more than 4
out of 5 participants dropping (14%) out by the end of 12 weeks.
At week 4, participants contributed twice as much passive data
(ie, momentary Global Positioning System data) compared with
that provided in survey assessments requiring active
participation (Figure 5). Significant differences in participant


engagement were observed between Hispanic/Latino and
non-Hispanic/Latino participants (P=.02). Non-Hispanic/Latino
individuals tended to participate in the study for 18.5 days longer
than their Hispanic/Latino counterparts (median 53.5 days until
dropout for non-Hispanic/Latinos and median 37 for
Hispanic/Latino participants; see Figure 6). Finally, participants
in the iPST and HTips arms were significantly more engaged
than those in the EVO and EnR arms (P<.01), regardless of the
race/ethnicity (Figure 7).

##### Depression Outcomes

Changes in weekly PHQ-9 scores were significantly associated
with baseline severity of depressive symptoms (ie, mild,
moderate, and severe; P<.001). Participants who reported severe
depressive symptoms upon study entry evidenced the greatest
decline in PHQ-9 scores during weeks 1-4 (beta=−4.19, P<.001)
but no significant changes during weeks 5-12. Participants with
moderate symptoms also showed an initial decline in PHQ-9
(beta=−1.96, _P=.004) and a further decline of 0.70 points_
(beta=−2.66, P=.006) in weeks 5-12 (Table 4,Figure 8). With
regard to treatment remission at the end of week 4, 34.42%
participants responded to the interventions (a decrease in PHQ-9
score of ≥5 from baseline), 51.63% were nonresponders (change
in PHQ-9 of <5 points), and a small proportion (11.48%)
deteriorated (PHQ-9 worsened ≥5 points) during the course of

the study. However, there was no difference in depression
outcomes among the 3 intervention arms. No differences in
treatment remission were observed between Hispanic/Latino
participants and non-Hispanic/Latinos.

##### Disability Outcomes

At the cohort level, disability based on SDS ratings decreased
by an average 0.74 points (P=.03) in weeks 2-4 and further by

0.39 points (beta=−1.09, _P=.02) in weeks 5-12. As with_
depression outcomes, there was no difference in disability
outcomes across treatment arms. Hispanic/Latino and
non-Hispanic/Latino participants did not differ in their disability
outcomes (Table 5).

### Discussion

##### Principal Findings

To our knowledge, BRIGHTEN V2 is the first large-scale effort
to target the remote recruitment of Hispanic/Latino individuals
with depression in the United States using digital health
assessments and interventions that were translated into Spanish
and administered solely on smartphones. We screened and
enrolled one of the largest cohorts of Hispanic/Latino individuals
with depression to date. Previous work has suggested that the
lack of utilization of mental health care could be attributed to
(1) cultural beliefs about mental health problems, (2) ineffective
and inappropriate therapies, or (3) access problems or other
barriers [24]. We attempted to address each of these issues by
selectively targeting an underrepresented Hispanic/Latino
population and using accessible, Spanish translated versions of
the evidence-based intervention apps used in the initial study

[8]. As has been found in other mobile-based mental health
clinical trials [25,26], long-term engagement continues to be a
significant challenge to these studies and is more pronounced


among Hispanic/Latino participants. Although mobile devices
are increasingly available in Hispanic/Latino communities [10],
the availability of these devices as a means for conducting
research and delivering care are not yet solutions that offset the
widespread disparities seen in this population.

##### Feasibility and Acceptability

Similar to our previous work [7,27], this study has shown the
feasibility of recruiting and enrolling a large and diverse sample
of Hispanics/Latino adults. Previous research and observations
from clinical practice suggest that Hispanics/Latino populations
in the United States face barriers to research and treatment,
including stigma and time constraints. This study was intended
to overcome those very barriers by leveraging mobile apps that
could be used at each participant’s convenience. However, the
engagement data showed that the Hispanics/Latino participants
dropped out close to 2 weeks earlier than their
non-Hispanics/Latinos counterparts, highlighting significant
challenges in not only recruiting but also in keeping this
population engaged. It was much more expensive and labor
intensive to recruit Hispanics/Latino participants relative to the


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Pratap et al


rest of the cohort. Attrition was particularly striking among the
Hispanic/Latino subset, with only 18.7% (73/389) downloading
the treatment app. Highest dropout among the Hispanic/Latino
sample were from participants reporting an annual income level
of less than US $20,000.

Potential issues recruiting US Hispanic/Latino individuals for
mental health research may hinge on (1) reluctance to be
randomized, given the high number of the enrolled participants
who tried to switch the initial randomly assigned intervention
app and (2) privacy concerns such as the possibility that some
of our lower income participants could be sharing the
smartphones with other family members, potentially reducing
the willingness to participate and causing high initial dropout

[28]. Furthermore, the majority of participants were iPhone
users, which may not be representative of the underlying
population. While the ownership of an Android smartphone
plus an iPad combination is relatively common as indicated by
a 2014 survey [9], the ease of being able to participate in this
study by only having to have a single device (iOS phone) likely
spurred the bias toward iOS users in the sample.

Another potential issue in the study was the possible delay in
receiving the intervention. The stratified equipoise
randomization occurred after eligible participants attempted the
assigned assessments (or after 72 hours, whichever came first);
given that participants may have been waiting for their assigned
intervention following their initial exposure to the assessment
app, they may have lost interest in participating. Another
consideration involves the appropriate incentive structure (eg,
timing and amount of compensation) to maximize retention and
engagement, as this factor is not well understood among such
underrepresented samples such as ours. It is an empirical
question to understand how the amount of payment affects one’s
participation in a given trial. Indeed, in the first version of this
study (BRIGHTEN V1), we found that participants who received
bonus payments remained in the study longer than those who
did not receive bonuses [8]. In that study, the experimentation
with two distinct incentive models to encourage retention
revealed that participant payment was not enough to keep
engagement from waning. Other work has shown that
externalized benefits (eg, compensation) can dull motivation,
whereas the creation of an internalized reward structure can
enhance motivation and improve the aspects of adherence (eg,
individualized presentation of study progress, personalized
encouragements) [29,30]. This is a considerable hurdle to
overcome for mental health researchers who are dependent upon
trying to identify features that would align with greater
engagement of a culturally unique population. Thus, these issues
of acceptability and engagement must be dealt with not only
for research but also for any scalable intervention to take hold
in routine clinical practice.

Despite the poor engagement of the active components in this
study, it is clear from the findings (and those from other
mobile-based studies) that there is still a tremendous potential
to capture passive data from smartphone use. This form of data
capture is much less burdensome as it does not require the user
to actively engage with an app. If one only considers the passive
data compliance versus that of the active surveys in our study,
passive data offers a viable opportunity to develop an


individualized digital baseline (digital fingerprint) and
investigate deviations from baseline phone usage to behavioral
fluctuations. However, using cohort-level signals in passive
data to predict depression states remains modest at best [31-33],
suggesting that this approach will likely require larger studies
and pairing with an active task-based component for the most
effective solution.

##### Difference in Clinical Features and Outcomes

Similar to our earlier findings in the original study [7],
participants on average reported improvement in both depression
and disability measures over time, regardless of treatment arm.
However, more than half of the participants, regardless of their
race/ethnicity, did not evidence any clinically meaningful change
(PHQ-9 change of less than 5 points from baseline) or actually
deteriorated according to their PHQ-9 scores (worsening of
more than 5 points from baseline on PHQ-9) during the course
of the study. It is important to note that the participants in our
trial did not have a clinical diagnosis of depression, rather they
endorsed at least a mild level of depressive symptomatology at
baseline screening on PHQ-9. Moreover, treatment outcomes
were based on self-report using this screening measure. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, treatment response was strongest in those with
greater depressive symptomatology at baseline. Thus, we
interpret our clinical findings with caution, as this is not a
clinical sample or an effectiveness trial, but rather a feasibility
trial in a sample of potential interest for future remote
interventions. We also noted overall poor engagement in this
sample with significant demographic differences between our
Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino participants.
Hispanic/Latinos reported lower income, less income
satisfaction, and lower education; such factors have been
previously reported to be associated with an increased incidence
of depression [34].

##### Conclusions and Future Directions

mHealth platforms have the potential to deliver on-demand and
as needed assessment and intervention alternatives despite
known barriers of time constraints, cost, stigma, and cultural
and language differences. Although mHealth holds great promise
for closing the treatment gap for underserved communities,
recruitment and retention remain problematic in such
populations, and more research is needed to figure out better
engagement strategies to best leverage mobile apps (eg,
appropriate incentive levels, culturally responsive content and
notifications along with user-centered design approaches [35]).
Like other contactless programs (eg, self-help interventions),
it is difficult to keep users engaged in active components without
therapists or other in-person supports [36]. However, the
ubiquity and relative unobtrusive nature of smartphones lend
itself to acquiring passive sensing data, even in the absence of
engagement with active components of the research or
intervention protocol.

Our study offers preliminary lessons learned from doing such
work in an understudied sample of Hispanic/Latino smartphone
users. Scaling these types of remote assessments and
interventions will hinge on the acceptance of such technology
by both care teams and patients. This will be a problem for
future research using remote technologies at scale to recruit and

engage targeted communities (eg, Hispanic/Latino adults with needs and addressing barriers to using mental health
depression) and will depend on understanding the population’s interventions via mobile apps.
