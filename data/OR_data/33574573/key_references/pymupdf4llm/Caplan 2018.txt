ABSTRACT
Mobile health (mHealth) interventions include mental health
apps (MHapps). There are hundreds of MHapps, which have
been touted as a means of revolutionizing mental health care
delivery. In spite of the rosy outlook and promise of MHapps,
there are challenges to implementation in Low and Middle
Income Countries (LMICs). We report on several domains of
implementation: acceptance, appropriateness, engagement,
and work processes assessed in two samples of clinicians and
patients designed to develop and test the feasibility of a
Spanish language Cognitive Behavioral VoiceThreadVR app for
Dominican primary care patients with depression. Results indicated that feasibility of our eMH intervention was compromised
by appropriateness of the target audience and the eligibility
criteria used, including language, age, access to phones, and
access to the internet. Both participants and clinical providers
had varying degrees of engagement in the MHapp. Clinical providers had a desire for increased knowledge and capacity building, but also unspoken expectations and misaligned incentives.
For participants, there were logistical and emotional barriers to
use, some of which could not be fully determined in this study
due to a lack of feasibility in terms of a low retention rate.
Corresponding to these issues, we identified four potential solutions: 1) understanding of characteristics of end-users; 2)
engagement of key stakeholders; 3) working within the existing
infrastructure; and 4) addressing the social determinants of
health. Unforeseen strengths also emerged as a result of our
investigations. The challenges encountered in this pilot study
can be viewed as evidence of failure or part of the incremental
steps necessary to build future success.

Introduction

Mental illnesses are among the leading causes of years lived with disability;
however, 80% of people with mental illness in Low and Middle Income
countries (LMICs) are unable to access treatment (Whiteford et al., 2013).

Increasing income inequality worldwide and disparities in health care
resources contribute to morbidity and poor health outcomes in LMICs.
The ubiquity of cellular phones and their unobtrusiveness may provide a
means of delivering mental health care that is more private and less stigmatizing through mHealth. mHealth is a type of eHealth that the World
Health Organization (WHO, 2011) defines as medical care or monitoring
that is delivered through mobile devices (World Health Organization,
2011). The WHO has found that mHealth interventions for chronic disease
management are utilized in the majority of its member nations and have
reached more than 31 million people worldwide (World Health
Organization, 2011). There are various types of mHealth interventions
including: interactive voice response (IVR), smartphone applications, short
messaging service (SMS), and telephone-based peer support (TBPS).
eMental Health (eMH) is “the use of telecommunication and information
technologies to deliver mental health services at a distance” (Vis et al.,
2018). eMH has been successfully used to deliver treatment, real-time monitoring, and symptom management, psychoeducation, screening, promotion
of behavioral change, coaching, social support, and self-management for a
wide variety of mental illnesses including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and borderline personality disorder (Donker et al.,
2013; Labrique, Vasudevan, Kochi, Fabricant, & Mehl, 2013; Wang et al.,
2014). Apps that deliver eMH interventions are referred to as mental health
apps or MHapps. There are hundreds of MHapps available; however, few
MHapps available for consumers incorporate evidenced-based features,
such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and few have evidence of
effectiveness (Bakker, Kazantzis, Rickwood, & Rickard, 2016).
There are 4.3 billion mobile subscribers and access to mobile phones globally is 91% (Sourabh, 2013). mHealth has been touted as a means of revolutionizing health care delivery and “the capabilities of mobile technology
are now central to global health thinking” (Mohammadi, 2015). In spite of
the rosy outlook and promise of mHealth and eMH, in particular, there are
challenges to implementation and translational research that need to be
considered. These challenges relate to human factors, the infrastructure of
health service delivery, and research capacity to evaluate technological
innovations in the use of eMH.

MHealth in Latin America

In Latin America, including the Dominican Republic (DR), wired networks
and connectivity are rapidly expanding (The World Folio, 2013) and penetration has reached 112%, meaning some people have more than one phone
(The World Folio, 2013). Unfortunately, technology is changing at a rate


-----

that often precedes research evidence, and there are only a few examples of
concerted efforts in mHealth interventions. The importance of information
technology in the region is being fostered by The Observatory for the
Information Society in Latin America and the Caribbean (OSILAC)
(United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, 2013) and The
Global Observatory for eHealth (GOe) (WHO, Global Observatory for
eHealth. Atlas—eHealth country profiles based on the findings of the
second global survey on eHealth, 2010), which are designed to monitor the
growth of internet technology and raise awareness of the need for eHealth
practices. The Ibero-American Network of Mobile Technology and Health
was created to promote research and development of mHealth in Latin
America. Results of their efforts were highlighted in the international workshop RITGMOS 2015, and featured the use of mobile applications and
instant messaging (SMS) as mHealth tools to benefit and improve the quality of diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, self-care, and quality of life
among the population of Latin America (Saigi-Rubio, Novillo-Ortiz, &
Piette, 2017). Peru and Mexico were highlighted for their use of mHealth
for treatment adherence, epidemiological surveillance, and chronic disease
self-management (Ram�ırez, Guillen, & Cifuentes, 2016; Richards, 2013;
Ruiz, Proano, Ponce, & Curioso,~ 2015). However, in general, efforts to promote the use of mHealth are in its infancy and mental health is underrepresented among mHealth strategies. In many Latin American countries,
the lack of infrastructure, both physical and technological, presents a real
barrier to the adoption and use of mHealth. In Colombia, there is a clear
policy on eHealth and health service needs of the population; however, the
potential use of technology is limited by poor coverage, few trained personnel, and cost (Frenk, 2015). A survey of Latin American and Caribbean
countries found that slightly more than half had an Information and
Communication Technology policy, whereas very few, including the DR,
had electronic health (eHealth) policies (Jimenez-Marroquin, Deber, &
Jadad, 2014). This absence of a concerted government level investment in
eHealth has resulted in limited outcomes and translational research. The
quality of existing mHealth research in Latin America is limited by small
sample sizes, lack of valid diagnostic measures, and insufficient safeguards
for confidentiality, anonymity, and information security (Ram�ırez et al.,
2016; Richards, 2013).

Barriers to conducting eMH translational research in LMICs, including
Latin America

Results of some systematic reviews conducted in the United States and theoretical articles describe a number of challenges to the development of an
evidence basis for mHealth apps that are relevant to MHapps. These


-----

include Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory issues, Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) and privacy issues,
integration with existing health systems, and financial sustainability (Terry,
2015). These challenges, although noteworthy, are not easily amenable to
change at the project level (WHO, 2015) and do not address the crux of
the issues facing implementation of an MHapp in an LMIC (Amerson &
Strang, 2015). Translational research is comprised of dissemination and
implementation (May, Johnson, & Finch, 2016; Proctor et al., 2009).
Dissemination of eMH has been successful in HICs given that stakeholders
and policy makers support eMH health care delivery to expand access. The
most frequently used evidenced-based eMH depression treatment is CBT
(Cuijpers, Andersson, Donker, & van Straten, 2011). In the form of selfhelp web apps and mobile apps, studies have shown effectiveness in the
treatment of mild to moderate depression in nonclinical settings
(Andersson, Topooco, Havik, & Nordgreen, 2016; Sander, Rausch, &
Baumeister, 2016; Wang et al., 2014), although implementation in the clinical setting is more challenging.
Most eMH interventions are developed and tested in High Income countries. Global research funding priorities are set by High Income Countries
(HICs) and have favored communicable disease research in LMICs.
Significantly less research funding has been dedicated to chronic disease
and mental health services research (The Global Emergency Medicine
Think Tank Clinical Research Working Group, 2017). The vast majority of
research related to mHealth in LMICs, including Latin America, has been
in the areas of behavioral change in infectious disease surveillance, and
maternal and child health. mHealth interventions have also been used a
platform to enhance workforce training and monitoring, track vital statistics, and as sensors and diagnostics (Bakker et al., 2016).
Although the use of the internet, mobile phones, and the development of
applications and online sources of information currently are in high
demand in LMICs, little has been done to integrate these communication
methods as tools for the dissemination of mental health interventions.
Sociocultural norms influence attitudes towards health services, including
how eMH solutions will be utilized (Dobson et al., 2017; O’Connor &
O’Donoghue, 2015; The Global Emergency Medicine Think Tank Clinical
Research Working Group, 2017). In Latin America and the Caribbean,
societal stigma related to mental health creates a reluctance to seek out psychologists, or psychiatrists. Persons with mental health problems prefer,
instead, the advice of family members or religious leaders when experiencing symptoms of emotional distress (Caplan et al., 2016). eMH can enable
people to access services in their own environment, avoiding the stigma
associated with disclosure of a mental health problem (Fraser & Blaya,


-----

2010; Pagalday-Olivares et al., 2017). However, stigma may be one of the
reasons that research specific to MHapps and other eMH interventions is
virtually nonexistent in Latin America.
The Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (REAIM) (Glasgow, Vogt, & Boles, 1999) framework has been used to identify
barriers and facilitators to eMH uptake in HICs (Donker et al., 2013), and
these fall into several domains, as follows: acceptance, appropriateness,
engagement, resources, work processes, and leadership. These issues are
also very relevant to research related to eMH delivery in LMICs, but may
be more clearly illustrated in a real world context. The objective of this
manuscript is to discuss the feasibility of implementation of MHapps
research in an LMIC, the DR, and to provide some potential solutions.

Methods

We report on the barriers to implementation of a proof of concept study
designed to develop and test the feasibility of disseminating a culturally
adapted Spanish language Cognitive Behavioral guided self-help
VoiceThread mobile appVR (CBT-VT app) for Dominican primary care
patients with depression. The application, El Buen Consejo Movil (EBCM)
(the Sound Advice) was developed and piloted in three government-owned
primary care clinics in Santo Domingo and Boca Chica, DR. We opted to
not provide a phone to participants, because the provision of a smart
phone (valued at $75 U.S. dollars) could be considered a coercion to participate in the research study. Thus, we provided an incentive of initially
one month’s internet access or 4 gigabytes (valued at $17) with an additional month upon follow-up. Feasibility data were ascertained from two
separate samples during 2016–2018. The study was approved by a
University Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Research Department of
the University Autonoma de Santo Domingo, and the Ministry of Health�
in the DR.
The Specific Aims of the study were to:

1. Assess access to smart phones and the internet among this population
and acceptability of app usage.
2. Assess the feasibility and acceptability of using EBCM. Feasibility
included recruitment, adherence and retention, clinical relevance, and
staff engagement.

Study design. A mixed-method longitudinal design was used to evaluate
the feasibility and acceptability of EBCM. We used an iterative design process for development and evaluation of mHealth technology, the


-----

Accelerated Creation to Sustainment (ACTS) model (Mohr et al., 2017).
This model avoids some of the pitfalls of translational research in the context of mHealth interventions. In the traditional model of translational
research, an app is developed outside of and apart from the deployment
setting, and is implemented in the real-world setting only when fully developed. In the ACTS model, creation, development, implementation, and
evaluation occur simultaneously and cyclically throughout the phases of
Create, Trial, and Sustain (Mohr et al., 2017). Therefore, based on the analysis of results from our first sample, we modified the sample, setting, intervention, and objectives for our second sample. We retained the objective of
assessing the feasibility and acceptability of using EBCM. An additional
objective for the second sample was to increase staff engagement and
understanding of the intervention for future deployment in that setting.
Subjects and Setting Sample 1. A convenience sample of 36 participants
was recruited from two primary care sites. The sample size was based upon
our a priori recruitment criteria of 60% of eligible participants recruited
and consented. Using a sample size estimate based on confidence intervals
of estimates (Hooper, 2019; Hertzog, 2008), with a sample size of 36, we
would be able to estimate a recruitment rate of 60% to within a 95% confidence interval of /- 13%. We opted for this range because of the recomþ
mended sample size of less than 40 for feasibility of recruitment in pilot
studies and a greater acceptability of wider confidence intervals (Hertzog,
2008). The sites were selected based on where providers had received the
WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) training in integrated behavioral health care. The goals of mhGAP were to increase access
to health care for mental, neurological, and substance abuse disorders
through integrated behavioral health care. Through mhGAP, primary care
providers throughout the country were trained in identification and management of common behavioral health disorders such as depression,
dementia, epilepsy, and alcohol misuse, thus, primary care providers had a
protocol for screening and treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
(World Health Organization, 2010). These primary care sites, known as
Primary Attention Units (UNAPS), had been selected by the Office of the
Minister of Mental Health and were located in the National District, specifically in Boca Chica, Santo Domingo, and Santo Domingo Este.
Recruitment Sample 1. The PRIME-MD PHQ-9 was used to assess presence of depressive symptoms (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). The
PHQ-9 is a 9-item scale that assesses all DSM-V symptoms of depression
during the past two weeks. It is a widely-used measure of depression severity in primary care, that has been validated for Spanish-speaking populations (Baca et al., 1999; Diez-Quevedo, Rangil, Sanchez-Planell, Kroenke, &
Spitzer, 2001; Wulsin, Somoza, & Heck, 2002). The PHQ-9 was selected


-----

because the questions were similar to the depression screening questions
used by mhGAP. After screening and scoring the PHQ-9, the participant
was informed of the results of the screening, and the significance of the
results, in a culturally appropriate manner. With the patient’s written consent, results were shared with the patient’s primary care physician. Patients
who met inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study of
EBCM. The consent form was read aloud to participants and a formal written consent was obtained. The inclusion criteria was: age greater than or
equal to 18, PHQ-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer & Williams, 2001) score indicative of
depression by algorithm, and greater than or equal to 5 and less than 15
(indicating mild to moderate depressive disorder) on a validated Spanish
translation of the PHQ-9, access to a working mobile smart phone, receipt
of primary care from the UNAP, able to speak and understand Spanish
and read at a third grade level (for texting within the app). The exclusion
critera was: age less than 18 years, PHQ-9 score not indicative of depression by algorithm and less than 5; or greater than or equal to 15, a history
of psychiatric hospitalization or bipolar disorder, severe mental disorder,
actively suicidal, significant cognitive impairment, hearing or speech
impairment that would preclude listening to and/or verbally responding to
the app, non-Spanish speaking, a life expectancy of less than six months.
Subjects and Setting Sample 2. Upon review and analysis of data from
the first two sites and concerns over the absence of screening and a referral
system for persons with mental health care needs, we opted for a third site
where mhGAP was being implemented with greater fidelity and mental
health professionals were present on-site. This UNAP was located in Santo
Domingo Este. At this site, the research team presented the goals and
objectives of the study to the entire clinical staff. In discussion of the proposed research, the Medical Director and Regional Health Director felt that
ECBM might be appropriate for clinic staff. Moreover, to enhance staff
engagement and understanding of the intervention, the PI and CoInvestigators decided that the clinical staff should be given a trial period of
the app to experience the intervention. We informed the staff that we
wanted their feedback on the app’s perceived appropriateness for the target
audience, the clinic’s patients. We also wanted to assess the potential for
staff members to monitor the app and fully integrate the intervention
within the daily work-flow of the clinic.
Recruitment Sample 2. All clinical staff (n = 30; 5 nurses, 14 CHWs,
and 9 doctors and 2 mental health providers) who were present in the
clinic and available during the times the research team was present were
invited to participate in the five-day trial of EBCM. Staff members who
were willing, formally consented to study participation. The consent, conducted privately, included permission to complete a brief demographic


-----

questionnaire, and the PHQ-9, and to provide feedback and evaluation of
the contents of the app. The inclusion criteria for staff was: age 18 and
above, had worked at the primary site for a minimum of 6 months, and
present at the clinic for a minimum of 15 hours per week. The exclusion
criteria was: age under 18, plans to be away from the clinic for greater than
one week, severe mental disorder, actively suicidal, cognitive impairment,
hearing or speech impairment that would preclude listening to and/or verbally responding to the app.
Intervention. After baseline data collection, participants were provided
with prepaid internet access for one month and EBCM was downloaded to
their phone. The intervention was based on the Spanish language depression prevention course, “The Healthy Management of Reality,” an evidence-based CBT group therapy program developed by Munoz (~ 2007). The
language and contents of the course had been culturally modified for the
Dominican population with ongoing collaboration with mental health professionals in the DR and the United States. Subsequently, the face-to-face
program (Munoz,~ 2007) was modified for use in the app. Modifications
were designed to compensate for the absence of therapist/patient live interaction by incorporating daily salutations and dichos (short parables or
instructive comments) in short one to two-minute audio commentaries.
These modifications were piloted among a convenience sample of 24 interview participants (14 patients and 10 clinic staff in different capacities) in a
primary care clinic in Santo Domingo, DR.
EBCM was designed to be used as a stand-alone tool to provide psychoeducation for depression or to augment treatment as usual (TAU). The
contents of EBCM, delivered in two daily recorded messages, was not considered to be psychotherapy, but rather guided self-help for depressive
symptoms and negative mood states. EBCM was downloaded to
VoiceThread’s cloud-based platform, a proprietary, secure mobile platform
that facilitates multimodal communication among users (see Figure 1).
Participants could respond to questions posed in the prerecorded psychoeducational strategies with a voice recording or text describing their
thoughts, mood states, or perceptions or record a numerical value on the
mood thermometer. Participants were assigned to groups of five or six
and could read or listen to responses of other participants. All answers and
participant responses were stored on the mobile phone. The recorded
responses were accessed by the study team via their own password-protected access to the participants’ individually assigned program. Since
EBCM was not a free-standing app, but was downloaded to the VT platform, individuals did not receive tailored messages or strategies that were
customized to individual responses. The five major parts to the EBCM consisted of psychoeducation and how to identify triggers for negative or


-----

positive moods and thoughts, daily self-monitoring of moods and thoughts,
symptom management, and cognitive behavioral strategies using a tool-box
approach (see Figure 2).
Participants received an introductory session that explained basic usage
of the app, including how to create a password for their app (and their
phone, if not already password protected). To prevent unauthorized use of
the app, we instructed participants to not share their passwords with anyone. Participants were given demonstrations to practice using the app.
They created a pseudonym and recorded an introductory statement using
their pseudonym that appeared within the app with the initials of the
pseudonym. Knowledge of how to use the app was evidenced by a return
demonstration of usage.
Monitoring of response to treatment. Participants were monitored for
adherence to treatment. The PI reviewed the responses to each session on a
daily basis and offered each participant feedback based upon responses and
improvement or worsening of mood scale. Participants who did not
respond to the app by the third day received a text message reminder to
encourage use of the app.
Data Collection. Data collection for Sample 1 occurred at baseline, when
semi-structured individual interviews were used to assess demographics,
mental and physical health, and use of mental health care. Demographic
items were selected based on a review of the literature pertaining to predictors of depression (Oslin et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2014). Participants were
also asked to respond to questions about whether they owned a mobile


-----

phone, if it was a smart phone, and if they had experience using mobile
apps. At the end of the four-week intervention, the PHQ-9 was administered. All three interviewers were Spanish speakers. Data collection for
Sample 2 occurred at baseline and at the end of the five-day trial period
of EBCM.
Acceptability of the CBT-VT. Final feedback of the acceptability and
feasibility of EBCM was based upon the open-ended questionnaire developed by Ainsworth et al. (Ainsworth et al., 2013) and was administered
in a face-to-face interview. Acceptability of the contents of EBCM was
evaluated based upon open-ended and Likert scale questions in the
domains of content, technology, interaction with others, privacy, and
confidentiality. Content questions included the degree to which recommended strategies could be used in daily living, a self-assessment of
mood state after participating in the sessions, and confidence in being
able to maintain the strategies. Technology questions were based upon


-----

ease of usage, comfort level in using the app, and barriers to using
the app.
In addition, within the app, every two days, we posed a short series of
questions, “What was useful about today’s session,” “What was not useful,”
and “How can we improve the session?”
Clinical staff in Sample 2 were asked to comment on the quality and cultural appropriateness of the revised graphic images within the newly added
animations, the perceived acceptability of the contents for patients, and if
they could see themselves having a role in monitoring participants’
responses to the app.
Evaluation of Implementation and Analysis of Processes. Our framework for analysis of processes related to implementation was based upon
the determinants of practices relevant to implementing eMH in primary
care identified by Vis et al. (2018) in their systematic review of eMH for
mood disorders. These determinants included: “(1) acceptance of eMH by
patients and staff, (2) appropriateness or clinical relevance of eMH, (3)
engagement of participants [patients and staff] in implementing and delivering eMH, (4) resources for implementing and delivering eMH, and (5)
work processes in delivering eMH” (Vis et al., 2018). We used inductive
analysis to ascertain how implementation and process outcomes fit within
the above-stated implementation determinants. Interview data were
reviewed and systematically analyzed by the investigators (the first and
second author) using qualitative descriptive techniques for thematic analysis
(Braun & Clark, 2006).
We used deductive analysis to identify a priori criteria of feasibility of
implementation, based on the Cochran Criteria for bias in interventional
studies (Editorial Board, Cochrane Back Review Group, 2009; Higgins &
Green, 2011), and the researcher’s experiences recruiting in the primary
care setting, including as follows:
Recruitment. 60% of eligible participants recruited and consented.
Retention/Attrition. Less than 25% attrition

Results/Summary of findings

The first sample had a mean age of 36 and the majority of these participants were women, 15 (83%), and from the DR, 14 (78%) (see Table 1).
The other participants were from the United States and Venezuela. In this
sample, 140 were screened for depression of whom 57 (41%) screened positive for depression, 21 were ineligible to participate in the study, two
(1.4%) due to age under 18, 11 (8%) were ineligible due to lack of a smart
phone, and 8 (6%) due to severity of depression or suicidal ideation (see
Figure 3). The absence of a smart phone was more likely to occur among
participants from the clinic in Boca Chica. Of the 36 participants who met

three people were ineligible due to lack of a smart phone, two people were
ineligible due to lack of capacity on their phones, and one person was ineligible due to cognitive impairment (see Figure 4). For those participants
who could not access the app on their phones or who did not view the
entire program, the program was presented to them on a computer during
the final individual and group interviews. We elicited feedback on the content and appropriateness of EBCM for their patient population (n = 6).

Determinant 1. Acceptance of eMH by patients and staff

In response to our initial series of questions about phone usage, a large
majority of the participants had cell phones, and 81% had smart phones.

Figure 4. Subject Screening Results-–Sample 2. Clinicians.

Almost all reported interest in mobile application therapy due to its convenience, privacy, and affordability, and most found the sample of suggested CBT strategies and “advice” to be relevant, comprehensible, and
culturally appropriate.

Determinant 2. Appropriateness or clinical relevance of eMH

Clinicians and patient participants perceived that the app was clinically
relevant and appropriate. When asked if the contents were useful or not
useful, most participants responded that “todos son muy utiles,”
(“everything was very useful”) (male, Boca Chica). Clinicians felt that the
information provided in the app and for potential users with depression
was appropriate: “Sobre el contenido me parece bien porque ayuda a saber
como manejarse” (“In respect to the content, it seemed to be good, because


-----

it helps to learn how to get along”) (female, community health worker
(CHW), Santo Domingo Este). Nevertheless, the appropriateness of our
eMH intervention was diminished as a result of the design of the study
and the selection of the target population in Sample 1. These challenges
included language barriers, age, access to phones, and access to
the internet.
Language. Some participants in the clinic in Santo Domingo were ineligible because they did not speak Spanish. Although this clinic drew from a
population residing in the nearby extremely impoverished neighborhood,
we had not anticipated that the number of patients who did not speak
Spanish would be so high. Many of the patients were from Haiti and
unable to understand Spanish. The language of our app was in Spanish and
there were insufficient budgetary resources for translation, validation, and
creation of the app in Creole.
Age. Our age eligibility criteria for use of the app were limited to adults,
aged 18–64. This was due to the fact that our MHapp was based upon the
“The Healthy Management of Reality,” a program developed for adults.
There were also ethical and logistical barriers to conducting research with
minors as participants, including the lack of access to child psychiatrists.
Nevertheless, our primary care clinics primarily served young women of
childbearing age who were seeking prenatal care or vaccinations for their
children. This population was at high risk for post-partum depression, and
many met all of the other eligibility requirements for the study. However, a
number of these women were found to be ineligible because they were
under the age of 18.
Access to phones. Some potential participants did not have smart
phones. Other participants shared their phones with their family members
limiting regular access to the intervention and potentially, limiting the privacy of usage. Some participants only had access to the phone in their own
homes. They did not carry their phone with them due to fear of theft, thus
limiting access to the self-monitoring aspects of the CBT intervention. Of
the participants who had access to smartphones, the majority had sufficient
memory on their phones to be able to download the app, but some continued to experience technical difficulties, such as forgetting their password,
or subsequent damage to their phones.
Access to the internet and technological literacy. Although most people
had smartphones and access to WIFI in their own homes or at internet
cafes, they did not use their phones to surf the internet; rather, the utility
of internet connectivity was to enhance communication and social interaction through WhatsApp and Facebook. Two of the participants who were
provided the app, but did not use it, were participants who had limited
technological literacy.


-----

Determinant 3. Engagement of participants and clinical staff in
implementing and delivering eMH

Both patient participants and clinical staff had various degrees of engagement in the MHapp for entirely different reasons. Clinical providers
expressed a desire for increased knowledge and clinical capacity. In Sample
2, the completion rate over a five-day period was 17% (2 out of 12).
However, we were able to ascertain follow-up data from all but one of the
clinicians. Among those who could access the app, the most common reasons cited for noncompletion were lack of time, technical difficulties, such
as slowness of the internet and inability to download the videos, forgetting
their log-in, and security features on the phone that prevented usage. In
Sample 1, a barrier to staff engagement was unspoken expectations and
misaligned incentives among the providers.
Clinical staff-misaligned incentives. In the clinics selected by the
Ministry of Health, the doctors who had been trained in mhGAP were
informed of the study, had met with the PI and Co-Investigators and discussed the goals of the program. During our presentation of the research
project, we assessed the doctor’s willingness to participate in the implementation of the research. Providers were informed that they would be responsible for screening and referring patients with elevated levels of depression,
in accordance with their prior mhGAP training. The two providers in each
of two sites stated that their motivation for participation was to potentially
enhance identification of depression, increase access to care for patients
with depression, and to increase staff capacity in understanding of depression. Both providers were offered the opportunity to participate as CoInvestigators upon completion of the Human Subjects training, provided
by the first author. The Principal Investigator (first author) had previously
facilitated this training for Co-investigators and Research Assistants, who
were compensated for the time dedicated to training. For one of the two
doctors, a non-stated incentive for participation was the expectation of
what she referred to as an “incentivo” or a personal direct payment for herself and the clinic staff. This expectation was expressed as a demand for
payment one day prior to commencement of the research and equal to
approximately one month’s salary. Due to the fact that this physician had
not completed Human Subjects training, we had not defined a researchspecific role for her. Her role was consistent with usual clinical day-to-day
responsibilities. To facilitate the implementation of the study, we created
additional non-research responsibilities related to coordinating student
learning experiences, and the physician was remunerated.
Engagement of patient participants. Participants who used the app
were engaged and reported that they found the advice helpful. Per comments within the app and one of the final interviews, EBCM offered good


-----

advice, reduced stress, and they felt comforted by knowing that other people were experiencing similar feelings. Both patient participants who completed the final evaluations would recommend the app to other people.
Within the app participants volunteered: “escucho sus consejos e aprendido
mucho m�as a yevar un estilo de vida m�as relajado sin pensar mucho en
cosas que no sean constructivas” (“I listen to the advice and I have learned
a lot about how to have a more relaxed lifestyle without thinking too much
about things that are not constructive”) (female, Santo Domingo). “Buen
del temometro me siento bien. No estoy enfadada. Eso me ayuda esta mas
trankila” (“Good, with the mood thermometer, I feel good. I’m not fed up.
This helps me to be more at peace”) (female, Santo Domingo).
Only one person expressed negative feelings about the app. During the
final interview, she voiced her ambivalent feelings that although she liked
the interaction with other people and she felt good knowing that other people were having similar experiences, she did not like to share her feelings in
public. She did not fully understand the messages in terms of content and
only found some of them to be useful, such as the breathing exercises. Her
personal problems and difficulties at home continued. Moreover, although
she did receive personal responses to her comments, she was looking for a
greater level of tailored responses, rather than the initial prerecorded messages that were directed at the entire group. She had really wanted individual
psychotherapy and misunderstood the limitations of the app.
At least five participants responded several times a week. However, most
participants failed to use EBCM for the entire four-week duration (see
Figure 3). In Sample 1, the completion rate for the entire four weeks was
8.33 (3 out of 36), and a third of the participants in Sample 1 who had
started using the app could not be reached for follow-up. There were
numerous logistical and emotional barriers to use, some of which could
not be fully determined in this study due to a low retention rate which did
not meet our a priori criteria for retention (see Figure 3). When contacted
by phone during the period of the intervention, a few participants stated
that they were unable to complete the program due to difficult life circumstances, including employment issues, undocumented immigrant status,
child care, or elder care responsibilities. One participant reported having
used up the allotted month’s internet access in one week. Another participant reported that he thought it would be more like the apps you get in
the app store, with games and points.

Determinant 4. Work processes in delivering EBCM

Work processes are the necessary tools and methods required to carry out
and monitor the intervention. Challenges to the conduct of our study were


-----

in the areas of research design including: the time dedicated to consent and
the need for multiple clinic visits to provide access to the app; and the lack
of standardized measures to assess patient appropriateness for the intervention and monitor outcomes.
Consenting and baseline data collection. In our first sample, many participants were lost during the process of reading aloud a twelve-page consent form, and baseline data collection. Per our University’s interpretation
of IRB regulations, the consent form was required to provide sufficient
detail about the contents of each instrument, the manner in which HIPPA
would be adhered to (although HIPPA is not enacted in the DR) and separate consent forms pertaining to HIPPA and permission to record the participant’s voice during the app usage. The process of reading aloud the
consent form took over 30 minutes, which proved to be difficult for participants who were interrupting their work day to attend the clinic. Therefore,
some participants were given the consent form to read at a convenient
time and were asked to return if interested. For participants who did
return, the multi-step process of accessing the app store, obtaining a gmail
account for access to the app, downloading the app, traveling to a local
store to purchase the on-going internet access for use of the app, demonstrating the app, and ensuring knowledge of how to use the app was a very
lengthy process which precluded full participation.
Lack of standardized measures. During the initial screening process, the
PHQ-9 served as the instrument to screen potential participants for depression. The PHQ-9 was selected due to its ability to validly and reliably
measure depression across cultures (Huang, Chung, Kroenke, Delucchi, &
Spitzer, 2006). In a United States sample of primary care patients, which
included Spanish speakers, there were a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity
of 88% for major depression at a score of greater than or equal to 10 based
on a structured clinical interview (Kroenke et al., 2001). Nevertheless, in
the absence of a population-based validation of the PHQ-9 in the DR, and
the lack of research capacity to conduct a structured clinical diagnostic
interview for sensitivity and specificity analyses, we really could not be sure
if the recommended cut-point of scores of 5, 10, and 15 referring to mild,
moderate, and severe depression were valid in the DR. Participants may
have been enrolled who did not have depression. In fact, a recent study of
primary care patients in Spain suggests that 12 is a more valid cut-point
for diagnosing depression than the usually recommended cut-point of 10
(Munoz-Navarro, 2017). In conjunction with the medical provider at the
site, we performed an extensive clinical interview with patients who indicated suicidal ideation or moderately severe to severe depression (scores of
15 and above). Nevertheless, this clinical interview did not meet the gold
standard of a structured clinical diagnostic interview, and it is possible that


-----

people with severe depression who should have been excluded from the
study remained in the study. Lastly, in discussions with the co-investigators
and medical providers, it was determined that the question regarding suicidal thoughts was not worded in the best manner to elicit an accurate
response. Thus, the wording was subtly modified to add in a more culturally acceptable “Are there times when you feel tired of living? Do you feel
that everything would be better if you were not living?” rather than “Do
you have thoughts that you would be better off dead?”

Determinant 5. Resources for implementing research and delivering EBCM

A number of barriers were encountered that affected research implementation including lack of research capacity and lack of government prioritization of integrated behavioral health care.
Lack of research capacity. There are a limited number of mental health
services researchers in the country. Most faculty with doctoral degrees are
fully engaged in teaching and administration and most mental health professionals are not engaged in research. The lack of protected time for
research that is characteristic of many institutions of higher education in
the United States is even more pronounced in academia in LMICS. The
IRB in our affiliated University was not fully functioning. Moreover, clinicians in LMICs are not trained in research, nor provided incentives to conduct research other than surveillance activities. Graduate students who
were serving as Research Assistants had not had the opportunity to participate in clinical trials and had minimal training to conduct qualitative interviews, ensure fidelity to the intervention, and create plans for data
management and analyses.
Mental health services infrastructure. Government clinics were selected
based upon their participation in mhGAP, and thus, the providers in the
primary care clinics selected for this study were familiar with depression
screening instruments and evaluation of depression. However, due to limited resources, full implementation and outcomes evaluation of mhGAP
had not been undertaken. Regular screening for depression was not occurring, and linkages for referrals to mental health providers had not been
fully established at the onset of the program, but were developed as the
program progressed.
Our third clinical site, the UNAP in Santo Domingo Este, represented
the ideal structure for integrated behavioral health. All of the staff had had
mhGAP training, rather than one or two physicians (as was the case in the
previous sites), so although depression screening was not taking place, there
was greater mental health literacy among the clinic staff. Nevertheless, the
integration of EBCM into the daily work flow of the clinic would prove to


-----

be difficult. As there was no routine screening process for mental health
disorders, identifying those in need of interventions was based solely on
clinical judgment and many patients had unaddressed mental health needs
(according to the mental health providers). Moreover, in our meeting with
clinical staff to establish a feasible workflow in terms of how patients using
the MHapp could be monitored and who would be the best person to
monitor the patients, the Medical Director volunteered that the CHWs had
the most flexible schedules and could take on this task. However, our interviews with the staff presented a differing viewpoint. When asked if it would
be possible to dedicate 20 minutes a day to reading and responding to
patients within the app the CHWs had the following comments:

“Bueno, yo no tengo tiempo. No se los dem�as” (“Well, I don’t have time. I don’t
know about the rest”) (CHW).

And nurses also: “Yo sal�ı desde las 7 de manana de mi casa~ ” (I leave from my house
at 7:00 in the morning) (Nurse).

“Yo creo que eso depende de la disponibilidad de cada persona” (“It depends on the
availability of each person” (CHW).

Discussion and proposed solutions

Lessons learned from implementation of an MHapp in primary care in the
DR are both positive and negative. The challenges encountered in these
pilot studies can be viewed as evidence of failure or part of the incremental
steps necessary to build future success. Corresponding to our determinants
of practice outlined above: acceptance, appropriateness, engagement, work
processes, and resources, we propose four key strategies to address the
challenges to implementation of a technologically-based intervention in a
middle-income country: 1) understanding of characteristics of end-users; 2)
engagement of key stakeholders; 3) working within the existing infrastructure to increase capacity and ensure effective work processes; 4) addressing
the social determinants of health; and 5) building upon strengths.

Understanding of characteristics of the end user

The lengthy process of app development can result in obsolescence of
technological interventions before they are implemented in the real world
setting. Therefore, understanding the end-user in terms of motivations,
user characteristics and environment are critical. We utilized these principles to assess potential usability and acceptance and developed a greater
appreciation of sociocultural differences in population health needs and
mHealth usage. We also recognized the necessity of including service users


-----

and caregivers in participatory research, planning, and policy making
(Semrau et al., 2016).
One of the notable characteristics of the end user we encountered was
the youthfulness of the primary care population and child-bearing population relative to that of the United States. The DR has one of the highest
rates of adolescent pregnancy in the Caribbean and globally (Pantaleon,
2015). Adolescent mothers who are without resources and social support
are at high risk for post-partum depression. MHapps that incorporate CBT
methods are effective for this population (Kauer et al., 2012), and therefore,
the age of eligibility for investigations of MHapps in countries with high
rates of adolescent pregnancy should be lowered to include these potential
participants.
Strategies to enhance retention and adherence. The issues we encountered in respect to retention and adherence are not unique to LMICs. In
fact, studies conducted in HICs have shown a completion rate for internet
treatment to be as low as 1% with an initial log-in rate of 10%
(Christensen et al., 2009). The science of persuasive system design provides
an evidence basis for elements of mHealth interventions that increase
adherence (Kelders, Kok, Ossebaard, & Van Gemert-Pijnen, 2012).
Persuasive technology includes both human-computer interactions and
computer-mediated communication (Kelders et al., 2012). Elements of persuasive technology used to support behavior change can be grouped
according to Primary Task Support, Dialogue Support (also referred to as
Social Accountability), and Social Support (Mohr, Cuijpers, & Lehman,
2011). Primary Task Support includes reducing complex tasks into simplified behaviors and ensuring that participants are familiar with the language,
concepts, and terms that are used in MHapps prior to deployment (Latif
et al., 2017).
Consistent with the findings in our research, due to global migration and
ethnic diversity, language diversity has been identified as a key barrier in
the use of MHapps in LMICs (Brian & Ben-Zeev, 2014). There are many
countries that use multiple languages in the same conversation which
requires that the user interface be designed accordingly (Chiu, Dimaras,
Downie, & Gallie, 2015). Alternatively, imagery and graphics can be used
to remedy low-literacy and language barriers (Medhi, Prasad, & Toyama,
2007). Design recommendations to improve the usability for low-literacy
populations and non-native speakers would include the provision of voicebased interfaces (e.g., spoken instructions and audio annotations), local language support, and the minimization of complex navigation and inputs
(Medhi et al., 2011).
Our use of existing software, VoiceThreadVR, allowed us to fully utilize
the ACTS model and develop and evaluate the design of the app without


-----

concerns about the cost or time dedicated to modify an app specifically
developed for this particular intervention. In our successive iterations of
the design of EBCM, we employed another aspect of persuasive technology
by targeting our messages and imagery to a Caribbean primary care population. Based on the characteristics of the sample ascertained in our first
two clinics, we added animations that depicted younger women in domestic
situations and service professions (see Figure 5). We also ascertained from
feedback from participants that depression often manifests as anger, and
can result in angry outbursts at children and loved ones. We utilized this
feedback in the animations. However, when asked to react to the animations, many people judged the actions of the mother with depression
harshly. Participants felt that the degree of anger at a child who had not
done anything wrong was not normal. However, one person suggested that
this was not necessarily a person with depression, because she sees this
behavior all the time.
Social presence. Stand-alone apps for depression, anxiety, and other disorders are significantly more effective when used as guided self-help or
monitored by a health-care professional, rather than when used independently (Cuijpers, Donker, van Straten, Li, & Andersson, 2010). A provider’s
recommendation to use an app enhances adherence to the app. Social presence or the sense that there is a human interaction within the app may
help avoid the high drop-out rates in eMH research within the primary
care setting (Anderson et al., 2016). Nevertheless, MHapps are not a substitute for the sustained, trusting, and ongoing relationship that a patient has
with their provider, which in and of itself is therapeutic (Agius &


-----

Stangeland, 2016). It is important that providers are aware of the effectiveness of the app and are part of an overall systematic plan to incorporate
app usage into routine care. In our study, the absence of reinforcement of
app usage by the primary care provider may have contributed to low retention rates. Additionally, our Research Assistant for the first sample was
responsible for conducting the final interviews. She joined us after the
study had commenced and had not participated in the earlier recruitment
and data collection. Therefore, she had not had the opportunity to personally meet the participants. Her relative lack of social presence may have
contributed to the difficulties we encountered in follow-up and responsiveness among the initial sample. In contrast, we saw the participants in the
second sample on a daily basis and could trouble-shoot if they had not
logged in and we set up the expectation that their feedback was important
throughout our conversations.
Engagement of Key Stakeholders. Ensuring patient, provider, and staff
understanding, and buy-in of the new innovation is likely to increase
uptake (Hall, Fottrell, Wilkinson, & Byass, 2014; Semrau et al., 2016).
Engaging key stakeholders in critical components of design features can aid
in dissemination. Our decision to allow the staff in Sample 2 to experience
the MHapp, gain comfort in its use, and ascertain their opinions as to the
apps’ clinical appropriateness facilitated buy-in and future deployment. A
more challenging aspect of provider buy-in is the often tenuous alliance
between researchers’ objectives and the clinic’s priorities. Our needs for
data collection and exploration of clinic staff’s potential role in the dissemination and use of the app exposed work-flow barriers to real-world implementation. Nevertheless, we also identified facilitators to implementation
including the establishment of relationships with clinic staff and the provision of hands-on experiences with EBCM, the proposed intervention. We
also clearly discovered the need to assess incentives for participation.
Realigned incentives. The reliance upon funding from HICs to fund
research in LMICs is unavoidable and a necessary means to reduce global
health care disparities (Bhutta, 2002). This unequal distribution of resources
and power requires careful considerations of not only the ethical issues
involved in the research, but an understanding of the perceptions of the
collaborators and participants as to what constitutes equitable distribution
of resources within the specific domains of the collaborators’ role in the
project. A social justice perspective would seek to mitigate power differentials and argue for shared decision-making and distribution of research
funding based upon mutually agreed upon contributions to the research. A
medical provider could be considered to be assisting in the research by
screening and providing access to the participants, who are patients.
Nevertheless, the ethical issue of coercion of participants comes into play if


-----

the medical provider is receiving remuneration for recruitment of patients.
Clearly, communication is crucial to ensuring that the research goals fit the
priorities for the particular clinic, but more importantly that unspoken
agendas and expectations are ascertained. A careful discussion of the medical providers’ perceived role in the research, desired contribution to the
research, expectations of direct financial gain, and a resolution of perceived
inequities in the distribution of resources are essential components to
ensure the projects’ success. Situating the research within the existing infrastructure requires maximization of effective work processes.
Working within the existing infrastructure to increase capacity and
ensure effective work processes. Infrastructure resources consist of the
availability and quality of office rooms, telecommunications equipment,
computers, and the associated primary care processes and referral systems,
and access to consults and secondary and tertiary levels of care (Donker
et al., 2013). Integrated behavioral health care is an essential primary care
process to facilitate the implementation of eMH. Integrated health care
may include stepped care models based upon symptom presentation and
patient needs, decision support for providers, co-location of behavioral
health and physical health treatment and at a minimum, integrated funding, and outcomes measurement (Hilty, Johnston, & McCarron, 2016). The
use of mobile technology can enhance linkages between the health sector,
community, the individual, or other institutions or resources, promoting
the development of integrated primary care in LMICs. Integration eMH
and MHapps may require modification of existing workflow to support the
dissemination of the intervention. Task sharing can include non-mental
health professionals delegated to the task of telephone or SMS monitoring
of responses to treatment, which is a critical component to enhance treatment engagement and retention. To enhance sustainability, clearly defined
roles for all members of the team, including a work-flow schema, are an
essential aid to implementation (Mohr, Burns, Schueller, Clarke, &
Klinkman, 2013).
Recommendations for consenting and baseline data collection. We
developed a multi-step process of dissemination of the intervention to
enhance feasibility in the primary care setting. This encompassed modifications to baseline data collection, down-loading the app, demonstrating use
of the app and supplying internet access.
Creating a consent process that effectively conveys the purpose and participation requirements of a research study to low-literacy populations in a
culturally-sensitive manner is extremely challenging in global health
research (Igoumenidis & Zyga, 2011). At the time of this study, the standard IRB protocol required a consent to include a detailed description of the
study including funding, recruitment processes, eligibility criteria, the


-----

contents of instruments, rationale for asking for participation, risks, benefits, and contact information. Amerson and Strang (2015) suggest that this
consent process may not be the best method to ensure understanding
because participants may find the process boring and burdensome.
Therefore, they recommend that only the essential and most relevant information be included. The revised Common Rule, which goes into effect
January 2019, includes changes to the requirements for informed consent.
These changes will streamline the informed consent process for primarily
educational and non-pharmaceutical interventions.
A systematic and streamlined approach to data collection is essential to
avoid drop-out at the pre-intervention stage of the study. Through trial
and error, we developed a system for collecting baseline data and providing
access to the app in the most efficient manner. We created a bilingual
video of the protocol that could be disseminated to all research assistants
to ensure fidelity to the intervention.
Eligible participants who consented to be in the study had baseline data
collected using the Qualtrics data collection system (Qualtrics LLC, 2002).
We chose Qualtrix because it is one of the few web-based survey systems
that can also be used off-line, which is critical in LMICs. Participants were
assigned a participant identifier (e.g., CBTVT18218) and a pre-made corresponding email (e.g., CBT-VT1_8.2.18@gmail.com); this step was necessary
for the deidentification of the participants while still ensuring a way of
monitoring participants throughout the duration of the intervention. This
step also expedited the process for participants who did not have email
access or did not remember their login credentials for the sign-up process.
After assigning a participant number with corresponding email, participants
received the intervention platform via wireless downloading through their
phone’s application marketplace (App Store or the Google Play Store). The
R
application VoiceThread[V] was downloaded onto the smart phone device.
Participants logged onto the application through a pre-made account set up
by the investigators; the login credentials corresponded to the participant
number and a generic password was created in advance for efficiency.
Ensuring confidentiality and privacy. Participants set up an online
anonymous profile by accessing the “Profiles” and “Identities” tabs and changing the assigned name to a preferred pseudonym; this step allowed the participants to remain anonymous yet be able to exist as a user with a “name” on the
application. The pseudonym was matched up confidentially to the participant
number to monitor progress later in the intervention. The changes were saved
and the participant was introduced to the features of the application.
Increasing research capacity. Capacity building for policy makers, service users, and researchers is one of the most critical aspects in strengthening mental health services. A needs assessment using a SWOT analysis


-----

(identification of strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats) (Semrau
et al., 2018) can help define a systematic coordinated approach to capacity
building. Moreover, research activities need to be supported and valued by
institutions to avoid the “brain drain” and migration of experienced
researchers to HICs (Evans-Lacko et al., 2016). Clinical providers and
graduate students have limited experience in designing research, collecting
data, and analyzing results (The Global Emergency Medicine Think Tank
Clinical Research Working Group, 2017). These processes can be facilitated
through the unique features of eMH which permit data collection through
surveys, and/or in-app questionnaires as well as biometric monitoring for
real-time results. WHO has a number of manuals that provide detailed
information on processes such as “Monitoring and Evaluating Digital
Health Interventions” (World Health Organization, 2016).
Enhancing research capacity requires a number of programmatic processes including training and mentorship for all levels of research experience, identifying leaders in capacity development, using multimodal
communication strategies for distance learning and project implementation,
and providing training in outcomes evaluation to clinical sites using a
train-the-trainer approach for sustainability (Thornicroft, Cooper, Van
Bortel, Kakuma, & Lund, 2012). The contents of trainings should be tailored to individual countries (Thornicroft et al., 2012). Most efforts to
increase research capacity and strengthen provider knowledge of quality
improvement strategies entail the provision of short courses and workshops. The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) in the ethical conduct of Human Subjects Research is free and can be offered as
college level coursework in research or public health classes. For more
advanced researchers, the United States National Institute of Health (NIH)
offers a free in-depth course on how to conduct clinical research. The
Introduction to the Principles and Practice of Clinical Research (IPPCR)
focuses on biostatistical methods, study design, protocols, evaluation and
quality assurance, and is appropriate for multidisciplinary health care professionals and researchers (NIH Clinical Center, 2018).
The social determinants of health as it pertains to eMH. The social
determinants of health as it pertains to eMH comprise the environment or
conditions that affect health outcomes and decision making tasks in the use
of eMH (O’Connor & O’Donoghue, 2015). The influence of a country’s
context, contributions to health care, and income inequality have a major
influence on the uptake and dissemination of mHealth interventions. For
the effectiveness of mHealth, it is necessary to contextualize the sociocultural and health realities, as well as the availability and access to
information and communication technology (ICT), requirements in infrastructure, financing, human resources, and the delimitation of ethical


-----

principles and human rights in access to mental health care. The national
health expenditure as a percent of GDP of 2.9 for the DR is one of the lowest in the region, and income inequalities are great (Moore, Carter, Nietert,
& Stewart, 2011). Mental health is typically under-resourced in LMICS, and
local or regional providers have little input into mental health services or
policies which are allocated at a national level, often by administrators with
limited knowledge of mental health systems (Alfonsson, Olsson,
Linderman, Winnerhed, & Hursti, 2016).
We found that both providers and patients were keenly aware of the socioeconomic barriers to health and well-being. Nevertheless, it was often their
conclusion that depression was solely a product of environmental stressors.
The grinding poverty, experienced by undocumented immigrants from
Venezuela, or young single mothers, rendered the CBT strategies of our
MHapp an afterthought and almost irrelevant solution. Thus, it was important to facilitate provider communication around depression and mental illness using a language that resonated with both provider and patients.
Limitations. Our findings of a lack of feasibility may have been limited by
extraneous barriers to the completion of our study that confounded our
results. As mentioned above, our limited research capacity meant that none
of the authors had protected time to conduct the research, and all had other
full-time responsibilities. This affected the length of time dedicated to data
collection, and follow-up. Moreover, the lack of substantial funding for the
study limited our ability to hire research assistants for significant periods of
time to collect data in our absence. Although, Moore et al. (Alfonsson et al.,
2016) posit that inadequate funding can compromise a pilot study to such
an extent that it should not be undertaken, this obfuscates the inherent
biases and politics of funders in terms of who and what gets funded, and
would eliminate potentially valuable insights gained by small-scale studies,
as well as the opportunity to increase research capacity. While it is possible
that increased time and money might have led to evidence of greater feasibility, we feel confident that most of the identified barriers to the conduct of
the research would have still been present to some degree, as these barriers
represent systemic infrastructure and institutional issues. An absence of
institutional research infrastructures, including IRBs and limited trained
research personnel, lack of standardized databases, and data collection methods have affected research output in LMICs (The Global Emergency
Medicine Think Tank Clinical Research Working Group, 2017).

Conclusions

The feasibility of mHealth interventions is effected by the inherent challenges in the conduct of research studies in LMICs, including the failure to


-----

recognize local customs and host country context and to adapt research
procedures to these circumstances, while maintaining translational research
rigor (Amerson & Strang, 2015). Although many of the issues we presented
in this manuscript are unique to LMICs, translation of evidenced-based
eMH interventions remains challenging even in HICs. The low effectiveness
of mHealth interventions in the clinical setting can be attributed to the lack
of validity of research methods that isolate intervention development from
the real world setting, use an asynchronous approach to design, evaluation
and implementation; and focus on the technology to the exclusion of considerations for supportive accountability and the necessity for human presence and support (Alfonsson et al., 2016; Hilty, Johnston, & McCarron,
2016). The methodology used in this study starts with implementation in
the real world setting, and, based on participant or end-user feedback,
iteratively continues to redesign and improve upon core features of the
technology and the deployment environment. The critical issues of retention and adherence are problems encountered in well-funded, large scale
trials in HICs (Eysenbach, 2005; Waller & Gilbody, 2009). For Mhapps targeted to populations with depression, adherence is compromised by the
amotivational syndrome that is a characteristic of depression, irrespective
of the nature of the intervention (Mohr et al., 2011). However, as seen in
this study, the greatest barrier to eMH implementation is human factors,
not technological ones (Luo, Hilty, Worley, & Yager, 2006). Although we
encountered numerous challenges to our MHapp intervention, there were
unanticipated benefits and a slow but steady march towards progress. We
embarked on key processes identified in the literature (WHO, 2015) that
laid the groundwork for incorporating cultural context in the intervention.
We also developed strong collaborations which will enable us to sustain the
intervention through the iterative process of refining our product and outcomes. We developed an ongoing and effective system of communication
through WhatsApp, Free Conference Calls, and group meetings. Over time,
we helped create liaisons between primary care providers and specialty
mental health care which strengthened referral systems. Our coauthor
recently completed a much needed epidemiological study of depression in
primary care in the DR, and we have increased research capacity by training students in the Ethical Conduct of Research and offering hands-on
experience in the conduct of research. At a national level, the country’s
health indicators are improving, the economy is rapidly growing, and
extreme poverty is decreasing. Therefore, the climate is positive for
eHealth growth. Although we reported on the difficulties of implementation of EBCM, there were also unforeseen successes that suggest that
further development and implementation of MHapps is a worthwhile venture.
