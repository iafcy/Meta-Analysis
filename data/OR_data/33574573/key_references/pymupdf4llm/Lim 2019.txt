**Background: Loneliness is an emerging issue for young people, but yet many**
interventions to address loneliness in this group focus on providing social opportunities.
While these sorts of interventions may appear to increase social connections, loneliness
is more related to quality rather than quantity of social relationships. Thus, interventions
addressing loneliness should focus on maximizing the quality of current relationships.
Together with youth consumers both with mental ill health and those without, we
developed a digital smartphone application (app) called +Connect. The 6-week program
delivers positive psychology content designed to improve relationship quality. We tested
the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of the program in lonely young people with or
without a mental health diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. We used a mixed method
study design to triangulate pilot quantitative and qualitative data in young people with and
without social anxiety disorder (SAD).

**Method: Nine participants with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (Mage = 21.00; SD = 1.41)**
and 11 participants with no mental health conditions (Mage = 20.36; SD = 2.16) completed the
+Connect digital intervention.

**Results: Those with social anxiety disorder reported less acceptable ratings on outcomes.**
Feasibility ratings, measured by uptake and app completion, met a priori threshold criteria
in both groups. Those with social anxiety disorder yielded more attrition, with almost
double the attrition rate compared with those without the disorder. There were no safety
issues elicited during the pilot study. In terms of outcomes, exploratory analyses indicated
that the app itself is likely to be beneficial rather than cause harm. Our qualitative data
indicated both groups reported no negative outcomes and noted that positive outcomes
were driven by three processes: reflection, learning, and real-life application. Further
exploratory data on usability indicated room for improvement in terms of giving more
support for different components of the app (i.e., challenges).

**Conclusion: The pilot findings of this proof-of-concept app indicates some promise in**
terms of a second iterative version of +Connect.

## INTRODUCTION

Loneliness is a subjective experience of social isolation (1),
and although such aversive feelings occur across the lifespan
(2), young adults (18–29), together with older adults (65–79)
are the most vulnerable to loneliness, reporting the highest
prevalence compared to other age groups (3). Forming meaningful
relationships with others is critical to our survival, and the
lethality of loneliness is well established. Future poor health
and increased risk of death is predicted by loneliness (4, 5). In
addition, deleterious effects have been observed on various
physical health conditions, including decreased immunity (6),
increased inflammatory response (7), elevated blood pressure (8),
decreased cognitive health (9), and faster progress of Alzheimer’s
disease (10), to name a few.

The challenge of loneliness is magnified by its effects on mental
health in addition to its effects on physical health. Loneliness
is well known to be associated with increased mental health
symptoms in both clinical (11, 12) and nonclinical populations
(13–15). In longitudinal studies that examined older adults aged
50–68, loneliness predicted depressive symptomatology over
and above potential confounding variables (e.g., demographics,
stress, and social support) (16). Similarly, in a large-scale general
population study of people aged 18 to 87 years old (N = 1,010),
loneliness predicted more severe social anxiety, depression, and
paranoia across a 6-month period (17). Given these results,
targeting loneliness has the potential to prevent the development
of more severe psychiatric symptoms.

Focusing interventions on youth might have the largest impact
because loneliness and psychiatric symptoms are common in this
age group and because of the potential for secondary prevention.
In a large Danish study of adolescents and young people aged
between 16 and 29 years old (n = 5,324), being female, having low
levels of education, and living in a deprived area were risk factors
for loneliness (18). Young people aged 12 to 25 are also at high
risk of developing emerging mental illnesses (19). In the 2007
Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing,
young people aged 16–24 years have the highest prevalence of
mental disorders, but the lowest rate of receiving services in the
past 12 months (20, 21). Young adulthood is further marked
with significant life changes from leaving school or home, to
facing new social challenges such as higher education or work
(22). Such social transitions mean that young adults may be
more reliant than ever on their social networks for support (23).
Having high-quality relationships can improve the young adult’s
ability to adjust to new social environments (24, 25), buffering
the effects of loneliness (26).

Interventions aimed at fostering social inclusion and enhancing
social relationships can promote psychological well-being or
promote recovery from problematic mental health symptoms
(27). However, because loneliness is more related to the quality
of social relationships than to the quantity (28, 29), interventions
that focus solely on providing more social opportunities to the
“lonely” individual have shown minimal benefit (30). This is
because loneliness is not the same as being alone or physically
isolated and is not strongly correlated with time spent alone
(31). Hence, simply asking a “lonely” individual to join a group


or interact with others provides either transient or minimal relief
from loneliness. Cognitive models of loneliness elaborate on
the distinction between loneliness and being objectively alone.
Proponents of such models contend that while the adverse nature
of loneliness motivates “lonely” individuals to connect with
others, they are also hypervigilant to social threats, causing them
to find evidence that people are not trustworthy or accepting
(32, 33). In response, the “lonely” individual shows less prosocial
behaviors toward others in an attempt to protect him or herself
from rejection thereby eliciting rejection from others (32, 33).

The cycle outlined above suggests that a key target in reducing
loneliness is to maximize the experience of social connection
within _existing relationships by helping the “lonely” individual_
to show more prosocial behaviors toward others. A positive
psychology-based intervention provides a useful framework
when addressing loneliness as it is designed to increase the
meaningfulness of existing relationships, promote positive
emotions, and focus on thriving during adversity (34–36).
Positive psychology is the scientific study about what is right
about the individual (as opposed to what is wrong), and it
involves identifying positive characteristics, strengths, and
psychological assets, which are inherent in a person irrespective
of societal status (37).

Young people are well known to use digital tools extensively
to connect with others, but existing social media apps may favor
a large number of brief social interactions, as opposed to fewer
and more meaningful relationships or designed to increase social
support (38). Existing social media platforms carry a risk of
alienation and cyberbullying (39, 40), which might contribute
to more loneliness (41). This situation suggests the possibility
of using a more positive app to build on strengths and reduce
loneliness. This possibility comports well with the increase in
digital platforms to either augment face-to-face mental health
interventions or to simply engage young people who would
otherwise not engage in mental health intervention (42).
Although a digital health intervention that can deliver evidencebased health information is highly valuable and preferred by
young people (43, 44), significant resources for development and
testing are required.

We developed a proof-of-concept digital tool to address
loneliness in young people. +Connect is a 6-week smartphone
intervention using a strengths-based positive psychology framework.
It is gamified and engaging. It delivers videos and posts daily in an
attempt to convey evidence-based concepts known to strengthen
relationships and increase social connections. Over 2015–2017,
young people aged 18 to 25 participated in a series of focus
groups. The groups included members that ranged from young
people with no mental ill health, to those with a history of high
prevalence disorders (e.g., depression, social anxiety) to those
with psychotic disorders. Feedback from initial focus groups
also recommended that content should be delivered in short
but frequent bursts (as opposed to longer and dedicated time)
(45). We opted to develop a smartphone app over other digital
platforms because of its mobility and accessibility (46–48). The
group then provided feedback on design (i.e., fonts, colors,
layout), functionality (e.g., task completion and gamification),
and language (e.g., written task and video content).


-----

In a pilot study, we employed a mixed methods approach using
both quantitative and qualitative data in order to deepen our
understanding of how young people experience +Connect. The
primary study aim was to examine the acceptability, feasibility,
and safety of +Connect in young people with or without
social anxiety disorder. First, we anticipated that +Connect
would be acceptable to both groups of young people. This
would be demonstrated by participants reporting higher than
_somewhat in their satisfactory and helpfulness ratings across_
a series of criteria, including understanding, enjoyment, and
content helpfulness.

Second, we anticipated that +Connect would be feasible
across three key factors: uptake, attrition, and app completion.
For uptake, we anticipated that at least 50% of people who were
interested would attend a baseline assessment. For attrition, we
anticipated no more than 30% attrition rate for both groups. We
further considered a participant to be a drop out if he or she
ceased using the app for >3 consecutive days, and the researchers
were unable to contact the participant. For app completion, we
hypothesized that participants would complete at least 70% of
the program (equivalent to 30 of the 42 days of content). We
explored other possible feasibility factors via the qualitative
interview. Third, we anticipated that +Connect would be safe to
use for lonely young people and to assess safety, we measured
the number of adverse events that occurred during the course
of the study.

Fourth, in an exploratory analysis, in order to determine
if the intervention reduces loneliness severity, we estimated
the plausible effect size of +Connect on loneliness ratings
_via_ a latent trajectory model in an exploratory analysis. We
included measures of mental health such as social anxiety and
depression symptom severity that could influence loneliness
severity. Last, in a second exploratory analysis, we measured
the usability of the app (e.g., functionality, navigation) and
acceptability ratings around the app design, concepts, and
delivery components.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

 +Connect Application Information
We opted to relay socially oriented content via video material
wherever possible. We developed three types of videos: 1) shared
experience videos (SEVs) using young people with lived
experiences of loneliness (49); 2) expert videos (EVs) featuring
academics (50), or 3) actor[1] videos (AVs) demonstrating concepts
_via_ modeling (51), all of which have already been utilized in
previous digital interventions.

Key concepts relayed via a smartphone app means that
content had to be concise and frequent as opposed to other
internet delivered interventions, which may require longer
but more infrequent discrete blocks. +Connect’s program
was designed to be delivered in less than 5 min over 42 days
(6 weeks). Participants are shown a home screen when they
opened the app. They were asked to log their mood states using a

mood evaluation tracker. They are then directed to a task which
was delivered either: 1) via text and images (e.g., an Instagram
format); 2) SEVs featuring young people with lived experiences;
3) EVs featuring academics introducing core concepts; or 4) AVs
featuring actors who would model interactions within specific
social contexts.

Videos were designed to be brief (i.e., 1.21 to 4.38 min). AV
scripts were written by a scriptwriter (under 25 years of age) and
reviewed in a series of focus groups with young people (students,
those with a history of high prevalence and serious mental
illness). Two coders unrelated to this study (graduate students
under clinical training) rated the content of each SEV on whether
it achieved the aims of the modules (e.g., gratitude video: to relay
that expressing gratitude can feel awkward at first, and it is more
than saying thank you). These processes meant that material
was checked and refined to ensure that concepts were simple to
understand, youth friendly, and relatable. Participants completed
daily tasks and were asked to answer a series questions related to
the post or video, using a multiple choice or True/False format.
Daily tasks did not exceed past 5 min. The gamification processes
include winning points and badges through task completion,
mood monitoring logins, progress through the app, and winning
challenges (52–54). **Supplementary Table 1 outlines what was**
delivered within +Connect app. The content was developed by
ML, JG, TR, and DP. There are different tasks (e.g., the gratitude
exercise, showing gratitude) that can sit under one general
module (e.g., Gratitude).

## Participants
Twenty participants aged 18 to 23 years old were recruited for the
study. Nine participants with social anxiety disorder (M = 21.00,
_SD = 1.41) were recruited from a local youth health service, while_
11 participants with no diagnosable mental health disorder (M =
20.36, SD = 0.52) were recruited through convenience sampling
from an Australian university. See Table 1 for more participant
demographic information.

## Materials
Participants attended three assessments: Time 1 (T1), baseline;
Time 2 (T2), post-treatment (after completing at least 33 days of
+Connect); and Time 3 (T3), 3-month follow up (conducted 3
months after the T2 assessment). All measures were administered
at all timepoints except for a) the Structured Clinical Interview
for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(SCID-5-RV; 55), which was only administered at baseline,
and b) the qualitative interview, which was conducted only
at T2.

The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID-5-RV; 55)
The SCID-5-RV depression and social anxiety modules were
administered at baseline to determine the study eligibility and
clinical diagnosis for the SAD group. Thirty percent amount of
the assessments was randomly selected and independently rated
by another coder with 100% agreement on diagnosis.

_SAD refers to social anxiety disorder._

The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS; 34)
The UCLA-LS, a 20-item self-report scale, was used as a measure
of loneliness severity. It uses a 1 (Never) to 4 (Always) Likerttype scale. The measure consists of both positively and negatively
worded items that assess loneliness (e.g., How often do you feel
that you are no longer close to anyone)? The UCLA-LS has been
shown to correlate negatively with life satisfaction and perceived
social support, thus supporting its convergent validity with
related constructs (56). Internal consistencies αs ranged from
0.90 to 0.95 across time.

The Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; 56)
The original SIAS is a 20-item self-report questionnaire that
measures anxiety-related reactions to different social interactions
(e.g., I get nervous if I have to speak with someone in authority).
The 17 _straightforwardly-worded items (S-SIAS) were found_
to be more valid indicators of social interaction anxiety than
the reverse-scored items across different samples (57). For this
reason, we used the straightforward items. Internal consistencies
ranged between αs = 0.91 and 0.94 across time.

Centre for Epidemiological Studies – Depression
(CES-D; 58)
The CES-D is a 20-self-report measure of depressive symptoms,
which employs a 0 (rare or none of the time) to 3 (most or all of
the time) Likert-type scale. Scores are summed to create a total
score indicative of depression symptomatology, where higher
scores indicate the presence of more symptomatology. The


CES-D has strong internal reliability (58). Internal consistencies
for the CES-D ranged from αs = 0.88 to 0.90 across time.

Semi-Structured Qualitative Interview
Participants were invited to complete a semi-structured interview
regarding their experiences using +Connect at T2. The questions
are provided in Table 2. The interview was transcribed verbatim
prior to analysis.

## Design and Procedures
Human research ethics approval was obtained from the university
ethics board, and written informed consent was obtained from
participants. We recruited young people who were assessed to
be lonely. There were two groups: 1) young people with social
anxiety disorder and young people with no current mental health
disorder. Participants with social anxiety disorder were recruited
_via their case manager at the local youth mental health service._
A student group was recruited via print media placed around the
local university. All potential participants were first screened via
telephone to assess their eligibility for the study. See Table 3 for
inclusion–exclusion criteria for each group.

The research assistant administered the UCLA Loneliness
three-item scale (59) over the telephone; those who scored 5 or
more and did not meet the exclusion criteria were invited to a
face-to-face baseline assessment, during which they completed
the remaining measures. At the baseline assessment, participants
provided consent to the study and complete the UCLA-LS. The
research assistant scored the scale and proceeded with the SCID5-RV if the score is above 38. The SCID-5 was audio recorded in
order to conduct inter-rater reliability on the clinical diagnosis.
Participants were excluded at this point if they met any of the
exclusion criteria. Participants who were assessed to be eligible
then completed the remaining assessments.

Once participants completed the baseline assessment,
research assistants introduced and oriented the participant to
the app (i.e., completing the first day with the participant).
The participant was briefed on the purpose, design, and
functionality of the app, and shown how to navigate the
different components. Researchers were able to monitor
the progress of the participants via a webpage. Participants
were contacted weekly for brief check in (either via text or
a phone call). This was conducted to ensure technical issues
were reported swiftly and to identify and address emerging
risk issues during the course of the study. Participants were
reimbursed for the completion of each assessment ($15/h). If
they completed every day of the app, they were reimbursed up
to $1.90 per day. This was done to offset the cost of data use
outside WIFI zones.

## Data Analytic Plan
A mixed methods approach included both descriptive statistics
and qualitative analysis. Specifically, participant interviews and
qualitative survey responses were analyzed using content and
thematic analysis. These data were used to support quantitative


data. An exploratory analysis using a latent trajectory model
of the UCLA-LS was also used to estimate the effects of the
intervention on young people. Bayesian estimation was used in
Mplus (60) to provide a credible interval for the intervention’s
effect over time, assuming a linear slope across reporting
periods. We consider these analyses exploratory because they
were clearly underpowered to detect anything but a large effect
size given the sample size. We also reported Cohen’s _d for_
effect size. Consistent with all pilot interventions, acceptability,
feasibility, and safety are the primary outcomes. _Acceptability_
was assessed at post-intervention using satisfaction ratings
on questionnaires, content helpfulness ratings, and qualitative
interview data that support these measures. Feasibility was
assessed by considering four key factors: uptake, attrition,
retention, app completion, and engagement. Uptake was defined
as the number of potentially eligible young people who attended
the baseline assessment. _Attrition was defined as the number_
of participants who attended the baseline assessment but failed
to log into the app for more than three consecutive days and
where researchers were unable to contact the participant. _App_
_completion was defined as accessing and completing at least_
70% of the app (30 out of 42 days). Consistent with most pilot
interventions and recommendations (61), we also measured
_Safety, which was operationalized as the incidence of serious_
adverse events (e.g., hospitalization and self-harm) during the
course of the study (62).

## RESULTS

 Acceptability
App Satisfaction Ratings
We set _a priori_ threshold of outcome satisfaction ratings
of more than 70% of participants in each group would rate
higher than _somewhat satisfied in their satisfactory ratings_
(that ranged from very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, not at all
_satisfied) across a set of criteria relating to different outcome_
ratings regarding ease of understanding, enjoyment in life,
and content helpfulness. **Student app satisfaction ratings.**
Around 72.73% of participants in the student group said
that they were somewhat or very satisfied with each outcome
criterion (see **Table 4). Furthermore, all participants found**
+Connect easy to understand; however, 18.18% to 27.27%
reported being not at all satisfied with several components of
+Connect, including increasing social confidence and creating
new relationships. See **Table 4 for details of the outcome**
satisfaction ratings. **Social anxiety group app satisfaction**
**ratings. As shown in Table 5, at least 50% of participants in**
the social anxiety group rated themselves as either somewhat
or very satisfied with each of the outcome criterions. Similar
to students, all of the participants with SAD reported that
+Connect was easy to understand and helped them accept
their mental health symptoms. However, 25.00% to 50.00%
reported being not at all satisfied with several components of
the app, including creating new relationships and increasing
social confidence.

App Content Helpfulness
Additional acceptability questions related to how helpful the
content was. **Student group content helpfulness. Overall,**
students tended to find the modules of +Connect helpful, with
27.27% to 81.81% reporting the modules to be either helpful or
_very helpful. If we extend positive ratings to include_ _somewhat_
_helpful, we see that 91.01% to 100% of the participants reported_
+Connect to be helpful. In interviews, student participants
reported Three Good Things as their favorite module (n = 7),
e.g., “I found the ones that were about how to make you feel better
_about yourself. So ones like three good things, for example….those_
_bits I found most helpful.” Those modules that students reported_
most as not relevant in their lives were self-disclosure (n = 2)
and balanced relationships (n = 2). This was primarily because
they felt they were “already aware of all that stuff” or had not
experienced a situation in which the information would be
relevant, i.e., _“Balanced relationships … I really didn’t relate to_
_myself because I never had like that kind of relationship where it_
_was always imbalanced or one-sided.”_

All students found the shared experience and expert videos
_somewhat or very much useful and enjoyable, while 81.81% of_
students found the actor videos were useful and 72.72% rating
them as enjoyable (see Supplementary Table 2 for details). This
differed somewhat from the qualitative findings; while four
students reported preferring the shared experience videos, one
student found them boring and hard to relate to, “Because when
_people actually shared their experiences, they are feeling that_

**TABLE 5 | Post-intervention outcome ratings of the +Connect for the SAD group.**


_emotion, but you can’t feel that.” Three students instead reported_
a preference for the actor videos. However, a further two
student participants reported finding the actor videos “kind of
_forced,” “kind of creepy,” and “fake.” Three participants reported_
the expert videos as their favorite type of video.

**Social anxiety group content helpfulness. Overall, participants**
with SAD tended to find the modules of +Connect helpful with
25% to 100% reporting modules to be either helpful or very
helpful (see **Supplementary Table 3 for details). If we include**
somewhat helpful as a positive rating, we see that 75.00% to 100%
of the participants with SAD reported +Connect to be helpful.
In interviews, participants with SAD also reported Three Good
Things as their favorite module (n = 3). Two participants with
SAD reported that the savoring module was not relevant in their
lives as “It felt a bit wishy washy and I didn’t really know how to
_relate that too much of my life.”_

Participants with SAD reported a different pattern of
preference for the video types in comparison to the student,
in that 87.50% reported shared experience videos as being
_somewhat or very much useful, while 75.00% reported them being_
_somewhat or very much enjoyable. This was supported, in part, by_
the qualitative results; five participants with SAD endorsed the
shared experience videos as “genuine,” “inspiring,” and _“easy to_
_relate to,” while two participants with SAD felt that the content_
was sometimes “fake” or “not relevant to [their] own experience.”
For the expert and actor videos, 75.00% of the participants with
SAD rated the videos as _somewhat_ or _very much useful, while_

only 50.00% rated the expert videos as either somewhat or very

over the shared experience videos as “you actually see how they

participants with SAD agreed with the student participants who
found the actor videos “a bit cheesy.”

## Feasibility
Uptake
We set _a priori_ threshold of at least 50% of people who were
eligible would attend a baseline assessment. **Student uptake:**
One hundred and one participants initially expressed interest
in participating in the project over a 10-month period. Fiftyone students did not want to participate in the context of a
research project but were given access outside the trial. Of the
remaining 50 students, 22 were found to be potentially eligible
after the initial phone screen; the remaining 28 were screened
out primarily for not identifying as lonely or needing to connect,
exceeding the age requirements, or having a mental illness. Of
the 22 people who were potentially eligible for the study, we were
unable to contact two participants for a baseline assessment,
leaving only 20 participants who were invited to a baseline
assessment. Hence, the uptake was around 90% with 2 out of 22
participants (around 91% uptake). Social anxiety group uptake.
Nineteen young people were presented as potential participants
from a local health service over a 12-month period. Two of
these people were non-responsive to telephone attempts, while
two people were ruled ineligible for the study during the phone
screen for substance abuse (one participant) and increased risk
to safety (one participant). The remaining 15 people were eligible
to complete the baseline assessment, and of these, two people did
not attend the baseline or did not finish the baseline assessment.
The remaining 13 participants were enrolled in +Connect.
Therefore, the uptake for social anxiety is around 13 out of 15
participants (around 87% uptake).

Attrition
We set a priori threshold of a 30% attrition rate for both groups.
**Student group attrition. There was a rate of 15.38% with two**
participants dropping out of the study citing no reason. **Social**
**anxiety group attrition. There was an attrition rate of 30.76%**
with 4 participants out of 13 dropping out of the study, and the
only reason cited was time commitment.

App Completion
We set a priori app completion rate of 70% (30 out of 42 days)
for both groups. **Student group app completion. Participants**
completed 90.26% of the app (M = 37.91 days, _SD = 5.09)_
exceeding the a priori requirement of 30 out of 42 days. Social
**anxiety group app completion. Participants (n = 9) completed**
approximately 84.66% of +Connect (M = 35.56 days, SD = 7.78),
exceeding our a priori requirement of 30 days out of 42.


Other Feasibility Factors
There were additional feasibility factors relating to time burden,
and difficulties with app components that were elicited. **Time**
**burden. Around 78.95% of the participants (15/19) found that**
the app did not create a significant time burden, reporting they
used the app for 3 or more minutes per day, while the remaining
21.05% (4/19) reported using the app less than 3 min per day[2].
In interviews, one SAD and one student participant reported
difficulties with the length of the strength challenge, and one
SAD participant reported difficulties with the longer videos,
i.e., “When they started becoming four minutes and such, they got
_really really difficult to concentrate on them, or just like, find the_
_time to actually do that.”_ **Maintaining engagement. The greatest**
difficulty participants with SAD reported during interviews was
remembering to complete the challenges and tasks (n = 5), e.g., “It
_was quite difficult to remember for me. Cos you know, even though_
_like occasionally it would give me like a notification say I’ll forget_
_to do it because I might have like gone to work or you know, I’ve_
_got uni work I’m doing or whatever. I tried at one point to make_
_it like a daily thing where I’d wake up and I’d do it. But that didn’t_
_really work out. So it was hard to keep consistent.”_ Conversely,
only two student participants reported difficulties remembering
to complete the app. It seemed that for student participants, it
became part of their routine more easily, i.e., “doing the app was
_just a daily task and then I think because there were some coming_
_around it was just making interest to like continue on with the_
_app.” This may partly be due to more control participants (n = 4)_
reporting being motivated by the app gamification than clinical
participants (n = 1). **Difficulties with app components. Three**
participants with SAD also reported difficulties completing the
challenges. This seemed to be primarily due to social anxiety
severity levels, i.e., “these kind of challenges I thought would take
_a lot of confidence in me. I just procrastinated on them a bit.”_
Participants suggested breaking down the challenges into smaller
and shorter components to make completion easier, i.e., “maybe
_simple, easy challenges like ‘today, compliment a stranger’s outfit’_
_or something. I think if I did those kind of exercises each day, it will_
_help me a lot in my social anxiety.”_

## Safety
No participant in either group reported any adverse event during
the program.

## Health and Wellbeing Outcomes
First, we report the descriptive scores, means, and standard
deviations across the two groups across time (see **Table 6 for**
descriptive statistics). Because our intent was to be descriptive,
we do not provide tests of between-group differences, but we do
describe changes over time within group. Next, we used a latent
trajectory model of the UCLA-LS to estimate the effects of the
intervention on young people. Bayesian estimation was used in
Mplus (60) to provide a credible interval for the intervention’s
effect over time, assuming a linear slope across reporting periods.

2Due to a technical issue with the survey, one participant did not contribute to the
feasibility, acceptability, and usability ratings of the +Connect App.

Student Group Descriptives
The UCLA-LS, S-SIAS, and CES-D scores decreased from
baseline to post-intervention and 3 months post intervention.

Social Anxiety Group Descriptives
The UCLA-LS and S-SIAS scores decreased in a linear trend
from baseline to 3 months post-intervention for the SAD
group. However, CES-D scores decreased from baseline to posttreatment, but scores appeared to regress toward their baseline at
the 3-month post-intervention period.

Combined Exploratory Quantitative Outcomes
Across the entire group of participants, loneliness showed a mean
negative slope (M = −3.82, 95% Credible Interval [CI] −5.54 –
−2.17). On the average, participants’ UCLA-LS scores decreased
by 7.64 points (where the standard deviation at baseline was
8.11) by follow-up, suggesting a large effect (Cohen’s d = 0.94).
If anything, results were stronger for students than the group
overall (M = −4.38, 95% CI −8.45 – −0.66, _d =_ 1.12, based on
an _SD_ of 7.84). The effect appeared similar in size, although it
had a wider confidence interval for the group of participants with
SAD (M = −3.39, 95% CI −7.61 – 0.41, d = 1.20, based on an SD
of 5.61). In each analysis, the slope had a significant variance,
indicating meaningful variation in how participants responded
to the intervention.

Qualitative App Outcomes
In interviews, 75% of the participants reported at least one positive
outcome from using the app. These primarily included increased
positive affect (e.g., “When I was using it more regularly … I felt
_a lot more happy with myself”) and improved social interactions_
(e.g., “I know more friends and can talk with them more.”). Four
participants (nclin = 2, ncontrol = 2) reported no positive outcomes
from using the app, (e.g., “it only takes up such a small part of
_your day that it’s not like it changed my lifestyle in any big dramatic_
_way”). No participants reported negative outcomes from using the_
app. Positive outcomes seemed to be driven by three main processes
induced by the app: 1) reflection (nclin = 5, ncontrol = 5); 2) learning
(nclin = 6, ncontrol = 8); and 3) real-life application (nclin = 4, ncontrol = 5).

**_Reflection_**
This factor seemed to be the primary process underlying the
increase in positive affect reported by participants, e.g., “I don’t
_really tend to reflect on stuff that much and it helped me to go ‘oh,_
_I could do that, and it would be productive’.” Participants reported_


using the challenges, video content, and mood logs as ways of
stimulating reflection.

**_Learning_**
In terms of learning processes, while videos were the main
source of psychoeducational information, several participants
(nclin = 4, ncontrol = 3) highlighted the key role of the after-video
questions in their learning process, i.e., _“The questions were_
_definitely good. They were definitely smart because they made you,_
_made you watch the video. You wanted to get them right because_
_you learnt something.”_

**_Real Life Application_**
While some participants (nclin = 2, ncontrol = 2) found that the app
provided little new knowledge, they nonetheless valued how it
provided revision of existing or commonsense knowledge, e.g.,
_“this stuff you just rarely notice, but it’s just a little bit reminder_
_that you should be doing this to people around you.” This revision_
often led participants to attempt to apply the lessons in real life,
either informally, or more often, through the challenges: _“the_
_challenges … just meant that it became a lot more … like oh ‘I_
_can actually take it out into the world and do some of the things it_
_suggested’.” Participants reported finding this real-life application_
both rewarding and challenging, i.e., “I feel like I’ve, there was a lot
_of information that at first seemed like common sense, to me, but_
_although it may seem like common sense, it’s actually like important_
_that we know those things because once we actually implement it, it_
_actually makes a difference in our lives,” “Challenging? Trying to put_
_it into real life context. And actually do it.”_

Three clinical participants reported an intent to apply +Connect
skills in future social interactions, primarily due to a lack of current
opportunities to apply the skills, e.g., “because I don’t really have any
_friends or relationships [the app is] not relevant to me right now …_
_But I feel like if I got a relationship it would be helpful. I definitely_
_learned a lot, and I did take quite a bit of stuff from it.”_

## Usability
We measured variables related to functionality, design, and
delivery of concepts in order to better design a second iterative
version of +Connect. Student group usability. Overall, students
found +Connect to be a usable smartphone application with
72.72% to 100% of participants rating that they agree or extremely
_agree that +Connect was easy to navigate, the format made sense,_
and that the language was easy to understand. Similarly, 72.72%
to 100% rated that they agree or extremely agree that they liked the

color scheme, fonts, photos, and videos. This was only partially
supported by student participants’ qualitative feedback, with the
majority of suggestions for app improvement relation to app
navigation and design (n = 8)[3]. Student participants also reported
finding the app questions were too easy (n = 6) and reporting
being able to answer them correctly without watching the videos.
They suggested increasing the difficulty of the questions in future
versions. Around 27% of students did not enjoy challenges within
the app, indicating that some work is required to improve the
challenges (see Table 7 for more details). Social anxiety group
**usability. Participants with SAD found +Connect to be a usable**
smartphone application as indicated by 100% of participants
rating that they _agree or_ _extremely agree that +Connect was_
easy to navigate, the format made sense, and that the language
was easy to understand. Furthermore, 62.50% to 87.50% of the
participants rated that they _agree or_ _extremely agree that they_
liked the color scheme, fonts, photos, and videos. The qualitative
feedback of the participants with SAD mirrored that of the
student participants in conflicting with the quantitative results;
five participants with SAD suggested improvements in app
navigation and design, and five reported that the app questions
were too easy. Similar to students, those with SAD did not find
challenges particularly enjoyable. Furthermore, almost 50% of
those with SAD reported that they did not find the badge reward
scheduling system encourage participation, suggesting that a
different reward schedule either by item or reward schedules will
need to be revised (see Table 8 for more details).

## DISCUSSION

 Key Findings
+Connect is a digital intervention designed to target loneliness
in young people. Because loneliness is more related to the
quality of relationships as opposed to quantity, we employed a
positive psychology approach to help young people identify their
strengths, increase their positive affect, and focus on building the
intimacy within existing relationships. We piloted the tool in both
lonely young people with and without social anxiety disorder.

Overall, we found higher acceptability ratings across different
ratings (e.g., ease of understanding, enjoyment in life) in a
nonclinical lonely student group compared with those with
SAD, i.e., > 70% in the student group vs 50% in the SAD group
reported higher than somewhat in their satisfaction ratings.
Specifically, those with SAD reported that they did not feel that
+Connect helped them create new relationships or increase
social confidence. While +Connect was not intended to create
new relationships (rather the focus is on increasing the quality of
existing relationships), it is important to consider modifying the
app to assist young people with SAD because social interactions,
including those suggested within the app, are likely to be
significantly more difficult for them.

3Further app design feedback primarily focused on app design and navigation,
additional content, additional notifications, increased login flexibility, gamification,
and additional opportunities for social interaction. A list of participant improvement
suggestions is provided in Supplementary Table 4.


In the qualitative interview, at least four participants
with SAD reported that they preferred actor videos over
shared experience videos even though 87.5% of the group
rated the shared experience videos as somewhat useful (see
**Supplementary Table 4 for more details). All students found**
the shared experience videos more than somewhat useful and
enjoyable. While previous studies that have found that content
featuring people with lived experiences is highly acceptable
to mental health consumers with similar experiences (49, 63),
our findings also indicate that shared experience videos may
also be useful for those without a mental illness, as long as the
experience being portrayed is shared (in this case, loneliness).
Expert videos (i.e., academics speaking to the audience) were
the least enjoyable, which suggest that videos that provided
either background or summary information should be relayed in
a more youth-friendly format. Focus groups with young people
with or without a mental disorder have already been engaged
in the next iteration and have given feedback on how to relay
seemingly useful but mundane information within animated
videos instead of messages from video-recorded experts.

One strength of this study was the ability to triangulate
qualitative and quantitative data to deepen our understanding
of participants’ experiences using the app. For example, while
satisfaction ratings for different video types would suggest that,
overall, both participant groups preferred the shared experience
videos, the in-depth interview data suggests that participants
with SAD were split almost equally on their preference for
shared experience or actor videos, while student participants
were split almost equally between shared experience, actor, and
expert videos. Further, their feedback provided a more nuanced
understanding of the differences in video scores for “useful”
versus “enjoyable.” Participants seemed to prefer actor videos
based on the quality of the learning experience (i.e., usefulness),
despite reporting them as less enjoyable. This suggests that useful
content is more important to users than enjoyable content.

Uptake of the app was 91% and 87%, respectively, for students
and those with SAD. While uptake was high for both groups, the
SAD group had a higher attrition rate of 30.76% compared with
half of that with those with no mental health disorders at 15.38%.
However, for those who were retained, both groups completed
more than 70% of the program. While the consumer-focused
guidance within its development phase may have contributed
to both acceptability and feasibility ratings, these findings
suggest that clinicians and researchers have to think more deeply
about how to engage those with SAD in digital interventions.
Fortunately, +Connect was assessed to be safe for young people
with or without SAD. While the study was underpowered to
determine any meaningful difference pre-post, the evidence of
a generally positive effect in quantitative ratings was consistent
with qualitative data. No participant reported negative outcomes,
and positive outcomes were driven by reflection, learning, and
real-life application processes. In our exploratory analyses, we
found that +Connect was more likely to benefit, or at least not
cause any harm, to young people.

In order to ensure that feedback from this proof-of-concept
trial can enhance the participant’s experience in future versions,
we assessed its usability, and results indicated that participants

suggesting changing reward schedules and a student noting that

## Study Limitations and Future Directions
First, this study is statistically underpowered to determine the
significant effects of pre-post intervention. However, our findings
are supported by qualitative data that will assist in revising the
app for use in a well-powered randomized control trial. There
were several reasons related to the small N, which contributed to
poor recruitment of young people with SAD: 1) there was change
in management and clinician turnover at the recruitment site;
2) young people with SAD were particularly difficult to recruit,
plausibly due to a high social avoidance of services.

Second, it is important to take into account that many
research studies offer reimbursement to offset any potential
costs the participant may incur during the study. In this
case, participants were reimbursed to offset potential costs
when logging into the app outside WIFI networks. While the
completion of this program (84.66% to 90.26%) was high, it is
unclear whether engagement with +Connect would be different
in “real-world” settings.

Last, +Connect is merely a tool to deliver information
to young people. A more tailored approach to assist young
people to translate these skills to real life may be required for
at least some young people. Such an approach may involve
more clinician or peer interaction within safe and moderated
chatrooms. Alternatively, the app might ask users for feedback
about challenges, leading to a more titrated, multi-step
approach for participants who rate challenges as unachievable
for them. A more tailored approach may be especially helpful
for young people who are lonely, with co-occurring mental ill
health or clinical mental disorders. Feedback taken from this
proof-of-concept app can be used to develop a second iterative
version, with a focus on increasing therapeutic outcomes and
improving engagement.

## Conclusion
Our proof-of-concept app +Connect was developed with an
aim of addressing loneliness severity in young people. The
development involved consumers aged 18 to 25 with or without
a mental health disorder. In this pilot mixed methods study,
we focused on pilot primary outcomes such as acceptability,
feasibility, and safety; next, we explored the potential outcomes
of the pilot. Our findings suggest that those with SAD may
benefit from such interventions but may require more tailored
support within the app in order to address attrition. Together
with quantitative and qualitative data, there is a rationale to do
