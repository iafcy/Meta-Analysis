### Abstract


Mobile technologies can be leveraged to meet the need for evidence-based psychological
depression treatment via primary care. The purpose of the present study was to preliminarily
examine the feasibility and efficacy of a self-help Brief Behavioral Activation mobile application
(app; “Moodivate”) for depressive symptoms among adults treated via primary care. Participants
(N = 52) were recruited from primary care practices between January and December 2017 and
were randomized 2:2:1 to receive: 1) Moodivate, 2) an active control Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy-based mobile app (“MoodKit”), or 3) Treatment As Usual (TAU; no app). Participants
completed assessments of depressive symptoms weekly for eight weeks. App analytics data were
captured to examine Moodivate feasibility (analytics unavailable for control app). Moodivate
participants on average had 46.76 (SD = 30.10) app sessions throughout the trial duration, spent
3.50 (2.76) minutes using the app per session, and spent 120.76 (101.02) minutes using the app in

total throughout the trial. Nearly 70% of Moodivate participants continued to use the app one
month after trial enrollment and 50% at the end of the eight-week follow-up period. A generalized
estimating equation model examining change in depressive symptoms over time by treatment
condition indicated a significant interaction between time and treatment condition (χ[2] = 42.21, df
= 14, p < .001). As compared to TAU, participants in both app conditions evidenced significant
decreases in depressive symptoms over time, and these treatment gains were sustained across the
trial period. These results preliminarily indicate feasibility of Moodivate as well as efficacy of both
Moodivate and MoodKit for the treatment of depression among adults recruited via primary care.
Future studies should focus on larger scale examinations of treatment efficacy and effectiveness
across primary care settings.

### Introduction

Fewer than one-third of United States adults who screen positive for depression receive
treatment (Olfson, Blanco, & Marcus, 2016). Most adults with depressive symptoms make at
least one annual medical visit to a primary care physician (PCP) (Olfson et al., 2016). As
such, primary care models for the delivery of evidence-based depression treatment may
improve treatment access for those with depressive symptoms. This is consistent with
recommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), which
note that PCPs should screen, treat, and provide follow-up for all patients who endorse
depressive symptoms (Siu et al., 2016).


Psychotherapy and/or antidepressant medications are both evidence-based treatments for
depression that can be delivered via primary care. Psychotherapy can be delivered by a
behavioral medicine specialist within the practice or via referral to an external mental health
treatment provider. Although primary care patients with depressive symptoms tend to prefer
psychotherapy for depression treatment (Dwight-Johnson, Sherbourne, Liao, & Wells, 2000;
van Schaik et al., 2004), they most often are prescribed antidepressant medications without
psychotherapy as an option (Rossom et al., 2016; Shim, Baltrus, Ye, & Rust, 2011; Stafford,
Ausiello, Misra, & Saglam, 2000). One key barrier to the delivery of psychotherapy via
primary care is limited access to mental health specialty care (Thomas, Ellis, Konrad,
Holzer, & Morrissey, 2009). Within one nationally representative survey, 66.8% of PCPs
reported that they were unable to get high-quality outpatient mental health services for their
patients (Cunningham, 2009).

Mobile technologies, such as mobile applications (apps), could be leveraged to fill this
depression treatment gap (Steinhubl, Muse, & Topol, 2013). Smartphone ownership in the
U.S. has grown year over year and now 77% of adults own smartphones (Pew Research
Center, 2017), with high smartphone ownership rates across age groups (e.g., 92% of
Millenials, 85% of Gen Xers, and 67% of Baby Boomers own smartphones; Jiang, 2018).
Thus, treatment access barriers could be reduced if evidence-based psychotherapy could be

efficaciously delivered via smartphone. Apps delivered directly within primary care settings
could provide an immediately actionable, evidence-based treatment for patients in need of
services for depressive symptoms.

To address the need for disseminable, evidence-based depression treatment resources via
primary care, our team developed a self-help mobile app treatment for depression called
“Moodivate” (Dahne et al., 2017). Moodivate development was informed by the Brief
Behavioral Activation (BA) Treatment for Depression originally developed by Lejuez and
colleagues (2011) as well as our team’s prior research developing a Brief BA mobile app
(“Behavioral Apptivation”) intended to be used in conjunction with traditional face-to-face
therapy (Dahne, Kustanowitz, & Lejuez, 2018). Brief BA is an evidence-based treatment
grounded in behavioral theories, which suggest that depression is caused by a lack of
reinforcement in the environment for positive, non-depressed behaviors. The goal of Brief
BA, and by extension Moodivate, is to help the user reengage in positive, non-depressed
activities by identifying, scheduling, and completing activities. The efficacy of Brief BA for
the treatment of depression has been established across more than 10 randomized clinical
trials with diverse populations (Collado, Long, MacPherson, & Lejuez, 2014; Daughters et
al., 2008; Gawrysiak, Nicholas, & Hopko, 2009; Gros et al., 2012; Hopko et al., 2011;
Hopko et al., 2013; Hopko, Lejuez, & Hopko, 2004; Hopko, Lejuez, LePage, Hopko, &
McNeil, 2003; Jakupcak, Wagner, Paulson, Varra, & McFall, 2010; MacPherson et al., 2010;
Reynolds, Macpherson, Tull, Baruch, & Lejuez, 2011). Effect size estimates for Brief BA
are in the medium to large range indicating meaningful clinical impact (Sturmey, 2009).
Because Moodivate is directly informed by an evidence-based treatment for depression, it
may be an improvement upon the majority of commercially available mental health
treatment apps which largely do not clearly reflect evidence-based practice (Bry, Chou,
Miguel, & Comer, 2018; Neary & Schueller, 2018).


### Methods

**Participants**


Although Moodivate is based on an evidence-based treatment for depression and was
developed for utilization in primary care, the efficacy of the app as a treatment for depressive
symptoms among primary care patients has not yet been examined. The aims of the present
study were two-fold: 1) to examine the feasibility and uptake of Moodivate among adults
with elevated depressive symptoms recruited from primary care and 2) to examine the
preliminary efficacy of Moodivate as compared to both an active control depression
treatment mobile app and to treatment as usual (TAU).

Study participants were recruited between January, 2017 and December, 2017 from family
medicine/primary care clinics affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina
(MUSC). Study participants were recruited in one of three ways: 1) by physician referral
(n=26), 2) by a research staff member who sat in the waiting room of the clinics and
discussed the study with patients (n=6), or 3) via flyers posted in participating clinics (n=6;
Note that data on recruitment source were missing for 4 participants). Those interested
completed a brief screening via phone to establish preliminary study eligibility. Potentially
eligible individuals were scheduled for an in-person baseline visit at which time final study

**Procedures**


eligibility was confirmed. Study participants had to meet the following criteria: 1) between
the ages of 18 and 65, 2) currently own a smartphone, 3) report willingness to utilize a
mobile app for the treatment of depressed mood, 4) have a current, valid e-mail address that
is checked at least once per day, and 5) score of > 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8
(PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009). Because both apps utilized in this trial were only accessible
via iOS, participants who did not own an appropriate iPhone (iOS 8 or higher) were lent one
for the duration of the trial. Participants were excluded if, during the baseline screening,
they: 1) scored < 13 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown,
1996) or 2) endorsed current suicidal ideation, defined as either a response of “I would like
to kill myself” or “I would kill myself if I had the chance” on the BDI-II, or an indication of
past month suicidal ideation on the Major Depressive Episode (MDE) module of the Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-5 (Sheehan et al., 2015). For the first
three months of trial enrollment, meeting diagnostic criteria for a current MDE was an
exclusionary criterion. However, research suggests that those with elevated depressive
symptoms who do not meet criteria for a current MDE experience similar levels of
functional impairment as those with a current MDE, but are less likely to receive treatment
(Cuijpers, de Graaf, & van Dorsselaer, 2004; Judd, Schettler, & Akiskal, 2002). Thus, both
to broaden the generalizability of results and to improve the pace of recruitment, this
exclusion criterion was removed in March, 2017. See Figure 1 for CONSORT diagram.

All study procedures were approved by the MUSC IRB. Upon consent, participants
completed self-report and interviewer-administered assessments and were subsequently
randomized 2:2:1 to receive either the Behavioral Activation mobile app (Moodivate), an
active control Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) mobile app (MoodKit), or Treatment as
Usual (i.e., no app). Because clinical data are limited on other available mobile apps that
purport to treat depressive symptoms (Chan, Torous, Hinton, & Yellowlees, 2015; Leigh &
Flatt, 2015; Neary & Schueller, 2018; Price et al., 2014), we opted to compare Moodivate
efficacy to an active control mobile app in addition to TAU to extend the literature on
efficacy data for other clinical apps. We selected MoodKit (Erhardt & Dorian, 2013) as the
active control app because, at the time of trial onset, it was one of the only available mobile
apps that clearly adhered to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles. Similar to Brief
BA, CBT is an evidence-based psychotherapy for depression that may be administered via
primary care. Thus, an app-based adaptation of CBT would be a fitting active control for a
Brief BA-based app.


Across all groups, providers managed depressive symptoms as they normally did, including
possible administration of adjunctive pharmacotherapy (see Table 1 for use of
pharmacotherapy by treatment condition). Randomization was stratified by participants’
self-reported use of medication for a mental or emotional problem. In addition, to mimic
standard care practices for depression treatment via primary care, participants across all
groups were provided with a brief handout about stress management, derived from standard
patient education materials within the clinic.

Moodivate and MoodKit were provided to study participants at no cost (both currently cost
$4.99 on the iTunes App Store). If randomized to either mobile app condition, study staff
helped the participant download the app and provided a brief, scripted overview (~10
minutes) on how to use the app. Those provided with an app were instructed to use the app
regularly, at least once per day, for the duration of the study. Following the baseline visit,
participants were e-mailed assessment measures weekly for eight weeks. All measures were
completed via REDCap, a secure, web-based research data capture system (Harris et al.,
2009). Participants were compensated up to $120 for completion of all assessments.
Participants who borrowed an iPhone as part of the trial were compensated an additional $50
for return of the iPhone in working, non-damaged order within two-weeks of their trial
completion date.


**Interventions**

**Behavioral Activation Mobile App (Moodivate).—Details of the Moodivate app have**
been published previously, including suggested instructions for integrating the app into
primary care practice (Dahne et al., 2017). Briefly, Moodivate is a self-help adaptation of
Brief BA (Lejuez et al., 2011). The main components of Moodivate include
psychoeducation, identification of life areas, values, and associated activities, daily
monitoring and activity planning, mood monitoring and social support to facilitate
completion of difficult activities. Users are reinforced for continued app utilization and
completion of activities via badges that can be earned within the app.


**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Mobile App (MoodKit).—MoodKit includes**
various components of CBT including thought checking, mood tracking, journaling, and
activity scheduling. Via the thought checker feature, users identify maladaptive thoughts and
alternative, more rationale thoughts. Users track daily mood while using the app and can
view a graph of change in mood over time. The app’s journal function allows users to write
responses to a variety of templates. Via the activity scheduler, users can select from 200+
suggested activities or create a new custom activity.

The treatment components of Moodivate and MoodKit differ in several ways. First, although
Moodivate and MoodKit both incorporate activity scheduling, Moodivate appoaches activity
scheduling from a values-driven approach consistent with Brief BA. In contrast, MoodKit
prompts users to select from a suggested activities list or create a new activity, but new
activities are not generated consistent with values. Second, whereas MoodKit incorporates
the cognitive restructuring components of CBT, Moodivate does not include any cognitive
treatment components. Third, in general, Moodivate has a somewhat simpler design with
fewer treatment components incorporated into the app.


**Treatment As Usual.—Participants randomized to the treatment as usual condition**
received only the patient education materials about stress management and did not receive a
mobile app.

**Measures**


Primary outcomes for this trial include: 1) feasibility of Moodivate as indicated by app
utilization analytics (similar analytics data not available for MoodKit) and 2) change in
depressive symptoms over time as a function of treatment condition.

**Moodivate Analytics Data.—User analytics data for participants randomized to the**
Moodivate condition were available via Yahoo’s Flurry Analytics system. Specific analytics
data captured included: 1) total number of app sessions across the trial duration, 2) average
time per app session, 3) total time spent using the app across the trial duration, 4) number of
times the participant added a new value within the app, 5) number of times the participant
created a value-driven activity within the app, 6) number of activities completed across the
trial duration, and 7) weekly retention, defined as the percentage of study participants who
utilized Moodivate at least once during each week after study enrollment.


We did not have access to similar data for participants randomized to the MoodKit condition
because this app was not developed by our research team.

**Depressive Symptoms.—The PHQ-8 (Kroenke et al., 2009) was utilized as a study**
screening measure to determine whether participants were experiencing at least minimal
symptoms of depression. At baseline, participants also completed the intervieweradministered Major Depressive Episode (MDE) module of the Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-5 (Sheehan et al., 2015) to assess for current and
lifetime MDEs. A participant was given a lifetime MDE diagnosis if they met criteria for
either a current or past MDE. Across the study follow-up (including baseline), depressive
symptoms were assessed via the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996).
Scores on the BDI-II are interpreted as follows: 0–13 = minimal depression, 14–19 = mild
depression, 20–28 = moderate depression, 29–63 = severe depression.


**Statistical Analysis Plan**

Chi-square and ANOVA analyses were used to determine baseline differences in participant
demographics as a function of treatment condition. Descriptive statistics were utilized to
examine Moodivate feasibility and acceptability as indicated by app analytics data. ANOVA
was used to examine the association between Moodivate app usage and treatment response,
defined as a significant (i.e., 10-point) decrease on the BDI-II at any point during the study.
Subsequently, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model assuming a normal
distribution, identity link function, and exchangeable correlation matrix was used to examine
the interaction between time and treatment condition on BDI-II depressive symptoms
adjusting for the main effects of baseline depressive symptoms, time, and treatment
condition. Because GEE accommodates within-subject correlations across repeated
measures and utilizes all available data, it provides less biased estimates than traditional
regression approaches in analyzing longitudinal data (Hardin & Hilbe, 2002).

### Results

**Participant Characteristics**


As this was a pilot trial, we sought to keep sample size low (i.e., ~20 participants per app
group) while still providing rich feasibility and preliminary efficacy data to inform future
trials. In total, 52 participants were enrolled in the trial (n=24 Moodivate, n=19 MoodKit,
n=9 TAU). See Table 1 for participant demographics for the full sample as well as by
treatment group. There were no significant demographic differences as a function of
treatment condition. At baseline, participants on average reported experiencing depressive
symptoms in the moderate to severe depression range (BDI-II baseline M(SD) =
29.02(10.09); Moodivate = 28.08(7.83), MoodKit = 28.63(11.30), TAU = 32.33(13.03)).
Nearly all participants (94.3%) met diagnostic criteria for a lifetime MDE and 71.2% of
participants met criteria for a current MDE. Study retention was high, with 76.8% of
participants across treatment groups completing at least six of the eight follow-up
assessments. There were no significant differences in study retention between treatment
groups.


**Moodivate Utilization**

**App Utilization.—Analytics data were available for 21 out of the 24 Moodivate**
participants. Data for the remaining three participants were lost due to technical issues. All
participants used the app at least once during the trial, 71.4% of participants used the app at
least 28 times, and 42.9% of participants used the app more than 56 times (i.e., at least once
per day on average). Participants on average had 46.76(30.10) app sessions throughout the
eight-week trial duration, spent 3.50(2.76) minutes using the app per session, and spent
120.76(101.02) minutes using the app in total throughout the trial. Participants created on
average 6.10(3.22) unique values within the app, 14.71(10.22) activities across values, and
completed 52.24(89.31) activities (Table 2). Analytics outcomes did not significantly differ
as a function of whether study participants used their own iPhone or a study iPhone
throughout the trial.


**Retention.—Weekly retention data, defined as any app use within each week following**
trial enrollment, were available for 18 of the 24 Moodivate participants (retention data for
the remaining 6 participants were lost due to system upgrades within the Flurry Analytics
platform). No procedures to increase app retention (e.g., contacting participants who were
not using the app to remind them to login) were instituted by the study team during the trial.
In general, retention was high across the study duration: 88.9% of participants utilized
Moodivate at least once during the first week following trial enrollment, 83.3% during the
second week, 66.7% during the third week, 66.7% during the fourth week, 66.7 percent
during the fifth week, 66.7% during the sixth week, 61.1% during the seventh week, and
50.0% during the eighth week.

**Association Between Moodivate Usage and Treatment Response.—There were**
no significant associations between any of the Moodivate analytics metrics (i.e., total
number of Moodivate sessions, average time per session, total time spent using Moodivate,
add value event occurrences, add value-driven activity event occurrences, complete activity


Behav Ther. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 July 01.


-----

event occurrences) and treatment response. However, there was a trend toward significance
for the association between total number of Moodivate sessions and significant BDI change

[F(1,19)=4.15, p=0.056], suggesting that those who utilized Moodivate more frequently
were less likely to have a significant BDI change during the course of the study.


**Change in Depressive Symptoms Over Time as Function of Treatment Condition**

The GEE model indicated a significant main effect of baseline depressive symptoms (χ[2] =
19.29, df = 1, p<.001) as well as a significant interaction between time and treatment
condition (χ[2] = 42.21, df = 14, p<.001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were utilized to
understand the nature of the significant time by treatment interaction. Adjusting for baseline,
depressive symptoms among participants in the Moodivate condition were significantly
lower as compared to the Week 1 assessment at Weeks 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Depressive
symptoms among participants in the MoodKit condition were significantly lower as
compared to the Week 1 assessment at Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Depressive symptoms among
participants in the TAU condition did not differ significantly from the Week 1 assessment at
any other follow-up timepoint. On average, participants in the Moodivate condition had a
12.21(13.15) point decrease on the BDI-II from pre- to post-treatment, participants in the
MoodKit condition had a 13.36(11.51) point decrease, and participants in the TAU condition
had a 7.75(14.99) point decrease. In addition, 50.0% of participants in the Moodivate
condition, 52.6% of participants in the MoodKit condition, and 33.3% of participants in the
TAU condition evidenced less than minimal symptoms of depression on the BDI-II (i.e.,
score ≤ 13) at some point during the study. Among those who completed the Week 8
assessment, 52.6% of Moodivate participants, 50.0% of MoodKit participants, and 25.0% of
TAU participants had less than minimal symptoms of depression at that time. Betweengroup mean differences were not significantly different on average across time points when
adjusting for baseline depressive symptoms (Moodivate vs. TAU mean difference (standard
error) = −3.94(2.94), p=0.18; Moodivate vs. MoodKit = 1.74(2.89), p=0.55; MoodKit vs
TAU = −5.69(3.15), p=0.07). Across time points, the only significant between-group
difference in depressive symptoms was observed at the Week 6 follow-up such that those in
the Moodivate and MoodKit conditions endorsed significantly lower symptoms of
depression than those in the TAU condition (Moodivate vs. TAU mean difference =
−7.51(3.14), p=0.02; MoodKit vs. TAU mean difference = −7.68(3.62), p=0.03)). Effect
sizes for pre- to post-treatment changes in depressive symptoms for Moodivate vs. TAU (d =
0.33) and MoodKit vs. TAU (d = 0.44) were small. See Figure 2 for a graph of depressive
symptoms by time as a function of treatment condition.


### Discussion

These results preliminarily indicate feasibility of Moodivate as well as efficacy of both
Moodivate and MoodKit for the treatment of depressive symptoms among adults with
elevated depressive symptoms recruited via primary care. Across a number of indices,
Moodivate was highly feasible. These participants had roughly one app session per day and
completed one activity per day, suggesting moderate engagement. Retention was high across
the trial duration, with nearly 70% of Moodivate participants continuing to use the app one
month after trial enrollment, and 50% at the end of the trial. This is in contrast to prior trials


Behav Ther. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 July 01.

which have suggested that those who download apps for mood management tend to use
these tools as intended for no longer than two weeks (Arean et al., 2016; Rosa, Campbell,
Miele, Brunner, & Winstanley, 2015) and is also in contrast to utilization of most
commercially available apps which retain on average only 30% of users one week after
download (Sigg, Lagerspetz, Peltonen, Nurmi, & Tarkoma, 2016).

Although app usage was strong, app usage metrics were not significantly associated with
treatment response, which may be due to a lack of power to detect significant associations in
light of the small sample within the Moodivate arm. There was a trend toward significance
for the association between total number of Moodivate sessions and treatment response such
that those who utilized Moodivate more frequently were less likely to have a significant BDI
change during the course of the study. This could either indicate that the number of
Moodivate sessions negatively impacts change in depression or could indicate that those
who were more symptomatic continued to utilize Moodivate with greater frequency
throughout the trial. In future studies, it will be important to incorporate a longer follow-up
time frame to determine if those who are more symptomatic and continue to utilize
Moodivate frequently have subsequent significant decreases in depressive symptoms.


This pilot trial also suggests preliminary efficacy for both Moodivate and MoodKit for the
treatment of depressive symptoms among a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample
of adults recruited from primary care. As compared to TAU, participants in both app
conditions had significant decreases in depressive symptoms over time, and these treatment
gains were sustained across the trial period. The lack of efficacy data is a major problem
within the field of mobile health research (Neary & Schueller, 2018; Price et al., 2014) and
this study provides preliminary data speaking to the efficacy of these two mobile apps. To
our knowledge, no other clinical trial has examined the efficacy of mobile apps for the
treatment of depression with primary care patients. Future research should focus on the
improvement of these app-based treatments for depression for primary care patients and
ways to implement these treatments within primary care practices.

Beyond the specific apps studied here, this trial also provides general guidance on the
development of mobile treatments for depression for primary care patients. First, although
we developed Moodivate for iOS only and MoodKit was similarly available only on iOS,
55.7% of study participants owned an Android smartphone. We opted to provide Android
owners with an iPhone to use for the duration of the trial, a practice which has been used in
prior studies (Ben-Zeev et al., 2015). However, this approach is likely not sustainable within
real-world clinical practice. To reach the majority of primary care patients with depressive
symptoms, future mobile-based treatments must be developed for both iOS and Android
platforms. Second, although Moodivate utilization rates are promising for a pilot feasibility
trial, they still could be increased, whether by the number of activities scheduled per day, or
through activities completed per day, either of which may further enhance treatment efficacy.
Modifications to Moodivate, such as providing users with a list of suggested activities or
directing them to continue to increase their activity level throughout the treatment duration
may be useful strategies to consider for future incorporation. Additional strategies such as
engaging the primary care provider in ongoing care via the app may be useful for promoting
engagement with mobile-based treatments more broadly (i.e., Moodivate, MoodKit, and


Behav Ther. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 July 01.


-----

other treatments). At present, Moodivate is not directly integrated with routine primary care
practice, such as via integration with the electronic health record or by having a stand-alone
provider portal that PCPs could review to determine patient treatment response. This may be
an important future avenue for additional software development and may improve patient
treatment engagement. Third, any mobile app-based trial must consider the potential impact
of evolving technology on app functionality. For example, during the course of this trial,
Apple released iOS 11, which impacted calendar functionality for Moodivate participants
who upgraded their operating system. Our team released an app update to resolve the
calendar issue, which was then pushed out to all Moodivate participants enrolled in the trial
at that time. Similarly, at trial outset, we tested Moodivate on a variety of different iOS
versions and noted that app functionality was optimal on iOS 8 or later. Thus, a study
inclusion criterion was that participants needed to own an iPhone running iOS 8 or higher or
be willing to use a study iPhone for the duration of the trial. Future mHealth trials should
consider the impact of technology upgrades on intervention functionality and have systems
in place to continuously test the functionality of their intervention following new technology
releases (Mohr, Cheung, Schueller, Hendricks Brown, & Duan, 2013). Finally, in the present
trial, we selected MoodKit as our active control app given mounting data highlighting that:
1) the majority of mental health apps readily available on the consumer marketplace lack any
research support or evidence-based content and 2) mental health apps developed in academic
circles lack consumer marketplace penetration (Bry et al., 2018). MoodKit is a commercially
popular mental health treatment app (at the time of the writing of this manuscript, it was #68
within the iTunes App Store “Health and Wellness” category) that adheres to CBT
principles, yet there are no published trials examining clinical outcomes associated with
MoodKit use. To begin to fill this gap between commercially successful mental health apps
and treatment outcomes research, within this trial we sought to preliminarily examine
clinical outcomes associated with Moodivate and with MoodKit use. Similar trials in the
future may consider incorporating commercially popular mental health apps as control
treatment conditions in order to expand the literature on mental health outcomes associated
with use of these readily available apps.

Results of this study should be interpreted with limitations in mind. This was a small pilot
study and results should be interpreted accordingly. Although we found a significant time by
treatment effect such that both app conditions outperformed TAU, we may have been
underpowered to detect significant effects between the two app conditions and it is possible
that within a larger scale trial either MoodKit or Moodivate would be more efficacious.
Small sample size may have also contributed to mostly non-significant between-group
differences in BDI-II symptoms across follow-up. Although use of psychiatric medications
was similar across the three treatment groups, we did not assess duration of medication use
(i.e., whether a study participant was stabilized on medication or recently started taking a
new medication). As such, we cannot disentangle whether treatment gains were a result of
Moodivate/MoodKit use or of possible new medication use. Participants did not complete
follow-up assessments beyond eight-weeks. Thus, it is unclear whether treatment gains
would be sustained outside of this timeframe. This issue of beyond treatment assessment is
particularly complicated within the area of app-based interventions. Unless app use is
restricted, study participants can continue to use the app and engage in treatment beyond the

initially prescribed period of time. Moodivate analytics data were missing for a small subset
of participants and we did not have access to similar analytics data from MoodKit. Thus, we
were unable to compare feasibility as indicated by analytics data between the two apps.

Future larger scale efficacy and effectiveness trials within primary care will be needed for
both Moodivate and MoodKit before these interventions can be recommended for the
treatment of depressive symptoms via primary care. Early evidence from this trial offers
promise toward that goal. Furthermore, although one strength of mobile health interventions
is that they tend to be low cost and, thus, more disseminable and cost effective than
traditional in-person psychological interventions, not all primary care patients with
depressive symptoms will have improvements in depressive symptoms solely by using a
self-help app such as Moodivate or MoodKit. Future investigations of these mobile
treatments should consider adaptive treatment strategies in which the level of treatment can
be adjusted based on whether each individual patient is responding to the mHealth treatment
(Collins, Murphy, & Strecher, 2007; Murphy, 2005).
