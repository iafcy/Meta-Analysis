### Sarah Watts, Anna Mackenzie, Cherian Thomas, Al Griskaitis, Louise Mewton, Alishia Williams and Gavin Andrews[*]


Background
Depression is a commonly occurring, disabling mental
disorder [1-3]. Worldwide it is currently the fourth leading cause of disability and is expected to become the
second leading cause of disease burden by the year 2020

[4]. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown
to be effective in the treatment of depression [5,6]. However, a number of barriers prevent patients from accessing treatment. For example, three–quarters of people in
the UK with depression received no treatment, with cost
being the major barrier [7,8]. Treatments that are more
affordable and accessible are necessary.
CBT via the internet (iCBT) has been shown to be as
effective as face to face treatment for Major Depressive

Disorder (MDD) and more cost effective [9,10]. Johanssen
and Andersson (2012) reviewed 25 controlled trials of
iCBT for MDD [11]. Effect size (ES) superiority of the
intervention over the control group ranged between 0.1
and 1.2, but there were six studies in which the effect size
superiority was greater than 0.85 (mean = 1.0, NNT=2).
The intervention in one of these [12,13](ES=1.2) was the
basis of the present work.
Delivery of CBT using the internet has increased the
options available for patients with depression to access
evidenced based effective treatment. For some, using a
fixed computer may mean little or no privacy, or it may
simply be inconvenient. Moreover, a patient may want
to review the treatment lesson material in context, for
example, re-reading material on a computer just prior to
entering a challenging situation may not be feasible. For
others, access to the internet may be unreliable and this
may not be a useful alternative. It is for these reasons,

that alternative modes of treatment delivery should be
considered. Mobile applications (apps) offer a viable,
cost effective and highly accessible solution. Recently
mobile apps have been utilized to deliver health treatments [14,15] and whilst a plethora of apps are available,
evidence based, evaluated apps remain sparse. With almost 6 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide in
2011, it is anticipated that this mode of health delivery
will rise [16]. To our knowledge, there are no published
RCTs using a mobile app to deliver treatment for MDD.
Using a mobile app may enable greater choice in preferred treatment options, increased convenience, greater
accessibility and enhanced privacy.
Bang and colleagues (2007) have described the advantages of using a mobile phone over other delivery methods for some of the elements of CBT, explaining a
mobile phone has the functionality to record, scale and
label anxiety-provoking situations when and where the
need arises [17]. These advantages were evidenced in a
recent study that showed people’s everyday mood, stresses, responses and general functioning, can be helpfully
communicated to primary care practitioners by tracking
and capturing data in context [18]. Furthermore, participants from this study reported this method of data collection as convenient and acceptable. This positive
sentiment was echoed in a study exploring community
attitudes towards the use of mobile phones for mental
health monitoring and self management. Proudfoot and
colleagues found attitudes were positive towards using a
mobile phone for mental health monitoring, however,
participants identified the importance of privacy, security provisions and an easy to use program [19].
On this basis, we revised our previously evaluated 6lesson clinician assisted treatment program for depression (The Sadness Program) [11,12] into a mobile app
version, complete with security settings. The name of
the program was changed from The Sadness Program to
The Get Happy Program to convey a sense of optimism
and empowerment. In order to demonstrate the efficacy
of the program using a mobile app, we decided to compare the delivery mode of the same program between a
mobile vs. computer group. It was hypothesized that all
participants would show significant improvement on
measures of depression, a reduction of psychological distress, and participants would find the treatment modes
equally acceptable. Given the transportable nature and
use of mobile phones, we thought it would be important
to understand the type of environment utilized, and if,
any, environmental factors, such as noise, may have an
impact on the efficacy of the program for mobile users.
Thus, based on the Experience Sampling Method [20],
three items were constructed to identify the location of
where the participant was completing the lesson, how
distracting the level of noise was, and the self rated


ability of the participant to concentrate in this environment. Adherence towards homework was also measured
using self reported effort and amount of homework
completed.

Method
Design
A CONSORT-2010 compliant, registered RCT compared
two modes of delivery, a mobile versus computer group.
Both groups were followed through 3-months follow-up.

Participants, randomisation, and recruitment
Applicants applied to [www.virtualclinic.org.au](http://www.virtualclinic.org.au/) after
reading details about the study. Details of the applicant
and participant flow are in Figure 1. During recruitment
between March and May 2012, 176 individuals applied
for this program and 52 applicants met the inclusion criteria: (i) aged over 18, (ii) self identified as suffering from
mild or moderate depression, and have PHQ-9 scores
and results of telephone diagnostic interview (MINI)
consistent with this, (iii) prepared to provide name,
phone number and address, and (iv) to provide written
informed consent, (v) had access to a mobile phone or
iPad, and a computer with a printer and, (iv) had previous experience with downloading a mobile app. Applicants were excluded if they: (i) had psychosis, bipolar
disorder, substance abuse or dependence, (ii) severe depression (with a PHQ-9 score greater than 24) and (iii)
or current suicidality, as assessed by Question 9 on the
PHQ-9: “how frequently over the last two weeks have
you been bothered by thoughts that you would be better
off dead or of hurting yourself in some way?” If the applicant answered 2 (= more than half the days), with a
history of previous suicide attempts or answered 3 (=
nearly every day), with or without previous suicide
attempts, they were excluded, and contacted by the
study clinicians (CT, AG) and advised as to an appropriate course of action.
115 applicants met selection criteria and of these 101
were able to be contacted by phone. The content of the
call included a review of the study and confirmation that
the applicant had read and understood the information
and consent form. Following this, the Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5.0.0 (MINI) [21]
was used to confirm the applicant met DSM-IV criteria
for a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). 52 applicants
met all inclusion criteria and were randomised via a true
[randomisation process (www.random.org) generated by](http://www.random.org/)
a team member not involved in the study, to either the
Mobile Group (n=22) or Computer Group (n=30). However, at baseline we had 15 participants in the Mobile
Group and 20 in the Computer Group, due to participants not starting the first lesson. Concealment of
allocation was maintained until the applicant met all

inter-rater reliability (k=.88-1.00) and adequate concurrent
validity with the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview [22].

Description of treatment
The Get Happy Program was based on the principles of
CBT and is a version of the previously evaluated Sadness
Program [11,12]. The program consisted of 6 lessons
conducted over an 8 week period. The lessons read like
a comic book and participants follow the story of Jess, a
comic character that has depression, and through her
story learn how she comes to manage her symptoms,
and participants can then apply these principles to their
own life. The size of the font was adapted for the mobile
version and some minor revisions were made to the content of the program. On completion of each lesson, participants were assigned and encouraged to carry out the
relevant homework activities and review the lesson.
Additional resources, such as information on assertiveness skills and sleep hygiene, and stories from previous
participant’s experiences were also available Figure 2,
Figure 3.


Clinician contact
Participants received emails/or phone calls from a clinician, until completion of Lesson 2 because our previous
research study has found that additional clinician support does not add any further benefit to participants

[13]. Following this, the only clinical contact was when
the participant initiated contact, or when a clinician
instigated contact due to a deterioration in the K-10
score [23]. The K-10 is a measure of psychological distress and was completed prior to beginning each lesson.

Outcome measures
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [24] is a
brief 9-item self-report scale that measures each of the
DSM-IV criteria for MDD with scores ranging from 0 to
27. Participants rate the frequency of symptoms over the
last fortnight on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3
(nearly every day), where 1 = several days, 2 = more than
half of the days. A PHQ-9 score of ≥10 is used as a clinical cut-off for probable DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD [25].
The PHQ-9 has been shown to have good sensitivity and
specificity [26] and excellent reliability and validity [24].
The Kessler 10-item Psychological Distress scale (K-10)

[23] is a measure of non-specific psychological distress
over the past 14 days. Scores can range from 10 to 50,
with higher scores indicating higher distress. The K-10
has good psychometric properties and can discriminate
between cases and non-cases of DSM-IV affective disorders [27].
Beck’s Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) [28]
consists of 21 items and is a measure of the presence and
severity of a MDD based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for depression. Scores range from 0 to 63 with higher
scores indicating a greater severity of depression. The
BDI-II possesses excellent internal consistency [28].

Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) [29] is a
scale for measuring treatment credibility and expectancy
of improvement. At post treatment, 2 items based on
the CEQ were asked including, how satisfied were you
with the skills that this program has taught you to manage your depression from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 9
(very satisfied); how confident would you be in recommending this treatment to a friend who experiences
similar problems from 1 (not at all confident) to 9 (very
confident).
Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) [30] is a measurement
of functional disability and impairment due to psychiatric symptoms and is self rated. The 2 items related to
productivity were used for this study. The first item used
to measure absenteeism asked participants how many
days in the last week their symptoms caused them to
miss studies or work, or leave them unable to do their
normal daily responsibilities. The second item used to
measure presenteeism asked participants on how many
days in the last week did they feel so impaired by their
symptoms, that even though they studied, went to work
or worked at home, their productivity was reduced.

Environment rating scale (ERS)
Three items were constructed to identify the location of
where Mobile Group participants were completing the
lessons with options including: at home, at work, on a
train or a bus, at a park or the beach, a café, or other.
The Mobile Group participants were also asked to rate
how distracting the level of noise was from 1 (no distracting noise) to 4 (extremely distracting noise). Lastly,
the Mobile Group participants were asked to rate their
ability to concentrate in this environment from 1 (poor)
to 4 (excellent) (adapted from the Experience Sampling
Method, [20]).

Homework rating scale (HRS)
Two items were constructed to measure the amount of
effort and homework completion. The participant was
first asked how much effort they had put into the homework from 0 (no effort) to 4 (complete effort); and how
much of the assigned homework they had finished from
0 (none) to 4 (all).

Statistical analysis
For the PHQ-9, K-10 and BDI-II analyses were conducted using linear mixed-model repeated measures
(MMRM) ANOVA with measurement occasion as a
within-group factor and intervention as a between-groups
factor. These analyses were conducted using the MIXED
procedure in SPSS Version 19 with an identity covariance
matrix. For the SDS generalised estimating equations
(GEE) were used to evaluate reductions in absenteeism
and presenteeism across time. GEE is a semi-parametric


method used to implement marginal models when the
outcome variable is not normally distributed. The GENLIN procedure with a repeated statement was implemented using SPSS Version 19. A poisson distribution with a
log link function was specified. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-subject dependencies. Initial models only included measurement
occasion, study group and their interaction as fixed effects.
For each outcome measure, the two homework questions
were included separately in subsequent models to investigate whether any of the outcomes differed based on selfreported homework effort or homework completion.

Outcome measurement
All participants completed the questionnaire outcome
measures (BDI-II, PHQ-9, K-10, CEQ, ERS and SDS) at
1-week post treatment and at 3-months follow up.

Results
Baseline
The mean age of participants was 41 years (SD= 12.38,
range =18 - 63) and 28/35 were female (80% of the sample). Participants reported on average, moderate depression levels using the PHQ-9, severe levels of depression
on the BDI –II, and severe levels of psychological distress using the K-10. Participants reported on average
2.14 days of work lost (SD= 2.19) and 4.40 days of work
that were underproductive (SD= 2.15) due to the presence of his/her psychiatric symptoms on the SDS (see
Table 1).

Baseline between-group comparisons
Independent samples t-tests compared the two groups on
baseline demographic characteristics and pre-treatment
symptom questionnaires. There were no differences between the groups on age, the BDI-II, PHQ-9, nor K-10.

Adherence results
8.6% (3/35) completed only the first lesson, 2.9% (1/35)
completed two lessons, 2.9% (1/35) completed 3 lessons,
5.7% (2/35) completed 4 lessons, 11.4% (4/35) completed
5 lessons and 68.6% (24/35) of participants completed all
six lessons. Refer to Figure 1. When comparing the
Mobile Group with the Computer Group on adherence,
there were no significant differences (t (33) = −.242,
P >.05).

Disorder-specific and generic outcome measures
Figure 4 displays mean PHQ-9 scores on each measurement occasion as a function of the two conditions.
Statistical tests showed that the benefits of the intervention remained significant in both groups at follow up
when using the PHQ-9 (F [3, 73.6] = 28.4, P=<.001), the

1734.5] = 28.4, P=<.001).
Estimated marginal means for PHQ-9 scores estimated
under occasion x intervention model).
Results from the MMRM (ANOVA) indicated that the
interaction between experimental group and time was
not statistically significant when comparing PHQ-9
scores (F [3, 73.6] = .875, P=.458), BDI-II scores (F [2,
47.0] = 1.7, P=.19), or K-10 scores (F [7, 174.91] = .370,
P=.919).
In order to investigate differences between each occasion of measurement, a series of pair wise comparisons
were conducted. For the PHQ-9 and K-10 the change
from baseline to mid-point, post-test, and 3-month follow
up was investigated. Significant reductions were found
between baseline and all other time points for both the
Mobile Group and Computer Group. This pattern was
repeated using the BDI-II, when investigating changes
from baseline to post-test and 3-months follow up.

Homework completion and effort
The aggregated mean score for homework effort for the
Mobile Group was 11.25 (range, 6–17) and 14.46 (range
9–20) for the Computer Group. An aggregated mean
score for homework completion for the Mobile Group
was 11 (range, 8–16) and 12.4 (range 6–18) for the
Computer Group. Results from the MMRM (ANOVA)
indicated that there were no significant differences in
homework completion or homework effort between the
groups on the PHQ-9, the BDI-II, or the K-10.

Effect sizes
Large (>.8) within-group effect sizes were found on the
BDI-II, PHQ-9 and K-10 measures from pre-treatment


to post-treatment. Effect sizes for these measures are
included in Table 1.

Productivity outcome measures
Statistical tests using the SDS showed a significant reduction in the number of days lost (absenteeism) (Wald
Chi-Square =10.31, P = <.05) and in the number of days
underproductive (presenteeism) from pre-treatment to
post-treatment (Wald Chi-Square =12.33, P = .001). Further results indicated that the interaction between experimental group and time was not statistically significant
when comparing the SDS on absenteeism (Wald ChiSquare =.86, P = .35) and presenteeism (Wald Chi-Square
=.22, P = .63).

Environment, distraction, and concentration measuremobile group
Descriptive data on the environment, level of distraction
and ability to concentrate, was collected for participants
in the Mobile Group. Over the six lessons, 66.7-92.9% of
participants completed the lessons in their home, 46.760% of participants completed these lessons when there
was slight distraction, and 30.8-53.3% endorsed an ‘okay’
ability to concentrate. Please refer to Table 2.

Clinical significance
At post-treatment, only 16/35 (45%) met criteria for depression on the PHQ-9 (see Table 3 for results).

Time spent per participant for both the mobile and
computer groups
The mean clinician time spent per participant was
4.1 minutes (SD= 4.63) and the mean technician time
spent per participant was 6.4 minutes (SD= 5.38). Each
time a clinician or technician had contact with a participant the amount of time was recorded to monitor the
time required to deliver the program.

Participant satisfaction
Upon completion of the program 54% of Mobile Group
and 64% of the Computer Group were very satisfied with
the program; with the remaining participants endorsing
‘somewhat satisfied’. 64% of the Mobile Group and 64%
of the Computer Group would be very confident in
recommending this treatment to a friend; and the remainder endorsed ‘somewhat confident’.

Discussion
These results indicate that reductions in PHQ-9, the
BDI-II and K-10 pre- to post-intervention and pre to
follow up, were significant, regardless of experimental
group. This provides preliminary support for the efficacy
of a CBT program delivered using a mobile phone. The
results, including the effect size, shown in this study are

commensurate with our previous RCT’s [12,13], indicating that using a mobile phone to offer this program
shows similar promise.
There were a number of limitations to this study. Firstly,
the small sample size necessitates replication, in order to
reproduce the benefits identified in this study of delivering
a CBT program via a mobile phone or computer. Other
possible limitations include the self-selecting nature of the
sample. Those applying to complete treatment programs
using technology must be motivated; however, this does
not make the results of this study invalid. A further limitation is the absence of a control group. A control group
would have provided the additional advantage of ensuring
the effects observed were able to be explained by the treatment. However, due to the small sample size of this study,
a control group was not included. Lastly, this study did
not collect data on the environment, level of concentration and distractibility in the Computer Group. Future


research could explore and compare this data to inform
recommendations as to the best placed environment for
patients to complete the program in order to obtain the
most optimal results.
The results of this pilot study indicate the usefulness
of replicating this study in the future research with a larger sample size and control group. Minor additions to
utilise the functionality available on a mobile phone/tablet are planned, for example, including the ability for
participants to set automated reminders in their calendar, and complete the homework on their phone/tablet.
Data on the time of day and amount of usage for the
mobile users is also intended to be collected to understand if the increased proximity of the mobile, does lead
to increased use, and greater benefits over time. Very little is currently known about the possible benefits of
offering patient’s treatment programs using a mobile app
on their mobile phone, however, the ubiquity of mobile

apps, the growing community uptake and interest in this
form of technology, and low cost associated with access,
indicates that this area of research necessitates attention.
In summary, depression is common and costly. Affordable, accessible and innovative interventions should be
developed, evaluated, and made available to improve the
lives of those affected by this disorder. Mobile based interventions can be easily implemented and can be made
widely available to the community at large. The patients
and their families affected by depression deserve the opportunity to recover, and readily accessible, evidenced
based treatment via a mobile phone/tablet offers hope,
and an opportunity to transform current clinical practice.
