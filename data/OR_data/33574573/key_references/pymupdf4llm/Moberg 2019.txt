### Abstract

**Background:** Despite substantial improvements in technology and the increased demand for technology-enabled behavioral
health tools among consumers, little progress has been made in easing the burden of mental illness. This may be because of the
inherent challenges of conducting traditional clinical trials in a rapidly evolving technology landscape.
**Objective:** This study sought to validate the effectiveness of Pacifica, a popular commercially available app for the
self-management of mild-to-moderate stress, anxiety, and depression.
**Methods:** A total of 500 adults with mild-to-moderate anxiety or depression were recruited from in-app onboarding to participate
in a randomized waitlist controlled trial of Pacifica. We conducted an all-virtual study, recruiting, screening, and randomizing
participants through a Web-based participant portal. Study participants used the app for 1 month, with no level of use required,
closely mimicking real-world app usage. Participants in the waitlist group were given access to the app after 1 month. Measurements
included self-reported symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. We performed an intent-to-treat analysis to
examine the interactive effects of time and condition.
**Results:** We found significant interactions between time and group. Participants in the active condition demonstrated significantly
greater decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress and increases in self-efficacy. Although we did not find a relationship between
overall engagement with the app and symptom improvement, participants who completed relatively more thought record exercises
sustained improvements in their symptoms through the 2-month follow-up to a greater degree than those who completed fewer.
In addition, we found that participants who reported concomitantly taking psychiatric medications during the trial benefitted less
from the app, as measured by the symptoms of anxiety and stress.
**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that Pacifica, a popular commercially available self-help app, is effective in reducing
self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, particularly among individuals who utilize thought records and are not
taking psychiatric medication.

### Introduction

##### Background

In the United States, in a given year, over 19% of adults
experience an anxiety disorder [1] and 6.7% experience a major
depressive episode [2]. Decades of mental health care research
have resulted in the development of effective
nonpharmacological therapies for anxiety and depression, one
of which is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) [3,4]. CBT is
among the best-researched nonpharmacological treatments for
depression and anxiety [5,6]. However, traditional CBT requires
a well-trained practitioner and significant time commitment
both inside and outside of the therapy room from the client;
dissemination of this treatment has been somewhat limited
despite its demonstrated efficacy [7].

Untreated mental illness has well-documented negative effects
on physical health, health care costs, productivity, and
well-being [8-10], and mental health and substance use disorders
are the leading causes of disease burden in the United States

[11]. Unfortunately, only 43% of people with mental illness in
the United States receive professional care because of difficulties
with access to care, stigma, cost, or time involved in seeking
treatment [2].

Technology-enabled interventions hold great promise to ease
some of the burden of mental illness due to their ability to scale
and reduce barriers to entry such as cost and stigma. In fact,
computerized or internet-based implementations of CBT have
existed for years and many have been demonstrated to be
effective for a number of mental health conditions [12-15].
However, although these products exist, they have made little
impact on reducing the overall disease burden and
implementation has lagged behind development [16].

Similar to the research-practice gap that exists for much of
mental health treatment, digital tools that perform well in closely
monitored, tightly controlled research settings do not always
translate into widely utilized programs among consumers. This
may be because of poor usability and design or concerns about
privacy and data security [17,18]; in some cases, these apps are
never made available to the public. More real-world studies that
demonstrate the effectiveness of mobile-delivered treatment
programs are needed.

User retention and engagement are critical to the success of
digital health interventions [17,19]. This is no different than in
traditional or in-person psychotherapy, where treatment retention
and engagement has long been a topic of study [20]. LeBeau et
al [21] defined treatment engagement as homework compliance
and found that greater compliance predicted better outcomes
among patients receiving CBT for anxiety disorders. However,
with digital tools, engagement has often been defined by the
number of uses or logins. The relationship between logins or
time spent using the app or digital tool is somewhat complex;
it is not always the case that greater use correlates with greater
symptom improvement. For example, 1 study found that
increased usage of a website for depression treatment
corresponded with less symptom improvement, and the authors
suggest the explanation that individuals who derived benefit


from the treatment discontinued their use early [22]. Kelders et
al [23] examined digital treatment adherence and identified that
engagement-related analyses should consider the types of actions
taken by participants (eg, didactic lessons vs feedback vs skills
practice) and the time at which the individual became
nonadherent (ie, early vs late). Tying engagement to outcomes
can also be complex. van Gemert-Pijnen et al [24] examined
participants’ number of logins and use of various platform
features and found a somewhat complex relationship between
logins, feature use, and impact on depressive symptoms.

There is also a rich literature on predictors of treatment response
in CBT, both in-person and when administered via digital tools,
though it is hard to draw any clear conclusions about for whom
CBT does or does not work. Høifødt et al [25] found
contributions from both some demographic and clinical factors
in a Web-based CBT intervention for depression. Specifically,
having had more depressive episodes, being married or
cohabitating, and having higher life satisfaction predicted better
response. Myrh et al [26] reviewed the literature on predictors
of treatment response to in-person CBT and described that
although several studies have found little-to-no strong predictors
of response to treatment, others have found that higher
socioeconomic status and being married predict better outcomes.
Dryman et al [27] conducted a study of the Internet-based CBT
(ICBT) mobile app, Joyable, to examine its efficacy for treating
social anxiety and found that responders (vs nonresponders)
had lower baseline symptoms and spent more days in the
program. Responders also called their coaches more and
completed more exposures. The groups did not differ on age or
gender. MoodHacker is a CBT-based app for individuals with
depression. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining
the efficacy of MoodHacker, Birney et al [28] found that
depression symptom improvements were larger among study
participants who had access to an employee assistance program
(EAP), though the authors note that EAP access could actually
represent more than just access to an in-person counselor (eg,
non-EAP participants may have different motivations than those
who encountered the study through EAPs). Given these mixed
data, we were also interested in examining for whom the Pacifica
app would be most effective.

##### Objectives

Though it is not the first all-virtual RCT of a mental health
support app [29,30], this study was an effort to advance the
literature on the real-world use of technology-enabled CBT.
We sought to test the effectiveness of Pacifica [31], a popular
(over 2.4 million registered users at the time of submission)
commercially available app for the self-management of stress,
anxiety, and depression, in a sample of individuals with
mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression who were seeking
digital tools to address their mental health. We predicted that
access to the app would help improve their symptoms and
increase self-efficacy. In addition, we hypothesized that greater
app usage, that is, more engagement, would result in larger
symptom improvements. In addition, given the ongoing debate
about active ingredients in therapy [32] and the transtheoretical
approach of the app, we aimed to examine whether symptom
improvement was related to the specific tools that were utilized
(eg, thought records, meditation, and social posts). Finally, we


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Moberg et al


evaluated whether demographic variables or baseline clinical
features would affect the efficacy of our app-based intervention.

### Methods

##### Study Design

This RCT compared an immediate intervention group (Pacifica)
with a waitlist control group (WL). Both groups had access to
treatment as usual at their discretion. The WL group was
provided access to the intervention at the end of the 1-month
waiting period. The immediate intervention group was
re-assessed 2 months after their completion of the 1-month
intervention period to examine the stability of symptom change.
The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT03333707) and was approved by Salus IRB (Austin, TX).

##### Recruitment, Screening, and Consent

We recruited participants for 3 months, from November 2017
through February 2018, via social media advertisements, a
listing on ClinicalTrials.gov, and through an opt-in screen in
the commercially available app itself. The vast majority of
participants were recruited through the app itself. Pacifica does
not advertise to acquire users, and most individuals find the app
through app store searches, using terms such as anxiety or stress
or via word of mouth.

We designed and built a Participant Portal that provided
individuals with a self-service platform for screening, consent,
and randomization to the app. To reduce duplicate enrollments,
potential participants provided their telephone number and
entered a code that was sent to them via short messaging service
(SMS) text messaging. A prescreen required participants to be
over the age of 18 years, fluent in English, with regular access
to a smartphone, and no previous experience with Pacifica. After
this prescreen, participants were provided with an informed
consent document in an embedded PDF. A 4-question
knowledge check confirmed that they had read and understood
the document. To consent, participants entered their email
address and password. Following consent, participants were
screened to confirm eligibility. The Participant Portal is Web
(not app) based, and therefore, participants could access the
portal through any device with a Web browser. Participants
assigned to the waitlist condition would not have been able to
download and use the app (outside of the study) unless they
signed up with a different email address than whichever address
they used for this prescreen.

In addition to the criteria in the prescreen described above, the
inclusion criterion was a score between 5 and 14 on the
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale [33] or
between 5 and 14 on the Patient Health Questionnaire 8-item
(PHQ-8) scale [34]. Exclusion criteria were (1) score below 5
on GAD-7 and PHQ-8 or above 14 on either, (2) positive
response on screener for previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, other psychotic spectrum disorder, or organic
brain disease, and (3) currently pregnant. Given the all-virtual
nature of the study, these criteria were selected to match the
intensity of the intervention to the severity of the users, allowing
us to balance participant safety with external validity and value
of the data.


An initial group of 9279 individuals completed the prescreen,
1524 completed informed consent, and 500 were randomized
to groups. In addition, 7 individuals’ participation was
discontinued for failing to download the app within 48 hours
of screening and randomization. Of the 253 individuals who
were assigned to the treatment group, 182 participants used
Apple (iOS) devices and 61 used Android devices. Furthermore,
3 participants accessed Pacifica with both iOS and Android
devices. Participants were assessed using questionnaire
measures, the details for which are below. See the CONSORT
flow diagram (Figure 1) for reasons for exclusion and
experimental compliance.

##### Intervention

Participants in the Pacifica group were given access to Pacifica
Premium, versions 5.7 through 5.9.1. Updates to the app that
occurred during the research study were bug fixes and
performance improvements and would not have impacted the
therapeutic approach or usability of the app. Descriptions of the
_app below are as it was in the research study and may not be_
_exactly the same as the currently available product. Pacifica is_
a mobile app marketed as a guided self-help tool for the
management of stress, anxiety, and depression. It is not
described as a treatment for any particular diagnosis nor is it
described as a substitute for professional treatment. At
onboarding, users select up to 3 goals on which to work from
a list of 8 options. The app prompts users once per day to rate
their mood and, based on their mood rating, recommends
activities to improve their mood via _Suggested Activities (ie,_
ecological momentary intervention; see the studies by Schueller
et al and Lovibond and Lovibond [35,36]). There are also 35
days of _Guided Paths that are approximately 10-min audio_
psychoeducational lessons with paired activities. Alternatively,
users can use the app buffet style, using whichever tools they
find helpful, whenever they choose. Participants in the study
were not provided guidance or suggestions regarding the amount
of level of app usage beyond any prompts in the app (described
above).

Descriptions and details on the different activities are given
below:

##### Mood

Allows users to rate their mood on a scale from Great to Awful.
Users may optionally label specific emotions or attach a
journal-style note to their mood rating.

##### Health

Allows users to track health behaviors such as sleep, caffeine
consumption, and exercise. Users can customize their health
behaviors and goals for each health behavior (ie, how many
hours of sleep or number of cups of coffee). They may
optionally set up an alarm so that Pacifica sends them a
notification to remind them to enter their health data.

##### Meditation/Relax

Offers over 40 audio activities, most of which are intended to
promote mindfulness or relaxation. These include deep
breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and a variety of
mindfulness activities.

**Figure 1.** Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram.


##### Thoughts

Offers 9 different activities to help users re-examine their
thoughts, identify cognitive distortions, and reframe thoughts.
The prompts are divided into 3 groups: basics, which help the
user recognize the relationship between their thoughts and
emotions, learn about cognitive distortions, and reframe negative
thoughts; journal prompts, which allow for free writing; and
_advanced tools. The advanced tools include one that creates a_
pie chart to help users identify other factors beyond themselves
that may contribute to events, a tool that asks a series of
questions to help them evaluate evidence, and an activity that
guides them to drill down and identify core beliefs. All of these
tools are guided exercises and do not provide automatic analysis
of the individual’s text inputs.


##### Goals

Allows the user to create a list of challenges to complete to meet
their longer-term goals. A fairly generic list tool, it can be
customized to address anxiety by enabling the user to build and
address a hierarchy of feared or avoided situations. Users coping
with depression can use the list to engage in behavioral
activation to re-engage with life. The tool prompts the user to
rate the perceived difficulty of the item before and after
engagement to help them recognize that their initial estimation
of the challenge may not be accurate. There are example items
that may be chosen or users can type in their own goals.

##### Guided Paths

Offer 35 days of psychoeducational content to teach the user
how to utilize the tools in the app and help maintain motivation
and interest. The lessons also provide background information
about CBT and mindfulness. Each 5- to 10-min audio lesson is


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Moberg et al


paired with an in-app activity. The audio content is presented
either as a didactic session or a mock session between a client
a therapist. The 35 days of content are divided into 4 paths: one
which offers an introduction to each of the tools in the app, 2
which are sequential and offer a deeper focus on CBT, and one
which focuses on building mindfulness skills.

##### Hope

On the basis of the principles of distress coping, the hope board
is a user’s personal repository of inspirational quotes and
images. It also allows the user to save their completed challenges
to help them feel a sense of accomplishment and savor their
wins.

##### Community

A peer-support community that is not moderated by
professionals, but is rather a place where users can post their
thoughts, challenges, and questions and receive support from
others using the app. The community is anonymous but utilizes
a flagging system to remove disruptive or inappropriate posts
or users. Users are provided the rules and guidelines of the
community when they first access the community.

##### Progress

Allows the user to review their mood ratings and completed
activities. The tool graphs their mood ratings against health
behaviors and other in-app activities so that users can identify
patterns and triggers. There is also a _skills tab that visually_
displays the user’s completed activities, separated by type.

##### Emergency Resources

Includes listing of crisis lines and resources for users in
emergency situations.

##### Measurement

 Questionnaire Measures

Study participants were assessed at 3 time points: at baseline
(pretreatment), 4 weeks later (ie, posttreatment; at the end of
the intervention period), and 3 months after baseline/2 months
postintervention (follow-up; only the Pacifica group completed
the follow-up because the WL group was allowed to access the
intervention after the 4-week assessment). At each assessment,
participants were both emailed and notified via SMS that they
had available assessments to complete. Assessments were
completed via the secure Participant Portal described above (ie,
not in the app itself).

The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) [37]
is a widely used freely available self-report measure of stress,
anxiety, and depression. A shortened version of the DASS-42,
its 21 items are measured on a Likert scale and yield 3 subscale
scores: stress, anxiety, and depression. The DASS-21 consists
of statements such as “I couldn’t seem to experience any positive
feeling at all” with 4 response options ranging from “Did not
apply to me at all” to “Applied to me very much or most of the
time.” For each subscale, summed scores range from 0 to 21,
with higher scores indicating greater symptoms. Its internal
consistency and concurrent validity have been shown to be in
the acceptable-to-excellent range [38].


The PHQ-8 [34] is an 8-item self-report measure of depression.
It is identical to the popular PHQ-9 [39] measure but eliminates
the question that queries suicidal ideation; it was selected given
the all-virtual nature of the study. An example item from the
PHQ-8 is “Little interest or pleasure in doing things,” with
response options ranging from “Not at all” to “Nearly every
day.” Scores on the PHQ-8 range from 0 to 24, and the measure
has been shown to have good internal consistency and reliability

[34]. Higher scores indicate greater symptoms.

The GAD-7 [33] is a widely used, freely available, 7-item
self-report measure to address severity of Generalized Anxiety
Disorder. An example item is “Feeling nervous, anxious, or on
edge,” with response options ranging from “Not at all” to
“Nearly every day.” Summed scores on the GAD-7 range from
0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater symptoms. The
GAD-7 has good reliability and validity [33].

The General Self-Efficacy Scale [40] is a 10-item self-report
measure that asks participants about their beliefs regarding their
ability to cope with stressors or challenges in their life. Example
items include “I can always manage to solve difficult problems
if I try hard enough,” with response options ranging from “Not
at all true” to “Exactly true.” Scores on the General Self-Efficacy
Scale range from 10 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater
self-efficacy. The measure has been shown to be reliable and
valid [41].

Overall, 2 composites were created from the 2 measures of
depression (PHQ-8 and DASS-21 Depression Subscale) and
the 2 measures of anxiety (GAD-7 and DASS-21 Anxiety
Subscale) to generate more reliable and valid indices of
symptoms. We standardized each measure at the pretreatment
time point, then used the means and SDs calculated at
pretreatment to standardize these measures at subsequent
timepoints. After the scores were standardized, measures were
averaged to create a single measure of each construct. These
measures are referred to as depression composite and anxiety
_composite in the results section and have a mean of zero and a_
SD of one 1 pretreatment.

##### Process Measures

To better understand possible mediators of symptom
improvement and app efficacy, we examined participants’
number of logins and number of completed activities as
measures of app engagement. It should be noted that for the
purposes of this study, activities include thoughts, goals (either
setting or completing), relax, and community (writing a post).
The engagement analysis did not include mood or health ratings,
_hope posts, or time spent reviewing content in the community_
forums because of the complexity involved in data extraction,
cleaning, and formatting for these activities.

##### Moderator Measures

To examine whether baseline patient characteristics predicted
treatment response to Pacifica versus WL, we tested
demographic and clinical characteristics. Demographic features
included age (treated as a continuous variable), gender
(0=female, 1=male), income (8 levels from <$20K to >$200K
treated as a continuous variable), marital status (0=not married,
1=married), education (0=did not complete 4-year college,


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Moberg et al


1=completed 4-year college), and race (0=other, 1=white).
Clinical features included current (at screening) use of
psychiatric medications (0=no, 1=yes), current (at screening)
use of psychotherapy (0=no, 1=yes), use of other mental health
apps (0=no, 1=yes), and whether they reported being diagnosed
with depression (0=no, 1=yes) or anxiety (0=no, 1=yes).

##### Statistical Analyses

 Power Analysis

On the basis of a two-week pilot study among college
undergraduates, we anticipated an effect size of .3 (Cohen d).
We targeted 90% power to detect an effect to a significance
level of .05 in a 2-group 1-tailed t test, which revealed a sample
of 191 participants per group. The previous study had about
75% completion, so we targeted to randomize 250 participants
per group. Though the use of pilot studies for estimating effect
sizes is questionable (cf [42]), this pilot study was the most
relevant data available on which to base our power analysis.
The effect sizes found in this study are larger than those in the
pilot study: between .4 and .54 for the key symptoms measures
versus .3 in the pilot.

We were not able to meet our target of 191 completers because
of greater-than-anticipated attrition: 101 WL participants and
79 active group participants completed the study. Given this
number of completers, we were able to detect an effect size of
.38 with 80% power given a significance level of .05 and a
2-group, 2-tailed t test.

##### Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using multilevel modeling (MLM) in Stata
15.0 [43]. MLM accounts for nesting of time points within
subjects, which allows for examination of change within and
between subjects across time (pretreatment, posttreatment, and
follow-up) and by group (WL and Pacifica). MLM includes all
participants with at least 1 measurement, and thus, it can be
used to estimate intent-to-treat effects. Separate models were
run for each of the 4 dependent variables (depression composite,
anxiety composite, stress, and general self-efficacy). Statistical
significance was defined as falling below a threshold of
alpha=.05, as this is the standard threshold used in randomized
clinical trials in psychology.

To examine the main effects of the Pacifica intervention
compared with WL, time was modeled at level 1, with 1 segment
specified between the pre- and posttreatment time points, and
a second segment between the post and follow-up time points.
This approach models typical trends in treatment studies where
the greatest effects occur by posttreatment and changes level-off
over follow-up and has been used in a number of previous
studies [44,45,46,47]. Group (WL vs Pacifica) was modeled at
level 2. Models included the main effects of the 2 time segments,
the main effect of group, and the interaction between group and
time. We examined the interaction between group and time for
statistical significance. All models included random effects of
the intercept and time, which were determined to be significant
based on likelihood ratio tests. Between-group differences were
assessed using the _margins command in Stata by comparing_
the slopes from pre- to posttreatment and by comparing the


predicted means from the model at the posttreatment time point.
Effect sizes are calculated based on the method described by
Feingold [48] that produces estimates analogous to Cohen d for
growth curve models in randomized clinical trials. As the WL
group received the intervention after the posttreatment time
point, we were unable to compare the groups at follow-up. Thus,
for the follow-up time point, the slope of change from
posttreatment to follow-up was tested only for the Pacifica
group.

To examine whether engagement with the app was related to
treatment response, we tested whether overall engagement
(number of app logins) and specific types of engagement
(number of times using the goals, relaxation, community, and
thoughts sections of the app), were associated with symptom
change in the Pacifica group. Models included the main effect
of engagement, the main effects of the 2 time segments, and
the interactions between engagement and time. We examined
the interactions between the engagement variables and each
time segment for statistical significance. Thus, we examined
whether engagement predicted change from pre- to posttreatment
and from posttreatment to follow-up for each type of
engagement and for each dependent variable.

To examine moderators of response to Pacifica versus WL, we
tested whether demographic features (age, gender, income,
marital status, educational level, and race) and clinical features
(use of psychiatric medications, engagement in psychotherapy,
use of other mental health apps, and previously diagnosed
anxiety and depression) were associated with symptom change
from pre- to posttreatment in the Pacifica group compared with
the WL group. Models included the main effects of the
moderator, the main effect of time, the main effect of group, all
2-way interactions, and the 3-way interaction. We examined
the 3-way interaction between the moderator, group, and time
for statistical significance. Significant 3-way interactions were
followed up with tests of simple interaction effects of group by
time at different levels of the moderator.

### Results

##### Pretreatment Group Differences

Table 1 presents demographic data on the WL and Pacifica
groups. Randomization was successful, and the 2 groups were
very similar with regard to demographics; we found no
significant differences between the groups (p s>.210). The
sample was largely female (75%) and white (80%) and had at
least some college education (91%).

##### Study Attrition

Of the 500 participants randomized, 204 completed both preand posttreatment assessments. This represents 47% of WL
participants and 35% of Pacifica participants. The difference in
attrition between the groups was significant: χ12 (n=500)=7.7;
_P=.006. We examined the baseline symptom ratings for the_
individuals who dropped out versus those who did not and found
no differences (see Table 2). Further, no differences were found
when these comparisons were stratified by group (P>.18).

##### Key Outcome: Symptom Change

We first examined whether, compared with individuals in the
WL group, individuals assigned to use Pacifica experienced
greater improvement in anxiety, depression, stress, and
self-efficacy. Our intent-to-treat analysis revealed significant
group × time interactions for each of the outcome measures
(depression composite, anxiety composite, DASS-21 stress, and
self-efficacy) such that change in the Pacifica group was greater
than change in the WL group. These results were unchanged
when individual measures of depression and anxiety were
examined separately. See Multimedia Appendix 1 for means
and SEs of the individual depression and anxiety measures. In
addition, to assess whether treatment dropout affected these
results, we analyzed additional models that included the group
× dropout interaction and main effects of group and dropout,
and the results were unchanged. Table 3 provides parameter

**Table 3.** Group × time interaction.


estimates for the group × time interaction from pre to
posttreatment, 95% CIs, significance levels, and effect sizes for
each outcome measure.

We additionally examined the simple effect of time within
groups. Table 4 shows that the Pacifica group experienced
significant change from pre to post for each variable (decreases
for depression, anxiety, and stress and an increase for
self-efficacy). Anxiety level in the WL group significantly
decreased from pre to post. For the Pacifica group, from post
to follow-up, there were no significant changes in any outcome.
There were significant group differences at post for each
measure (see Figure 2). The WL group was higher than the
Pacifica group for depression symptoms (0.66; CI 0.37 to 0.94;
_P<.001), anxiety symptoms (0.47; CI 0.17 to 0.77;_ _P=.002),_
and DASS-21 stress (2.09; CI 1.09 to 3.08; P<.001), and lower
on self-efficacy (−1.46; CI −2.62 to −0.30; P=.014).

##### Clinically Significant Change

Participants were classified as having achieved clinically
significant change (CSC) on the PHQ-8 and GAD-7 as outlined
by Jacobson and Truax [49]. The individual scales were used
for the CSC analysis because test-retest reliability metrics were
needed to calculate the reliable change index. Rates of CSC at
post for PHQ-8 were as follows: Pacifica, 41.8% (n=33/79);
WL, 16.8% (n=17/101); χ12 (N=180)=13.74; P<.001. Rates of
CSC at post for GAD-7 were as follows: Pacifica, 39.2%
(n=31/79); WL, 24.2% (n=24/99); χ12 (N=178)=4.63; P=.031.
The rate of CSC at follow-up for the Pacifica group was 35.4%
for the PHQ-8 and 48.9% for the GAD-7.

##### Engagement Effects

The median number of logins in the Pacifica group during the
30-day intervention was 19, with a range of 1 to 286. We did
not find any significant interactions for group by time by overall
engagement with the app (defined by total number of logins)
for depression composite (P>.21), anxiety composite (P>.34),
stress (P>.11), or self-efficacy (P>.55).

However, for tests examining unique activities in the app, we
found that the use of thought record tools was significantly


associated with symptom improvement for 2 of the outcome
measures: anxiety composite and stress (see Figure 3).
Specifically, for the anxiety composite, greater number of
thought records completed during treatment was associated with
greater anxiety reduction from posttreatment to follow-up (beta
_=-.10; CI −0.19 to −0.02;_ _P=.019), although not from_
pretreatment to posttreatment (P=.406) _. Number of thought_
records completed was not significantly associated with baseline
anxiety in the MLM (P=.834). For DASS-21 stress, a greater
number of thought records completed during treatment was
associated with less stress reduction from pre- to posttreatment
(beta _= −.30; CI −.50 to −.11;_ _P<.01), but greater stress_
reduction from posttreatment to follow-up (beta =-.47; CI −.87
to −.08; P<.05). Number of thought records completed was not
significantly associated with baseline stress in the MLM
(P=.772). Descriptively, individuals who completed relatively
more thought records showed a delayed positive effect in terms
of anxiety and stress reduction. Use of the thought record tool
was not significantly associated with change in depression
(P>.13) or general self-efficacy (P>.48). The use of the goals,
relax, and community tools was not associated with change in
anxiety (P>.18), depression (P>.13), stress (P>.29), or general
self-efficacy (P>.26).

##### Moderator Analysis

 Demographics

We examined the 3-way interaction between group, time, and
demographic responses to examine whether any of these
demographic traits moderated treatment response.

Age, gender, income, marital status, educational level, and race
did not significantly moderate the effect of group on symptom
improvement. See Table 5 for details.

##### Clinical Features

We also conducted moderator analyses for each of the clinical
characteristics listed in Table 1. We found only 1 characteristic
that significantly interacted with group and time to predict
outcome measures: presence/absence of concomitant psychiatric
medications at baseline. As shown in Figure 4, the presence of
psychiatric medications moderated the group effect such that

**Table 5.** Group × time × moderator.


the benefits of Pacifica compared with WL were significantly
greater for people who were not taking psychiatric medications
than for people who were taking medications. This moderation
of the group × time interaction only reached significance for
the anxiety composite and DASS-21 stress measures.

For the anxiety composite, tests of simple effects showed that
for participants not taking psychiatric medications, those
assigned to Pacifica had a significantly greater reduction in
anxiety than those assigned to WL (slope difference=−.68, CI
−1.01 to −0.35; P<.001). However, for those taking psychiatric
medications, no difference in symptom reduction emerged
between Pacifica and WL (P=.771). A similar pattern emerged
for stress. For participants not taking psychiatric medications,
those assigned to Pacifica had a significantly greater reduction
in stress than those assigned to WL (slope difference=−2.54;
CI −3.70 to −1.39]; _P<.001). However, for those taking_
medications, no difference in symptom reduction emerged
between Pacifica and WL (P=.615).

### Discussion

This study is the first published RCT of Pacifica, a widely
available, popular smartphone app–based intervention for
self-help of mild-to-moderate stress, anxiety, and depression.
The tools implemented in the intervention are based on the
integration of CBT, mindfulness, and mood and health tracking.
Results indicated that this intervention is effective compared
with a waitlist control at 1 month in reducing self-reported
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress and increasing
feelings of self-efficacy. Between-group effect sizes were in
the small-to-medium range. In addition, treatment gains were
maintained for 2 months following the end of the 1-month
intervention period, especially for anxiety symptoms. These
results are particularly noteworthy given the very light touch
nature of the study, short duration of the intervention period,
and the real-world sample of individuals.

App usage was self-guided, and participants were not instructed
to use the app with any specific level of frequency, so rather
than consider adherence, we explored whether amount of usage
(ie, number of completed activities) was associated with
symptom improvement. We did not find any association with
overall usage, possibly because looking at the total number of
app logins is a simplistic way of quantifying engagement.
However, we did find that individuals who completed relatively
more thought records demonstrated delayed improvement, which
is noteworthy. Though there have been challenges in the
literature to the importance of cognitive restructuring in CBT

[50], this study suggests that, at least for technology-enabled
CBT, thought records were helpful. Subjectively, completing
thought records is a more time-intensive and cognitively
demanding activity than health tracking or meditation and
increased use of these activities may be a marker of greater
commitment to treatment or improvement. We should note,
though, that in this study thought records included both basic
journaling prompts and more complex reframing activities.
However, this study was unfortunately underpowered to examine
the effects of different types of thought tools. The apparent
delayed positive benefit of completing relatively more thought
activities is consistent with the common perception that although
examining and challenging negative thoughts is difficult in the
short term, it can result in more long-lasting benefits. In addition,


there are data suggesting that CBT is effective at preventing
relapse to anxiety and depression [51,52], but further research
is needed to more completely understand these effects,
particularly in computerized CBT.

Demographic characteristics among participants were not related
to outcomes, which is consistent with the mixed findings across
previous studies examining traditional (ie, not online delivered)
CBT [53-55] as well as internet-based CBT [13,25,56-60]. This
suggests that app-based CBT can have effects across diverse
populations rather than being relevant only for a specific group.
However, we found differential effects between participants
who were and were not taking psychiatric medications at
baseline. Though not significant for measures of depression or
self-efficacy, for the anxiety composite and DASS-21 stress
measures, the presence of medication at baseline diminished
the difference between the groups, that is, both the WL and app
groups improved. Inspection of the means reveals not that the
presence of medications markedly reduced the effectiveness of
the app, but rather that there was little added benefit of the app
above and beyond the medication.

Although this finding is inconsistent with some data that
combined treatments perform better than therapy alone [61], it
is consistent with literature that has found minimal benefit of
combining medication with psychotherapy [62]. Certain
medications such as benzodiazepines may interfere with
behavioral therapy [63]. To be sure, though, a guided self-help
tool such as Pacifica is not psychotherapy—nor does it purport
to be. The personal relationship established with a practitioner
may be what catalyzes treatment and nudges it above medication
alone; blended models that incorporate both self-help solutions
with human coaching have been found to be superior to self-help
alone [64]. The drawback of these models is their ability to
scale. Stepped care models that triage services and match the
level of in-person support with client need are likely the way
of the future [65]. Such models combine the rapport and human
connection of a human therapist or coach with the ubiquity and
outside-of-the-clinic support of a mobile app. The question of
whether combining mobile interventions with pharmacotherapy
is effective is particularly relevant given the fact that a majority
of individuals receive their psychotropic medications from
primary care providers [66] who typically only see them

intermittently; digital tools could potentially provide additional
support between appointments.

This project represents a step forward in that it is a real-world
evaluation of a popular, commercially available
technology-enabled intervention. However, there are several
limitations that should be noted. First, the study was conducted
among a convenience sample that was rather homogeneous in
its demographic makeup. The participants were largely
college-educated white females. Previous research has found
that women are overrepresented in Web-based research studies

[67]. Although this sample may represent the individuals who
are most likely to utilize technology-enabled mental health
interventions, this homogeneity may limit the degree to which
the outcomes can be generalized. Owing to the fact that no
demographic information is collected from users upon sign-up,
we cannot assess how representative this sample is of all of the
individuals who utilize Pacifica.

Although the participant pool was homogeneous from a
demographic perspective, the study was conducted in a sample
that may have been heterogeneous with respect to diagnosis.
We did not conduct diagnostic interviews and only have
participants’ responses to symptom rating questionnaires. In
the real world, many individuals seeking Web-based tools to
manage their mental health are doing so outside of the context
of the therapy clinic and may not have formal diagnoses. It is
noteworthy that our sample had relatively low levels of anxiety
and depression. This further highlights the fact that individuals
who seek digital tools may be on the mild end of the spectrum
and that these tools may need to be used in conjunction with

therapy to be effective for more severely affected individuals.
Future research should examine whether these data can be
replicated in a more diverse sample to consider whether efficacy
varies based on demographics. It would also be important to
verify the app’s efficacy among individuals who have been
formally diagnosed versus those who self-selected and were
simply screened using self-reported measures. Furthermore,
analyses of engagement with the app were exploratory, and
significant findings should be replicated in future studies.

Another limitation relates to the finding regarding the
moderation of the effects by the use of psychotropic
medications. Although this finding is interesting, because we
had minimal information about participants’use of medications
(ie, no data on the types, dosage, or any change to medication
across the course of the study), this should be examined further
in future work.

This study provides encouraging findings around the ability of
popular, commercially available, guided self-help tools to
empower individuals to manage their symptoms of stress,
anxiety, and depression and increase their self-efficacy. This
study also serves as a proof point for an all-virtual study. Given
the limitations of existing health care systems and the obstacles
to care that exist for individuals coping with mental health
conditions, mobile apps and technology-enabled interventions
can play an important role in expanding access and serving as
an adjunct to in-person treatment. Future research should
continue to clarify the best application of these tools and how
they can be better integrated into existing workflows and care
delivery systems.
