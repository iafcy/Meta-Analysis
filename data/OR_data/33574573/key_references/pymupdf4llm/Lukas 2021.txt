### Abstract

**Background:** Available smartphone-based interventions for depression predominantly use evidence-based strategies from
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), but patient engagement and reported effect sizes are small. Recently, studies have demonstrated
that smartphone-based interventions combining CBT with gamified approach-avoidance bias modification training (AAMT) can
foster patient engagement and reduce symptoms of several mental health problems.
**Objective:** Based on these findings, we developed a gamified smartphone-based intervention, mentalis Phoenix (MT-Phoenix),
and hypothesized the program would both engage patients and produce preliminary evidence for the reduction of depressive
symptoms.
**Methods:** To test this hypothesis, we evaluated MT-Phoenix in a randomized controlled pilot trial including 77 individuals with
elevated depression scores (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores ≥5). Participants were either instructed to train for 14 days
with MT-Phoenix or assigned to a waitlist control condition. Engagement with the intervention was measured by assessing usage
data. The primary outcome was reduction in depressive symptom severity at postassessment.
**Results:** Data from this pilot trial shows that participants in the intervention group used the smartphone-based intervention for
46% of all days (6.4/14) and reported a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms than did participants in the control
condition (F1,74=19.34; P=.001), with a large effect size (d=1.02). Effects were sustained at a 3-month follow-up.

**Conclusions:** A gamified smartphone-based intervention combining CBT with AAMT may foster patient engagement and
effectively target depressive symptoms. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in a phase 3 trial
using clinical samples. Moreover, the intervention should be compared to active control conditions.

### Introduction

Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the
world [1] and is associated with severe impairments for afflicted
individuals [2]. Fortunately, there is ample evidence for the
efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatments for depression [3].
However, in spite of costly attempts to provide evidence-based


treatment for all patients, a large number of individuals remain
untreated [4,5] or respond to psychotherapy only partially [6].

In the past decade, many attempts have been made to use the
internet to improve access and response to depression treatments.
Due to the dramatic increase in smartphone use in the past years

[7], these attempts have recently started to focus on
smartphone-based interventions for mental health [8]. This focus


-----

can be explained by the advantages of smartphones such as their
widespread use [9], their resulting potential for dissemination

[10], and their constant availability, which allows for the
integration of therapy-relevant competencies into the patient’s
daily life [11].

Available research shows that smartphone-based interventions
using strategies from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have
the potential to effectively reduce depressive symptoms. For
example, a study [12] showed that a smartphone-based
intervention offering 6 weeks of self-guided CBT for adults
with mild-to-moderate depression led to significant reductions
of depressive symptoms when compared to a control condition
with access to internet-based psychoeducation for depression
(d=1.03). Significant effects were also found on measures of
behavioral activation and work-related outcomes such as
productivity, absence rates, and workplace distress. In another
trial [13], participants from a community sample with
mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression received 7 weeks of
training with a CBT-based self-help smartphone-based
intervention. At postassessment, participants in the intervention
group showed significantly greater reductions of depressive
symptoms than both an attention control group (d=0.36) and a
waitlist control condition (d=0.46).

However, results for the effectiveness of CBT-based
smartphone-based interventions for depression are inconsistent.
For example, a three-armed trial [14] compared 4 weeks of
treatment with a gamified smartphone-based intervention that
targets cognitive control abilities to a smartphone-based
intervention based on problem-solving therapy and an
information control smartphone-based intervention in a sample
of participants with mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression.
Although depression symptoms decreased in the total sample,
no significant differences were found between the two active
smartphone-based interventions and the information control
condition at both 4-week and 12-week follow-up assessment.
Moreover, meta-analysis results suggest that heterogeneous
smartphone-based interventions for depression are moderately
effective when compared to inactive controls (g=0.56), but that
effects are small when compared to active control conditions
(g=0.22) [15]. In the meta-analysis, a subgroup analysis showed
that the use of CBT techniques did not influence study effect
sizes significantly when compared to smartphone-based
interventions that did not use CBT.

In addition to smartphone apps using techniques from CBT,
smartphone-based interventions using cognitive bias
modification (CBM) paradigms have recently been discussed
as potentially useful for the reduction of symptoms in various
psychological domains. For depression, available CBM
interventions have focused primarily on the modification of
attention biases [16] and interpretation biases [17]. Regarding
their effectiveness, a meta-analysis study reported a moderate
effect of attention bias modification and interpretation bias
modification trainings on biases (g=0.49), but only a small effect
on anxiety and depression symptoms (g=0.13) [18]. Lately,
approach-avoidance biases have been shown to play an
important role in the development and maintenance of
depression. For example, one study showed that depressed
individuals have a stronger avoidance tendency toward angry


faces when compared to healthy controls (d=0.26) [19]. In
another study [20], the authors found reduced approach
motivation toward positive pictures compared to neutral pictures
in individuals with depressive symptoms when compared to
nondepressed controls (d=0.55). In trainings aiming at the
modification of approach-avoidance biases (approach-avoidance
modification training [AAMT]), participants are asked to
approach functional disorder-specific stimulus material (pictures
and/or statements) and to avoid dysfunctional material.
Prominent examples for the clinical utilization of
computer-based AAMT can be found in the domain of alcohol
dependency. Here, two studies demonstrated that the
combination of 3 months of inpatient CBT and computer-based
AAMT effectively reduced relapse rate in alcohol-dependent
individuals after a 12-month follow-up by 10% [21] to 13%

[22] when compared to CBT-only controls. In the domain of
depression, a recent study used computerized AAMT as an
add-on to treatment-as-usual [23]. In a sample of clinically
depressed individuals, this blended intervention was shown to
successfully reduce depressive symptoms when compared to a
sham control condition. Another study included patients with
various diagnoses and tested AAMT as an adjunct to inpatient
treatment [24]. Here, results showed that AAMT reduced
depressive symptoms compared to a sham control group.
Interestingly, approach tendencies and symptom reductions
were moderated by depression severity at baseline, such that
only participants with higher initial depressive symptoms
benefited from this intervention.

With regard to smartphone-based interventions facilitating a
similar blended approach, pilot studies yielded promising results
for the efficacy of gamified smartphone-based interventions
combining AAMT with face-to-face CBT in various
psychological domains. In one of these studies, the combination
of 14 days of gamified AAMT with a brief face-to-face
counseling session led to significant reductions in body
dissatisfaction in individuals at risk for eating disorders when
compared to waitlist controls (d=0.62) [25]. In another study,
two brief face-to-face group counseling sessions and 14 days
of gamified AAMT significantly reduced procrastination when
compared to a waitlist control condition (d=0.84) [26]. A third
study tested the aforementioned rationale in the domain of
alexithymia and showed the intervention significantly reduced
alexithymia (d=1.14) and improved emotion recognition skills
(d=0.97) when compared to an active control condition [27].

Aside from the utilization of psychotherapeutic techniques,
some studies have suggested that low adherence rates to
smartphone-based interventions and the lack of engagement
features used by apps may be partly responsible for the limited
effectiveness of available interventions [28]. In search of ways
to improve patient engagement, several studies [29,30] have
discussed the use of gamification elements as a particularly
promising tool to increase engagement in nongaming contexts.
Gamification refers to the use of game elements and design
features such as points, badges, levels, progress, and challenges
in nongaming software [31]. Regarding the use of gamification
strategies to increase engagement with online interventions, a
systematic review demonstrated that gamification has the
potential to increase engagement parameters such as time spent

in a program, number of completed assignments, and total
number of views [32]. In depression research, a meta-analysis
that analyzed gamified interventions targeting depression found
a moderate effect size for depression therapy at posttreatment
(d=0.47) [33].

Addressing the important role of CBT and approach-avoidance
biases in depression as described above and following up on
the promising findings for smartphone-based interventions that
combine gamified AAMT with face-to-face CBT in other
domains, we developed an automated, gamified
smartphone-based intervention for depression combining AAMT
with CBT (mentalis Phoenix [MT-Phoenix]). To provide a
scalable and possibly cost-effective intervention, we developed
MT-Phoenix as a standalone smartphone-based intervention.
The aim of this study was to test MT-Phoenix in a phase 2
randomized controlled pilot trial to explore the effectiveness of
this novel intervention in a cohort of individuals with elevated
depressive symptoms. We hypothesized MT-Phoenix would
reduce depressive symptoms and improve well-being. Treatment
effects were expected to be stable at a 3-month follow-up.

### Methods

##### Recruitment

Participant recruitment started in May 2017 through
announcements published on the internet (ie, across several
social media channels and local notice boards). Interested
individuals were asked to scan a QR code or click a link
provided in the announcements that led to a survey tool
(Unipark) providing a screening questionnaire that assessed
participants for study inclusion based on the following criteria:
heightened depression scores with values ≥5 on the Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [34], sufficient German
language skills, aged ≥18 years, access to a smartphone using
iOS (Apple iPhone 5 or above), and ability to provide informed
consent. Eligible individuals were sent written information about
study procedures and an informed consent form via email.
Participants that returned a signed copy of the informed consent
form were randomly assigned to either the intervention or a
waitlist control condition. We used block randomization with
a fixed block size of two to ensure similar sample sizes across
conditions. Randomization was conducted by a master’s degree
student (not otherwise involved in the study) using a
randomization website. Participants received an email with a
link to the survey tool reminding them to complete both the
primary and secondary outcome measures. Posttreatment
assessment was conducted 2 weeks after baseline, follow-up
assessment was conducted 12 weeks after posttreatment
assessment. The treatment was free of charge. Student
participants received course credit for participation and every
participant automatically took part in a draw for a shopping gift
card. All data were assessed with the help of the survey tool.
After baseline completion, participants in the intervention group
received an email inviting them to download MT-Phoenix in
the App Store and to train over a 14-day period. Given the
heterogeneity of studies in this emerging field, no standardized
recommendations on the use of smartphone-based interventions
have come to the authors’ attention. Thus, participants did not


receive any recommendations regarding duration or frequency
of use of the intervention in this pilot trial. Participants in the
waitlist condition were given access to the intervention after
completing the follow-up assessment. All study procedures
complied with the human research guidelines of the Declaration
of Helsinki and were approved by the ethics committee of the
German Psychological Society.

##### Intervention

 Overview

MT-Phoenix was developed by a graduate psychologist (CAL)
and a professor in clinical psychology (MB). MT-Phoenix is a
gamified intervention that provides the trainings for 13
module-based competencies important for managing depressive
symptoms. Multimedia Appendix 1 shows screenshots of the
app. The 13 competencies in MT-Phoenix are presented in this
order to the participants: functional thoughts, positive activities,
daily routines, experiencing pleasure, relaxation, reconnect
socially, self-support, self-comfort, problem-solving, acceptance,
grieving, gratitude, and self-care. Gamification is used by
arranging the modules sequentially, having participants earn
points for completion of certain activities, using a level system
in the AAMT, and providing illustrated feedback components.
The competencies consist of the elements described below.

##### Psychoeducation

At the start of each competency module, MT-Phoenix provides
information on the relevance of the respective competency for
depression. Consistent with typical smartphone use, educative
information is provided by simulating a fictional group chat in
which a coach and four users affected by depression
communicate with each other via made-up SMS text messages.
In the fictional conversations, the coach makes use of two
conventional therapeutic techniques: guided discovery and
Socratic dialogue.

##### AAMT/Audio Instructions

In 10 of the 13 competencies, MT-Phoenix uses four different
types of gamified AAMT in which participants are asked to
systematically approach functional stimulus material and avoid
dysfunctional stimulus material. Approach-avoidance is
achieved by making use of the smartphone’s several input
channels. Three consecutive levels of AAMT are provided in
each of the 10 competencies containing AAMT. Before the start
of a new level, MT-Phoenix provides a short tutorial on how
the respective level is played. Made-up stimulus material was
provided for each competency. The stimuli used in the AAMT
are competency-specific pictures (faces, scenes, etc) with text
statements (negative thoughts, dysfunctional beliefs, etc) written
on them. Examples of stimuli can be found in Multimedia
Appendix 2. In the first level (SWIPE), approach-avoidance is
trained by asking participants to wipe away dysfunctional stimuli
and to pull functional stimuli toward themselves by moving the
stimulus either to the top or the bottom of their smartphone
screen with their finger. In the second level (COMMAND),
participants can control the stimuli with voice commands (eg,
saying the words “future” or “friend” to a functional stimulus,
making it move toward oneself, and the words “past” or “foe”
to a dysfunctional stimulus, making it disappear from the


-----

smartphone display) by making use of the smartphone’s
microphone. In the third level (DRAW), participants are asked
to approach or avoid stimuli by drawing meaningful gestures
(eg, by drawing a check mark on a functional stimulus or by
“crossing out” a dysfunctional stimulus) on the smartphone
display. Here, approach-avoidance is reinforced by making
checkmarks appear in green and crosses in red. In the fourth
level (MAZE), the stimuli are placed in the center of different
labyrinths and participants are instructed to maneuver stimuli
through the labyrinths before pulling functional stimuli toward
themselves or wiping away dysfunctional stimuli. Upon correct
and incorrect reactions, MT-Phoenix provides feedback (positive
feedback: showing illustrated thumbs-up pictures and the word
“Correct!”; negative feedback: illustrated thumbs-down pictures,
the words “That’s wrong!” and a short vibration of the
smartphone) to the participants. For three competencies
(relaxation, experiencing pleasure, and self-support),
MT-Phoenix provides audio instructions instead of AAMT.

##### Tasks

At the end of each competency module, participants are asked
to complete a series of competency-related short tasks. Short
tasks are exercises designed to foster motivation and behavioral
activation (eg, “Go for a 15-min walk today,” “Try to think of
three things you liked today and write them down in the app”).
Studies have found behavioral activation tasks in smartphone
apps for depression to be particularly helpful [35]. Participants
have to complete a minimum of three short tasks to successfully
“play through” a competency and to continue to the subsequent
module in the training.

##### Measures

 Primary Outcome

Depressive symptoms were assessed using the PHQ-9 [34]. The
PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report questionnaire that evaluates the
presence of depressive symptoms during the last 14 days based
on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for major depression.
Each of the 9 items can be scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly
every day) so that scores can range from 0 (absence of
depressive symptoms) to 27 (severe depressive symptoms). The
German version of the PHQ-9 used in this study has been shown
to have high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (86%) in the
detection of depression [36]. In previous studies, the internal
consistency of the PHQ-9 has been demonstrated as good, with
an α score ranging from .86 to .89. In this study, the α for the
PHQ-9 was .86.


##### Secondary Outcomes

Presence of emotional, motivational, cognitive, somatic, and
interactional aspects of depression during the last 7 days was
assessed with the German 20-item version of the Center for
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (Allgemeine
Depressions-Skala [ADS]) [37]. Higher values indicate more
severe depressive symptoms. Internal consistency has been
demonstrated as good, with α scores ranging from .89 to .92.
In this study, the internal consistency was .91.

Well-being was assessed using the 5-item World Health
Organization Well-being Index (WHO-5) [38]. On a 5-point
Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (none of the time) to 5 (all of
the time), the WHO-5 asks respondents to rate how the following
statements applied to them during the last 14 days: “I have felt
cheerful and in good spirits,” “I have felt calm and relaxed,” “I
have felt active and vigorous,” “I woke up feeling fresh and
rested,” and “My daily life has been filled with things that
interest me.” Internal validity has been shown to be excellent
(Cronbach α=.92) in a German-speaking sample. The α for this
study was .89.

##### Statistical Analysis

Possible intervention effects were evaluated using an
intention-to-treat approach. Missing data were shown to be
missing completely at random (nonsignificant Little test),
imputed with the help of Markov chain Monte Carlo multivariate
imputation algorithm with 10 estimations per missing value

[39]. We conducted analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) on
post and follow-up outcome scores to evaluate possible
intervention effects and included the outcomes’baseline values
as covariates to control for a potentially confounding influence
of these scores. As for effect sizes, we calculated Cohen d based
on [40] and followed commonly used conventions [40] by
defining 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 as small, moderate, and large
effects, respectively.

### Results

##### Participants

Multimedia Appendix 3 illustrates the flow of participants
through the study. In the final sample of 77 participants, the
mean age was 29.93 (SD 11.61) years. Participants were
predominately female (56/77, 82%) and 34% (26/77) of
participants reported they were receiving therapeutic treatment
at the time. Significant baseline differences between the
intervention and the control condition were found with regard
to depression measured with the PHQ-9, age, and occupation.

##### Intervention Effects

ANCOVA results on depressive symptoms as assessed with the
PHQ-9 revealed significant differences between the intervention
and the waitlist control condition at postintervention assessment
(F1,74=19.34; P=.001) with a large effect (d=1.02). Of all treated
participants, 63% (25/40) achieved clinically significant
improvement on the primary outcome measure as defined by a
reduction ≥5 points on the PHQ-9. Regarding depressive


symptoms as assessed with the ADS, the ANCOVA yielded
significant differences between the intervention and the waitlist
control condition after the intervention (F1,74=36.68; P=.001)
with a large effect (d=1.41). With regard to well-being,
ANCOVA results showed significant differences between the
intervention and the waitlist control condition at postintervention
assessment (F1,74=15.34; P=.001) with a large effect (d=0.91).
Empirical means and standard deviations are displayed in Table

##### Maintenance of Effects

Regarding the maintenance of treatment effects, ANCOVA
results showed that intervention effects persisted through
follow-up for the PHQ-9 (F1,74=6.35; _P=.014), the ADS_
(F1,74=5.85; P=.018), and the WHO-5 (F1,74=14.72; P=.001).

##### Intervention Engagement and Evaluation

With regard to intervention engagement, 13 participants did not
initiate training with the intervention over the intervention
period. The 27 participants that did initiate training with
MT-Phoenix used the app for an average of 6.38 days (SD 2.83)
and spent 62.39 minutes in the app (SD 68.17). During the
training, participants completed 5.89 (SD 4.43) modules and


an average of 25.89 (SD 23.43) tasks and played 2.28 (SD 3.10)
levels of the AAMT per module. The average error rate
(incorrect responses) in the AAMT was 2.4%, suggesting that
participants understood the training instructions. Participants
spent 20.39 (SD 12.97) minutes playing the AAMT, representing
33% of the total time spent in the app. Regarding the
intervention evaluation, participants in the intervention group
were asked to evaluate the three major components of
MT-Phoenix for their perceived helpfulness at postassessment
using a Likert scale from 0 to 4. Evaluation results were above
average, with high ratings for psychoeducation (mean 3.17, SD
0.72), the AAMT (mean 3.00, SD 0.53), and behavioral
activation tasks (mean 3.17, SD 0.55).

### Discussion

This phase 2 pilot trial evaluated the preliminary effectiveness
of a standalone gamified smartphone-based intervention
combining AAMT and CBT principles in a sample of adults
with elevated depression scores. Study results indicate a greater
reduction of depressive symptom severity over the course of
the intervention in the intervention group when compared to
waitlist controls at posttreatment. Follow-up analyses indicate
that effects were maintained over a period of 3 months after the
completion of the intervention. In addition, the intervention
group exhibited a significant increase in well-being at
postassessment when compared to the control condition. These
effects were also sustained through follow-up.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate
the effectiveness of a gamified intervention that combines CBT
and AAMT techniques for the reduction of depressive
symptoms. With regard to patient engagement, data analyses
show a considerably high retention rate for MT-Phoenix (25/27,
93%, representing the percentage of participants that reused the
app after the first use) when compared to studies showing that
about 30% of individuals stop using smartphone-based
interventions after the initial use [41]. Comparisons of adherence
to smartphone-based depression interventions across studies
indicate that participants trained with MT-Phoenix almost every
other day (6.4/14 days, 46%), while intervention adherence was
lower (39%) in a study that evaluated three smartphone-based
interventions targeting depression [14]. However, comparisons
are limited as smartphone-based interventions tend to differ on
various parameters that have been shown to influence adherence
such as interventional content, design, gamification elements,
and use of reminders and notifications. Comparisons are further
limited by varying study designs such as intervention periods,
target populations, and use instructions. Moreover, the current
study design did not include an experimental manipulation that
tested the gamified smartphone-based intervention against a
nongamified version. Thus, it cannot be concluded that the
gamification elements used in MT-Phoenix were responsible
for the engagement rates observed in this study. On the contrary,
engagement with the intervention may have been influenced by
participants with mild depression scores as such individuals
have been shown to be more willing and able to use a
self-directed intervention like MT-Phoenix [42].

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate
the effectiveness of a gamified smartphone-based intervention
targeting depressive symptoms using AAMT and principles of
CBT. The observed effect sizes (d) were 1.02-1.41 for
depression and 0.91 for well-being. Comparisons of effect sizes
suggest that MT-Phoenix yields similar (well-being) and larger
(depression) effects compared to smartphone-based interventions
using gamified AAMT in combination with face-to-face CBT.
Moreover, preliminary effects found in this pilot trial are
superior to other standalone smartphone-based interventions
for depression (g=0.56), as demonstrated in a meta-analysis

[15]. Thus, MT-Phoenix is a promising low-threshold
intervention for individuals with heightened depressive
symptoms.


The findings presented in this paper have important theoretical
and clinical implications. First, they provide evidence that a
gamified smartphone-based intervention combining AAMT
with CBT principles can reduce depressive symptoms. Second,
this study is the first to show that a blended approach
(smartphone-based intervention combined with face-to-face
CBT) can be automated and delivered by a standalone
smartphone-based intervention without any face-to-face contact
with a mental health professional. Study results add to the
growing body of literature suggesting that smartphone-based
interventions have the potential to change the provision of
mental health services profoundly, especially when interventions
are scalable and easy to disseminate like the program under
investigation. Third, this study demonstrates that a
smartphone-based intervention targeting depression can engage
participants to adhere to the intervention frequently. This finding
is corroborated when comparing training data from this study
with usage rates in other studies that tested smartphone-based
interventions for depression.

Regardless of its merits, results from this study are subject to
several limitations that need closer consideration. First, although
similar interventions have been positively evaluated in pilot
studies on body dissatisfaction [25], procrastination [26], and
alexithymia [27], findings from this study provide preliminary
evidence only for the particular program under investigation
and thus cannot be easily generalized to other interventions
combining AAMT and CBT. Hence, future studies should
replicate these findings in other disorders or psychological
problems. Second, as 30% of all participants received
psychotherapy while participating in this study, results may
have been influenced by factors other than the intervention
under investigation. Further studies are needed to examine
whether MT-Phoenix may be more appropriate as an adjunct
to treatment-as-usual instead of a standalone intervention. Third,
generalization of study results is limited as the smartphone-based
intervention was made accessible for iPhone owners exclusively,
the statistical power was low due to the rather small sample
size, and the sample was homogeneous with regard to several
sociodemographic variables. Thus, future studies should make
MT-Phoenix available for other operating systems as well and
should further examine the intervention in larger and more
diverse samples. Fourth, inclusion of participants was performed
on the basis of heightened depression scores rather than on the
basis of a systematic diagnosis (eg, by using the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders) [43]. We
included participants who reported PHQ-9 depression scores
of ≥5 to ensure testing of the intervention in individuals with a
range of symptom severity and to allow for comparison between
studies on smartphone-based interventions for depression that
have focused predominately on participants with mild and
moderate depressive symptoms. However, as we did not include
an upper cutoff for study inclusion, participants with severe
depressive symptoms were also included in the study.
Approximately 30% of the study sample reported being in
therapeutic treatment, thus hinting at the inclusion of patients
with diagnosed depression. Future studies should try to replicate
the findings in samples of patients that are more distinct with
regard to depressive symptom severity. To this end, we are
currently conducting a large multicenter clinical study that


-----

JMIR MENTAL HEALTH Lukas et al


compares a gamified version of MT-Phoenix with a nongamified
version in patients with a major depressive disorder diagnosis
after release from inpatient treatment. Fifth, although the
majority of participants in the treatment condition achieved
clinically significant improvement, the intervention should be
further improved to ensure positive outcomes for an even larger
number of individuals. Sixth, future studies should attempt to
further improve both study and intervention adherence. To this
end, qualitative analyses of user data may be helpful to
systematically identify and improve flaws in both the technology
and content of the 1.1 version of the intervention used in this
study. Seventh, the use of a nonactive waitlist control group
may have led to an overestimation of treatment effects as waitlist
designs have been discussed as possible nocebo conditions in
the literature [44]. Despite the acknowledged limitations of
research designs using nonactive control conditions, we decided
to use an economic waitlist design in this pilot trial. Eighth, the
high dropout rate before initiation of the intervention in the
intervention group is another factor that has to be regarded with

caution when interpreting the results of this study, especially
in terms of the use of an intention-to-treat approach. Although
uptake of automated online-based interventions with no personal
contact between participants and study personnel is commonly
observed as low in the literature [45], allocation to the control
group and older age usually predict low uptake rates. Further
observations are needed to identify possible reasons for this
phenomenon beyond the aforementioned. Ninth, this pilot trial
did not include an a priori power analysis to determine the
sample size necessary for meaningful comparisons between
treatment arms. Finally, despite the important role of
approach-avoidance biases in depression, the current design
prohibits assigning intervention effects to the AAMT. Further
dismantling or comparison studies are needed to ascribe
intervention effects to distinct techniques used in MT-Phoenix.
Another possible solution to this limitation is to systematically
measure approach and avoidance tendencies at both pre- and
posttraining.
