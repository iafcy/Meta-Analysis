ABSTRACT

The Effects of Using Pacifica on Depressed Patients


by Daniel Bustillos

Depression is a psychiatric condition that affects millions of Americans each year. It is a concern


in today’s society that needs to be treated and addressed with more care. According to the World

Health Organization, major depression is the second largest health care problem worldwide when


it comes to disability. Cognitive behavioral therapy has demonstrated positive outcomes in

patients with depression. With advanced technology, millions of people are using the Internet to

find a solution to their depressive symptoms. Pacifica is a mobile application that offers

relaxation activities such as deep breathing, calming strategies, positive visualization,

mindfulness, muscle relaxation, visualization, calming sounds, guided meditation, support

groups, and daily tracking (Pacifica, 2017). A research project was completed by asking 30

individuals to participate in the study. Twenty-four of the 30 participated, but only 19 completed

the pretest and posttest. The Beck Depression Inventory was analyzed pre- and post-intervention,

along with a paired samples t-test and descriptive statistics.

Effects of Using Pacifica on Depressed Patients


Depression has been known about for years; in the past, it was viewed as a demonic

disorder by many. One in every six Americans suffers from the mood disorder, which can lead to


the development of medical conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease and, even

more seriously, suicide. Unfortunately, only 50% of people suffering from major depression


receive treatment, and only 20% follow the guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association

(Andrew, 2016). Various research articles have concluded that patients with depression have a

shorter life span and are more likely to partake in risky behavior. Various approaches to the

treatment of depression have been attempted, and cognitive behavioral therapy has demonstrated

positive results. A new approach to cognitive behavioral therapy has been analyzed based on the

use of the Internet and a mobile application. Advanced practice registered nurses are in a great

position to help alleviate the shortage of mental health providers due their diverse scope of

practice.

**Chapter I: Background and Significance**

**Background and Significance**

Depression is a psychiatric condition that affects an estimated 17.6 million Americans

each year (“Depression and Suicide Risk,” 2014). It is a concern in today’s society that needs to

be treated and addressed with more care; a great number of patients are living with psychiatric

conditions that involve daily suicidal ideation, causing them to move in and out of psychiatric

facilities. There is also a lack of psychiatric providers and therapies to help patients diagnosed

with depression. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth

_edition), depression is defined as a loss of interest or pleasure in the activities of daily living for_

more than two weeks (Reynolds & Kamphause, 2013).

Five of the following nine symptoms need to be present nearly every day in order for one

to be diagnosed with depression. The symptoms include depressed mood or irritability, decreased


interest or pleasure, significant weight changes (+/- 5%), changes in sleep, changes in activity,

loss of energy, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, diminished concentration, and suicidal ideation


(Reynolds & Kamphause, 2013). When depression becomes too strong for a patient to bear,

many times, he or she will resort to what is, in his or her eyes, the only solution: suicide.


Depression is the psychiatric condition that is most commonly correlated with suicide.

**Assessment of the Phenomena (Problem Statement)**

Depression is an issue of concern that has a great economic burden; it shortens the lives

of the people diagnosed and results in a high suicide rate among individuals. Depression has a

great impact on the economy of the United States. One clinical trial analyzed the impact of

depression on quality-adjusted life expectancy (QUALE). The research concluded that at age 18,

QUALE was 28 years higher for depressed adults and 56.8 years higher for non-depressed

adults. In essence, there was a 28-year loss for patients with depression starting at age 18 (Zack,

Thompson, Crosby, & Gottesman, 2015). According to the World Health Organization (2018),

major depression is the leading health care problem worldwide when it comes to disability.

Major depression affects approximately 17% of individuals during their lifetimes. Sadly,

approximately 15% of all depressive patients will commit suicide over a period of 10–20 years.

Antidepressant medications remain the primary treatment for depression. However, meta
analysis has demonstrated that antidepressants only have beneficial effects for severely

depressed patients (Jakobsen, Hansen, Storebø, Simonsen, & Gluud, 2011). Data such as this

emphasize the importance of developing new research and treatments for patients with
