Abstract

### Objective: Technological advances have sparked the development of computer- and smartphone-based self-help programs for depressed people, but these programs’ efficacy is uncertain. This randomized controlled trial evaluated an intervention called SuperBetter (SB), which is accessed via smartphone and/or the SB Web site. Materials and Methods: Online, we recruited 283 adult iPhone[�] (Apple, Cupertino, CA) users with significant depression symptoms according to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D). They were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) a version of SB using cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychotherapy strategies to target depression (CBT-PPT SB); (b) a general SB version focused on self-esteem and acceptance (General SB); or (c) a waiting list control group (WL). The two SB groups were instructed to use SB for 10 minutes daily for 1 month. All participants completed psychological distress and well-being measures online every 2 weeks through follow-up. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using hierarchical linear modeling. Results: As hypothesized, SB participants achieved greater reductions in CES-D scores than WL participants by posttest (Cohen’s d = 0.67) and by follow-up (d = 1.05). Contrary to prediction, CBT-PPT SB did not perform better than General SB; both versions of SB were more effective than the WL control. Differences between SB versions favored General SB but were not statistically significant. Conclusions: These large effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously in light of high attrition rates and the motivated, self-selected sample. Nonetheless, smartphone-based/Internet-based self-help may play an important role in treating depression.


Introduction
echnological advances have sparked the development of computer- and smartphone-based tools aimed
# T
at promoting mental health.[1,2] These tools can augment
conventional depression treatment by making therapy
homework more convenient and engaging, by serving as a
minimally invasive intervention for people with mild
symptoms, and by offering treatment where it has been
unavailable.[2–4] Of the estimated 350 million people who
suffer from depression, fewer than half are treated, and
about 30% of those treated do not fully recover.[5,6] High-tech
tools present exciting opportunities to address these problems, but do they work?


Efficacy of computer- and smartphone-based
interventions

Online cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) programs can
alleviate depression, whether they are self-directed, therapist-guided, or video chat–based.[7–12] These programs’ effect
sizes are small to moderate for self-reported depression, with
Cohen’s d ranging from 0.20 to 0.37.[8,9] Their efficacy is
perhaps unsurprising, as these programs closely follow traditional therapy, psychoeducation, and/or bibliotherapy
models.
Mobile platforms have enabled novel, creative uses of
traditional treatment strategies. Mobile applications (apps)
have multiple advantages: They are convenient, engaging,

user-friendly, personalized, and self-paced. Framed as
games, apps become potentially powerful tools to promote
well-being. "Serious games" are games designed to achieve
goals beyond entertainment, such as improved health, cognition, and education.[13] Indeed, playing games is associated
with improved mood and decreased physical stress, as well
as improved knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors toward
health and exercise.[14,15] Additionally, games can build supportive communities through chatrooms, forums, and social
networking.[16]

Although well-being apps and serious games have proliferated, their impact is unclear as few have been rigorously
evaluated.[17,18] Researchers and app developers can collaborate to identify and evaluate apps with potential to relieve
depression and enhance well-being.

The present study

SuperBetter (SB) is an innovative smartphone- and Internet-based tool that uses game mechanics to increase users’
drive to accomplish challenging goals and to build social
support through online discussion forums and Facebook integration. (More information on SB is available in Supplementary Table S1 [Supplementary Data are available online
at www.liebertonline.com/g4h].) The University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) and SuperBetter Labs, LLC (San
Francisco, CA) collaborated to conduct a randomized controlled trial of SB’s ability to relieve depression. A version of
SB was developed to specifically target depressive symptoms
using principles from successful established therapies,
namely, CBT and positive psychotherapy (PPT).[19–21] This
version (‘‘CBT-PPT SB’’) was evaluated alongside an existing version of SB (‘‘General SB’’), not specifically designed for depression. Both versions were compared with
each other and with a waiting list control group (WL).
We anticipated that SB use would result in decreased
depression. We expected CBT-PPT SB to provide the
greatest benefit, given its basis in established interventions
for depression. According to the cognitive theory of depression, participants should benefit from learning cognitive
restructuring techniques that help them identify and correct
distorted, negative thoughts about the self, world, and future.[22] In addition, participants should benefit from behavioral activation, a well-established technique that alleviates
depression by increasing daily experiences of pleasure and
mastery.[23] Finally, PPT has been found to alleviate depression symptoms by increasing positive emotions, meaning,
and engagement.[21]

We expected General SB to confer a more modest benefit.
First, it should benefit participants by facilitating so-called
common factors such as positive expectancy and social support.[24] Second, activities focused on self-esteem should benefit participants by addressing depressive self-devaluation.[22]

Finally, third-wave CBT approaches have recently highlighted
the value of acceptance-based treatment strategies, which are
included in this version of SB.[25]

In addition, we expected that SB use would impact secondary outcomes. We anticipated that SB would diminish
participants’ anxiety, given the comorbidity of depression
and anxiety as well as the commonalities in treatment approaches for depression and anxiety symptoms. We also
anticipated that SB would raise participants’ overall life


satisfaction, self-efficacy, and perceived social support, as
SB was designed to empower participants to make positive
changes in their lives and to connect with others. We did not
hypothesize that either version of SB would prove superior
with regard to these secondary outcomes.
Thus, we tested three hypotheses: (a) Participants using
SB will experience greater improvements in depression
symptoms compared with WL participants. (b) Participants
using CBT-PPT SB will experience greater improvements in
depression symptoms compared with those using General
SB. (c) Participants using SB will experience greater improvements in secondary outcomes (anxiety, life satisfaction,
self-efficacy, and social support) compared with WL participants.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Eligible participants were iPhone[�] (Apple, Cupertino,
CA) owners (as SB was available only on iOS) 18 years of
age or older, meeting the criterion score for clinically significant depression (16 or higher) on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D)[26]

(Table 1). A priori power analyses, completed using
G*Power software, indicated that at least 207 participants
would be needed to detect a small effect in a repeatedmeasures design testing a within–between interaction (e.g., a
Time · Condition interaction), assuming a error probability =
0.05 and power (1 – b error probability) = 0.80, with a correlation of 0.40 among repeated measures. Participants
(n = 283) were recruited online between November 2012 and
March 2013 through announcements on the Penn Authentic
Happiness Web site and the Craigslist.org community bulletin board. The announcement guided potential participants
to www.Qualtrics.com where they completed a CES-D
screening and baseline assessment.
Enrollment and random assignment were completed in an
automated fashion on the Qualtrics Web site. After completing the baseline assessment, participants were randomly
assigned to one of three conditions (using the automated
Block Randomizer in Qualtrics): CBT-PPT SB, General SB,
or WL. Participants were aware of whether they were assigned to SB or WL, but SB participants were not aware of
the version they received or of our specific hypotheses.
(Astute participants with knowledge of existing therapies
may have recognized the CBT and PPT components of the
CBT-PPT version.) Information on participant flow is provided in Figure 1.

Procedure

This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board (i.e., Human Ethics Committee) at the University of
Pennsylvania (protocol number 816882).

Intervention content. CBT-PPT SB targeted depression
with two sets of activities. These participants first downloaded content adapted from PPT: (a) the 3 Good Things
intervention,[27] (b) identification of personal strengths with
the Values in Action Inventory,[27] and (c) guidance on using
strengths in new ways.[21,27] Upon completion, they were then
asked to download content adapted from two classic CBT

interventions: (a) cognitive restructuring (replacing depressive thoughts with adaptive ones)[22] and (b) behavioral activation (planning and carrying out activities that provide
pleasure and mastery).[23]

The General SB program focused on self-esteem and acceptance of the present. For instance, participants were asked
to ‘‘practice being present’’ (notice surroundings, breathe
deeply, etc.), collect a list of ‘‘awesome qualities’’ others
attribute to them, or find a piece of art or music that reminds
them to accept life’s ups and downs. Figure 2 shows SB
screenshots.
The two versions of SB were otherwise similar. SB users
interacted with a game-like platform and were invited to describe a goal (an epic win; here, overcoming depression), take
recommended steps toward this goal (quests), complete recommended mood-boosting activities ( power-ups), directly
address specific obstacles (battle bad guys), and enlist social
support if desired (invite allies). SB users earned points and
‘‘leveled up’’ as they progressed through these activities.
WL participants did not complete any prescribed intervention. They were asked only to complete surveys at 2, 4,
and 6 weeks (as SB participants did also). All participants
were free to concurrently use other treatment strategies (e.g.,
psychotherapy, coaching, and/or medication). Data about
such activities were collected at each time point and used as
time-varying covariates in analyses.

Intervention procedure. Both SB groups were instructed
to use SB for at least 10 minutes per day for 1 month, as
previous literature suggests that interventions lasting p4
weeks can effectively reduce depression symptoms.[28] The


intervention was targeted to occur on the SB iPhone app, but
participants could also use the SB Web site on their personal
computers. (The SB app may be somewhat easier to use than
the Web version, mainly because participants have their mobile phones accessible when completing SB actions. Thus,
they can record their actions in the app immediately. Also,
fewer clicks are needed to record each action in the mobile
app. On the other hand, some players prefer the accessibility
of larger screens generally used with the Web version. However, content and text are identical across versions, and other
differences are minor.) They were encouraged to use the
forum and recruit Facebook social support (allies), which was
optional in order to protect privacy and confidentiality.

Measurement procedure. Data collection occurred online
via Qualtrics surveys and via participants’ iPhones/computers.
(SB Labs automatically logged app usage data, such as number
of log-ins and what content was downloaded.) Participants
engaged in the intervention and surveys in a self-directed
manner at their location and time of choice. No incentives were
used to increase compliance, but e-mail reminders were sent at
2-, 4-, and 6-week assessment intervals. Data collection lasted
through May 2013; the study concluded when the target enrollment was surpassed and the final wave of participants
completed their 6-week follow-up assessments.

Measures

Participants completed a total of four online surveys, each at
2-week intervals (baseline, midpoint, posttest, and follow-up).
The survey contained the measures and questions detailed

in Table 1. The CES-D was used to assess the primary outcome variable: depression at posttest.[26] The CES-D is a valid
measure of depression symptoms for both psychiatric populations and community samples and proved reliable in this
study (Cronbach’s a = 0.86).[29] Participants also reported
demographic traits: race/ethnicity, gender, age, and education level.

Data analysis

Preparatory analyses. We first examined the data distributions and checked that the assumptions of our intended
analytic methods were met. We tested for differences in demographic and/or psychosocial variables between conditions


at baseline, using t tests and one-way analyses of variance (for
continuous variables) and chi-squared tests (for categorical
variables). When significant differences were detected, these
variables were used as covariates in the main analyses.
We also examined whether intervention usage or fidelity
differed across conditions and discovered that it did: 54.41
percent of participants using CBT-PPT SB (n = 37) downloaded only PPT content and did not download or use the CBT
content. (Unlike CBT-PPT SB, which comprised these two
separate downloads at distinct time points, the General SB
condition required only one download to receive all content.)

Missing data. We retained 41.34 percent of the original
sample at midpoint (n = 117), 26.15 percent at posttest

(n = 74), and 18.34 percent at follow-up (n = 52), a high attrition rate typical for Internet-based intervention research.[30]

Participants who stayed in the study through posttest were
more satisfied with SB (mean = 5.26, standard deviation

[SD] = 1.14) than those who did not (mean = 4.24, SD = 1.79)

[t(49) = - 2.51, P = 0.02]. WL participants were less likely to
have dropped out by posttest than either of the other groups

[v[2](2, n = 283) = 11.53, P = 0.003]. Missing data were accounted for using intent-to-treat analyses estimated with the
maximum likelihood method in a hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) framework.

HLM of outcomes. A series of models was used to conduct an intent-to-treat analysis, modeling change in participants’ depression symptoms (and in secondary outcome
variables) over time. We conducted analyses using SAS
Enterprise version 9.3 software.[31] The Level-1 model captures
within-person change in depression (and other repeatedly
measured variables) over four time points. This within-person
change is referred to as the slope. The Level-2 model reflects
participants’ condition (CBT-PPT SB, General SB, or WL) as
the between-persons predictor.
For all HLM models (unless otherwise noted in Results),
continuous measures in the Level-1 model were centered at
pretest (i.e., the intercept), and dichotomous variables were
coded 1/0 to allow for meaningful evaluation of parameter
estimates. We first tested unconstrained models to confirm
that there was significant individual variation about the slope
and intercept before accounting for random assignment to
condition. Treatment effects were evaluated by examining the
Time - Condition interaction, which reflects group differences
in improvement over time and is represented by the b coefficient associated with treatment condition in the Level-2


model. The b coefficient represents how much the slope of the
dependent variable (e.g., depression symptoms) changes with
every 1-unit change in the independent variable of interest
(here, condition), controlling for any other variables in the
Level-2 model. We calculated effect sizes (Cohen’s d) for
between-group changes using the procedure recommended
by Feingold.[32] In all models, we included key covariates:
participants’ use of other treatment (medication, therapy, and
coaching) during the trial, age at baseline, and gender.

Post hoc analysis examining the impact of CBT content. As noted above, 54.41 percent of CBT-PPT SB users
downloaded only half of the intended content. We suspect
that this was due not to meaningful systematic differences
across individuals, but rather to confusion about how to
download content: Unlike General SB participants, CBTPPT SB participants were asked to download content on two
separate occasions. To better understand the impact of PPT
versus CBT content, we conducted another HLM analysis in
which we separately examined the impact of General content, PPT content, and CBT content compared with WL (a
treatment-on-treated analysis).

Results

Participant flow

There were 283 participants randomly assigned to the
CBT-PPT SB (n = 93), General SB (n = 97), or WL (n = 93)
groups. (Three individuals were excluded from analyses
because they enrolled in the study twice and were assigned to
two different conditions.) Of these, 117 completed the
midpoint assessment, 74 completed the posttest, and 52
completed the follow-up (Fig. 1).

Demographics and clinical characteristics

The sample was primarily white (n = 238, 84.1 percent),
female (n = 197, 69.60 percent), and educated at the Associate’s Degree (i.e., 2-year college degree) level or higher
(n = 261, 92.2 percent). Mean age was 40.15 (SD = 12.40)
years. Comparing the three conditions, age differences
approached conventional levels of statistical significance

[F(2, 280) = 2.89, P = 0.06], as did gender differences [v[2](2,
n = 280) = 5.57, P = 0.06]. Thus, age and gender were used as
covariates in subsequent analyses. Other demographic
characteristics, recruitment source, and key clinical characteristics did not significantly differ across groups. Table 2
provides detailed demographic and clinical information.
At baseline, participants’ mean CES-D score of 33.39
(SD = 9.41) reflected clinically significant levels of depression symptoms. At baseline, 35.7 percent (n = 101) of participants were using therapy as a strategy to treat depression
and/or another condition, 43.8 percent (n = 124) were using
medication, and 7.4 percent (n = 21) were using life coaching. Overall, 61.1 percent of participants (n = 173) were using
one or more of these strategies. Depression symptoms and
other psychosocial variables did not significantly differ
across groups (Table 2).

Treatment fidelity

This study prioritized external validity and made SB usage
as naturalistic as possible. Treatment adherence was lower
than might be expected in traditional clinical randomized
controlled trials, likely because of the absence of incentives.
Of 190 participants assigned to use SB, 75.80 percent
(n = 144) logged in at least once. Number of log-ins ranged
from 1 to 274 total, with a mean of 21.53 (SD = 34.27) and
median of 9.50. Relatively few participants used the optional
forum (n = 21) or invited allies via Facebook (n = 6), and this
did not significantly differ across the two SB conditions.
Similarly, the two SB conditions did not significantly differ
in the number of times they signed in or used various SB
features (power-ups, quests, battles, and extra powerpacks).


Some CBT-PPT SB participants did not receive all intended SB content, perhaps owing to confusion about technical aspects of the app. Of the 93 participants assigned to
CBT-PPT SB, 72 (77.4 percent) logged in to SB. Of the 68
(73.12 percent) who downloaded content, 37 (54.41 percent)
downloaded PPT content only, whereas 31 (45.59 percent)
downloaded both PPT and CBT as intended. (In contrast, of
the 97 participants assigned to General SB, 72 [74.23 percent] logged in, and 64 of these [88.89 percent] downloaded
all the intended content for this group.) We further examine
this issue below.

Primary outcome: Changes in depression by posttest

SB’s effects were evaluated by examining the significance
of the difference between the rates of change (slopes) in
CES-D scores for the CBT-PPT SB, General SB, and WL
conditions. All models controlled for participants’ age,
gender, and use of other treatment (medication, therapy, and
coaching). (Note that medication, therapy/coaching, and
gender did not predict change in depression. Older participants showed slightly greater decreases in depression [Age
coefficient = - 0.13, t(276) = - 2.83, P < 0.001].) Table 3
gives means and SDs, and Tables 4 and 5 give HLM parameter estimates and significance tests. Generally, participants became less depressed over time (i.e., the main effect
of time was significant). SB users achieved greater relief
from depression symptoms than WL participants (Table 4),
with an effect size (Cohen’s d) of 0.67 by posttest. The
difference between SB and WL groups was statistically
significant at posttest [Condition coefficient = - 6.13,
t(276) = - 3.90, P < 0.001] (the Condition coefficient was
estimated in the model using scores centered at posttest).
Participants using CBT-PPT SB did not achieve greater
relief from symptoms than participants using General SB,
contrary to prediction (Fig. 3). Both groups showed significantly faster rates of improvement than WL (Table 5).
CBT-PPT SB participants were less depressed than WL
participants at posttest [Condition coefficient = - 3.92,
t(275) = - 2.06, P = 0.04], as were General SB participants

depression than WL participants (d = 1.05) (Table 4). Again,
both CBT-PPT SB (d = 0.76) and General SB (d = 1.36)
participants improved more rapidly than WL participants
(Table 5). Both CBT-PPT SB [Condition coefficient =
-6.99, t(275) = - 2.66, P = 0.008] and General SB [Condition
coefficient = - 12.42, t(275) = - 4.70, P < 0.001] participants were less depressed than WL participants at follow-up
(with this Condition coefficient estimated using scores centered at posttest). Again, these models controlled for age,
gender, and use of other treatment (medication, therapy, and
coaching).

Anxiety, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and social support. Detailed information about SB’s impact on secondary
outcome variables is provided in Tables 4 and 5. Of note is that
SB users experienced greater decreases in anxiety than WL
and greater improvements in life satisfaction, self-efficacy,
and social support than WL. Again, both versions of SB were
generally effective, and neither version proved superior to
the other. Here too, all models controlled for age, gender, and
use of other treatment.

Exploratory analysis of impact of CBT content

We conducted a treatment-on-treated analysis to determine the impact of PPT content versus combined CBT-PPT
content. We used a hierarchical linear model similar to those
above to investigate the impact of having actually downloaded PPT content only (n = 37), CBT and PPT content
(n = 31), or General SB content (n = 64). In comparison with
WL participants who did not use SB at all (n = 79), participants who actually downloaded General SB or the complete
CBT-PPT content achieved significantly greater decreases in
depression (Table 6). In contrast, those who downloaded
PPT only did not fare better than participants who did not use
SB at all. (In 14 cases it was uncertain whether a WL participant had downloaded SB content before or after the WL
period had elapsed. These individuals were excluded here in
order to make this a clean treatment-on-treated analysis.)

Discussion

Participants who used the SB tool achieved decreases in
depression symptoms. Our first hypothesis was supported:
SB users demonstrated significantly fewer depressive
symptoms by posttest than control participants. These findings are consistent with past research on the positive impact
of online programs for reducing depressive symptoms.[7–10]


Furthermore, these findings suggest that mobile platforms
and game mechanics provide opportunities for creative and
effective uses of clinical knowledge.
Our second hypothesis was not supported. Even though
the CBT-PPT SB version was based on empirically supported depression interventions, CBT-PPT SB users did not
experience greater decreases in depression than General SB
users. Rather, both groups of SB users fared better than WL
participants, and neither SB version proved superior; General
SB’s apparent advantage was not statistically significant.
Why was CBT-PPT SB no more effective than General
SB? First, treatment fidelity issues help to explain the pattern
of results. About half of CBT-PPT SB users failed to
download the CBT content, and so they did not receive the
full intervention as intended. We would not expect that
completing just two PPT exercises would have a large impact
on depression symptoms. Indeed, the treatment-on-treated
analysis indicated that participants who downloaded the
combined CBT-PPT content fared significantly better than
the WL, whereas those who downloaded only PPT content
did not. There may also be substantive issues with the CBTPPT SB content that can explain why it was not even more
effective. For instance, CBT-PPT SB users may have found
this newly developed content less user-friendly and engaging
compared with the General SB participants who used the more
refined, established, popular SB content. In addition, the more
complex skills involved in CBT may take longer to master or
may require more direct and intensive guidance. Moreover,
depressed individuals can have motivational and cognitive
deficits that cause them to be frustrated and discouraged by
challenging, reflective activities; in contrast, easy, pleasant
activities offer a simpler path to improved mood.[33]

On the other hand, why was General SB more effective
than anticipated? First, this version of SB was chosen because it was a well-established favorite of previous SB users,
and so it may have been much more engaging. Second,
negative self-evaluations are central to depression, so General SB’s self-esteem content may have conferred important
benefits.[22] Third, there is increasing evidence that acceptance is a useful approach for dealing with depression.[34]

General SB’s acceptance-based content may have proved
accessible and helpful—and it may have been easier to adapt
to the mobile format in comparison with complex cognitive
restructuring skills. Fourth, it is possible that both versions of
SB exert their effects through common mechanisms such as
increasing positive expectancy or helping users feel empowered.

Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) ranged from 0.43 to 1.36. The binomial effect size display can help make sense of Cohen’s d.[35]

The binomial effect size display presents hypothetical differences in outcome rates across the intervention and control
groups. An effect size of d = 0.67 (SB versus WL at posttest)
is equivalent to a scenario in which 66 percent of intervention participants experience meaningful change and only 34
percent of WL participants do. An effect size of d = 1.36
(General versus WL at follow-up, the greatest effect found
here) is equivalent to 78 percent of intervention participants
experiencing meaningful change compared with 22 percent
of WL participants.

Limitations

These effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously in light
of several important limitations of the study, concerning
treatment fidelity and dosage, attrition, measurement, and
generalizability.

Treatment fidelity and dosage. About half (54.41 percent) of participants using CBT-PPT SB (n = 37) did not
receive the complete intervention, as explained above. This
limits conclusions that can be drawn about differences between the SB versions. To more accurately determine whether
one version of SB is superior, it would be necessary to ensure
that (in a large sample with low attrition) all participants received all intended content. It would also be beneficial to
measure any moderators that may make a particular version of
SB more effective for a particular set of individuals.
Also, although all SB participants received the same instructions about how often to use SB, treatment dosage (i.e.,
number of log-ins) varied from 1 to 274 (mean = 21.53). The
majority of participants did not in fact log in daily for
1 month. It is notable that several participants commented
that they would have appreciated having more content to
download. SB encourages users to create their own content
(quests, battles, bad guys, power-ups, etc.) if/when they
complete all the preprogrammed content. However, it may
be that some users disengage when they run out of novel
predesigned content. Our log-in rates hint that to maximize
SB’s effectiveness, it may be necessary to spur users to return to the site daily by creating a higher volume of novel
content or developing other motivational strategies.

Attrition. This study had low retention rates, with only
26.15 percent of the sample intact at posttest and 18.34
percent at follow-up. These large attrition rates are not uncommon in Internet-based research.[30] The attrition rate is
due in part to our prioritization of ecological validity. For
naturalistic SB usage, incentives for compliance were not
used. The large attrition rate limits the conclusions we can
draw, in spite of our efforts to alleviate some of these concerns by using intention-to-treat with HLM. The relatively
small number of individuals who stayed in the study through
follow-up strongly influenced the parameter estimates. These
retained participants might have been especially motivated
or high-functioning.

Measurement. Depression was measured using a validated self-report instrument, not a clinical assessment. Thus,
participants may not have met criteria for a diagnosis of


Major Depressive Disorder, and these findings may not
generalize to such individuals. (Nonetheless, the sample’s
mean CES-D score was well above the CES-D’s standard
clinical cutoff, and a majority of participants were receiving
treatment.)

Generalizability. This sample of iPhone owners may not
represent the general population, as iPhone users tend to be
more educated, liberal, and of higher income than the average
individual.[36] In addition, SB’s effects may vary for users with
greater or lesser comfort/expertise with mobile and online
technology. Because of the short follow-up, we also cannot
generalize about the long-term effects of the intervention.
It is notable that our sample was largely recruited from a
self-help Web site, Authentic Happiness. Individuals who are
actively seeking self-help tools may be an especially motivated, hopeful, or proactive subset of the depressed population. Furthermore, our participants were aware of whether
they were in WL an or intervention group. Intervention
participants may have enjoyed positive expectancies, hope,
and/or increased self-efficacy owing to the knowledge that
they had accessed a new self-help resource. These factors
could have increased the effect sizes found here.
Thus, our findings may not generalize to all depressed
people, particularly those in traditional clinical settings. Our
findings are more applicable to depressed individuals seeking self-help resources. Participants did not receive any incentives to take part or to comply with the intervention
guidelines, and this increases the study’s external validity.

Implications for research

There are exciting future directions for this research. Positive changes were effectively elicited through an innovative
technological format unlike traditional therapy and psychoeducation. This suggests that psychological interventions may benefit from embracing the creative opportunities
provided by mobile platforms and game-like formats. In
particular, it is important to understand how evidence-based
treatment strategies can translate into novel formats without
sacrificing fidelity or effectiveness. It will be valuable for
researchers to replicate this study but with an emphasis
on internal validity, namely, by minimizing attrition rates
and maximizing treatment fidelity. We also need to understand the mechanisms of change in these new interventions and the populations for whom these interventions are
most appropriate.

Implications for clinical work

These findings suggest that smartphone-based apps provide promising opportunities for mental health interventions.
The tools could be integrated with traditional psychotherapy
approaches. For example, therapists could use mobile apps to
assign, monitor, and collaborate with clients on homework
between sessions. Although these tools cannot achieve or
replace what individual therapists do, they can expand access
to treatment. People unable to receive treatment owing to
stigma or other barriers (cost, location, long waiting lists)
could be helped by technology-assisted interventions. Additionally, smartphone-based tools could serve as appropriate and cost-effective interventions for people with minimal
symptoms not yet requiring medication or therapy. It is our

hope that a new wave of innovative, evidence-based online
and mobile interventions will help to alleviate depression
symptoms and raise well-being.
