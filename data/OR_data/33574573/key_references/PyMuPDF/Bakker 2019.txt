Objective: There is an abundance of evidence supporting the efficacy of compu-
terised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), but few studies have evaluated mobile
applications (apps) that provide CBT strategies. This study investigating the rela-
tionships between mental health outcomes and engagement with a mobile app that
recommended short CBT strategies.
Method: Participants downloaded the MoodMission app from the iOS and
Android app stores, completed in-app baseline assessments, and final assessments
30 days later. Participants reported their mood to MoodMission when they were
feeling low or anxious and received a list of short CBT strategies to choose from
and engage in. Data from 617 assessment completers (71% female; M age = 27
years) were analysed via hierarchical and mediated regressions.
Results: App engagement ratings predicted increases in mental wellbeing. Media-
tion analyses revealed that there were indirect effects of app engagement on depres-
sion, anxiety, and mental wellbeing via the mediator of coping self-efficacy.
Subsample analyses found this only for participants who were experiencing a mod-
erate level of depression or anxiety at the time of the baseline assessment.
Conclusions: Engaging with an app that provides CBT strategies can increase
mental wellbeing, and coping self-efficacy may mediate effects of the app in indi-
viduals experiencing moderate depression or anxiety.

INTRODUCTION
The ubiquity, portability, and ease of data entry of smart-
phones makes them ideal tools for health and behaviour
change interventions (Aung, Matthews, & Choudhury, 2017;
Dogan, Sander, Wagner, Hegerl, & Kohls, 2017; Wendel,
2013). Simultaneously, the need for accessible mental health
interventions continues to be dire. Depression has become
the top cause of disability worldwide (World Health Organi-
sation, 2017), and while effective psychotherapies for affec-
tive disorders are available (Andrews, Cuijpers, Craske,
McEvoy, & Titov, 2010), the proportion of people who
access them is disappointingly low, with 65% of Australians
who experience a mental health issue not accessing treat-
ment (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2007).
Mental health apps (MHapps) aim to provide highly
accessible mental health supports with a wide range of
smartphone-based
tools,
including
guided
meditations,
thought and mood tracking, psychoeducation, and coping
skills training (Bakker, Kazantzis, Rickwood, & Rickard,
2016). While many MHapps have been developed and
released on app stores, very few have been empirically

validated (Donker et al., 2013; Grist, Porter, & Stallard,
2017; Huguet et al., 2016; Sucala et al., 2017). The mecha-
nisms underlying the purported benefits of their use remain
unstudied.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an evidence-
based psychotherapy that has been successfully translated to
self-guided computer-based programs (Andrews & Wil-
liams, 2014), known as computerised CBT (cCBT) or inter-
net CBT (iCBT). Meta-analyses have found cCBT effective
in treating a range of issues (e.g., Heber et al., 2017; Two-
mey & O’Reilly, 2017) and can serve as an effective trans-
diagnostic
treatment
for
both
anxiety
and
depression
(Cuijpers, Cristea, Weitz, Gentili, & Berking, 2016; Newby,
Twomey, Yuan Li, & Andrews, 2016; Pasarelu, Andersson,
Nordgren, & Dobrean, 2017). While the successes of cCBT
suggest that programs can be effectively translated to deliv-
ery via mobile devices (Proudfoot et al., 2013; Watts et al.,
2013), the interaction style used with a mobile device is fun-
damentally different to that used with a personal computer
(Wendel, 2013). Potential advantages of MHapps over
cCBT programs include ease of access across time and envi-
ronment, collection of more types of data, and more immedi-
ate and satisfying interactions. However, cCBT programs
may be better at delivering large amounts of written content
and may be faster, cheaper, and easier to develop technically
(Bakker et al., 2016). MHapps that teach CBT strategies
may be effective at improving mental health outcomes, but
more studies are required to confirm these effects (Callan,
Wright,
Siegle,
Howland,
&
Kepler,
2017;
Sucala
et al., 2017).
Among the other relevant CBT-based apps reported in
the literature thus far, Kinderman et al. (2016) presented data
on the effectiveness of Catch It, a CBT-based MHapp that
coached users in a short cognitive reframing and reflection
strategy.
Significant
increases
in
positive
mood
and
decreases in negative mood were noted when comparing the
first and second times the app had been used. However, the
long-term use of the app was not studied, so it was unclear
whether these effects were maintained over, for example, a
30-day period. Comparative measurements of depression,
anxiety, and mental wellbeing were also absent. Similarly,
Meinlschmidt et al. (2016) found that a MHapp that coached
27 male participants through CBT-based “micro-interven-
tions” resulted in short-term mood improvements, but the
long-term effects of the app were unclear.
Mohr et al. (2017) reported the efficacy of a suite of
“IntelliCare” apps in significantly reducing depression, as
measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-
9), and anxiety, measured by the 7-item Generalised Anxiety
Disorder scale (GAD-7). Fourteen different apps were devel-
oped and 95% of the participants downloaded five or more
of the IntelliCare apps. Participants also received phone calls
and text messages to coach their use of the apps. While this
study
demonstrates
the
theoretical
efficacy
of
using
MHapps, the influence of coaching calls should be consid-
ered before concluding that consumers who independently
download MHapps can receive benefits. Furthermore, using
a suite of 14 individual MHapps rather than a single multi-
purpose MHapp is inconsistent with principles of intuitive
app design. It may be overly complex for users to navigate
between apps, and the prevention of intercommunication
between the apps is a major shortcoming.
Roepke et al. (2015) found that two different versions of
the MHapp “SuperBetter,” including a version using CBT
strategies and one using more general self-esteem and accep-
tance focused strategies, successfully reduced depression
symptoms when compared to a waitlist group. There was no
significant difference between the SuperBetter versions, but
no measures of app use or app engagement were made, so
conclusions were not informed by how engaging the partici-
pants found the different app versions.
Participants
in
all
the
studies
summarised
above
(Kinderman et al., 2016; Meinlschmidt et al., 2016; Mohr
et al., 2017; Roepke et al., 2015) were experiencing signifi-
cant depression and/or anxiety symptoms, so it is unclear
whether the MHapps would be effective for users experienc-
ing subclinical symptoms. This has important implications
for the recommendation of MHapps to different users. For
example, if a MHapp is effective for users experiencing mild
to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety, but not as
effective for those experiencing severe distress, alternative
supports should be recommended.
Practicing coping skills is a central part of CBT
(Mennin, Ellard, Fresco, & Gross, 2013). Coping self-
efficacy (CSE) is a measure of an individual’s confidence in

ON
THIS
TOPIC
1. There is good evidence supporting the effectiveness of com-
puterised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression
and anxiety.
2. Amongst the mental health apps available to the public, very
few have had experimental validation, and fewer still have
been shown to be effective amongst a community sample.
3. MoodMission is an app that recommends CBT strategies
based on mood.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
1. Engagement with MoodMission predicted increases in men-
tal wellbeing.
2. Coping self-efficacy mediated the effects on depression, anx-
iety, and wellbeing, and participants who were moderately
depressed or anxious experienced these effects.
3. Apps like MoodMission may prevent depressive and anxiety
disorders and serve as an adjunct to clinical treatments.

ability
to
engage
in
coping
strategies
(Thorne,
Andrews, & Nordstokke, 2013) and cope with adversity
(Chesney, Neilands, Chambers, Taylor, & Folkman, 2006).
CSE is positively associated with psychological thriving
(Sirois & Hirsch, 2013) and negatively associated with
depression (Philip, Merluzzi, Zhang, & Heitzmann, 2013
and overall psychological distress (Benka et al., 2014;
Pritchard & Gow, 2012; Smith, Benight, & Cieslak, 2013).
While the outcomes of using some CBT-based MHapps
have been studied (Dahne, Kustanowitz, & Lejuez, 2017;
e.g., Huguet et al., 2016), the role of improving CSE to elicit
mental health benefits remains unclear. Kuhn et al. (2017)
conducted a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing
the “PTSD Coach” app, for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,
to a waitlist condition over 3 months of treatment. Compared
to waitlist participants, PTSD Coach users experienced
greater reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms, and
greater increases in psychosocial functioning. CSE specifi-
cally related to PTSD symptoms was also assessed, but no
effect of the app was found. The authors recommended more
research to be done to clarify the potential mediating role
that CSE plays in the effects of MHapps.
In addition to CSE, Bakker et al. (2016) detail two other
potential mechanisms for MHapps to exert positive effects
on mental health and wellbeing, including emotional self-
awareness (ESA) and mental health literacy (MHL). It is
theorised that CSE, ESA, and MHL may mediate the rela-
tionship between engagement in different MHapps and men-
tal
health
outcomes.
Investigating
these
mediators
is
important to deduce what app features make a MHapp effec-
tive, and how MHapps can be improved by including or
refining these features (Bakker et al., 2016). ESA refers to
the ability for an individual to understand and differentiate
their own emotions, which can result in emotional self-
regulation improvements (Barrett, Gross, Christensen, &
Benvenuto, 2001; Hill & Updegraff, 2012), and positive
mental health outcomes (O’Toole, Jensen, Fentz, Zachar-
iae, & Hougaard, 2014). MHapps have been developed with
mood-tracking functionality, and a handful have been stud-
ied regarding their impact on ESA (Bakker & Rickard,
2017; Kauer et al., 2012; Morris et al., 2010; Rickard, Arj-
mand, Bakker, & Seabrook, 2016). MHL is the “knowledge
and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recogni-
tion, management or prevention” (Jorm et al., 1997), which
can
be
gained
through
psychoeducation
interventions
(Macrodimitris, Hamilton, Backs-Dermott, & Mothersill,
2010). Internet delivered psychoeducation is effective at
reducing
depressive
symptoms
and
distress
(Brijnath,
Protheroe, Mahtani, & Antoniades, 2016; Donker, Griffiths,
Cuijpers, & Christensen, 2009), and can be embedded into
MHapps.
Bakker, Kazantzis, Rickwood, and Rickard (2018a) con-
ducted a RCT comparing a waitlist control group to three
MHapps, “MoodMission,” “MoodPrism,” and “MoodKit,”
over 30 days. It was found that all three app groups experi-
enced increases in mental wellbeing, and MoodMission and
MoodKit users experienced decreases in depression. Medi-
tated regressions revealed that these effects were mediated
via CSE rather than MHL or ESA. While this RCT sug-
gested that the apps have efficacy, real-world effectiveness
remains unknown. The participants used in the RCT signed
up to a study, and thus may not represent the typical MHapp
user that naturalistically finds the app while searching the
app store.
To measure the real-world effects of using MHapps out-
side of clinical trials, some have suggested investigating and
quantifying positive relationships between app usage and
mental health outcomes (Carpenter et al., 2016; Yeager &
Benight, 2018). This can help avoid “digital placebo
effects,” which occur when merely the installation of a
MHapp can bias individuals’ responses towards favourable
mental health outcomes (Torous & Firth, 2016). Bakker and
Rickard (2017) detail how app engagement may be more
useful than raw usage to consider for this relationship, as
usage can be influenced by a high rate of general phone use,
procrastination, boredom, emotion-focused coping, or anxi-
ety. For example, an individual who accesses an app a lot
because they use their phone a lot on their morning commute
as a distraction device may not be receiving the same “dose”
of the intervention as someone who accesses the app a lot
because they are committed to its use and feel like they are
getting something out of the experience. Measuring app
engagement in terms of quality rather than quantity is similar
to measuring client engagement or therapeutic relationship
in psychotherapy, which is predictive of treatment outcomes
(Holdsworth, Bowen, Brown, & Howat, 2014; Kazantzis,
Cronin, Norton, Lai, & Hofmann, 2015). Short self-report
surveys are used to measure therapeutic engagement (Joe,
Broome, Rowan-Szal, & Simpson, 2002), and similarly,
items on a short feedback questionnaire can be used to mea-
sure a user’s engagement with the MHapp, whereby if app
engagement ratings are positively associated with mental
health and wellbeing outcomes, it suggests the MHapp has
efficacy.
The current study aimed to investigate the mental health
and wellbeing impacts of using CBT strategy app Mood-
Mission over a period of 30 days in a community sample,
including the underlying mechanisms that make it effective,
and whether users’ mental health status influenced the
effects. MoodMission (Bakker, Kazantzis, Rickwood, &
Rickard, 2018b) provides users with CBT strategies that
they can use to cope with low moods and anxiety. Practis-
ing such strategies may improve CSE. The strategies also
have small amounts of integrated psychoeducation, which
may increase MHL. While the app does have a rudimentary
log of past use, this is not optimised in a mood diary for-
mat, so it was not designed to increase ESA. Considering
these features of MoodMission, an additional aim of this
BAKKER AND RICKARD

study was to investigate whether CSE and MHL mediated
the MHapp’s mental health and wellbeing effects. The
mediation role of ESA was also explored as an alternative
to CSE and MHL.
It was hypothesised that after using MoodMission for
30 days, participant app engagement, as measured by app
feedback questionnaire, would be associated with an
increase
in
mental
wellbeing,
as
measured
by
the
Warwick-Edinburgh
Mental
Well-being
Scale,
and
a
decrease in depression and anxiety symptomatology, as
measured by the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Furthermore, these
predicted relationships were hypothesised to be mediated
by increases in CSE, as measured by the Coping Self-
Efficacy Scale, and MHL, as measured by a self devised
questionnaire, that users experienced while using the app,
rather than an increase in ESA, as measured by a revised
version of the Emotional Self-Awareness Scale. It was
hypothesised that participants who scored in the clinical
range on the baseline PHQ-9 and GAD-7 would experi-
ence stronger mediated effects than those who scored in
the nonclinical range.

This research was reviewed and approved by the Monash
University Human Research Ethics Committee (MUHREC;
Project Number: CF14/968-2014000398). The sample was
drawn from data 617 users who had downloaded the app
between August 2016 and June 2017, and had complete
baseline and final assessment data. Age ranged from 13 to
70 (Mean = 26.9, SD = 10.9, Median = 24, IQR = 19–32),
with 151 males, 439 females, and 27 participants who did
not specify their gender. The majority of this sample had
completed tertiary education (65%) and were currently
employed (29% full time, 34% part time).

App description
MoodMission (MoodMission Pty Ltd, 2018) is an app that
was developed to provide users with CBT strategies for
managing low moods and anxiety. Bakker et al. (2018b)
detailed the development of MoodMission and how it was
designed for three primary uses: “(a) to provide self-
administered prevention and self-help strategies to reduce
the risk of clinically significant mood and anxiety disorders;
(b) to support stepped-care interventions (Vogl, Ratnaike,
Ivancic, Rowley, & Chandy, 2016; White, 2010) as a plat-
form for access to low-intensity intervention for low-level
clinical symptoms or sub-clinical symptoms of depression
and anxiety; and (c) as an adjunct to psychotherapy or other
face-to-face treatments for mood and anxiety disorders”
(p. 7). The app was designed for a broad range of individuals
to increase accessibility and avoid excluding potential users.
This study used a community sample, so aimed to investi-
gate the app’s first two primary uses but not the third.
When users report their low moods or anxious feelings
to MoodMission, the app provides them with a choice of
five CBT strategies called “Missions.” Missions are short,
easily achievable activities and strategies, taken from
evidence-based psychotherapies, that aim to soothe users’
distress. Missions are tailored to the problem that a user
reports, so for example, if a user reports low mood, Mood-
Mission may suggest physical exercises (Cooney et al.,
2013), behavioural activation activities (Dimidjian, Martell,
Herman-Dunn, & Hubley, 2014), or gratitude thought exper-
iments (Lambert, Fincham, & Stillman, 2012; Sin & Lyubo-
mirsky, 2009). Missions are “intelligently” selected using an
adaptive learning algorithm based on the user’s distress
scores obtained from past Missions. MoodMission’s inter-
vention therefore supports the user preference for short, tai-
lored
modules
in
internet
mental
health
interventions
(Batterham
&
Calear,
2017).
MoodMission
collected
responses from users on several self-report measures at the
start of use and 30 days later. The surveys deployed by the
app are listed in Table 1. These assessments were chosen
based on (a) length and suitability for administration via
mobile device, (b) psychometric quality, and (c) lack of legal
restrictions that would prevent use in a MHapp.

Procedure
As detailed in Bakker et al. (2018b), MoodMission was
developed and made freely available on the iTunes and Goo-
gle Play app stores. To encourage downloads of the app, a
multiformat promotional effort was made, including social
media pages, news articles, blog posts, conference and trade
show presentations, school and university presentations, and
printed flyers. Promotions were targeted across ages and
genders, with an aim to appeal to a wide audience of people
interested in improving their mental health and wellbeing.
With the exception of printed flyers, all promotions were not
paid, so this influenced their choice. Examples of promo-
tions, for example, links to social media pages and news arti-
cles, can be found at moodmission.com.
Participants downloaded the app and completed a series
of “onboarding” introductory steps. This included complet-
ing the baseline assessment, containing the survey measures
used in this study. After the assessment was completed,
MoodMission’s mission suggestion features were unlocked
and the app encouraged users to access the app when they
were feeling low or anxious. A series of push notifications
on the first, third, seventh, and fourteenth days following the
assessment completion were used to remind users to engage
with the app. After 30 days of use, MoodMission prompted
users to complete the final assessment, which included the
same measures from the baseline assessment, with the

addition of the App Engagement Scale. This same procedure
was also used in Bakker and Rickard’s (2017) study on
MoodPrism.

Design and analyses
A power analysis using G*Power 3 software and based on
the smallest effect sizes reported by Kuhn et al. (2017)
revealed that 90 participants would be required to detect
direct and indirect mediated effects at α = 0.05. Some data
were missing for some participants due to partial assessment
completions. Missing data were not replaced, and analyses
were conducted excluding participants with missing data in
a listwise fashion. IBM SPSS software was used for all ana-
lyses, each with bootstrapping using 5,000 samples. Prelimi-
nary
analyses
investigated
the
potential
confounding
influences of Age and Gender on the analyses. For Age, a
series of partial correlations with the three outcome variables
(final scores) were performed, with the baselines scores par-
tialled out. Gender, as a categorical variable, instead was
included as a covariate in a within-subjects ANCOVA. The
results determined whether Age or Gender would be
included in the main analyses as covariates. Three hierarchi-
cal regressions were used to determine total (unmediated)
effects between App Engagement and each outcome mea-
sure, with final depression, anxiety and mental wellbeing
scores as the respective outcome variable. The first step in
the hierarchical regression included entry of potential con-
founds identified from preparatory analyses and baseline
depression,
anxiety
or
mental
wellbeing
scores.
App
Engagement was entered in the second step.
To investigate the role of mediators, three mediated
regression models were used, each using one of the three
outcome variables; Depression (PHQ-9), Anxiety (GAD-7),
and Mental Wellbeing (WEMWBS). Three mediating vari-
ables were used in each model; CSE measured by the
CSES, ESA measured by the ESAS-R, and MHL measured
by the MHLQ. As per recommendations from Darlington
and Hayes (2016) and Zhao, Lynch, and Chen (2010), a
significant total (unmediated) effect was not a prerequisite
for investigation of mediation effects. This allows the
investigation of mediators, even if omitted or opposing
mediators are masking total or direct effects (Darlington &
Hayes, 2016).
All mediated regression analyses were conducted with
the PROCESS plug-in for SPSS (Hayes, 2013) using proce-
dures detailed in Field (2013) and Hayes and Rockwood
(2016). To quantify change over time for each mediator or

outcome variable, each analysis followed Hayes and Rock-
wood’s (2016) recommendations to use baseline scores as
covariates and final (post-30 days of app use) scores as out-
come variables. This avoids “self-selection,” regression to
the mean, and other biases found in other techniques, such
as the use of difference scores. Regardless, when baseline
and final scores are highly correlated (as was the case for
this sample; see Table S1, Supporting Information), this
approach often yields a similar output to using difference
scores (Vickers & Altman, 2001). For ease of interpretation,
reported regressions refer to “Depression,” “Anxiety,” or
“Mental Wellbeing” scores, but all take baseline scores into
account and therefore operationalise change over the 30-day
app use period. All beta (β) statistics reported in the regres-
sions are standardised effect sizes.
Three subsamples based on baseline measures of clinical
symptomatology were identified. The Nonclinical subsample
scored 9 or under on both the baseline PHQ-9 and the GAD-
7. Guidelines for the PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001) and the
GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) both list 10–14 as in the “mod-
erate” range, so the Moderate-clinical subsample scored
between 10 and 14 on either the baseline PHQ-9 or GAD-7,
but not both. The Severe-clinical subsample scored 15 or
over on the PHQ-9 or GAD-7, or scored 10 or over on both
PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to account for those participants
experiencing comorbid depression and anxiety.

RESULTS
The data were inspected and cleaned to ensure that assump-
tions for linear regression were met. Participants with miss-
ing data and outlying cases on any variables ±3SDs from the
mean were excluded, as this could indicate errors in data col-
lection, incomplete responding, or non-serious responding.
This left 617 participants for the subsequent analyses.
Durbin-Watson statistics were found to be above specified
limits for all regressions, suggesting independence of errors
(Durbin & Watson, 1951). All variance inflation factors
(VIFs) were between 1.0 and 1.1, and tolerance statistics
>0.9, suggesting an absence of multi-collinearity (Field,
2013). Each outcome variable’s residuals were inspected to
confirm homoscedasticity and normally distributed errors.

Potential confounds
Age and gender were considered as potentially confounding
variables for each of the regression analyses. Partial correla-
tions
(with
baseline
Depression,
Anxiety
or
Mental
Wellbeing scores partialled out respectively) revealed that
Age yielded significant relationships with Depression (PHQ-
9), r (614) = −0.160, p < 0.001, and Anxiety (GAD-7),
r (614) = −0.123, p = 0.002, but not Mental Wellbeing
(WEMWBS), r (614) = 0.045, p = 0.260. No significant
effects were observed for Gender, as it was a non-significant
covariate for Depression (PHQ-9), F (1, 413) = 0.34,
p = 0.563, ηp
2 = 0.001, Anxiety (GAD-7), F (1, 413)
= 1.64, p = 0.201, ηp
2 = 0.004, and Mental Wellbeing
(WEMWBS), F (1, 413) = 1.92, p = 0.167, ηp
2 = 0.005.
Significance did not change with the exclusion of partici-
pants who selected “Other” for gender. Based on these
results, Age was controlled in the first step of each regres-
sion analysis. To ensure suitability for further investigation
and adequate relatedness between baseline and final mea-
sures, correlations between each of the variables were calcu-
lated and inspected (see Table S1). A univariate ANOVA
revealed no significant differences in App Engagement
between the Nonclinical, Moderate-clinical, and Severe-
clinical
subsamples,
F

Total (unmediated) effects
Hierarchical regressions (controlling for the age confound,
and baseline scores) on the whole sample demonstrated that
App Engagement significantly predicted an increase in Men-
tal Wellbeing scores, ΔF (1, 613) = 16.92, p < 0.001,
ΔR2 = 0.017. However, App Engagement did not signifi-
cantly predict changes in Depression, ΔF (1, 613) = 0.62,
p = 0.430, ΔR2 = 0.001, or Anxiety, ΔF (1, 613) = 0.11,
p = 0.742, ΔR2 < 0.001. When split into Nonclinical,
Moderate-clinical, and Severe-clinical subsamples, the same
was found, with App Engagement significantly predicting
Wellbeing (Nonclinical: ΔF (1, 140) = 4.49, p = 0.036,

Mediation analyses
Mediation analyses were first performed for the whole sam-
ple (N = 617), even in the absence of significant total effects
for Depression and Anxiety (as per Zhao et al., 2010). There
were significant standardised indirect effects of App Engage-
ment through CSE for Depression, β = −0.063, 95% CI
[−0.100, −0.031] (Figure 1a), Anxiety, β = −0.058, 95% CI
[−0.094, −0.027] (Figure 1b), and Mental Wellbeing,

β = 0.085, 95% CI [0.041, 0.133] (Figure 1c). A significant
positive relationship between App Engagement and MHL
was also observed in each regression. All other direct and
indirect effects were not significant.
Following the analyses of the whole sample, mediated
regressions were pursued independently for the Nonclinical
(n = 144), Moderate-clinical (n = 123), and Severe-clinical
(n = 350) subsamples. In the Nonclinical subsample, no direct
or indirect effects were found to be significant in the regressions
for Depression (Figure 2a) or Anxiety (Figure 2b). However, a
significant mediation effect for Mental Wellbeing (Figure 2c)
was found for CSE, with a standardised indirect effect of

β = 0.103, 95% CI [0.002, 0.221]. No other direct or indirect
effects were significant for Mental Wellbeing.
In the Moderate-clinical subsample, there were significant
mediation effects for CSE in all three regressions, with standar-
dised indirect effects of β = −0.173, 95% CI [−0.291, −0.080]
for Depression (Figure 3a), β = −0.195, 95% CI [−0.326,
−0.094] for Anxiety (Figure 3b), and β = 0.221, 95% CI
[0.114, 0.345] for Mental Wellbeing (Figure 3c). No other direct
or indirect effects were found significant.
In the Severe-clinical subsample, there were no significant
direct or indirect effects in any of the three regressions (see
Figure 4). However, there were significant positive relationships

observed between App Engagement and MHL in all three
regressions. There were also significant negative relationships
between CSE and Depression, and CSE and Anxiety, and a sig-
nificant positive relationship between CSE and Mental Well-
being. A summary of the presence of direct and indirect effects
from all regressions is presented in Table 3.

DISCUSSION
This study aimed to assess whether engaging with Mood-
Mission, a MHapp that intelligently suggested CBT strate-
gies, predicted improvements in mental health (depression
and anxiety) and wellbeing. The primary finding was that

app engagement predicted improvements in mental well-
being, and this relationship was mediated by CSE for all but
the severely clinical subsample. These findings are similar to
those of Bakker et al.’s (2018a) RCT, but have broader
implications of real-world effectiveness due to naturalistic
recruitment and comparisons across clinical status.
This study also found that while app engagement did
not directly predict reductions in depression and anxiety,
a mediated pathway was identified via CSE for the whole
community sample and the moderately clinical subsam-
ple. A similar meditation effect was observed in Bakker
et al.’s (2018a) RCT for all three MHapps, including

MoodMission. ESA and MHL did not act as mediators
for any of the app engagement relationships. This sug-
gests that, for users experiencing moderate levels of
depression and anxiety, engaging with MoodMission
improved CSE, which subsequently decreased depression
and anxiety.
Participants were included from a wide range of ages,
but the median age was 24 and 75% were aged 32 or youn-
ger. This is the same age range where the highest rates of
global smartphone ownership and use are observed (Nielsen,
2016), so this is a naturalistic reflection of MHapp use in a
community sample. The findings should be cautiously gen-
eralised to older populations who may engage differently
with the intervention, but Firth et al.’s (2017a, 2017b) meta-
analyses of a range of MHapp studies using samples of dif-
ferent ages suggest that age did not impact treatment effects.
These findings support the use of MoodMission to
improve mental wellbeing, regardless of the users’ clinical
status. When accounting for clinical status, mediated effects
on depression and anxiety levels were only observed for
moderately clinical users. A possible explanation for this is
that nonclinical users already had low levels of depression
and anxiety, so increasing CSE did not detectably lower
them further. On the other end of the spectrum, severely
clinical users may have required a more intensive interven-
tion to improve their CSE and reduce their depression and
anxiety. This lack of effect on depression and anxiety for
users experiencing severe levels of these disorders suggests
that MoodMission should not be recommended as a standa-
lone treatment, and demonstrably effective therapies such as
CBT with a psychologist should still be sought first. There
may also be other advantages of using MoodMission for this
subsample that were not detected in this study. For example,
MoodMission may change the attitude towards help-seeking
for severely clinical users, as they receive notifications about
seeking professional support, or it may have relapse preven-
tion effects. In addition, the app may have preventative
effects for users who are not currently experiencing depres-
sion or anxiety, but the 30-day window of assessment used
in this study was too short to detect these. This represents a
limitation of this study that future studies could address by
collecting a broader range of data for a longer period of time.
Such intensive data collection may bias findings away from
naturalistic user download scenarios, but could reveal how
apps like MoodMission can be best used with nonclinical
and severe clinical users.
Although indirect effects via CSE were found for
Depression and Anxiety in the moderately-clinical subsam-
ple, direct effects were not found. A number of limiting fac-
tors could account for this, including the effect of an
unmeasured, conflicting mediator nullifying the direct effect
(Darlington & Hayes, 2016). For example, anxiety or
depression may share a positive relationship with an unmea-
sured variable like perceived social support, which could be
working in opposition to CSE. Both mediators working in
opposition may cancel out the overall direct effect (Zhao
et al., 2010). Such a mediator going unmeasured represents a
limitation of the current study. Bakker and Rickard (2017)
conducted a similar study, including the same mediators and
methodologies, using the self-monitoring MHapp MoodPr-
ism. MoodPrism enabled users to track their moods over
time by completing daily surveys and creating an interactive,
colourful mood diary. Findings suggested that engaging with
MoodPrism significantly decreased depression and anxiety,
and
increased
mental
wellbeing.
Additionally,
it
was
hypothesised that engaging with MoodPrism’s reflection-

focused features would promote gains in ESA, and so ESA
would serve as a mediator between app engagement and
mental health and wellbeing outcomes. However, it was
found that this was only the case for individuals who scored
15 or over on the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 measures, the same as
the current study’s Severe-clinical subsample. ESA was not
a significant mediator for individuals who scored under this
on the depression and anxiety measures.
While users experiencing depressive or anxious symp-
toms may have more motivation to engage with MHapps
and other mental health interventions, it was observed that
app engagement did not differ based on baseline depression
or anxiety severity. There may be several explanations for
this. First, MoodMission was not promoted as a treatment
for people diagnosed with mental health issues, so users may
have been motivated to engage with the app for a wider vari-
ety of reasons, including to improve positive mental well-
being. Second, as depressive and anxious symptomatology
increases, overall motivation to engage with anything can
decrease, for example, via fatigue and being overwhelmed
(Krämer, Helmes, & Bengel, 2014), so this force may have
counteracted motivations to engage based on self-perceived
symptom severity. The absence of a way to measure and
account for these motivations represents another limitation
of this study, which future studies could address.
Bakker et al. (2016) suggests three different types of
MHapps; goal-focused MHapps are designed to improve
CSE by recommending activities and active coping skills,
reflection-focused MHapps are designed to improve ESA by
using
self-monitoring
features,
and
education-focused
MHapps are designed to improve MHL by supplying users
with mental health information. MoodMission’s main func-
tion is the recommendation of CBT strategies, so it best fits
into the goal-focused category. While MoodPrism was a
reflection-focused MHapp, MoodMission contains features
that lends to a goal-focused MHapp design, so the role of
CSE as a mediator was expected. However, while the media-
tion effects of ESA were observed for MoodPrism partici-
pants in the Severe-clinical range, MoodMission participants
in this range did not experience any measured effects of
engaging with the app. This suggests that reflection-focused
features, such as those used in MoodPrism, may be better
suited to users who are severely depressed or anxious,
whereas goal-focused features, such as those used in Mood-
Mission, may be more useful for users who are experiencing
moderate levels of depression or anxiety. More research is
needed to directly compare these features across different
groups and different circumstances, as the current study was
limited by the current features of MoodMission and an
inability to compare the effectiveness of different features
within the app.
MoodMission is designed to be accessed when the user
is experiencing low moods or anxious feelings. This may
explain why there was no effect of app engagement on
depression or anxiety for participants who were not already
experiencing significant depression or anxiety symptoms.
These users may not have been able to use the Missions to
meaningfully decrease their emotional distress, as they were
experiencing fewer episodes of less severe distress. There
may have also been limiting floor effects of the PHQ-9 and
GAD-7 measures to detect further reductions in depression
and anxiety. The finding that these users experienced signifi-
cant, measurable effects of app engagement on mental well-
being support this theory, as there would be less of a ceiling
effect on this measure.
There is a perception among some health and mental
health practitioners that smartphone use has detrimental
mental health outcomes. However, research has linked only
non-social use of smartphones to depression and anxiety
(Elhai, Levine, Dvorak, & Hall, 2017), highlighting that it is
not the devices themselves that cause issues, but the way
they are used. Further support for this comes from the results
from this study, which suggest that using the features of a
MHapp can result in reductions in depression and anxiety,
and improvements in mental wellbeing.
This study suggests that engagement with MoodMission,
a goal-focused MHapp that intelligently suggests CBT strat-
egies to users, is related to improvements in coping self-effi-
cacy, which in turn is related to improvements in mental
health and wellbeing. This is particularly relevant for moder-
ately depressed or anxious users. These findings contrast
with those from reflection-focused apps like MoodPrism
(Bakker & Rickard, 2017), which work through the mediator
of emotional self-awareness. Analysing mediators and con-
sidering the mechanisms of different mental health interven-
tions is important to inform directions of development.
Creating self-guided interventions that work via multiple
mediators because they engage users in several complemen-
tary processes may lead to improved effects on outcomes.
The addition of reflection-focused features to MoodMission
would be an example of this, and one worth pursuing and
studying. Considering the clinical potential of MHapps (van
Os et al., 2017) and the paucity of research in the area
(Donker et al., 2013; Grist et al., 2017), the findings of this
study are important for the development, promotion, and
refinement of effective MHapps and other self-guided men-
tal health supports.
