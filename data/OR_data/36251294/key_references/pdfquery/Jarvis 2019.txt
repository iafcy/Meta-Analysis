Abstract: There is a high prevalence of loneliness among older people, especially in residential care 
settings. Loneliness is often accompanied by maladaptive cognitions which can aﬀect the maintenance 
and establishment of meaningful social connections. This study implemented and evaluated a 
low-intensity Cognitive Behavior Therapy (LI-CBT) mHealth-supported intervention which targeted 
maladaptive cognitions in older people (≥60 years) experiencing loneliness. The three-month 
intervention using WhatsApp was implemented with older people in four inner-city residential care 
facilities. The intervention included three components: technology acceptance, psycho-education, 
and individualized positively worded messages addressing maladaptive cognitions. The intervention 
was evaluated using a randomized control design. Key outcomes were measured pre-, post-, and one 
month after the intervention. There were signiﬁcant changes in social cognition (YSQ-SF T0–T1–T2, X2 
= 9.69, p = 0.008) and loneliness levels (total loneliness T0–T1–T2, X2 = 14.62, p = 0.001), and an increase 
= 60%, X2=15.22, p = 0.019). At 1-month follow-up, even with 
in WhatsApp usage (T0 
a signiﬁcant reduction in WhatsApp usage, a signiﬁcant reduction in loneliness was maintained. 
LI-CBT delivered via instant messaging may be eﬀective in reducing loneliness experienced by 
older people. 



Relocation to residential care may bring about changes in social network structures and social 
network density for older people [1–3]. This can result in social isolation, loneliness and reduced 
mental well-being [4,5], with loneliness prevalence reported as high as 56% among older people living 
in residential care in Norway [6]. Loneliness, seen as the cognitive discrepancy between desired and 
actual quality and quantity of relationships [7], may result in negative or maladaptive cognitions 
commonly expressed by people experiencing loneliness [8,9] that can interfere with the development 
or maintenance of social connections [8,10]. Loneliness has pathophysiological eﬀects on older people 
which increase mortality [11]. 
There are a plethora of primary studies, and systematic reviews addressing loneliness in older 
people [5,12,13]. Various social and psychological interventions have been recommended to address 
loneliness in older people, including interventions using technology [5,9,14,15], with varying degrees 
of eﬀectiveness [16] and diﬀering levels of quality in evaluation design [8,9]. Interventions addressing

maladaptive or negative social cognitions have been reported to be most eﬀective in reducing loneliness 
by changing social behavior and thereby improving social connections [8,9]. Improvement in social 
connections can contribute to healthy ageing and improved cognitive functioning [17,18]. Previously 
held beliefs that face-to-face interaction is the gold standard of social participation [19] has been 
challenged, with evidence that feelings of connection can also be established via communication 
technology [3]. Social media and instant messaging have been cited as instances of communication 
technology that may improve social networks by maintaining visibility, re-awakening previous social 
networks, or development of new networks [20–23]. Instant messaging using mobile cellular phones 
can be used to address maladaptive cognitions, but older people are reported to be less inclined 
to use technological communication to initiate social connections [24]. MHealth projects for older 
people are often viewed with skepticism in regard to cost, perceived poor technology acceptance and 
ageism [25,26], but when appropriate consideration is given to facilitating conditions [25,27,28] and 
cost [29,30] older people are capable of learning new technology [25]. Despite studies examining older 
people’ existing engagement with social media and its eﬀects on loneliness [21,31] a gap exists for 
intervention studies that speciﬁcally target loneliness using social media. Chipps et al. [14] in their 
umbrella review of systematic reviews examining eInterventions targeting loneliness in older people 
failed to identify any mHealth interventions in the included primary studies. Chen and Schulz [12] 
in their systematic review of communication technology interventions, suggested further studies in 
the ﬁelds of loneliness and social media to identify the opportunities to reduce loneliness in older 
people. This study accordingly sought to implement and evaluate a low-intensity cognitive behavioral 
therapy (LI-CBT) mHealth-supported intervention delivered via mobile instant messaging (WhatsApp) 
to address maladaptive cognitions and reduce loneliness in older people living in a residential setting. 

A LI-CBT intervention, Living In Network Connected Communities (mLINCC) to be delivered on 
WhatsApp, was developed by a stakeholder group consisting of a CBT specialist psychologist, a mental 
health nurse, and an mHealth expert. The intervention was informed by a theoretical framework of 
loneliness [32,33] and evidence from two umbrella reviews on the eﬀectiveness of interventions to 
address loneliness [14,34]. A gap in mHealth interventions was identiﬁed [14,23] along with strong 
evidence that social cognition interventions [8,9] and psycho-education [35] were most eﬀective in 
addressing loneliness and the need for participants to be actively involved in the intervention [35]. 
The three-month intervention had three distinct phases involving threads of trust, social network 
development, and gerontechnology self-eﬃcacy, reinforced with homework assignments requiring 
a WhatsApp response [36] and a weekly face-to-face Help Desk for technological support [37]. 
All participants in the intervention group (IG) were added to the mLINCC WhatsApp group, which 
was a closed group and at cross-over a separate WhatsApp group (mLINCC 2) for the control group 
(CG). Apart from the closed groups, participants were able to use the smartphone and communication 
on mLINCC as they chose and there was no incentive for increased use. The data package selected 
to oﬀer the greatest ﬁnancial sustainability post-intervention, allowed for any form of WhatsApp 
interaction apart from WhatsApp calls. No participants had previously used WhatsApp; in the IG 
apart from one participant all owned feature (basic) mobile phones which did not support such 
applications as WhatsApp, predominantly making calls and the participant who owned a smartphone 
used it as a feature (basic) mobile phone. In the ﬁrst phase (2 weeks), technology acceptance was 
developed through activities which included the selection of a smartphone and four 90-min face-to-face 
(F2F) group-training sessions on the use of the smartphone and WhatsApp. The participants could 
keep the phones post-intervention but would be responsible for the purchase of data (600 Mb for 
ZAR15.00/month/US $1.10). In the second phase (2 weeks), psycho-education was delivered through 
four 90-min F2F sessions on factors underlying loneliness. Key messages from these sessions were 
conﬁrmed through messages on WhatsApp. In phase three (1 month) individualized messages with 
positively framed content aimed at countering maladaptive cognitions were sent to participants via 


WhatsApp. Individual maladaptive cognitions were identiﬁed through the administration of the Young 
Schema Questionnaire short-form (YSQ-SF)—Disconnection and Rejection domain. The messages 
were constructed by the CBT specialist and each message had two components: acknowledgment of 
the maladaptive cognition linked to loneliness, and a positively framed counter message to allow the 
participants an opportunity to reﬂect on the cognitive distortion and its inﬂuence on their feelings 
and behaviors (Table 1). The ﬁnal phase was a maintenance stage (1 month) during which just the 
weekly Help Desk was continued, with the moderator still presiding over the WhatsApp group though 
not participating. 


Acknowledgment of Schema

I am quite suspicious of other 
people’s motives 
It is only a matter of time before 
someone betrays me

It is understandable that you may 
feel suspicious of other people and 
worry that they may hurt you, 
take advantage of you, or have 
ulterior motives, especially if these 
types of experiences have 
happened in the past.

Counter message; Not all people 
have negative intentions. There 
are genuine and trustworthy 
people in the world. 
Unfortunately, negative 
expectations can act as a barrier to 
your being able to reach out to 
others. You can change this. Try to 
evaluate the accuracy of your 
beliefs. Look back on your life and 
identify someone who really cared 
about you. Think about what 
made this person diﬀerent. 
Setting: The study was conducted in an Non-Government Organization (NGO) which oﬀers 
accommodation for resource-restricted residents, ranging from independent living to frail care and 
services throughout the city to 1900 older people (≥60 years). 
Study design: A randomized control study with two groups—IG and CG—was conducted to 
evaluate the intervention. Due to the nature of the intervention there was no blinding. Participants 
were randomly assigned to the IG or the CG. The CG received usual care, which was a generic wellness 
program for all residents. For ethical reasons, on completion of the intervention the CG also received 
the intervention, receiving their smartphones and all resources at this cross-over point. The study was 
approved by the Humanities and Social Sciences Ethics Committee (HSSREC) of the University of 
KwaZulu-Natal. (HSS/1169/016D) on 16 September 2016, followed by gatekeeper permission from 
the research site. Approval was received to feature the WhatsApp brand in the printed material 
(Asset Request # 34292). 
Population and sampling: The population was 828 residents living in four inner-city residential 
NGO care facilities (n = 828) in a large South African city. Eligible participants were identiﬁed through 
a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 277 residents and met the criteria for inclusion: namely, 
≥60 years, residing in the residence, willing to participate, cognitively intact on the Subjective Memory 
Complaint Clinical (SMCC) [38] and socially isolated (≤15 on the Friendship Scale) [39], or lonely 
(2–6 on de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS) [40] [6-item]) or with decreased mental well-being 
(World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index, (WHO-5) [41] score < 13) (Figure 1) A minimum 
sample size of 52 participants was estimated to provide a medium to large eﬀect size.

Research instrument: A standard researcher-administered questionnaire was used to capture 
the key outcome measurements of WhatsApp usage, social cognitions, loneliness, and mental 
well-being. The questionnaire captured data on demographics and WhatsApp usage, social cognition 
(Disconnection and Rejection domain of the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-SF 3)) [42], loneliness 
(6-item) (DJGLS) [40], and mental well-being (WHO-5) [41] (Table 2).

Disconnection and Rejection domain and related schemas of the YSQ-SF 
(Abandonment, Defectiveness, Emotional Deprivation, Mistrust and Social 
Isolation) [43]. Using a 6-point Likert scale rating the most accurate description 
over the past year from “Completely untrue of me” (1) to “Describes me 
perfectly” (6) [43–45]. YSQ-SF has established reliability and validity in Eastern 
(Cronbach α 0.72 –0.90) and Western settings (Cronbach α 0.81–0.94) [44] and 
with the elderly [45]. 
The DJGLS is a 6-item scale (0–6) with two sub-scales of emotional (0–3) and 
social loneliness (0–3) [40]. A score of six represents extreme loneliness and three 
of extreme emotional or social loneliness, measured on its sub-scales [40]. It is 
recommended for use in the elderly [46], reliable and well validated [40]. 
The WHO-5 is a 5-item scale using a 6-point Likert rating and is a ﬁrst screener 
for depression (raw score <13) [41,47]. The scale items are positive statements 
based on mood, vitality and general interest over a two-week period [41].

Data collection: The questionnaire was administered three times: pre-intervention (T0), 
post-intervention (T1) and one month post-intervention (T2). The participants provided written 
informed consent and the LI-CBT mHealth-supported intervention was conducted from March to 
June 2018. In preparation, research assistants (1:4 participants) were trained and resource materials 
prepared (manuals, stylus pens, and phone pouches) [48–50]. 
Data analysis: Data from the questionnaires were entered into SPSS v.25. Ages were categorized into 
younger old (60–79 years) and older old (80+ years) and time in residence (1–18 months and ≥19 months). 
Summary scores for all outcome measures were calculated. Items in DJGLS were reverse scored for 
emotional loneliness subscale. Non-parametric Friedman test (X[2]) was used to detect within-group 
diﬀerences in the intervention across three time periods tests, followed by Wilcoxon signed rank test (W) 
to compare the time points for signiﬁcance (p ≤ 0.05). Diﬀerences between groups were compared using 
Mann-Whitney-U (U) and due to the small sample and diﬀerent sample sizes, Hedges’ g calculated 
eﬀect sizes ([M1–M2]⁄SDpooled and weighted) (https://www.socscistatistics.com/eﬀectsize/default3.aspx). 
Missing data was handled by excluding cases pairwise. Cronbach’s alpha was used to test the internal 
consistency of the subscale and scale scores (≥0.70 good). 


Eighty-nine respondents (n = 89) were eligible to participate in the intervention, and 32 (35.95%) 
agreed to participate (Figure 1). Of the eligible participants 32 (35.95%) were not interested, 13 (14.61%) 
ill, 10 (11.24%) were not available and two participants declined for personal problems (Figure 1), 
Eligible participants who declined participation showed similar levels of mental well-being (WHO-5 
m = 16.5/25 ± 4.9) and total loneliness (m = 3.14/6 ± 1.59) to the participants. Fifteen participants 
were allocated to the IG and 17 to the CG, resulting in 13 (IG) and 16 (CG) participants after attrition 
(Figure 1). The participants were between 61 and 87 years (m = 74.93 ± 6.41 years), mainly female, 
Asian/Indian, widowed, and primary school and lesser-educated. Nearly two thirds of the participants 
had lived in the residences for 19 months or longer (n = 20, 62.5%) (Table 2). Cronbach-alpha was 
measured at T0 and shown to be good for YSQ-SF and all ﬁve schemas and the WHO-5, but low 
internal constancy for social loneliness (α = 0.55). 
At T0 there were no signiﬁcant demographic or outcome diﬀerences between the IG and CG 
(Table 3). At the start of the intervention, only slightly more than half of participants (54.84%) used their 
mobile phones weekly to contact family or friends (Table 4), with the majority (n = 26, 83.87%) using 
the call function. The total group (n = 32) were mostly mentally well, but showed moderate levels 
of maladaptive social cognitions on the selected domain (YSQ-SF m = 78.38/150 ± 25.06), with Social 
Isolation rated the highest, and moderate levels of loneliness (total loneliness m = 3.56/6 ± 1.24; emotional 
loneliness m = 1.63/3 ± 0.83; social loneliness m = 1.94/3 ± 0.72) (Table 4).

CG: Control group; dep: Deprivation; DJGLS: de Jong Gierveld loneliness scale; IG: Intervention group; WHO-5: 
WHO-ﬁve Well-being Index; YSQ-SF: Young Schema Questionnaire (Short form); Note: Diﬀerences between 
intervention and control groups for usage of mobile phone were tested using Chi-square tests (X2) and cognition, 
loneliness, and mental well-being were tested using non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U; Signiﬁcance was set as 
p < 0.05. 
The eﬀectiveness of the intervention was evaluated at three time points (T0–T1–T2). In the IG at 
T0–T1–T2, a signiﬁcant increase in the frequency of mobile phone usage (X2 = 8.90, p = 0.012) and 
WhatsApp (X2 = 12.17, p = 0.002) was recorded, as opposed to the CG where no signiﬁcant changes in 
the frequency of usage of the mobile phone were recorded. In the IG from T1 to T2, the signiﬁcant 
= 60%, X2 = 15.22, p = 0.019) was 
increase in the frequency of daily smartphone usage (T0 



= 53.3%, 
not maintained with a signiﬁcant reduction by the end of the intervention (T1 
X2 = 13.48, p = 0.036). Monitoring of participants’ smartphone activity was only possible through 
the WhatsApp group (mLINCC) and not through their encrypted messages. On mLINCC there was 
evidence of participants’ active use of all functions oﬀered by the select WhatsApp data package 
(excluded WhatsApp calls), except for the function of creating a voice message. While recording a voice 
message and the simultaneous requirement of holding the voice message icon appeared to present 
co-ordination challenges. 

Over the intervention (T0–T1–T2), the IG showed signiﬁcant decreases in the total YSQ-SF 
(X2 = 9.69, p = 0.008) and the schemas (Social Isolation X2 = 16.45, p ≤ 0.001, Emotional Deprivation 
X2 = 11.04, p = 0.003, Defectiveness X2 = 9.50, p = 0.009) except in the schemas Abandonment and 
Mistrust (Table 5). This was accompanied by a signiﬁcant reduction (T0–T1–T2) in total loneliness 
(X2 = 14.62, p = 0.001) and emotional loneliness (X2 = 15.80, p = < 0.001). In comparison. (T0–T1–T2), 
the CG participants became more lonely (total loneliness, W = 5.51, p = 0.064) and signiﬁcantly more 
emotionally lonely (X2 = 12.29, p = 0.002) (Table 5). For the IG, T0 to T1 showed the most signiﬁcant 
reductions for all measurements (YSQ-SF (YSQ-SF W = −2.34, p = 0.019, Social Isolation W = −3.06, 
p = 0.002, Defectiveness W = −2.72, p = 0.007, Emotional Deprivation W = −2.45, p = 0.014, Abandonment 
W = −2.08, p = 0.037, total loneliness W = −2.16, p = 0.031, emotional loneliness W = −2.27, p = 0.023)) 
(Table 5). During the post-intervention period (T1–T2), the CG had signiﬁcantly higher loneliness 
(total) (p = 0.011) and emotional loneliness (p = 0.003) (Table 5). 
Comparing the overall eﬀect between the IG and CG pre- and post-intervention (T0–T1) the 
IG had signiﬁcantly improved WhatsApp usage (IG 73.3% vs. CG 11.8%, X2 = 16.22, p ≤ 0.001), 
with accompanying signiﬁcantly greater improvements in their social cognitions for Social Isolation 
(IG 7.08 ± 5.62 vs. CG 1.29 ± 6.08, U = −2.39, p = 0.015), Emotional Deprivation (IG 6.69 ± 7.58 vs. CG 
1.12 ± 7.75, U = −2.24, p = 0.025), Abandonment (IG 6.69 ± 7.58 vs. CG 1.12 ± 7.75, U = −2.24, p = 0.025). 
The improvements in loneliness and mental well-being were not signiﬁcant between the groups at T1 
(Table 6). However, in the post-intervention period (T1–T2), the signiﬁcant increase in WhatsApp users 
(IG 66.7% vs. CG 5.9%, X2 = 17.08, p ≤ 0.001), was accompanied by signiﬁcant improvements in the 
IG compared to the CG in all levels of loneliness (Total loneliness IG 0.92 ± 1.26 vs. CG-1.53 ± 2.00, 
U = −3.28, p = 0.001; emotional loneliness IG 0.31 ± 0.75 vs. CG 1.12 ± 1.11, U = −3.36, p = 0.001; social 
loneliness (IG 0.62 ± 1.04 vs CG −0.41 ± 1.18, U = 2.36, p = 0.028) (Table 5). The largest eﬀect size was 
for total loneliness and emotional loneliness (total loneliness ES = 1.50, emotional loneliness ES = 2.26) 
(p ≤ 0.001) (Table 6), with small eﬀect sizes for social loneliness (ES = 0.47) and mental well-being at T2 
(ES = 0.41) (Table 6).

Although the study sample size was small, the LI-CBT WhatsApp intervention was eﬀective 
in signiﬁcantly adjusting maladaptive social cognitions and reducing loneliness in older people in 
this setting and can be used in other resource-restricted settings and non-resource-restricted settings. 
Customization of the intervention is suggested in tailoring the positively worded MIM to be culturally 
and contextually speciﬁc. In future at the invitation to the intervention a period of experimentation 
with a smartphone in a low risk setting has the possibility of increasing enrolment. The study though 
delivered using WhatsApp concurred with the study byChiang et al. [15] involving reminiscence in 
older men (n = 92) which showed the eﬀectiveness of targeting maladaptive social cognitions in the 
reduction of loneliness. 
Improved cognition and a reduction in loneliness was signiﬁcantly evident post-intervention 
(except social loneliness) and was maintained one month after the active intervention. The continued 
eﬀect, despite some decrease in WhatsApp usage possibly due to the lessening of the novelty 
eﬀect [51], may be related to the changes in the format and frequency of communication with the social 
networks from participants’ initial preference for mobile phone calls to their use instead of WhatsApp, 
which allowed them to maintain or develop contact with both kin and non-kin networks. 
The social cognition schema which demonstrated the largest eﬀect size (ES = 1.28) was Social 
Isolation, with changes in the feelings of alienation, not belonging, being an outsider, and socially 
diﬀerent. Social Isolation has predictive validity for depression [52], and links to emotional loneliness [53]. 
Similarly, deprivation is a core component of loneliness [7] and the large eﬀect on Emotional Deprivation 
(ES = 1.24), which involved improved feelings of nurturance, empathy and protection may further 
reduce emotional loneliness [53]. Improvement in the schemas of Emotional Deprivation, Social Isolation, 
and emotional loneliness were paralleled with an increase in smartphone contact with social networks. 
The ﬁndings suggest that through the network link in the intervention, the participants found nurturance 
and a sense of belonging and inclusion, and were able to experience relationship salience [19]. 
The eﬀect for social loneliness (ES = 0.47) was small and appeared more resistant to change. 
The IG participants showed slower changes in their perceptions of adequacy in the number of people 
in the social networks and it was only after the maintenance period that social loneliness showed a near 
signiﬁcant change. This may relate to the progressive nature of loneliness, with dissipation of emotional 
loneliness preceding dissipation of social loneliness [54]. It was anticipated that social loneliness 
improvement would have occurred earlier due to the early face-to-face interaction among participants 
and the group-based interventions, reported to be of value in the reduction of loneliness [9,32]. 
The resistance to change in social loneliness may also relate to the resistance to change in the schema of 
Mistrust, needing a change to occur in the cognitive appraisal of relationships before there is a change in 
the social deﬁcit [54]. The cognitive appraisal of Mistrust can be a problem for social engagement: trust, 
which is often likened to the “glue” that binds society [55], is closely intertwined with social loneliness. 
Edwards [56], following Putnam’s various propositions in relation to social capital, states that trust is 
foundational to civic culture and is the outcome of a person’s correct prediction of others’ co-operative 
behavior, facilitated by external conditions. In addition, Pope et al. [57] note that the higher the level of 
trust, the greater the possibility of social participation. Because Mistrust is linked to social loneliness it 
may also be interwoven with the schema of Defectiveness leading to feelings of shame, inadequacy, 
and hypersensitivity to criticism that hamper trust and relationship development. A further possible 
factor relates to socio-emotional selectivity theory, according to which older people select to maintain 
contact with their closest, familiar relationships [57] rather than building new relationships [58,59]. 
Lastly, delayed changes in social loneliness, may be related to South Africa being a country with low 
levels of trust [54] and with older people showing lower trust levels than younger people [55]. Mistrust 
is often higher in settings such as South Africa that have high levels of crime, social inequalities, low 
income and political corruption [55]. 



The unique LI-CBT mHealth supported by the social networking platform of WhatsApp 
(mLINCC) incorporated face-to-face development of technological readiness in smartphone usage, 
psycho-education, and the delivery of positively worded mobile instant messages. Overall the 
intervention showed signiﬁcant improvements in maladaptive cognitions, and loneliness, highlighting 
the role of cognitive appraisals in the subjective experience of loneliness. In addition, the unique use of 
WhatsApp and the crafting of a LI-CBT mHealth-supported intervention that addressed technological 
readiness in smartphone usage mitigated against loneliness experienced by cognitively intact older 
people living in residential care settings. The study demonstrated the possibility of the delivery of 
LI-CBT by a non-psychologist in a low resourced setting in Africa and demonstrated the ability of 
older people to learn smartphone technology thereby facilitating e-inclusion. 

It is recommended that residential care facilities implement measures to facilitate residents’ 
positive cognitive appraisals of relationships and contexts such as regular psycho-education sessions. 
It is further recommended that the study is repeated with a larger sample, over for a longer period, 
possibly six months, and involves community dwelling older people. In particular, this should be 
conducted in Africa, where there is a paucity of comparable loneliness studies. In addition, further 
studies on the development of trust among older people could result in a measure to increase enrolment 
in intervention programs targeting loneliness. 

Overall, the study found that a low-intensity CBT intervention, tailored to individuals, can be 
delivered to older people using smart phones and instant messaging with potential to reduce loneliness, 
although some limitations in the study should be noted. Firstly, the sample size was low, with eligible 
participants showing low intent to participate (64.04%), which may be a side-eﬀect of being lonely and 
may require diﬀerent study recruitment in future studies. This is conﬁrmed by high attrition rates in 
loneliness studies [51,60–62] due to higher levels of physical ill-health in older people experiencing 
loneliness [63], coupled with reticence to use smartphone technology possibly due to anxiety levels or 
a reduced sense of self-eﬃcacy [27]. The low number of participants in the study and the high number 
of demographics variables and outcome measures could have had an impact on signiﬁcance. Secondly, 
a limitation in the use of the DJGLS in this setting should be noted, with possible misinterpretation 
by the participants of the terms “plenty”,” many” and “enough” in the DJGLS [64] that may have 
inﬂuenced ratings of social isolation, and also the notably low reliability in the social loneliness subscale 
for this study in comparison with other studies [40]. Thirdly, the nature of the study design did not 
enable diﬀerentiation between the various components or the vehicle of delivery of the intervention, 
and it is recommended that factorial and smart designs be used for future evaluations.
