Question: What is the effectiveness of gym-based exercise versus home-based exercise with telephone 
follow-up amongst adults with chronic conditions who have completed a short-term exercise program 
supervised by a health professional? Design: A randomised, controlled trial with concealed allocation, 
intention-to-treat analysis, and blinded outcome assessment at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. 
Participants: The participants were recruited following a 6-week exercise program at a community 
health service. Intervention: One group of participants received a gym-based exercise program for 
12 months (gym group). The other group received a home-based exercise program for 12 months with 
ﬁrst 10 weeks (home group). Outcome measures: Outcome measures 
telephone follow-up for the 
included European Quality of Life Instrument (EQ-5D), the Friendship Scale, the Hospital and Anxiety and 
Depression Scale, Phone-FITT, 6-minute walk test, body mass index and 15-second sit-to-stand test. 
Results: There was no signiﬁcant difference between study groups in the primary outcome (EQ-5D visual 
analogue scale, 0 to 100) across the 12-month intervention period, with an estimate (adjusted regression 
(cid:1)5 to 4). The gym group demonstrated slightly fewer 
coefﬁcient) of the difference in effects of 0 (95% CI 
symptoms of depression over the 12-month period compared to the home group (mean difference 
0.8 points on a 21-point scale, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.6). Conclusion: Similar long-term clinical outcomes and 
long-term exercise adherence are achieved with the two approaches examined 
in this study. 
Participation in gym-based group exercise may improve mental health outcomes slightly more, 
although the mechanisms for this are unclear because there was no change in the selected measure of 
ﬁnding may also be a Type 1 error. Further 
social isolation or other measures of health and wellbeing. This 
research to reproduce these results and that investigates the economic efﬁciency of these models of care 
is indicated. Trial registration: ACTRN12610001035011. [Jansons P, Robins L, O’Brien L, Haines T (2017)

Australian Bureau of Statistics data from 2004 to 2005 demon- 
strate that approximately 70% of Australians aged > 15 years were 
classiﬁed as sedentary or having low levels of physical activity. 
Physical inactivity causes a signiﬁcant public health burden, with 
direct healthcare costs estimated at over AUD377 million per year 
in Australia.1 Chronic conditions such as coronary heart disease, 
stroke, depression, and type-II diabetes contribute the greatest 
burden to the Australian healthcare system.2 
One of the easiest and most effective ways of reducing 
healthcare costs in Australia might be older adults having greater 
adherence to physical activity. There are a number of interventions 
to enhance physical activity in populations with chronic diseases 
such as cardiac disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 
diabetes. One such approach is to use short-term (4 to 6 weeks) 
supervised exercise programs. Supervised exercise programs in 
these populations have been shown to improve clinical health 
outcomes, such as quality of life, anxiety, depression and exercise 
tolerance.3–5 However, there is evidence that exercise adherence 
declines after the programs are completed, with many people 
ceasing altogether. A randomised, controlled trial with 109 parti- 
cipants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease identiﬁed that 
approximately 50% of older adults ceased exercise within 9 months 
of completing a supervised exercise program.6 Unfortunately, the 
beneﬁts of exercise are rapidly lost when exercise is ceased,7 
highlighting the need to promote ongoing participation. Hence, 
there is a need to identify ways of promoting ongoing physical 
activity following completion of a short-term supervised exercise 
program.

frequently 
employ behaviour change techniques. Three main approaches 
have been used: home-based exercise programs with no follow- 
up,8 gym-based exercise programs,9–14 or home-based exercise 
programs with telephone follow-up.6 Home-based prescribed 
physical activity programs with telephone support are thought to 
work by embedding exercise into daily routine, and avoiding the 
need for travel to an exercise centre. However, they may fail by not 
facilitating inter-personal connections between the individual and 
his/her peers, and by the prescriber having limited capacity to 
monitor the person’s physical progress. Structured gym-based 
programs may have an advantage over home-based programs, by 
controlling 
training and 
supervision, allowing personal attention and immediate verbal 
feedback from the exercise facilitator. Motivation for exercise may 
also be enhanced via social support and interaction between 
exercise group members with similar health issues.15 However, 
there are conﬂicting 
ﬁndings across these studies as to which of 
these follow-up approaches is more effective, and none have yet 
undertaken a head-to-head comparison in a regional, suburban, 
single-site, community health centre. 

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a 
home-based exercise program with telephone follow-up to a gym- 
based follow-up program amongst adults with a variety of chronic 
conditions and who had completed a short-term exercise program 
supervised by a health professional.

trial with concealed 
allocation, and blinded outcome assessments conducted at 
baseline (ie, at the completion of the short-term supervised 
exercise program), 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Prior to enrolment, all 
participants received an initial health assessment (also used to 
obtain participant baseline demographic data) from an exercise 
physiologist and then completed a 6-week supervised exercise 
program at a community health service. This consisted of 1-hour 
group exercise sessions, with participants encouraged to attend 
three sessions per week. Each participant was provided with a 
home-based exercise program at the conclusion of the supervised 
exercise program. Exercise physiologists collected baseline data for 
this trial at the discharge assessment of the short-term supervised 
program. Patients were then randomised to one of the two 12- 
month intervention programs. Randomisation involved the inves- 
tigator opening a sealed, opaque envelope containing the random 
allocation sequence, which was developed by a separate investi- 
gator with no knowledge of participants’ 
 baseline results. This 
sequence was set out in permuted blocks of 4, 6 and 8, and was 
stratiﬁed by the participant’s primary chronic disease diagnosis 
type (pulmonary, musculoskeletal, diabetes, other). A blinded 
research assistant conducted the reassessments at 3, 6, 9 and 
12 months. Participants were not blinded to group allocation; 
therefore, their self-reported outcomes could not be considered to 
be blinded. However, the research assistants who administered the 
physical tests were blinded. 

Participants were recruited from a pool of adults who had 
completed a 6-week exercise program at the Cardina Casey 
Community Health Service, South East Melbourne, Australia. Those 
referred to this service typically have: multiple co-morbidities; 
poor or declining mobility; physical de-conditioning; or a 
combination of these problems. Mixed population rehabilitation 
groups are a potentially useful mechanism of service delivery for 
regional areas where throughput within a speciﬁc diagnostic 
grouping is insufﬁcient to justify a disease-speciﬁc rehabilitation 
program (eg, pulmonary rehabilitation). We excluded people with 
acute psychiatric impairment or cognitive impairment that made 
the person unsuitable for participation in a gym-based or home- 
based exercise program, as determined by health service staff. 
Partners and/or couples were also excluded from participation. 



intervention were 
given a 12-month, individualised, exercise program. An exercise 
physiologist from the community health service supervised this at 
the gym from Monday to Friday for 2 hours per day. This meant 
that there was a person present at the gym with whom the 
participant already had a pre-established relationship from when 
they had completed the initial short-term supervised exercise 
program. Participants were encouraged to attend during the times 
that 
the gym. However, 
participants were able to independently attend the gym during 
off-peak times (Monday to Friday 08:00 to 16:00). Each participant 
was encouraged to complete a 1-hour exercise session, three times 
per week. They were required to pay the standard casual entry fee 
of AUD5 per visit to the gym. The exercise prescription adhered to 
the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for chronic 
health conditions.16 

The prescribed exercise included strengthening, aerobic and 
stretching exercise components. The strengthening component 
involved 40 minutes of six to eight strength training exercises for 
the upper and lower body (eg, leg press, calf raise, bicep curl, 
triceps push-down, 
lateral pull-down, chest press or scapula 
retraction) using pin-loaded resistance equipment, unless contra- 
indicated. Participants were prescribed a two-set repetition 
maximum per exercise set at a moderate intensity of approxi- 
mately 60% of their 10-repetition maximum. The aerobic compo- 
nent of the exercise involved up to 15 minutes of stationary bike, 
treadmill or cross trainer. The rating of perceived exertion scale 
‘moderate’ 
 intensity.17 The stretching 
was used to monitor a safe 
component involved 5 minutes of upper and lower limb stretching 
(eg, pectoral, shoulder, calf, hamstring and quadriceps) with two 
repetitions of each static stretch prescribed for 30 seconds. The 
healthcare professionals providing the intervention were trained 
in the Health Coaching Australia model that uses motivational 
interviewing techniques, solution-focused coaching and cognitive 
behavioural therapy techniques to identify techniques and address 
behavioural, emotional, situational and cognitive barriers to 
exercise adherence.18 



Participants allocated to the home-based intervention were 
also given a 12-month, individualised, exercise program. Each 
participant was encouraged to complete a 1-hour exercise session, 
three sessions per week, at home. The home-based exercise 
ﬁrst 
program was supervised via 
10 weeks, approximately 25 to 30 minutes in duration. The total 
ﬁve phone calls for each 
time 
participant was comparable to that spent supervising each 
participant in the gym over a 12-month intervention period. The 
exercise physiologist supervising the telephone intervention was 
also trained in the Health Coaching Australia Model. The same 
exercise physiologists who provided supervision for the gym- 
based program also provided the supervision for the home-based 
program, ensuring equivalence in the experience and educational 
background of the providers of each of these interventions.

The exercise prescription aimed to be comparable to that of the 
gym-based program. It also adhered to the American College of 
Sports Medicine guidelines for chronic health conditions,16 with 
strength, aerobic and stretching components comparable to the 
gym-based program. The strength-training component involved 
six to eight exercises for the upper and lower body (eg, sit to stand, 
calf raise, bicep curl, triceps push-down, lateral pull-down, chest 
press or scapula retraction) using body weight or an elastic 
exercise banda to provide resistance. The aerobic component 
included community walking or, if participants had access to their 
own exercise equipment such as a stationary bike, this was 
incorporated. 


Health-related quality of life was assessed using the European 
Quality of Life Instrument (EQ-5D).19 This questionnaire contains 
ﬁve multiple-choice questions and a 100-point overall health 
ﬁve questions reﬂect mobility, 
state visual analogue scale. The 
personal care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ 
depression. The respondent selects one of three ordinal state- 
ments to describe their health for each. In order to obtain an 
overall score, the Dolan utility calculator20 was applied. A utility 
score is determined where 0 represents death and 1 perfect 
health. Test-retest reliability for community-based adults follow- 
ing stroke is 0.83 at 3 weeks and 0.86 at 3 months.21 A minimum 
clinically important difference using this calculation approach for 
the EQ-5D amongst mixed chronic diagnosis groups has been 
estimated to be 0.074.22 

Productivity was measured using the Health and Labour 
Questionnaire.23 This questionnaire contains methods for calcu- 
lating productivity losses that are not the sole result of absentee- 
ism.23 
Social activity was measured using the Friendship Scale, which 
is a short and user-friendly 
that measures six 
dimensions contributing to social isolation and social connec- 
tion.24 A score between 0 and 24 is obtained; higher scores indicate 
less social isolation. 

Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale.25 This scale includes 14 items, seven 
of which relate to an anxiety subscale and seven to a depression 
subscale. Each item is scored between 0 and 3, and a sub-scale 
score > 8 indicates a possible case and a score > 10 a probable 
case.25 
Body mass index (BMI) was determined by body weight in 
kilograms divided by height in metres squared.26 Body mass index 
has been shown to predict cardiac mortality across a 15-year 
span.27 



is 
commonly used to measure lower limb strength in older people. 
The 
to be excellent 
reliability was established 
(ICC = 0.96) in a study assessing older adults with knee or hip 
osteoarthritis.29 In a study examining mobility tests for predicting 
multiple falls in community-dwelling older adults, good test-retest 
reliability was reported (ICC = 0.89).30 

(such as lifting weights or playing sport), and total physical 
activity. A total physical activity (PA) summary score between 
0 and 209 can be derived from the frequency and duration data 
by multiplying the two across all questions and adding the 
products. A higher score signiﬁes greater participation 
in 
physical activity. 

ﬁtness centre over the 
12 months was measured via gym scanning software that 
recorded client attendance. Participation in alternate forms of 
physical activity was measured at follow-up assessments at 3, 6, 
9 and 12 months, with a patient-recorded logbook. Participation 
in the home-based exercise program was measured using the 
patient’s logbook and collated at the 3, 6, 9 and 12-month 
assessments. 
An adverse event was any injury or exacerbation of existing 
illness that required medical attention while participating in either 
intervention and was measured using the patient logbook at 3, 6, 
9 and 12 months. 
A range of other outcomes measures that were relevant to an 
economic evaluation of this trial were also collected, but will not be 
reported in this clinical trial report. 

Each of the outcomes was compared between groups using 
linear regression analyses. Data were clustered within individual 
participants and robust (Huber-White) variance estimates were 
used.34 Each analysis compared groups across all 
follow-up 
assessments simultaneously with adjustment for baseline scores 
for that same outcome. A group-by-assessment time point 
interaction effect was also examined to see 
if there was a 
difference in the rate of change in an outcome between groups. 
Alpha criterion 
level was set at p = 0.05. All analyses were 
conducted using STATA softwareb. 
A sample size of 52 participants per group was required for this 
experiment to have 90% power to detect a 7-point change in the 
EQ-5D visual analogue scale of global health-related quality-of-life 
at the 12-month follow-up assessment. Many minimum clinically 
important difference levels have been established for the EQ-5D 
visual analogue scale across a range of patient populations with 
chronic disease, although a 7-point change is a standard that is 
commonly employed.35 A standard deviation of 11 points was used 
on the basis of a pre-trial survey of 20 patients within the target 
group conducted by the investigators. A 10% participant attrition 
rate was accommodated for; thus we aimed to recruit 57 partici- 
pants per group. 








The 6-minute walk test,31 which measures the distance a 
participant is able to walk in 6 minutes, was performed once per 
participant at each time point, using the American Thoracic Society 
guidelines. In community-dwelling adults aged 
 65 years, the 6- 
minute walk test showed correlations with the Short Physical 
Performance Battery (0.61), chair stand time (–0.62), habitual gait 
(0.80), maximal gait (0.80) and stair climb time (–0.83).32 

Physical activity was measured using the Phone-FITT,33 which 
is a self-reported questionnaire about the frequency, intensity, 
time and type of physical activity undertaken. The Phone-FITT 
allows respondents to report on household activity (such as 
cooking, cleaning and gardening), recreational physical activity

measures are presented in the 
groups were broadly similar at baseline, although some discre- 
pancies in characteristics were evident in terms of the proportion 
of married participants; 42/54 (78%) in the gym group compared to 
31/51 (61%) in the home group, and for the proportion who were 
widowed; 12/54 (24%) in the home group compared to 2/51 (4%) in 
the gym group. The gym group were more likely to be born in 
Australia (78 versus 60%), more likely to have a primary diagnosis 
of cancer (39 versus 23%) or diabetes (39 versus 23%) and less likely 
to have lung disease (24 versus 45%).

A summary of the primary and secondary outcome measures is 
presented in Table 2. (Individual participant data are presented in 
Table 3. See eAddenda for Table 3). The regression coefﬁcients that 
are presented represent the between-group difference averaged 
across the follow-up time points adjusted for baseline scores. A 
second coefﬁcient is also presented representing the group-by- 
time interaction effect to identify whether the effect of group 
allocation changed over follow-up time points. There was no 
signiﬁcant difference between study groups in the EQ-5D (primary 
outcome) across 
follow-up. The gym group 
demonstrated fewer symptoms of depression (Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale - depression subscale) over the 12 months of 
follow-up compared to the home group (p = 0.02); however, this 
was the only signiﬁcant between-group difference observed.

The mean number of exercise sessions completed at the 12- 
month follow-up was 52 sessions (SD 43, range 0 to 156) in the 
home group compared to 53 sessions (SD 34, range 8 to 150) in the 
gym group. The proportion of people fully adherent (deﬁned as 
three sessions completed per week) was 34% in the gym group and 
33% in the home group. 




This study has identiﬁed that gym-based and telephone follow- 
up approaches produce similar longer-term outcomes in people 
with chronic diseases who have recently undertaken a 6-week, 
centre-based, supervised exercise program. The only apparent 
difference in outcomes was identiﬁed for the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (depression subscale) outcome. It had been 
anticipated that a gym-based program might produce superior 
mental health outcomes mediated via the social interaction that 
participants would have participated in while at the gym. However, 
no change was found in the measure of social isolation, bringing 
this hypothesis into question. It is possible that the measure of 
social isolation (the Friendship Scale) was not the correct scale to 
measure the change in the amount of social interaction a person 


encountered. The Lubben Social Network Scale36 may have been 
preferable for this purpose, as it is a measure of social network size 
rather than one of loneliness and the ability to interact with others 
(as is the Friendship Scale). It is possible that a mechanism of action 
not mediated via social interaction may also have been responsible 
ﬁnding. For example, having to go to the gym forces people 
for this 
to leave their house, which has potential mental health beneﬁts 
from experiencing new environments or being exposed to sunlight 
while travelling to the gym.37,38 It is also possible that this may 
have been a Type 1 statistical error, given the number of secondary 
outcomes that were examined. Overall, the mechanism for the 
between-group difference in depression symptoms was unclear 
and warrants repeated investigation to reproduce this result and to 
more deeply examine the potential mechanism of action. It was 
encouraging, however, that the health states attained at the end of 
the initial program were largely maintained at 12 months in both 
groups. 

ﬁrst to directly assess the effectiveness 
of gym-based follow-up compared with home-based follow-up via 
telephone support amongst people with chronic diseases who 
have just completed a supervised exercise program. A recent 
review identiﬁed 11 studies that have previously examined one of 
these 
interventions compared to a control. Meta-regression 
analyses found no differential effect of follow-up approach on 
the rates of adherence to the exercise programs that had been 
ﬁnding, in that 
prescribed.39 The present study concurred with this 
it identiﬁed no difference in adherence rates between the two 
follow-up approaches. 
is still possible, however, that the 
different approaches may have different therapeutic outcomes 
despite similar adherence rates. 
It could be postulated that 
exercising 
in a gym environment with a range of available 
equipment may enhance the ability of participants to exercise at 
a higher intensity. Further research would be required to see if this 
is the case. 

A limitation of the present study was that it did not meet the 
planned sample size of 114 participants. This study was conducted 
in a somewhat regional suburban centre approximately 40 km 
from a major metropolitan city (Melbourne, Australia). The study 
location served as the single, major community health centre 
location for this area, meaning that many of the current and 
potentially future participants in this study often interacted with 
each other at this centre. Consequently, study recruiters noted that 
potential participants were becoming increasingly aware of the 
study prior to being approached as the study progressed. These 
‘study aware’ 
 individuals were forming preferences for study 
allocation grouping (usually centre-based), which then affected 
recruitment, in that people who did not prefer centre-based 
follow-up were disproportionately refusing to enter the study. A 
meeting of study investigators determined that it was better to 
cease the recruitment early at 105 rather than recruit a biased 
sample into the study. A consequence of this was that the study had 
lower statistical power than anticipated and that Type II statistical 
errors may have been made. A review of the analyses of the primary 
and secondary outcomes indicates that this may have been an issue 
for the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale 



The present study was not able to determine whether the 
exercise participation rates or health outcomes would have been 
any better for this patient population if a 
 control 
condition been employed. Reis et al12 and Berry et al10 found that 
following the completion of a short-term, supervised, pulmonary 
exercise program, the initial gains in 6-minute walk test distance 
signiﬁcantly declined with a 
 control compared to a 
centre-based exercise intervention. The Short Form-36 quality of 
life questionnaire scores12 and the Fitness Arthritis and Seniors 
Trial functional performance inventory10 also signiﬁcantly de- 
clined with a 
 control. In contrast, the present 12- 
month follow-up indicated that health outcomes were largely 
unchanged over this period for people allocated to either of the two 
follow-up approaches. One could also question whether the 
adherence rates observed in this study were sufﬁcient to generate

a physiological beneﬁt for participants, as both groups only 
participated on average in one session per week. Previous research 
has 
that one session per week after previously 
completing a more intensive program is sufﬁcient to maintain 
muscle strength, particularly when compared to completely 
stopping exercise participation.40 
The present study had some other limitations. It was impossible 
to blind participants or people delivering the intervention as to 
group allocation. 
In the home-based group with telephone 
support, participants’ 
 self-reported adherence was recorded using 
logbooks, whereas in the gym-based group, attendance at the gym 
was recorded through electronic scanning of a membership card. It 
is anticipated that the self-report approach may be more prone to 
spuriously inﬂated scoring by study participants leading to an 
overestimate of exercise adherence rates in this group. 
This research has implications both for clinical practice and 
future research. Clinicians could justiﬁably employ either of these 
follow-up approaches in clinical practice, although use of an 
approach that minimises overall healthcare resource use and 
aligns with patient preferences is recommended. As such, future 
research that investigates the cost-effectiveness of each follow-up 
approach should be considered. Furthermore, there is a need to 
‘no 
compare these approaches in this patient population with a 
follow-up’ 
 control to ensure that it is worthwhile pursuing either 
of these follow-up approaches. Future research could also take the 
form of a multicentre trial varying 
location (regional versus 
metropolitan) to investigate whether this factor inﬂuences the 
relative effectiveness and economic efﬁciency of either approach.

telephone follow-up for people with chronic diseases who had

may improve mental health outcomes. However, the mechanism 
for this was unclear, as there was no change in the selected 
measure of social isolation or other measures of health and 
wellbeing. Future research that investigates the cost-effectiveness 
of each follow-up approach should be considered.
