Background: Quality of life has become an important aspect in the measurement of the health of an individual as 
the population ages. Rhythm-centred music making (RMM) has been shown to improve physical, psychological and 
social health. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of RMM on quality of life, depressive mood, sleep 
quality and social isolation in the elderly. 
Methods: A randomised controlled trial with cross over was conducted. 54 participants were recruited with 27 
participants in each arm. In phase 1, group A underwent the intervention with group B as the control. In phase 2, 
group B underwent the intervention with group A as the control. The intervention involved 10 weekly RMM 
sessions. Patient related outcome data which included European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS) scores were 
collected before the intervention, at 11th and at the 22nd week. 
Results: A total of 31 participants were analyzed at the end of the study. The mean age was 74.65 ± 6.40 years. In 
analysing the change in patient related outcome variables as a continuous measure, participation in RMM resulted 
in a non-significant reduction in EQ5D by 0.004 (95% CI: -0.097,0.105), GDS score by 0.479 (95% CI:-0.329,1.287), PSQI 
score by 0.929 (95% CI:- 0.523,2.381) and an improvement in LSNS by 1.125 (95% CI:-2.381,0.523). In binary analysis, 
participation in RMM resulted in a 37% (OR = 1.370, 95% CI: 0.355,5.290), 55.3% (OR = 1.553, 95% CI: 0.438,5.501), 124.1% 
(OR = 2.241, 95% CI = 0.677,7.419) and 14.5% (OR = 1.145, 95% CI = 0.331,3.963) non-significant increase in odds of 
improvement in EQ5D, GDS, PSQI and LSNS scores respectively. 
Conclusion: Participation in RMM did not show any statistically significant difference in the quality of life of the 
participants. It is however, an interesting alternative tool to use in the field of integrative medicine. Moving forward, a 
larger study could be performed to investigate the effects of RMM on the elderly with an inclusion of a qualitative 
component to evaluate effects of RMM that were not captured by quantitative indicators. 
Trial registration: This trial was retrospectively registered. This trial was registered in the Australian New Zealand 
Clinical Trials Registry under trial number ACTRN12616001281482 on 12 September 2016. 

Introduction 
Background 
The silver tsunami has hit Asia with the population aged 
65 and above projected to increase by more than 300% 
from 207 million in 2000 to 857 million in 2050 [1].

health as “a state of complete physical, mental, and so- 
cial well-being and not merely an absence of disease and 
infirmity”. With people living longer than before, the 
concept of quality of life, which comprises of objective 
descriptors and subjective evaluations of physical, mater- 
ial, social, and emotional wellbeing together with the ex- 
tent of personal development and purposeful activity [2], 
has become an important aspect in the measurement of 
the health of an individual and it has been recognized as

an important health outcome [3]. The self-assessed 
health status is also a powerful predictor of morbidity 
and mortality [4, 5]. Integrative medicine is an emerging 
field [6] that has been defined as “patient-centred, heal- 
ing oriented, and embracing conventional and comple- 
mentary therapies” with a focus on the person as a 
including one’s lifestyle, not just the physical 
whole, 
body itself. It addresses the importance of nonphysical 
influences like emotional, spiritual and social health on 
physical health and disease [7] and it has been shown to 
be helpful in improving care for patients [8]. 
Depression and sleep duration has been found to 
have effects on health-related quality of 
life [9, 10]. 
Depression is a common mood disorder among the 
elderly [11, 12] which has been listed as one of the 
top ten causes of disability burden (in years of life lost 
to disability) in Singapore [13]. It is known that sleep 
and its characteristics have various effects on the 
physiology of the human body [14] and that having 
adequate sleep and good sleep quality is an important 
part in maintaining a healthy lifestyle [15]. 
Rhythm-centred music making (RMM), defined as the 
active playing of drums and various other percussion in- 
struments, has been found to have benefits in areas of 
emotional, psychological and social outcomes [16, 17] 
with improvements in mood, reduction in anxiety, stress 
relief and relaxation [16, 18, 19]. The notion of group 
drumming has been adopted by numerous communities 
to promote wellness, teambuilding and sense of em- 
powerment [20–22]. In group drumming, participants 
gather around in a circle each with their own instrument 
[23]. The session will be led by a facilitator who creates 
an environment that encourages participants to commu- 
nicate with one another, to express their emotions and 
to reduce their stress and tension within through the use 
of various percussion instruments [24]. The drum circle 
connects different individuals, encouraging a sense of 
community [25]. This therapeutic experience through 
music making empowers the individual and allows them 
to take the intervention into their own hands. On top of 
the effects on emotional, psychological and social out- 
comes, it has also been shown by one study that drum- 
ming could lower blood pressure post-intervention [19], 
postulating the possibility of it bringing about improve- 
ments in the physical health of the elderly. 
Objectives 
The active playing of rhythmic music using various per- 
cussion instruments, including drumming, is a type of 
physical activity [19] whereby the effects on the elderly 
has yet to be adequately explored. The purpose of this 
study was to explore the benefits that RMM has on the 
quality of life of the elderly. The effects of RMM on de- 
pressive symptoms, sleep quality and social isolation in 
the elderly were also studied as secondary outcomes. 
With the results from this study, RMM could be used as 
a possible tool for clinicians in the field of Integrative 
Medicine. A wider scale of implementation of RMM as a 
recreational activity could also improve the health out- 
comes of the elderly living in the community. 
Methods 
Trial design 
This was a randomised controlled trial with cross over 
consisting of 2 phases and a planned allocation ratio of 
1:1. Before the start of Phase 1, participants from both 
Group A and Group B had to complete their first set of 
questionnaires. In Phase 1 of the study, participants in 
Group A underwent the intervention while participants 
in Group B served as the control. 
After 11 weeks, a second set of questionnaires were 
administered to participants from both groups. In Phase 
2 of the study, participants in group A served as a con- 
trol group for group B while participants in group B 
underwent the intervention. At the end of 11 weeks, the 
final set of questionnaires were administered to partici- 
pants from both groups. 
This study was approved by the SingHealth Centralised 
Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was ob- 
tained from the participants prior to participation in the 
study. There were no changes to methods after trial 
commencement. 


Participants 
A total of 54 participants who met the following criteria 
were 
co- 
investigator YH between 1 November 2015 to 9 January 
2016: (1) Aged 65 years and older; (2) Understands 
English or Mandarin. Exclusion criteria 
included: 
Individuals on palliative care and individuals who were 
bed-bound. Sociodemographic, clinical and patient re- 
lated outcome data were collected via interviewer- 
administered questionnaires in the participant’s home. 

Intervention 
Participants participated in RMM sessions of 1 h per 
session, under the Rhythm Wellness Programme by 
OneHeartBeat, held once a week for a total of 10 ses- 
sions over 11 weeks where a break was scheduled in the 
4th week to factor in a public holiday within the inter- 
vention period of one of the groups. All RMM sessions 
were facilitated by 3 experienced instructors. The instru- 
ments used include the conga, cowbell, Djembe, Ashiko 
Tan-tans, Dunun, Shakers, and Wood Blocks in all the 
sessions. 
Each session was carried out in a circle, with the par- 
ticipant seated comfortably and the drum or percussion 
instrument within reach in front of them. During each 


session, the instructors facilitated free play, and encour- 
aged the participants to express themselves and interact 
with each other through the active playing of 
the 
instruments. 
Outcomes 
Sociodemographic data included age, gender, race, mari- 
tal status, number of children, type of housing and the 
number of people the participants are living with. Partic- 
ipants’ social support and social isolation were assessed 
using the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS) as well 
as questions pertaining to their attendance at social ac- 
tivities like residents/community development commit- 
tee or neighbourhood events and places of worships. 
Clinical variables included self-reported co-morbidities, 
functional status, whether they were under palliative 
care, their hearing and vision as well as participation in 
physical exercise. The sociodemographic data of the par- 
ticipants are shown in Table 1. 
Patient related outcome data included European Quality 
of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), Geriatric Depression 
Scale (GDS), Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS) 
and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores. 
EQ5D, GDS, LSNS and PSQI were collected at 3 dif- 
ferent time points - before the intervention and at 
the 11th and 22th week. There were no changes to 
trial outcome measures after the trial commenced. 
The EQ-5D form is a measure of health status from 
self- 
the EuroQol Group primarily designed for 
completion by respondents. The score ranges from 0 
(death) to 1 (full health) and includes 5 dimensions 
namely “mobility”, “self-care”, “usual activities”, “pain/ 
discomfort”, “anxiety/depression” [26]. It is validated lo- 
cally by Luo N [27, 28]. 
The GDS is a tool for the elderly populations consist- 
ing of 15 items which evaluates the level of depressive 
symptoms of an individual over the past week. A cut-off 
score of more than 5 out of the maximum 15 indicates 
the presence of clinically significant depressive symp- 
toms. This scale was developed by Yesa-vage et al. [29] 
and validated locally by Nyunt, M. S. [30]. 
PSQI is a self-reported measure of sleep quality, con- 
sisting of a 19 item scale grouped into 7 equally 
weighted component scores: Subjective Sleep Quality, 
Sleep Latency, Sleep Duration, Habitual Sleep Efficiency, 
Sleep Disturbances, Use of Sleeping Medication and 
Daytime Dysfunction. The subscale scores range from 0 
to 3 and the global score range from 0 to 21 with poorer 
sleep quality indicated by a higher global score [31, 32]. 
LSNS is a self-reported measure designed to gauge so- 
cial isolation in older adults. It measures the frequency, 
size and closeness of contacts for the respondent’s social 
network by assessing their perceived level of support re- 
ceived from their friends and families. LSNS-6 is the

abbreviated version with 3 items on the friends scale and 
3 items on the family scale. It is used mainly to identify 
people that may require assistance or would benefit from 
linking to community programs/services [33]. The score 
range from 0 to 30, with a higher score reflecting more 
social engagement. Individuals with a score of less than 
12 were identified as socially isolated. 
Sample size calculation 
This was based on our primary objective which was to 
understand the impact of the intervention on the quality 
of life of the participants. The total sample size required 
was 30 with 15 in each arm. We used 0.074 as the min- 
imally important clinical difference for EQ5D with a 
standard deviation of 0.066 [34]. We based the our cal- 
culations on the following formula, n = (Zα/2 + Zβ)2 
*2*σ2/d2, with type I error of 0.05 and power of 0.8, tak- 
ing into account a dropout rate of approximately 15%. 
Randomization 
A list of participants was generated by co-investigator 
AY and sequential numbers were assigned to each par- 
ticipant. Participants were randomly allocated into 
Group A or B using a computer random number gener- 
ator. This was done by the co-investigator AY. The par- 
ticipants and co-investigator YH were not aware of the 
treatment allocation until after they were enrolled in the 
study. The randomization list was made available to co- 
investigator YH on the day of data collection and partici- 
pants were notified of their group assignment verbally 
by YH. There was no blinding done. 
Statistical methods 
Data from each of the experimental phases, Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 were analysed using STATA SE14.0. Within 
group differences for sociodemographic variables were 
analysed with t-test for continuous variables and Fisher 
exact test for categorical variables. Descriptive statistics 
were presented in mean ± standard deviation for con- 
tinuous variables and number of participants with the 
percentages for categorical variables. Within group dif- 
ferences were analysed with Wilcoxon signed rank test 
and between group differences were analysed with 
Mann-Whitney U tests. The data was analysed based on 
per-protocol analysis whereby only participants who 
have completed the 3 data collection forms were 
analysed. 
EQ5D, PSQI, GDS and LSNS were categorized into 
binary outcomes based on absolute improvements to 
analyze the effect of RMM on the improvements of the 
various outcome measures. For the continuous and bin- 
ary characterization of change for each patient outcome 
variables, the generalized linear models using generalized 
estimating equation (GEE) was performed on the data to 
account for the correlation between repeated changes in 
scores. The linear predictor included the intervention in- 
dicator, order indictor, phase and the baseline patient 
outcome variables before the start of each phase. P- 
values less than 0.05 were reported as significant. 
Results 
Participant flow 
As shown in Fig. 1, 3 participants from Group A with- 
drew from the start of the study due to time commit- 
ments with 24 participants left in Group A and 27 
participants left in Group B. During Phase 1 of the 
study, a total of 6 participants from Group A and 4 par- 
ticipants from Group B withdrew from the study. For 
Group A, 1 participant dropped out because of the trav- 
elling distance to the sessions, 1 participant was un- 
contactable while the other 4 participants dropped out 
because of family and other commitments. For Group B, 
2 participants from withdrew because of medical reasons 
and 2 participants were un-contactable. During Phase 2 
of the study, a total of 2 participants in Group A and 8 
participants in Group B withdrew from the study. For 
Group A, 1 participant passed away while the other par- 
ticipant was un-contactable. For Group B, 1 participant 
from withdrew because of social issues, 3 participants 
withdrew because of travelling distance while the other 4 
withdrew because of time commitments. A sensitivity 
analysis was performed on the sociodemographic of the 
dropouts compared to the participants that remained 
and only the gender was found to be statistically signifi- 
cant (p = 0.045) as shown in an additional file [see 
Additional file 1]. 
Recruitment 
Participants were recruited from December 2015 to 
January 2016 and followed up till June 2016. The trial 
was completed as planned in June 2016. 
Baseline data 
Table 1 provides the summary statistics of the sociode- 
mographic variables for Group A and B, and there were 
no significant differences in sociodemographic charac- 
teristics between the two groups. The overall mean age 
of the study participants was 74.65 ± 6.40 and 94% of 
the participants were female. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 31 participants were included in the analysis, 
16 from Group A and 15 from Group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Pre-intervention and Post-intervention values 
In Phase 1 of the study, Group A underwent 10 ses- 
sions of RMM. As shown in Table 2, there was a non-

significant decrease in median GDS scores from 3.50 
(1.00, 6.00) before the intervention to 2.00 (1.00, 3.00) 
after the intervention and a non-significant decrease in 
median LSNS scores from 18.50 (7.50, 23.00) before the 
intervention to 12.50 (8.50, 18.50) after the intervention. 
The median EQ5D scores showed a non-significant im- 
provement from 0.81 (0.67, 0.94) pre-intervention to 
0.94 (0.72, 1.00) post-intervention. The median PSQI 
scores remained unchanged. In Phase 2 of the study, 
Group B underwent 10 sessions of RMM while Group A 
served as a control. Showing a similar trend, there was a 
non-significant decrease in median GDS scores from 
4.00 (3.00, 6.00) before the intervention to 2.00 (1.00, 
5.00) after the intervention and a non-significant de- 
crease in median LSNS scores from 12.00 (6.00, 14.00) 
before the intervention to 11.00 (6.00, 17.00) after the

intervention. The median EQ5D scores showed a non- 
significant 
from 0.60 (0.35, 0.86) pre- 
intervention to 0.63 (0.39, 0.74) post-intervention. The 
median PSQI scores remained unchanged. It was also 
noted that the median GDS scores of Group A contin- 
ued to show a non-significant reduction from 2.00 (1.00, 
3.00) to 1.00 (1.00, 3.50). 
Effects of RMM on patient outcome variables 
In studying the effects of RMM on the change of EQ5D, 
GDS, PSQI and LSNS as a continuous measure, a linear 
regression model using GEE was performed where the 
outcome is the change in scores while taking into ac- 
count phase, order and baseline EQ5D, GDS, PSQI and 
LSNS respectively before the start of each phase, and the 
correlation across repeated measurements. As shown in 
Table 3, it is noted that participation in RMM resulted 
in a non-significant reduction in EQ5D by 0.004 (95% 
CI: -0.097, 0.105), GDS score by 0.479 (95% CI:-0.329, 
1.287), PSQI score by 0.929 (95% CI:-0.523, 2.381) and 
in LSNS by 1.125 (95% CI:-1.134, 
an improvement 
3.384). 
In classifying the patient outcome variables into im- 
provements vs no improvement, a logistic regression 
model using GEE was performed while taking into ac- 
count phase, order and baseline patient outcome vari- 
ables before the start of each phase, and the correlation 
across repeated measurements. It is noted that participa- 
tion in RMM resulted in a 37% non-significant increase 
in odds of improvement in EQ5D scores (OR = 1.370, 
95% CI: 0.355,5.290), 55.3% non-significant increase in 
odds of improvement in GDS scores (OR = 1.553, 95% 
CI: 0.438,5.501), 124.1% non-significant increase in odds 
of 
in PSQI scores (OR = 2.241, 95% 
CI = 0.677,7.419) and a 14.5% non-significant increase in 
odds of improvement in LSNS scores (OR = 1.145, 95% 
CI = 0.331,3.963) when compared with no participation 
in RMM.

Harms 
The co-investigators YH and AY enquired about any ad- 
verse events by asking the participants for feedback, 
allowing them to raise issues at the end of each session, 
finding out how they felt about the sessions and whether 
there were any issues or discomfort they might have ex- 
perienced in between each session. There were no ad- 
verse issues raised by the participants. 
Discussion 
Interpretation 
This is the first study performed evaluating the effects of 
RMM on the quality of life and sleep quality of individ- 
uals providing the basis for future studies to explore 
these areas. The strengths of the study include a cross- 
over study design that provided a control for each inter- 
vention arm through randomization and the generalized 
linear models using GEE to account for phase, order and 
baseline patient outcome effects. 
It is noted from Table 2 that the baseline patient re- 
lated outcome variables for both groups were signifi- 
cantly different when comparing EQ5D and LSNS. 
Thus, an adjusted analysis was performed with the re- 
sults reflected in Table 3. 
The effects of RMM on EQ5D scores as a primary out- 
come showed a non-significant decrease in quality of life 
in the continuous analysis and a non-significant increase 
in odds of improvement in EQ5D scores. In studying the 
effects of RMM on GDS, PSQI and LSNS scores as sec- 
ondary outcome measures after correction for baseline 
patient related outcome variables, results showed a gen- 
eral trend of increasing the probability of improvement 
isolation 
in depressive mood, sleep quality and social 
with participation in RMM even though it was not sta- 
tistically significant for both continuous and binary ana- 
lysis. The effects of RMM on the psychological health of 
participants with improvements in anxiety [35], mood 
[36], stress, anger and self-esteem [37] has been shown 
in various other studies as well [38]. 
Even though the scores for EQ5D as the primary out- 
come measure were not significantly different post- 
intervention, the RMM sessions were well-received by the 
majority of the participants of the intervention group. 
RMM could be a new activity adopted by various commu- 
nities and nursing homes to engage the elderly as a form 
of recreational activity with benefits on the health of an in- 
dividual. It could also be a possible non-pharmacological 
therapy in the field of Integrative Medicine where the 
focus is not only on the physical health but also on treat- 
ing the patient whole including their lifestyle as well.

support in data collection and Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital for the 
provision of venue. 
Limitations 
Results from the study showed possible improvements 
in depressive mood, sleep quality and social isolation in 
individuals but due to limited statistical power from a 
small sample size as this is a pilot study, the changes 
were not statistically significant. Also, as it is difficult to 
comprehensively quantify the benefits of RMM on the 
individual participants, a qualitative study could be con- 
ducted in the future to objectively study the effects of 
RMM that were not captured by the patient-related out- 
come measures in this study. However, this quantitative 
study provides the ground work for future exploration of 
the impact of this intervention on quality of life, sleep 
quality, depression and social isolation. With regards to 
future studies conducted on RMM, if a cross over study 
design was to be chosen, a suitable duration for a wash- 
out period could be incorporated to take into account a 
carryover effect from the intervention. A randomized 
controlled trial design without crossover could be con- 
sidered as it is difficult to quantify a sufficient washout 
period and the intervention may result in a learned ef- 
fect unlike drugs, resulting in an incomplete washout. 
Conclusion 
Participation in RMM did not show any statistically sig- 
nificant difference in the quality of life of participants. It 
is however, an interesting alternative tool to use in the 
field of 
integrative medicine and moving outside the 
field of medicine, it could be a new form of recreational 
activity adopted by the elderly in the community as well 
as in nursing homes. Moving forward, a larger study 
could be performed to investigate the effects of RMM 
on the elderly with an inclusion of a qualitative compo- 
nent to evaluate effects that were not captured by quan- 
titative indicators.
