Pain is common in the aging population, particularly among older 
residents of nursing homes. It has been found that 50% of older people 
living in the community have been experiencing chronic pain, and the 
number increased to 80% for older residents of nursing homes. 
Exercise is an effective non-pharmacological intervention that can 
reduce pain and improve physical and psychological functions. A 
quasi-experimental study with a pretest–posttest control group de- 
signed was conducted to evaluate the effects of a physical exercise 
program (PEP) on older residents of nursing homes who have chronic 
pain. Three-hundred-ninety-six older residents with chronic pain 
were recruited from 10 nursing homes run by non-governmental 
organizations in Hong Kong. The average age of the older residents 
was 85.44 ± 6.29. Five nursing homes were randomized to the experi- 
mental group with PEP (n ¼ 225, age ¼ 85.45 ± 6.25); the other ﬁve 
nursing homes were randomized to the control group without the PEP 
(n ¼ 171, age ¼ 85.44 ± 6.35). PEP was an eight-week training program 
given by a physiotherapist and nurses once a week. It consisted of 
warm-up exercises, muscle strengthening, stretching, balancing, and 
self-administered massage to acupressure points. At the end of each 
PEP session, pamphlets with pictures illustrating the ‘‘exercise of the 
day’’ were given to the older residents of nursing homes as a tool to 
enhance their self-management skills. The control group received no 
training during the eight weeks. Upon completion of the PEP, the 
experimental group experienced a signiﬁcantly greater reduction in 
pain intensity from 4.19 ± 2.25 (on an 11 point scale) to 2.67 ± 2.08, as 
compared to the control group (p < .05). In addition, the

psychological well-being (happiness, loneli- 
ness, life satisfaction, and depression) of the 
experimental group was signiﬁcantly 
improved (p < .05). 
(cid:1) 2013 by the American Society for Pain 
Management Nursing 
Pain is common in the aging population, particularly 
among older residents of nursing homes (Hollenack 
et al., 2007). Most age-related diseases and illnesses 
cause chronic pain and disability. Studies showed 
that 50% of 
the community-dwelling adults aged 
60 years or above had experienced pain, and the num- 
ber increased to 45% to 80% in residents of nursing 
homes (American Geriatric Society, Panel on Chronic 
Pain in Older Persons, 1998; Chung & Wong, 2007; 
Ferrell et al., 1990). Older residents of nursing homes 
are also at a higher risk of their pains not being 
assessed and the treatments they are receiving being 
inadequate even though their pains are documented 
(Achterberg et al., 2010). 
Pain in the elderly is mostly degenerative and can 
cause mobility decline, role changes, and psychologi- 
cal disorders. Pain results from acute or chronic condi- 
tions are associated with a decrease of physical and 
social functions and quality of life, and it is seen as 
a key indicator of physical impairment (Horgas et al., 
level of 
2008; Parker et al., 2013). The overall 
physical activity in older adults with chronic pain is 
signiﬁcantly lower than their non-pain counterparts 
(Stubbs et al., 2013). 
The impact of pain is a cycle of disuse and inactivity 
(Grifﬁn, Harmon, & Kennedy, 2012; Martin, 2007). Pain 
causes a decrease in muscle strength, mobility, and 
physical ﬁtness, which results in reduced functional 
use. People who reduce their physical activities 
experience more pain and disability in the long run. 
Psychological effects of pain include misconcep- 
tions about pain, decreased self-conﬁdence in one’s 
ability to cope with pain, fear of causing harm, avoid- 
less life satisfaction, and 
ing performing activities, 
worsening mood (Grifﬁn, Harmon, & Kennedy, 2012; 
Meredith, Strong, & Feeney, 2006; Sowden, Hatch, 
Gray, & Coombs, 2006; Turk et al., 2003;). 
Maintaining the functional capacity in older peo- 
ple is crucial for breaking the cycle of disuse and inac- 
tivity. Physical exercise is effective in improving 
functions or delaying the functional decline in older 
people (Binder et al., 2002; Rydwik, Kerstin, & 
Akner, 2005). Exercise can signiﬁcantly improve the 
gait velocity and limb strength and decrease psycholog- 
ical disorders such as depression in older persons 
(De Carvalho & Filho, 2004; Callahan, 2009). 
Performing physical exercise can be seen as a skill 
for pain management. It has been shown that physical 
exercises, if performed regularly as a habit, can bring 
health beneﬁts such as pain relief and improved func- 
tional capacity for older people. Effective physical 
exercise can be introduced as a self-management skill 
to older residents of nursing homes who have chronic 
pain. 
The objective of this study is to investigate the ef- 
fectiveness of a physical exercise program (PEP) in re- 
ducing pain, enhancing mobility, and improving 
psychological function for older residents of nursing 
homes. The authors hypothesized that the PEP would 
signiﬁcantly improve the outcomes in terms of pain in- 
tensity, physical mobility, quality of life, and psycholog- 
ical function. 

Design 
It was a randomized-controlled study to explore the ef- 
fect of an eight-week PEP for older residents living in 
nursing homes in pain intensity, physical mobility, 
quality of life, and psychological function. The study 
was approved by the Human Subject Ethics Sub- 
committee of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 
Ten nursing homes in Hong Kong, including Hong 
Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories, were 
recruited by convenience sampling. These nursing 
homes were run by non-governmental organizations 
and had similar social support, healthcare, and pension 
policies. Among them, ﬁve nursing homes were ran- 
domized to the experimental group; another ﬁve nurs- 
ing homes were randomized to the control group by 
using a computerized randomization table. Partici- 
pants in the experimental group received the PEP 
while the control group received no treatment during 
the study period (Figure 1). 
Participants 
Older persons who had suffered from musculoskeletal 
pain six months prior to the study were recruited. A to- 
tal of 396 older persons were enrolled. Inclusion crite- 
ria were aged 60 or above, able to communicate in 
Chinese, and were oriented to time and place. Older 
persons with a history of mental disorder or cognitive 
impairment were excluded. Each participant gave writ- 
ten informed consent to participate. 
Procedure 
Demographic data, medical data, psychological param- 
eter, and physical parameter were collected in both the 
experimental and the control group two to three days 
before the PEP and two to three days after the PEP. 



The demographic data included age, gender, mar- 
ital status, educational level, previous occupation, and 
personal health condition. The medical data included 
information on pain history, use of oral analgesic 
drug, and non-drug methods for pain control. The psy- 
chological parameter included happiness, loneliness, 
life satisfaction, depression, and quality of life. For 
physical parameter, the authors assessed the range of 
motion (ROM) of the participants, and the Barthel 
ADL Index and the Elderly Mobility Index were used 
to assess the activities of daily living and mobility. 
Three research assistants with nursing back- 
ground were on the research team. Training, as well 
as demonstration and returned demonstration, were 
given to prepare them to use various instruments. 
One research assistant received training, demonstra- 
tion, and return demonstration from a physiotherapist 
to learn how to take pain history and use a protractor 
to measure the ROM of the participants. 
The Physical Exercise Program 
The physical exercise program (PEP) was led by a phys- 
iotherapist and research assistants with nursing back- 
grounds. It was carried out in a multi-function room 
of the nursing homes. The PEP was delivered to the in- 
tervention group one time a week for eight weeks. 
Each session lasted for an hour. 
The participants’ physical condition and capacity 
to perform the exercises were carefully monitored 
throughout the program. Continual encouragement

and reinforcement were given to the participants to en- 
hance their performances. 
The PEP was designed by a physiotherapist based 
on his/her clinical practice on pain management and 
health education experiences with patients. Each 
session of the PEP was made up of a 15-minute 
warm-up exercise and a 45-minute exercise training. Dif- 
ferent types of exercises were offered in each session. 
Examples included muscle strengthening using an elas- 
tic band, stretching, balancing, towel dance, and the 
skill of self-administered acupressure and massage. 
The 45-minute exercise training was designed to 
help the participants to relieve their pain in the shoul- 
der, neck, back, and knee areas. The theme of each PEP 
session and the exercises performed are shown in 
Figure 1. Upon completion of each PEP session, pam- 
phlets with pictures illustrating the ‘‘exercise of the 
day’’ were given to all participants to encourage them 
to continue to practice the exercises by themselves. 
Instruments 
The 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was used to 
assess the presence, location, and intensity of pain 
among the participants. The scale was presented verti- 
cally, with 0 representing no pain and 10 the worst 
pain imaginable. The Spearman’s correlation coefﬁ- 
cient for validity was 0.74 (Lara-Munoz, De Leon, 
Feinstein, Puente, & Wells, 2004). 
The Barthel Index was used to evaluate the self- 
care functional ability for the activities of daily living 
(Mahoney and Barthel, 1965). The index consists of 
10 items including presence or absence of fecal and uri- 
nary incontinence and independence in grooming, toi- 
leting, feeding, personal hygiene, transfers, walking, 
dressing, climbing stairs, and bathing. The score varies 
from item to item, and the maximum total score is 20, 
which indicates total independence (Shyu, et al., 2008). 
The Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS) was used to 
assess the mobility of the participants. The scale con- 
sists of seven activities that evaluate an individual’s mo- 
bility independence including position changes and 
walking mobility (Smith, 1994). The score varies 
from item to item and the maximum total score is 20, 
which indicates total 
independence (Proser, 1997; 
Ng, Tong, & Li, 2008). 
The range of motion (ROM) of the participants 
was measured by the degree of movement from the 
alignment of body, including left and right neck rota- 
tion, left and right shoulder ﬂex, left and right shoulder 
abduction, left and right knee ﬂex, lumbar ﬂex, left and 
right lumbar rotation, and left and right hip ﬂex. A half 
circle protractor, which is made of transparent plastic 
and marked in degrees (180(cid:2)), was used to measure 
angles. 
Quality of life was measured by the Health Survey 
Short Form questionnaire (SF-12), which consists of 12 
questions to generate physical and mental component 
subscale scores (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1996). Each 
score ranges from 0 to 100, higher scores indicating 
better health status. A Chinese version of the SF-12 
was used which has been found valid and equivalent 
for the Hong Kong Chinese (Lam, Tse, & Gandek, 
2005). 
The Chinese version of the Subjective Happiness 
Scale was used to assess the happiness level of older 
persons (Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999). The scale con- 
sists of four items rated on a 7-point Likert Scale. The 
total scores range from 4 to 28 with higher scores sig- 
nifying higher subjective happiness. The Cronbach’s al- 
pha is 0.79 to 0.94. The test-retest reliability ranges 
from 0.55 to 0.90. 
The revised UCLA Loneliness Scale was used to 
measure people’s loneliness (Russell, 1996). The scale 
consists of 20 items to measure feelings of loneliness 
and social isolation. A four-point Likert Scale with a rat- 
ing 1 ¼ never, 2 ¼ seldom, 3 ¼ sometimes, and 
4 ¼ always was used. The range of total scores is 20 
to 80. Higher scores indicate greater loneliness. The 
Chinese version of the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale 
was used in this study with a Cronbach’s alpha of 
0.90 (Chou, Jun, & Chi, 2005). 
The Chinese version of the Life Satisfaction Index, 
a form scale, was used. The index consists of 18 ques- 
tions around ﬁve components: zest, resolution and for- 
titude, congruence between desired and achieved 
goals, positive self-concept, and mood tone. Items are 
scored 1 ¼ agree and 0 ¼ disagree (Chi and Boey, 
1992). Higher scores indicate greater life satisfaction. 
The Cronbach’s alpha is 0.7 and internal consistency 
is 0.62. 
The Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression 
Scale was used to measure depression (Mui, 1996; 
Yesavage, Brink, Rose, & Lum, 1983). The scale 
consists of 15 questions with a rating of 1 ¼ yes and 
0 ¼ no. Higher scores indicate more depression. 
Cronbach’s alpha of internal consistency is 0.89, and 
the test-retest reliability is 0.85. 
Statistical Analyses 
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, 
version 17) for Windows was used for all statistical 
analysis. Descriptive statistics calculated the means 
and standard deviations. The authors used the Chi- 
square test to analyze the differences in the demo- 
graphic data between the experimental group and 
the control group. Changes in outcome measures 
were regarded as the difference between pre- and 
posttreatment (posttreatment minus pretreatment).

Demographic Data of the Study Participants 



Independent t-test to analyze the between-group differ- 
ences of the outcome variables was used. The signiﬁ- 
cance level was set as p # .05. 

Participant Characteristics 
Descriptive characteristics of the participants are pre- 
sented in Table 1. There was no baseline difference be- 
tween the experimental group and the control group 
in all demographic data, but there were signiﬁcantly 
more post stroke participants in the experimental 
group. The scores in the experimental group were sig- 
niﬁcantly higher than those of the control group in 
most outcome measures (except the Barthel 
index 
and EMS) (Table 1). 
Pain Intensity 
The baseline pain intensity among the participants was 
4.10 (cid:3) 2.20. After the completion of PEP, the partici- 
pants’ pain intensity was reduced in both groups. 
The pain score (as measured by VRS) in the experimen- 
tal group was signiﬁcantly lower than the control 
group (PEP group 2.67 (cid:3) 2.08 vs control group 
3.29 (cid:3) 2.24; Change of VRS: (cid:4)1.70 (cid:3) 2.53 vs 
(cid:4)0.69 (cid:3) 2.45, t ¼ (cid:4)4.164, p < .001) (Table 2). The 
pain scores for each painful site are shown in Figure 2. 
Physical Parameters 
The experimental group had signiﬁcantly higher 
scores in the Barthel index and the EMS at baseline 
than the control group (p < .01). Yet, no signiﬁcant dif- 
ference between the two groups regarding the score 
changes in the Barthel index and the EMS upon com- 
pletion of the PEP (p > .05) (Table 3). In the experi- 
mental group, the ROMs of the neck, shoulder, back, 
hip, and knee joints of the participants had increased 
signiﬁcantly upon completion of 
the PEP (all 
p < .001), as shown in Table 3. 
Quality of Life 
There was no signiﬁcant change in the quality of life 
(both physical and mental components) of the PEP 
group and control group (Table 3). 

Psychological Parameters 
Score changes in the psychological measures (happi- 
ness, 
life satisfaction, and depression) 
were more signiﬁcant in the PEP group than in the con- 
trol group (all p # .05) (Table 3), which indicated par- 
ticipants in the PEP group had a higher self-perception 
of happiness and life satisfaction and lower perception 
of loneliness and depression after receiving the PEP.

The present randomized controlled study conﬁrmed 
that an eight-week physical exercise program, includ- 
ing muscle strengthening and stretching for the painful 
areas, balancing, and self-administered acupressure, 
was effective in reducing pain and improving psycho- 
logical function and joint mobility. In addition, the par- 
ticipants who attended the PEP had signiﬁcantly lesser 
pain than those who had not received the PEP. The ex- 
ercise is easy for the elderly to do themselves. The PEP

is a feasible intervention, which is easy to replicate and 
is applicable to other residents. Physical activity is 
an important non-pharmacological strategy in the 
management of chronic pain, and it is important to en- 
courage older adults with chronic pain to remain active 
(Grifﬁn, Harmon, & Kennedy, 2012; Stubbs et al, 
2013). The physical exercise in this 
study is 
beneﬁcial to older adults. The authors suggest that

Moreover, older

maintain their functions. 



The score change in the Barthel index indicated 
a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in the partici- 
pant’s physical capacity and no signiﬁcant group differ- 
ence in the Elderly Mobility Scale. This was possibly 
due to the high physical functional capacity among 
the enrolled residents (especially the PEP group) at 
baseline. This might have caused a ceiling effect that 
hindered satisfactory improvements in physical mobil- 
ity of the participants. 
The authors suggest that instruments such as the 
Timed Up and Go test, the Timed Chair Stand test, 
and the Gait Velocity test could be other effective out- 
come measures used for further studies in the evalua- 
tion of physical mobility (Csuka & McCarty, 1985; 
Hayes & Johnson, 2003; Shumway-Cook, Brauer, & 
Woollacott, 2000). 
There were signiﬁcant improvements in the psy- 
chological measures regarding the change in happi- 
ness, life satisfaction, loneliness, depression, and two 
pain beliefs in permanence and self-blame in the PEP 
group. Yet, the control group did not show any signif- 
icant improvement, even tending to deteriorate in 
those variables. The favorable improvements experi- 
enced by the PEP group were signiﬁcant in enhancing 
psychological well-being for older adults. 
Indeed, the design of the PEP was an eight-week 
program given by the research team, and the authors 
could only deliver it once a week for eight weeks in 
each nursing home. In future studies, it would be inter- 
esting to explore the effectiveness of a four- or six- 
week dose. To focus developing exercise as a habit, 
older adults were encouraged to perform exercises 
on their own time. The study did not have a particular 
measure on resident activity and exercise outside of 
class, which would be a limitation of the present study, 
and further study should include recording exercise ac- 
tivities beyond the PEP class. 
The fact is that personal attention given to nursing 
home residents during the PEP was not controlled for 
among the experimental groups, and this constituted 
a limitation of the present study. In the future study, 


a nursing student could be assigned to sit with and visit 
nursing home residents for the same period that the 
PEP group gets their exercise program. 

In conclusion, the eight-week PEP is effective in reliev- 
ing pain and improving certain psychological functions 
for older residents of nursing homes. The authors com- 
pared the physical mobility between the two groups af- 
ter the PEP and found that 
the PEP group had 
a signiﬁcant improvement in the range of motion of 
common painful joints. 
By learning and self-practicing the physical exer- 
cises learned in the PEP, older residents persons are 
more likely to have their pain reduced, their psycho- 
logical well-being enhanced, and their joint mobility 
improved to perform daily activities as well as a better 
quality of life in the long run.
