Background and Objectives: To examine the primary and secondary outcomes of a theory-driven group bereavement inter- 
vention for widowed older adults through a cluster-randomized controlled trial. 
Research Designs and Methods: Twelve community centers providing health and social services for elderly people were 
randomly assigned to the experimental condition, the dual-process bereavement group intervention-Chinese (DPBGI-C) 
and to the control condition, the loss-oriented bereavement group intervention-Chinese (LOBGI-C). Both interventions 
comprised weekly, 2-hr sessions for 7 weeks followed by a 4-hr outing in the eighth week. Of 215 widowed older adults 
contacted and assessed, 125 eligible participants were interviewed three times—preintervention, postintervention, and at a 
16-week follow-up—to assess complicated grief symptoms, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and social support. 
Results: Using intention-to-treat analysis, both interventions produced improvements in grief, depression, and social sup- 
port, but effect sizes were larger with the DPBGI-C. The participants in the DPBGI-C condition also reported reduced anx- 
iety, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness, whereas those in the LOBGI-C condition did not. There were interactions 
between intervention type and time with respect to grief, anxiety, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness. 
Discussion and Implications: Although traditional LOBGI-C can help to reduce grief and depression in bereaved older 
adults, the DPBGI-C was found to be superior as it had a greater and more extensive impact on outcomes. This is the first 
study of the effectiveness of this evidence-based, theory-driven intervention for widowed Chinese older adults and has 
implications for theory building and practice. 

Widowhood is a common life experience for older people. 
In Hong Kong, about one in two women aged 65 years or 
older is widowed; the ratio is lower for men, at 1 in 10 
(Census and Statistics Department, 2017). Most bereaved 
people come to terms with their loss without formal inter- 
vention, but recent research suggests that about 20%–30% 
of bereaved persons need some additional support and 
approximately 10% are at risk of persistent grief issues 
and require professional bereavement intervention (Aoun 
et al., 2015; Bonanno, Wortman, & Nesse, 2004). The 
Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th 
edition, American Psychiatric Association, 2013) proposed 
a bereavement-related disorder to be called “persistent 
complex bereavement disorder” in an appendix entitled 






“Conditions for Further Study,” but it is not yet a recognized 
diagnosis. Similarly, it has been proposed that the upcom- 
ing ICD-11 should include a new disorder identified as pro- 
longed grief disorder (PGD; Maercker et al., 2013). Recent 
studies suggest that approximately 7%–10% of bereaved 
people experience PGD (Kersting, Brähler, Glaesmer, & 
Wagner, 2011), with the prevalence being 14% among the 
Chinese population (Li & Prigerson, 2016). Older adults 
(variably defined as being from 55 to 65 years and older) 
are more likely to suffer from PGD than younger adults, 
with estimated rates of 9%–25% (Simon, 2015). 
Bereaved older adults are at greater risk of emotional, 
mental, and physical health problems if they are socially 
isolated (Perng & Renz, 2018). Their poor health out- 
comes may be linked to a reduction in self-care abilities 
or loss of motivation to live in the absence of their spouse. 
The normal-aged related deterioration of daily functions 
is believed to make widowed older adults more vulner- 
able than their younger counterparts. In later life, loss of a 
spouse means the loss of a life companion and confidante. 
The diminishing number of children per couple, increas- 
ing childlessness (Cheng, Chan, Li, & Leung, 2014), and 
the great geographic mobility of adult children means that 
familial support for older adults is weakening, thus they are 
increasingly reliant on a spouse and this makes conjugal 
bereavement in later life more challenging. The diminishing 
of familial support also affects bereaved older adults. People 
who are widowed in old age are more likely to experience 
loneliness than their married peers (Dahlberg, Agahi, & 
Lennartsson, 2018), yet loneliness is rarely measured as an 
outcome of bereavement interventions (Currier, Neimeyer, 
& Berman, 2008). Loneliness was found to be a common 
challenge for bereaved older adults, but those who had 
greater social support from friends were less affected (Utz, 
Swenson, Caserta, Lund, & de Vries, 2014). Researchers 
have argued that recent social and economic developments 
in China have increased the likelihood of loneliness (Chen, 
Hicks, & While, 2014), and Chinese older adults who grew 
up in the traditional family-oriented culture find loneli- 
ness more devastating than their Western peers (Goodwin, 
Cook, & Yung, 2001). Weiss (1973) suggested that two 
types of loneliness could be distinguished: emotional lone- 
liness and social emotional loneliness. The former refers to 
the absence of a significant other or someone to whom one 
has an emotional attachment whereas the latter refers to 
the absence of a sense of belonging to a social network. 
Similarly, Utz and colleagues (2014) differentiated between 
“feeling alone” and “being alone.” 
Bereaved older adults are forced to confront new 
demands for adjustment from the world whilst dealing 
with separation distress following the loss of their spouse. 
Hahn, Cichy, Small, and Almeida (2014) found that wid- 
owed older adults have reduced resilience in the face of 
problems of everyday life and more physical symptoms in 
response to home-related stressors than before the death 
of spouse. Traditional bereavement interventions that 
emphasize psychological needs might not address the multi- 
dimensional needs of bereaved persons, including support 
to cope with daily tasks. 
In recent decades, various types of intervention have 
been developed to ease the possible adverse consequences 
of bereavement (e.g., normal or complicated grief, depres- 
sion, symptom distress) and facilitate positive adjustment 
(e.g., improve coping, social adjustment, quality of life) 
(see reviews by Neimeyer & Currier, 2009; Waller et al., 
2016; Wittouck, Van Autreve, De Jaegere, Portzky, & van 
Heeringen, 2011). The studies have examined a range of 
therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, support- 
ive therapy, family-focused grief therapy, and interpersonal 
psychotherapy (Waller et al., 2016). There is considerable 
variability in the focus and effectiveness of the different 
interventions. First, the efficacy of grief and bereavement 
interventions varies according to level of need and cir- 
cumstances surrounding the death (Boelen, 2016; Schut & 
Stroebe, 2005). For example, in individuals who are griev- 
ing normally, grief interventions may actually interfere 
with the natural grief process and result in greater distress 
(Schut & Stroebe, 2005). Interventions aimed at treating 
bereaved people with severe grief symptoms have had posi- 
tive outcomes (Neimeyer & Currier, 2009). Second, meta- 
analyses of the efficacy of bereavement interventions have 
consistently shown that their effects are modest or minimal 
(Currier et al., 2008; Neimeyer & Currier, 2009; Wittouck 
et al., 2011), comparing with that of general psychother- 
apy. This indicates the need for development of an effective 
psychosocial bereavement intervention. 
Third, according to Waller et al. (2016), few of the stud- 
ies of bereavement interventions published between 2000 
and 2013 were of high methodological quality. These 
identified studies, which were mainly on individual-based 
interventions, were different in nature, and showed mixed 
results. Since then, newer randomized controlled trials of 
grief-specific cognitive behavioral interventions (Bryant 
et al., 2014; Rosner, Pfoh, Kotoučov, & Hagl, 2014; Shear 
et al., 2014) and internet-based interventions (Eisma et al., 
2015; Litz et al., 2014) have produced more promising 
results in diverse settings and populations. In particular, 
Shear et al. (2014) and Nam (2016) found differences in the 
grief reactions and adjustment of older adults assigned to 
a complicated grief treatment and those assigned to inter- 
personal psychotherapy or supportive counseling; however, 
only 51% of the intervention group responded to treatment 
(Shear et al., 2014). Other potential limitations of previous 
intervention studies are the considerable heterogeneity of 
the samples (e.g., diversity in the loss of relationship, cause 
of death and bereavement period) and the fact that most 
have been developed and validated in Western countries. 
The extant evidence suggests that very few bereavement 
interventions have any effect and those that do are all indi- 
vidual-based, but not group, interventions. Although grief 
is a personal process it is affected by social context. In par- 
ticular, loneliness is a major challenge for those bereaved in 



later life (Tang & Chow, 2017). Supiano and Luptak (2014) 
found that a group bereavement intervention including 
complicated grief treatment was as successful at addressing 
grief symptoms and was more time-efficient as the same 
intervention delivered collectively. They further suggested 
that group format might be beneficial in that they offer a 
supportive environment and reduce social isolation, which 
is particularly common in older adults. Overall, there has 
been limited systematic research into group delivery of 
bereavement interventions and most of the studies have 
only examined grief and depression, not loneliness, social 
support or anxiety. This study was a randomized controlled 
trial of a theory-driven, group bereavement intervention, 
examining a wider range of outcomes. 
Theoretical Framework: The Dual-Process 
Model 
Stroebe and Schut (1999, 2015) introduced a dual-process 
model of coping with bereavement that consists of three 
elements: loss-oriented coping, restoration-oriented coping, 
and oscillation. Loss-oriented coping involves dealing with 
the loss experience. It includes grief work, or more generally 
the appraising and processing of all the various aspects of 
the loss experience. Restoration-oriented coping addresses 
the life changes which may arise from bereavement, includ- 
ing adjustment to new roles, identities and relationships, 
and new experiences. Oscillation refers to the inevitable 
alternation between loss- and restoration-oriented coping 
processes. Dynamic back-and-forth movement between 
these two modes of coping predicts better mental and phys- 
ical health outcomes in the bereaved. 
In a departure from conventional bereavement inter- 
ventions, which are loss-oriented and focus solely on sep- 
aration distress, the American coauthors (M.C. and D.L.) 
have paid extra attention to the handling of adjustment to 
life without the deceased (Caserta, Utz, Lund, Swenson, & 
de Vries, 2014; Caserta, Lund, Utz, & Tabler, 2016; Lund, 
Caserta, Utz, & de Vries, 2010). A dual-process bereave- 
ment group intervention (DPBGI) was developed and tested 
systematically. A novel feature of the intervention was that 
oscillations between restoration-oriented and loss-oriented 
coping were incorporated into the design of the intervention 
(Caserta et al., 2016; Lund et al., 2010). The intervention 
placed equal emphasis on loss- and restoration-oriented 
coping and was delivered as a group intervention to facili- 
tate mutual learning about restoration-oriented coping. 
This intervention was used as a model for the intervention 
described and evaluated here. 
Although the expression of grief appears to be similar 
in Western and Chinese cultures (Li & Prigerson, 2016), 
there are sociocultural differences in the grieving pro- 
cess (Bonanno, Papa, Lalande, Zhang, & Noll, 2005). In 
particular, Chen and colleagues (2017) found that dual- 
process model, which was developed in Western coun- 
tries, captured the overall coping mechanisms of Chinese 
bereaved mothers effectively. Yet at a micro level, cultural 
factors should be taken into account when exploring the 
nuanced meanings embedded in the emotional and behav- 
ioral coping process. The content of restoration-oriented 
coping in America that dealt with financial and legal issues 
as well as social participation were not relevant to Hong 
Kong Chinese situation as Chinese people rarely discuss 
their financial situation with others. Chinese people tend 
to be concerned about their health, particularly after the 
death of a spouse, thus the themes of health-related topics 
were added. The themes of attending to life changes and 
household chores in the American model were kept as they 
were universal. Moreover, rituals were usually used in the 
Chinese funerals or bereavement groups for expressing 
emotions in a structured way. A commonly used letting- 
go ritual was included in the Chinese model. The partici- 
pants released fishes into the wild, symbolizing the letting 
go of pain and suffering attached to the bereavement. The 
Taoist philosophy considers releasing animals into the wild 
to be doing a good deed for the deceased. The length of 
the intervention was reduced to eight sessions. The con- 
tent was also reorganized and the between-session oscilla- 
tions were replaced by within-group oscillations from the 
third to sixth session. Lastly, as Chinese people are prag- 
matic, the last session included some practical cooking, to 
help participants start putting what they had learnt about 
nutrition and self-care into practice. The DPBGI-Chinese 
(DPBGI-C) group faithfully kept the oscillations between 
the loss-oriented and restoration-oriented coping, which is 
the core essence of the model, though the length and part of 
the content were slightly different from the American one. 
The themes of loss-oriented coping in the American model 
were also straightly followed. The DPBGI-C has already 
been piloted in a sample of older Chinese adults in Hong 
Kong and was found to be promising (Chow, 2015). 
Based on the pilot study of the DPBGI-C, we hypoth- 
esized that at the end of the intervention and at a 16-week 
follow-up, the DPBGI-C participants would exhibit 
greater improvements in both the primary outcomes, grief 
reactions, anxiety and depression and the secondary out- 
comes, loneliness and social support, than loss-oriented 
bereavement group 
(LOBGI-C) 
participants. 


Research Design 
The study was a single-blind cluster randomized controlled 
trial with two arms. Cluster randomization randomizes 
centers instead of individuals: all the people from a given 
center are allocated to the same condition (Meurer & 
Lewis, 2015). This method was used to avoid contamin- 
ation of experimental and control group participants at the 
same study sites. It was also administratively efficient as it 
was easier to recruit adequate participants for one group 
than for two groups. 

 


The experimental intervention incorporated restoration- 
oriented and loss-oriented components as well as oscilla- 
tions (i.e., DPBGI-C), whereas the control intervention was 
a conventional loss-oriented intervention (LOBGI-C) com- 
prising the loss-oriented component only, which is typical 
of the standard of care in community-based bereavement 
support groups. Both interventions involved weekly ses- 
sions over a period of 8 weeks, thus the “quantity” of inter- 
vention was the same in both conditions. Participants in 
both conditions were assessed at three points (preinterven- 
tion, postintervention, and 16-week follow-up) by trained 
interviewers. 

Older adults (60 years or older) whose spouse had died 
within the previous 2 years were recruited. As Neimeyer 
and Currier (2009) suggested that it is more appropriate 
to offer bereavement intervention to those showing intense 
separation distress after their loss, we only recruited people 
who scored with relatively high scores on a measure of com- 
plicated grief (i.e., > 22 on the Inventory of Complicated 
Grief). The exclusion criteria were loss of a child or parent 
in the previous 2 years, remarriage since the bereavement, 
residence in a long-term care facility, receipt of psychiatric 
treatment before the death of the spouse (excluding treat- 
ment for reactive depression), and impaired mental func- 
tion sufficient to affect participation in interviews. 
Participants were recruited from two types of study site: 
medical service units (hospitals and geriatric clinics) and 
social service units (district counseling and social centers 
for elderly people). Study sites were stratified by nature and 
type of service and randomized to the experimental and 
control conditions in order to reduce biases due to differ- 
ences in setting and service type. 

Twelve study sites participated: nine social service units and 
three medical service units. As a number of service centers 
declined to participate some types of referral source were 
underrepresented. One of the centers that agreed to partici- 
pate did not succeed in recruiting enough participants to 
run a bereavement group. As the randomization of groups 
was carried out independently for each center, there was 
no guarantee that the size of the control and experimental 
groups would be similar. Seven centers were assigned to 
the intervention condition and five to the control condition 
and the number of participants in the two conditions was 
also uneven. 
Staff at the study sites invited widowed older adults who 
fulfilled the inclusion criteria to participate in the study. 
Upon completion of the study all participants, received 
HK$300 for participating. The University of Hong Kong/ 
Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster Institutional 
Review Board and the Kowloon West Cluster Research 
Ethics Committee approved the study (Reference Numbers: 
UW 13–338 and KW/EX-14–167 [79-05]). All participants 
provided written consent before taking part in the study. 

The experimental and control interventions both consisted 
of eight sessions. The theme of each session is shown in 
Table 1. The DPBGI-C integrated new cultural elements 
into the original DPBGI. For example, dietary concerns and 
Chinese ideas about health were added as restoration topics 
and the therapeutic ritual of freeing of fish was introduced 
in the last session. In addition, participants’ knowledge of 
cooking and nutrition was tested through shared prepar- 
ation of a meal in the final session of the DPBGI-C. These 
modifications were intended to promote a continuing bond,

Primary Outcomes 
Grief reactions were measured with the Chinese Inventory 
of Complicated Grief which comprises 19 items on grief 
symptoms relating to spousal loss. In a sample of older 
adults, the Chinese version had an internal reliability of 
Cronbach’s α = .92 (Chow & Fu, 2010). 
Emotional reactions in the form of depression and anx- 
iety symptoms were measured with the Chinese version of the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Leung, Wing, 
Kwong, Lo, & Shum, 1999). Half of its 14 items measure 
anxiety and the other half measure depression. Cronbach’s α 
for the full Chinese-Cantonese version was .86; values for the 
depression and anxiety subscales were .82 and .77, respectively. 
Secondary Outcomes 
Loneliness was conceptualized in terms of two dimensions 
(i.e., emotional and social loneliness) and measured with 
the seven-item Chinese version of the De Jong Gierveld 
Loneliness Scale (Leung, de Jong Gierveld, & Lam, 2008). 
The reliability of the scale ranged from .80 to .90. 
Social support was measured with the Inventory of 
Social Support (ISS; Hogan & Schmidt, 2002), which is 
designed to measure perceived social support following a 
loss. Comprising five items to which responses are given 
using a five-point Likert scale, the ISS has been shown to be 
internally consistent (α = .76). 

Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24.0 software on the 
basis of intention-to-treat. In other words, all 125 partici- 
pants who consent to participate, met the inclusion criteria 
and were allocated to one of the conditions at baseline were 
included in the analysis, regardless of subsequent attendance 
at intervention sessions (Armijo-Olivo, Warren, & Magee, 
2009; McCoy, 2017). Missing data were handled by mul- 
tiple imputation with fully conditional specification. Since 
19.2% participants had missing data, 20 imputations (and 
50 iterations) were conducted (White, Royston, & Wood, 
2011). Background variables (i.e., participants’ age, gender, 
education level, cause of bereavement, time since bereave- 
ment, and age of the deceased) and behavioral variables (i.e., 
grief, anxiety, depression, social and emotional loneliness and 
perceived social support at all three time-points) were entered 
into the model used to estimate the missing data. We then 
used paired t tests to compare baseline values with postint- 
ervention and follow-up values to assess the direct changes 
and long-term effects of both interventions. Pooled means 
and standardized deviations were used to compute the effect 
sizes of differences in Cohen’s d between the conditions for 
repeated measures (Morris, 2008) (values of Cohen’s d < 
0.33 indicates small group differences, values between 0.33 
and 0.55 indicates moderate differences and values > 0.55 
large differences; Lipsey & Wilson, 1993). Next, a linear 
a cultural feature that is important to bereaved Chinese 
people (Chow & Chan, 2006; Fong & Chow, 2018). 
Two user manuals and two facilitator manuals were 
produced for DPBGI-C and LOBGI-C, respectively. 
Groups in both conditions were led by experienced 
bereavement counselors who were mentored and super- 
vised by the first author (A.Y.M.C.). Group leaders were 
supported by an assistant facilitator from the center 
which had recruited the participants so that someone was 
available to handle any adverse or unexpected partici- 
pant reactions. 

Two hundred and fifteen older adults provided verbal 
consent to participation in the study. Nine changed their 
mind after they had been contacted by the researcher. 
The ICG scores of 167 potential participants met the 
inclusion criterion. Fourteen eligible participants did 
not receive the intervention due to health issues or unex- 
pected family demands, such as caring for grandchildren 
following the resignation of the family’s domestic help- 
ers. In the end, 125 participants received the group inter- 
vention (11 DPBGI-C groups and six LOBGI-C groups) 
(Figure 1). The combined exclusion and dropout rate 
was similar for the DPBGI-C and LOBGI-C conditions, 
at 40% and 45%, respectively. Participant characteris- 
tics are shown in Table 2. There were no demographic 
or baseline differences in the primary and secondary 
outcomes between participants in the experimental and 
control conditions.

mixed model was used to examine the longitudinal inter- 
vention effects. The model included one categorical random 
effect (Participant), one categorical fixed effect (Condition: 
DPBGI-C vs LOBGI-C), one ordinal fixed effect (Time: base- 
line vs post-test vs 16-week follow-up), and the Condition × 
Time interaction. Pooled results of F test by the fixed effect of 
Condition × Time estimated the difference of effects between 
the two intervention methods. Finally, we compared the mag- 
nitude of the two interventions by calculating the changes in 
score between baseline and the post-treatment and follow-up 
assessments for both conditions and assessing the difference 
between the conditions using a one-sided, two-sample t test. 
The sample of 101 participants who completed the three 
time points of data collection (i.e., nonimputed data) was 
included to evaluate the intervention effects in terms of 
changes within the group over time and difference between 
the changes of groups over time. 

Primary Outcomes 
The intention-to-treat analysis showed that participants 
in both groups had lower levels of grief reaction and 
depression at the postintervention and follow-up assess- 
ments (Table 3). Effect sizes for changes in all primary 
outcome variables were higher for the DPBGI-C than 
the LOBGI-C, with the exception of grief at follow- 
up. Only the DPBGI-C produced a reduction in anx- 
iety. There were Condition × Time effects for both grief 
(F (2, 123) = 3.37, p < .05) and anxiety (F (2, 123) = 3.39, 
p < .05). 
The effect sizes for differences of the two groups in 
change scores at postintervention and follow-up are 
reported in Table 4. At the postintervention assessment, 
DPBGI-C was found to have statistically significant bet- 
ter results than the LOBGI-C with moderate effective 
sizes (Cohen’s d ranged from 0.35 to 0.56) in all three 
primary outcome variables. At follow-up assessment, 
DPBGI-C still had a statistical significant improvement 
in anxiety than LOBGI-C, with a moderate effect size 
(d = 0.41). 
The findings were similar when only the nonimputed 
data (N = 101) were analyzed. Thus, our first hypothesis, 
that the DPBGI-C would produce a greater improvement 
in the primary outcome variables than the LOBGI-C, was 
supported.

DPBGI-C participants also experienced reductions in emo- 
tional and social loneliness, but LOBGI-C participants did 
not (Table 3). There was a Condition × Time interaction for 
both types of loneliness. LOBGI-C participants reported 
higher levels of social support after the intervention, but the 
change was smaller at the follow-up assessment, whereas 
DPBGI-C participants reported a larger increase in social 
support, which was sustained at follow-up. 
The reduction in loneliness was greater in the DPBGI-C 
condition than the LOBGI-C condition (Table 4). The effect 
sizes for the differences between two groups in emotional 
and social loneliness at postintervention were d = 0.39 and 
d = 0.50 respectively. The effect size for the difference in 
emotional loneliness increased to 0.63 at the follow-up 
assessment. 
Analysis of the nonimputed data produced similar 
results with respect to the between- and within-condition 
comparisons. In summary, the second hypothesis, that the 
DPBGI-C would produce a greater improvement in second- 
ary outcomes than the LOBGI-C, was also supported. 
The results of this trial show that DPBGI-C was statistic- 
ally superior to the traditional LOBGI-C in reducing grief, 
anxiety, and loneliness in widowed older adults. Although 
the two interventions had the same (group) format and 
similar levels of input, the DPBGI-C also proved superior 
as a method of increasing participants’ perception of the 
social support available to them. Currier and colleagues 
(2008) concluded from an analysis of 61 outcome studies 
of bereavement interventions that universal intervention 
(for everyone) generally had no effect. There were only 
mild effects for selective intervention (to high-risk groups) 
or moderately large effect for indicated (to bereaved people 
experiencing high distress) intervention. In contrast, both 
interventions used in this study produced much higher 
effect sizes in grief reduction relative to baseline, as shown 
in Table 3. Similarly, both interventions also produced 
reductions in depression that were of higher magnitude 
than the reductions in the indicated interventions found in 
the review of Currier et al. (2008). The reduction of depres- 
sion in the DPBGI-C was found to be much larger than 

 
 
 
 


the LOBGI-C. The LOBGI-C focused on loss, whereas only 
half the content of the DPBGI-C did so. It appears that 
the restoration-oriented content included the DPBGI-C 
provided additional benefits, which supports the idea that 
restoration-oriented coping processes contribute crucially 
to adjustment to bereavement (Stroebe et al., 1999, 2010). 
Furthermore, the findings of our trial are consistent with 
those relating to use of the original DPBGI in the United 
States. The original DPBGI was found to contribute to 
changes in grief and depression (Utz, Caserta, & Lund, 
2013), but its effects were similar to those of a traditional 
grief intervention. In contrast, our version of the DPBGI-C 
did produce greater changes in grief than the traditional 
intervention with which it was compared, indicating that 
the feasibility and effectiveness of a bereavement care may 
be improved by cultural adaptation. 
The DPBGI-C reduced anxiety relative to baseline 
both immediately after the 8-week intervention and at the 
16-week follow-up, whereas the LOBGI-C did not affect 
anxiety. As the restoration-oriented topics included guid- 
ance on practical coping strategies such as building social 
relationships, following a healthy diet and taking care 
of one’s health, it is plausible to suggest that such prac- 
tical coping strategies account for the reduction in anx- 
iety observed following the DPBGI-C, particularly anxiety 
related to the challenges of facing life without the deceased. 
These postintervention effect sizes of changes in bereave- 
ment outcomes were similar to the recent finding of com- 
paring complicated grief treatment with interpersonal 
psychotherapy (Glickman, Shear, & Wall, 2016). 
The within group effects of the interventions were 
smaller at the follow-up assessment than immediately after 
the intervention, but still detectable. Again, our results are 
better than those reported in the meta-analyses of the long- 
term effects of indicated intervention (Currier et al., 2008). 
For between group analyses, the effect sizes in grief and 
depression at the postintervention assessment were greater 
than the average effect sizes reported for bereavement inter- 
ventions in the earlier meta-analysis (Currier et al., 2008). 
Although the between-condition differences were not stat- 
istically significant at the follow-up assessment, they were 
still greater in absolute terms than the comparable dif- 
ferences calculated in the meta-analysis, which were also 
statistically nonsignificant (Currier et al., 2008). Notably, 
the between-group differences in the meta-analysis relate 
to comparisons of an intervention with a no-intervention 
condition (a waiting-list control group or placebo). We 
compared our novel intervention with a traditional, grief- 
focused intervention and had therefore anticipated that 
effect sizes would be much lower than in studies comparing 
an intervention group with a no-treatment group. 
This study investigated the impact of bereavement inter- 
ventions on loneliness, a facet of bereavement that has gen- 
erally been ignored in earlier intervention studies (Nam, 
2016; Shear et al., 2014; Supiano & Luptak, 2014). The 
superior effect of the DPBGI-C on loneliness is a surprising 
result. Both interventions were delivered in a very similar 
format—over eight sessions, with groups of similar sizes. 
All the groups were facilitated by social workers with simi- 
lar professional experience. There were also no differences 
between the backgrounds of participants receiving the two 
interventions. Therefore the difference in the content of 
the two group interventions probably explains their dif- 
ferential effects on loneliness and perceived support. The 
loss-orientation of the LOBGI-C may draw participants’ 
attention to their unique relationship with their deceased 
spouse and is a more personal and internal process. In com- 
parison, half of the time in the DPBGI-C is spent on res- 
toration-oriented topics, which are more external and are 
shared among the participants. We suggest that discover- 
ing common experiences and sharing restoration-oriented 
coping processes helps to create a social support network 
among a group receiving the DPBGI-C, as well as reduces 
the loneliness. The LOBGI-C focused on the relationship 
with the deceased. It is likely that simply sharing and think- 
ing about the deceased without also working on restora- 
tion-oriented coping fails to address a bereaved person’s 
yearning and has no effect on emotional loneliness. Only 
the DPBGI-C reduced social loneliness and the reduction 
was not maintained at follow-up. As the postintervention 
evaluation took place a week after the eight consecutive 
weekly meetings that comprised the interventions, the tem- 
porary reduction in social loneliness might reflect group 
members’ sense of being part of a social network. As there 
was no further contact among group members between the 
postintervention and follow-up, this sense of being part of 
a social network may have dissipated fairly quickly, lead- 
ing to a rebound in social loneliness, although in descrip- 
tive terms social loneliness was still lower at the follow-up 
assessment than at baseline. 
This study has limitations. One would expect the deci- 
sion by a number of service centers not to participate in 
the study, the unequal number of intervention and con- 
trol groups, and participant drop-out to have affected the 
findings. However, there were no demographic or base- 
line differences between participants assigned to the two 
conditions. Similarly, comparison of outcome measures in 
the intention-to-treat and completed intervention analyses 
revealed no differences. Thus, it appears that the impact 
of these limitations was not as great as might have been 
expected. It took an unexpectedly long time to recruit 
adequate numbers of participants. All study participants 
were widowed older Chinese adults and the majority of the 
sample was women. We used stringent selection criteria, 
including only those who reported high levels of grief and 
had not lost another significant family member in the pre- 
vious 2 years. Consequently, any generalization of the find- 
ings to other bereaved populations should be made with 
caution. 
A more rigorous study design would have included a 
waiting-list control condition in addition to the two condi- 
tions compared here, but this was precluded by concerns 



that it would be unethical to place participants—especially 
those display high levels of grief—on a waiting list for at 
least 16 weeks, until all data had been collected from the 
intervention groups. Ideally, another arm of comparison 
with the original DPBGI will offer more insights about 
the suitability of the translation. As this study is hoped to 
provide evidence of effective bereavement intervention to 
Chinese widowed persons, the commonly-used approach 
in Chinese bereaved population was adopted instead. In 
addition the centers would have refused to take part in 
the study if it had included a 16-week waiting-list control 
condition. Assessment after longer follow-up period would 
reveal more information. The RCT study of treatment of 
complicated grief in elderly persons by Shear et al.’s (2014) 
randomized controlled trial of a 16-week intervention 
used a 20-week follow-up and Bryant et al. (2014) used a 
26-week follow-up when assessing a 14-week intervention. 
Our use of a 16-week follow-up period for an 8-week inter- 
vention is in line with practice in other studies. 
Despite these limitations, our study addresses a sig- 
nificant gap in the bereavement intervention literature. It 
is a good example of the development of a theoretically- 
grounded intervention and subsequent rigorous testing 
via a randomized controlled trial using a traditional inter- 
vention as the control treatment. The experimental inter- 
vention is a scrupulous cultural adaptation of a model 
developed in the West. Klass and Chow (2011) argued that 
culture prescribes acceptable grief and affects how grief is 
handled; nevertheless, here we have reported the successful 
cultural translation of a bereavement intervention. 
This study advances bereavement research methodology 
in several ways. First, it extends the common outcomes of 
grief and depression to include anxiety, loneliness and social 
support. Second, the control condition involved a commonly- 
used bereavement-specific group intervention (i.e., treatment 
as usual) of similar duration to the experimental interven- 
tion, whereas most previous studies of the efficacy of group 
bereavement interventions used waiting-list controls or non- 
compatible control group interventions. Although a review 
by Neimeyer and Currier (2009) noted the existence of a 
very small population who experience “treatment-induced 
distress,” a review by Waller et al. (2016) did not find any 
group intervention that produced worse outcomes than a 
no-intervention condition. Still, the inclusion of the com- 
monly adopted intervention is more ethically appropriate. 
Third, as Neimeyer and Currier (2009) concluded that 
bereavement interventions have the greatest impact on 
those showing the most distress; we offered our interven- 
tions as indicated interventions rather than as universal 
interventions. This is in line with the suggestion that poten- 
tial users of bereavement service services should be screened 
(Aoun, Rumbold, Howting, Bolleter, & Breen, 2017) and 
may partly explain why we observed bigger effects than Utz 
et al. (2014). Moreover, we carried out both intention-to- 
treat and completed intervention analyses and found that 
the results were comparable. 
This study provides empirical support for the dual-process 
model of bereavement. It also sheds light on intervention 
“dosage,” particularly in relation to loss-oriented coping tech- 
niques. Although the loss-oriented component of the DPBGI-C 
took up only half the time of the LOBGI-C (which focused 
exclusively on loss-oriented techniques), it produced greater 
reductions in grief, depression, and loneliness in DPBGI-C, 
leading to the somewhat surprising conclusion that in this 
context, less is more. The introduction of restoration-oriented 
components apparently played a crucial role in reducing 
anxiety and emotional loneliness in DPBGI-C participants. 
Further analyses will be undertaken to explore the mechanism 
underlying the changes induced by the intervention. 
The practical contribution of this study is that it demon- 
strates the effectiveness of a group bereavement intervention, 
complementing existing evidence of the effectiveness of one- 
to-one complicated grief treatment (Shear et al., 2014, 2016) 
and cognitive behavioral therapy (Bryant et al., 2014). This 
study showed that the DPBGI-C is effective for bereaved 
older Chinese adults experiencing particular difficulty in 
coping with their loss. The better result might be partially 
attributed to the collective nature of Chinese, which might 
not be totally applicable to participants of other cultures 
who favor individualism. Nevertheless, this group alter- 
native may involve less input of professional resources for 
each bereaved person, yet achieve the same, if not a better, 
outcome. The group format is more resource-efficient than 
one-to-one treatment and provides added value, as group 
members form a social support network and realize that oth- 
ers share some of their experiences and feelings. Moreover, 
because manuals have been produced for the DPBGI-C it 
should be possible for others to deliver the intervention. 

Based on systematic analysis of the evidence collected we 
conclude that the DPBGI-C is more effective than trad- 
itional bereavement group interventions. Added to the 
limited efficacy studies of bereavement intervention for 
bereaved persons developed in the West, this study contrib- 
utes evidence of bereavement intervention effectiveness for 
Chinese bereaved persons. The adoption of the dual-process 
model as the theoretical framework also allowed us to shed 
light on the role of restoration in bereavement interventions.
