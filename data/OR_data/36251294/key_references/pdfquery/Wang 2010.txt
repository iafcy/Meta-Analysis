This study assessed the feasibility of a yoga intervention to improve 
the mental and physical well-being of older adults. Convenience 
sampling was used to recruit 18 older adults living in a low-income 
housing complex. Utilizing a classical experimental design, the 
participants were assigned to either a yoga group or a socialization 
group; both met twice a week for an hour for four weeks. Results 
showed that although there is inconclusive evidence to demonstrate 
that the yoga intervention was superior to the socialization group 
in improving mental and physical health, yoga could provide some 
beneﬁt for older adults.

The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a yoga intervention 
to improve the mental and physical well-being of older adults. The practice 
of yoga is holistic because it can help address issues of the body, mind, and 
spirit. In addition to the physical beneﬁts of the practice of yoga, philosoph- 
ical teachings, meditation, introspection, and self-study may stimulate the 
mind and increase hope, thereby reducing anxiety and helping to prevent 
or reduce the chance of depression. If an older adult can improve his or her 
physical functioning, it may increase not only his or her mental well-being 
but also his or her capacity for independent living. Regular physical activity

can postpone disability and decrease morbidity and mortality, thus poten- 
tially counterbalancing some of the negative effects associated with aging 
(Lautenschlager, Almeida, Flicker, & Janca, 2004). 
Yoga’s self-regulatory approach (Singh, 2006) is congruent with the 
strengths-based perspective in social work, which focuses on the individ- 
ual’s own strengths and capacities. Yoga encourages the individual to take 
responsibility for his or her own care, possibly reducing the dependence on 
a physician or the use of medication (Singh, 2006). Furthermore, yoga con- 
nects to and strengthens parts of the self that lead to greater contentment. 
One of the principle philosophies of yoga is that everything that one needs 
psychologically and spiritually comes from within. The yogic philosophies 
encourage persons to look within themselves for their own happiness, rather 
than looking for external means of gratiﬁcation. 
Many of the studies that examine yoga as an intervention address the 
physical and mental health conditions that affect the older adult population, 
for example, depression, anxiety, stress, and low blood pressure; however, 
only eight studies speciﬁcally targeted older adults (Brown, Koziol, & Lotz, 
2008; Chen et al., 2008; Chen & Tseng, 2008; Chen, Tseng, Ting, & Huang, 
2007; Haber, 1983; Krishnamurthy & Telles, 2007; Lee, 2006; Oken et al., 
2006). Of these studies, only two used a control and/or comparison group 
(Krishnamurthy & Telles, 2007; Oken et al., 2006). With the exceptions of 
Krishnamurthy and Telles (2007), who looked speciﬁcally at depression, and 
Oken et al. (2006), who examined cognition and quality of life, there are 
no studies that included a mental health–related outcome in older adults. 
Although the study conducted by Krishnamurthy and Telles (2007) showed 
positive results for yoga reducing depression in a controlled study, these 
ﬁndings may be limited to their study population, which was older Indian 
persons living in a residential facility in India. Pilkington, Kirkwood, Rampes, 
and Richardson (2005) found in their systematic literature review that none 
of the studies examining yoga as an intervention for depression included 
participants older than age 50. Thus, there are no studies looking at yoga as 
an intervention for depression in older adults except for older persons living 
in a residential facility in India. 


This study followed a pretest–posttest control-group design with a random 
assignment of older adults to either a yoga intervention or a socialization 
comparison group. The entire intervention was conducted on three separate 
occasions and occurred at a Section 202 US Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD) 60-unit low-income senior housing building in 


a suburban area of Philadelphia. The data were collected on-site at the 
senior housing building by a nurse practitioner on three separate occasions 
(October 2007, January 2008, and March 2008). 
The target population was adults age 60 and older who live indepen- 
dently in the community. The goal was to test yoga as an intervention in the 
general older adult population, rather than in a population with a speciﬁed 
illness or condition, in order to include as many participants as possible. 
The study population was the residents of the low-income housing build- 
ing as well as their friends and/or family. A senior housing building was 
selected to minimize the difﬁculty of transportation and inconvenience for 
the participants. Individuals were ineligible if they were bedbound, age 59 
or younger, currently participating in a yoga program, or unable to follow 
verbal commands in English. 
This study utilized convenience sampling. Recruitment began with post- 
ing and distributing ﬂyers to each resident, holding informational sessions, 
and the researcher attending the building’s social and community events. 
The building social worker and building manager also helped promote 
awareness through word of mouth. Recruitment was considered exhausted 
after each eligible resident was contacted personally either by the researcher 
or the building social worker. If the resident expressed interest in participat- 
ing, she or he was instructed to show up during the enrollment period. 
The housing complex had 65 residents at the time of the study, 51 of 
whom were eligible. Of the 51 eligible residents, 18 (33.3%) enrolled in the 
study. All (100%) of the potential participants that were screened met the 
eligibility criteria. The sample contained a total of 18 participants, with 8 
assigned to the yoga group and 10 assigned to the social group. 

The participants assigned to the yoga group were asked to participate in 
eight yoga sessions, which were held twice a week for four weeks. Each 
session lasted 1 hour and consisted of 45 minutes of posturing and breathing 
and 15 minutes of relaxation and teachings. The yoga intervention was held 
on-site at the housing building. A treatment manual that was created for the 
implementation of the intervention was developed in consultation with a 
nurse practitioner, a registered yoga teacher (RYT) experienced in teaching 
classes to older adults, and an exercise physiologist. 
The participants who were assigned to the socialization comparison 
group attended hour-long sessions twice a week for four weeks where they 
were shown movies that were administered by the researcher. The partic- 
ipants in the socialization group were asked to continue with their daily 
routines and activities, to not participate in yoga classes, and to not discuss 
any of the parts of the intervention with the experimental group. 




Depression was assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological 
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), which has been widely used in stud- 
ies of depression in later life. The CES-D has a possible range of 0–10, 
with a higher score indicating a higher level of depression. In older adults, 
the 10-item CES-D was reported to have sensitivity at 100%, speciﬁcity at 
93%, and positive predictive value at 38% (Irwin, Artin, & Oxman, 1999). 
The internal consistency reliabilities for this study at pre- and posttest were 
α = .80 and α = .82, respectively. 

Morale was measured by the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale- 
Revised (PGMS), a 17-item scale designed to measure psychological well- 
being in older adults in three factors: agitation, attitude toward one’s own 
aging, and loneliness. The possible range is 0–17, with a higher score indicat- 
ing a lower level of morale. The PGMS has a reported reliability of 0.81–0.85. 
Grann (2000) documented an average correlation of 0.73 with nine other 
measures of well-being. The internal consistency reliabilities for this study at 
pre- and posttest were α = .86 and α = .86, respectively. 

Hope was measured using the Herth Hope Index (HHI; Herth, 1992), 
a 12-item index that measures areas of an individual’s inner sense of 
temporality and future, inner positive readiness and expectancy, and inter- 
connectedness with self and others. The possible range of scores is 12–48, 
with a higher score indicating a lower level of hope. The HHI has a reported 
reliability between 0.88 and 0.97 and a reported criterion validity between 
0.73 and 0.92 (Grann, 2000). The internal consistency reliabilities for this 
study at pre- and posttest were α = .88 and α = .84, respectively. 

Isolation was measured by using the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. It has 
a possible range of 3–9, with a higher score indicating a higher level 
of loneliness. The UCLA Loneliness Scale is correlated with the 20-item 
Revised–UCLA Scale at 0.82 (Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2004). 
This version of the scale was developed speciﬁcally for older adults and has 
a reported alpha of 0.72. The internal consistency reliabilities for this study 
at pre- and posttest were α = .76 and α = .86, respectively. 



The one-leg stand is a test used to measure balance (Gehlsen & Whaley, 
1990; Kaye et al., 1994; Oken et al., 2006). Participants are asked to stand on 
one leg with their eyes open for as long as they can. The score is determined 
by the average duration, in seconds, the participant stands on each leg. The 
longer the duration, the greater the participant’s balance. For this study, the 
test–retest reliability for this measure was r = .63 (p < .04). 

The sit-to-stand test is widely used (Guralnik et al., 1994; Oken et al., 2006) 
to measure lower body strength. The seated participant is asked to stand 
without the use of his or her arms. If the participant is successful, then she 
or he is timed doing it ﬁve more times. The score is the total time it took to 
stand from sitting. A shorter time indicates greater lower body strength. The 
test–retest reliability for the lower body strength measure for this study was 
r = .61 (p < .02). 

The sit-and-reach test (Hoeger, 1992; Hong, Li, & Robinson, 2000; Hui, 
Yuen, Morrow, & Jackson, 1999; Oken et al., 2006; Shephard, Berridge, & 
Montelpare, 1990) was designed to measure ﬂexibility in the hamstrings and 
lower back. The participant is asked to sit on the ﬂoor in with his or her legs 
in a V shape. A ruler is placed to measure how many centimeters she or he 
can reach forward. The score is the number of centimeters the participant 
is able to reach, with a higher score indicating a higher level of ﬂexibility. 
The test–retest reliability for the ﬂexibility measure for this study was r = .20 
(p > .05). 


Participants were primarily Caucasian (72.2%); the remainder of the partici- 
pants were African American (27.8%). The majority of the participants were 
female (88.9%). The mean age of the participants was 74.9 years (SD = 8.4), 
with a range of 62–91 years. The mean years of education for the partici- 
pants was 13.6 (SD = 2.7), with a range of 8–18 years. Sixty-one percent 
of the participants were Protestant, with the remainder of the participants 
self-identiﬁed as “other.” The majority (72.2%) of the participants reported 
religion as “very important,” 16.7% reported religion as “somewhat impor- 
tant,” and 11.1% reported religion as “not important.” The average income 


was $952 per month (SD = 319.02), with a range of $561–$1,532. One par- 
ticipant (5.6%) was married, seven (38.9%) were widowed, four (22.2%) 
were divorced, and ﬁve (27.8%) had never married. Statistical analyses were 
nonsigniﬁcant between the yoga and comparison groups with regard to 
demographics (see Tables 1 and 2). 
To determine if the intervention and treatment groups differed with 
regard to the dependent variables, 
tests were conducted 
between group membership and the pretest scores of the CES-D, the PGMS, 
the HHI, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the one-leg stand test, the sit-to-stand 
test, and the sit-and-reach test. The results showed that the PGMS was

signiﬁcantly different at pretest, with the yoga group showing much lower 
levels of morale than the social group. No other signiﬁcant differences in 
pretest scores existed between the two groups. 
The overall attendance rate for the entire study was 71.5%. The atten- 
dance rate was higher for those who were assigned to the yoga group 
(78.1%) than to the social group (66.4%), with the average number of ses- 
sions attended by each participant being 6.3 for the yoga group and 5.3 for 
the social group (out of 8 sessions). Attendance adherence steadily declined 
by wave for the overall study and for both groups (yoga group: October 
2007 = 91.7%, January 2008 = 70.8%, March 2008 = 68.8%; social group: 
October 2007 = 91.7%, January 2008 = 65.6%, March 2008 = 41.6%). The 
overall mean number of sessions attended was 7.3 for October 2007, 5.4 for 
January 2008, and 4.2 for March 2008. 
At the time of pretest, the overall the mean score for all the partici- 
pants for the CES-D was 2.39 (SD = 2.5). For level of morale, the mean 
score of the PGMS for all the participants at pretest was 5.72 (SD = 4.32). 
The mean score for the HHI for all the participants at pretest was 17.39 
(SD = 5.18). The mean score of the UCLA Loneliness Scale for all the 
participants at pretest was 5.17 (SD = 1.69). 
The overall mean for the participants for the one-leg stand score at 
pretest was 5.45 seconds (SD = 3.29). The mean score for the sit-to-stand 
test was 20.41 seconds (SD = 13.24), with a range of 38. The overall mean 
score for the sit-and-reach test at the time of pretest was 24.85 centimeters 
(SD = 10.01), with a range of 36.5. With the exception of the sit-and-reach 
test, more variance in the scores for the yoga group existed than for the 
social group, indicating a wider range of functioning for the participants in 
the yoga group than in the social group. 

The yoga group showed improvement from pre- to posttest in all the mea- 
sures of mental well-being (CES-D, PGMS, HHI, and UCLA Loneliness Scale). 
The yoga group also showed improvement in the sit-to-stand and the sit- 
and-reach tests. A slight decrease was present in the score for the one-leg 
test, but it was not signiﬁcant. The social group also showed improvement 
from pre- to posttest in all the measures of mental well-being (again, CES-D, 
PGMS, HHI, and UCLA Loneliness Scale), and showed improvement in the 
sit-and-reach test. However, the social group showed a decline in the one-leg 
and sit-to-stand tests. 
Paired t tests were also conducted for each group to understand the 
differences between pre- and posttest. Statistical signiﬁcance existed for 
improvement in the loneliness scale for the socialization group (p = .025), 
and a trend toward signiﬁcance for the yoga group in the measures of sit-to- 
stand (p = .085) and sit-and-reach (p = .066). No other signiﬁcant differences

existed within groups from pre- to posttest. Table 3 shows the results of the 
paired t tests by group. 
Based on the results of an independent t test, no signiﬁcant differences 
existed in any of the dependent variables between the groups. However, 
unlike at pretest, at posttest the measure of PGMS was not signiﬁcantly 
different between the two groups. This indicates a decreasing gap in the 
scores from pre- to posttest. The mean scores for pre- and posttest by group 
are presented in Table 4.

Despite the ongoing demand for evidence-based practice, 
research continues to have practical difﬁculties that were found through- 
out this study. Researchers have been urged to share with their colleagues 
struggles and successes in regard to recruitment and not to underestimate 
the difﬁculty in recruiting frail older adults into research (Harris & Dyson, 
2001). Although this study yielded little statistically signiﬁcant results, there 
is value in highlighting challenges faced by intervention researchers. This 
study failed to meet its desired sample size, even though many strategies 
suggested by other researchers were incorporated: providing a monetary 
incentive; conducting the study at the participants’ home, which negated the 
need for transportation; and using the same person to observe the pre- and 
post measures in order to minimize participant confusion (Arean, Alvidrez, 
Nery, Estes, & Linkins, 2003). As noted previously, recruiting was considered 
exhausted after every eligible resident had been contacted.

In fact, some strategies for successful recruitment and retention may 
negatively impact other methodological issues of the study. For example, to 
avoid transportation problems, this study was conducted on-site at a senior 
housing building, as suggested by past researchers (McNeely & Clements, 
1994). However, this type of design also increases the threats to validity 
because it increases the chance of contamination and reactivity to selection. 
Perhaps one of the prices to pay for recruiting participants at the site of 
their residence is the issue of contamination. When the intervention and 
the comparison groups share living space, the participants will undoubtedly 
see and/or talk about the elements of the study. In this study, it was com- 
mon for the participants to try to attend the group to which they were not 
assigned or to look into the room while the session was being conducted. 
Because the members of the comparison group were aware of their sta- 
tus, there was a potential for the so-called John Henry effect. Researchers 
need to be aware and carefully weigh the potential ramiﬁcations of location 
when considering where to recruit and conduct an intervention study. If 
researchers decide to conduct an intervention study at a site that presents 
these complications, they must be vigilant about minimizing possible con- 
tamination. Conducting a study where participants report to a research site 
at assigned times may minimize some of these risks. Another strategy to 
possibly reduce contamination is to consider how the study is advertised. 


In this study, it was described as a study to test yoga. As a result, being 
assigned to the yoga group became the preferred group. It may have been 
wiser to simply state that the study would compare two different types of 
group socialization. 
Many other barriers to recruiting participants are worth discussing. First, 
many potential participants voiced a fear of physical strain or medical condi- 
tions as a reason for declining to be in the study. Thus, the misunderstanding 
of the components of the intervention presented as a barrier to participation. 
Although it was continually stressed that yoga can be helpful for chronic and 
painful conditions, can be modiﬁed to meet the needs of the most severely 
impaired person, and is not physically demanding and would be conducted 
while seated, there was still a great deal of reluctance. Studies involving 
physical activity may also pose some special challenges when recruiting par- 
ticipants (Jancey et al., 2006), especially when targeting older adults. Thus, 
for treatments and interventions that require physical activity, coaxing, edu- 
cation, and continual explanation and/or a lengthier recruitment period may 
be necessary. 
It is worth noting that reluctance to engage in mental health treatment 
was not given as a reason for not enrolling in the study. This could be 
because of a lack of knowledge of what yoga is and what the interven- 
tion entailed. Although yoga philosophy essentially mirrors many aspects of 
cognitive behavioral therapy, it is a way of “hiding the peas in the mashed 
potatoes,” so to speak. If activities that promote self-awareness can be con- 
tinued to be validated for the improvement of mental well-being, then yoga 
could be an ideal alternative and an adjunct treatment for those opposed to 
conventional mental health treatment. 
Although the dropout rate for this study was only one 1 of 18 (5.6%), 
recruitment and retention of participants became increasingly difﬁcult as the 
study progressed. Recruitment in the ﬁrst wave required only ﬂyers and 
informational sessions. The participants were eager to learn more about 
the study and sought out the researcher. However, for the third wave, per- 
sonal invitations and continual follow up were necessary for enrollment 
and retention, which required that the researcher seek out the participants. 
Although the third wave required a more aggressive recruitment strategy, 
it still yielded a lower enrollment rate than the previous waves. This trend 
may be something that other researchers conducting intervention studies in 
similar populations may want to closely monitor. It may be related to the 
notion that health affects retention. Other research ﬁndings have suggested 
that intervention adherence was signiﬁcantly correlated with baseline mea- 
sures of depression, fatigue, and the physical components of health-related 
quality (Flegal, Kishiyama, Zajdel, Haas, & Oken, 2007). Other researchers 
may want to ensure that the data collection period is sufﬁcient for the 
researchers to recruit adequate numbers depending on the self-rated health 
of the population, and if the study involves physical exercise. 


It is also the possible that the lack of statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings from 
this study may be attributed to the length of the intervention. It is possible 
that the intervention was not long enough to engender change in older 
adults, and that a more sustained intervention is needed to make an impact 
on mental and physical health. Given the initial improvements and some of 
the trends toward signiﬁcance for some of the measures, it is possible that 
that a more sustained intervention would have produced signiﬁcant results. 
In addition to the implications of sample size, several other limitations 
to this study are worth noting. The treatment integrity of the intervention 
was compromised because the sessions needed to be modiﬁed according 
to the participants’ abilities and comfort level. For example, the intervention 
included standing poses to increase balance. However, some of the partici- 
pants were hesitant to stand, so the entire sessions were conducted seated. 
Given this, it is no surprise that there was no improvement in the balance 
scores. In addition, this might mean that there was insufﬁcient stimulation 
for the higher-functioning participants. It will be necessary to modify prac- 
tices in order to simulate similar effects in participants to meet the needs of 
a wide range when there are no cutoff scores at pretest. 
One limitation to the external validity of this study is that the sample 
was self-selected. Because the study utilized convenience sampling, all the 
participants showed interest in the study. Thus, the ﬁndings of the study 
may not be generalized to all older adults who might not be as willing to 
engage in such a study. In this study, for example, those who were severely 
depressed, isolated, or physically disabled may have not been eligible or 
interested and/or the adherence and retention rates could have differed. 
Although this study produced little statistically signiﬁcant results, there is 
value in it. This study can also serve as a pilot for other studies. First, it tested 
the feasibility of the treatment manual. Given that the intervention could not 
be carried out in the way it was originally designed because of the partic- 
ipants’ comfort level, the treatment manual can be adapted for persons with 
speciﬁc conditions. The target population in this study (older adults living in 
the community) may have been too broad to test for efﬁcacy. Modiﬁcations 
for speciﬁc conditions, both mental and physical, can be developed and 
tested. Because a 4-week period may not have been long enough to produce 
signiﬁcant results, the intervention can also be tested for dosage to ascertain 
how much of an intervention is needed to achieve the desired outcomes. 
Second, the study addresses the needs of older adults in a holistic manner, 
acknowledging the mind-body-spirit connection. Interventions focusing on 
strengths of individuals may have some impact on overall well-being. 
Lastly, much of the merit of this study stems from the lessons learned 
concerning what was done well and what could have been improved to 
increase recruitment and retention for studies targeting older populations. 
Special efforts for recruitment as well as the location of the study need to 
be carefully considered when designing studies. Another possibility is to 


reconsider the design of the study if such a small sample size is attained. 
Although we attempted to carry out a methodologically rigorous study, the 
reality is that the state of knowledge at that time in this area could have 
merited a more exploratory and uncontrolled design, or even a series of 
single system designs. Although these designs produce concerns of validity, 
some data would be better than no data when a sample size precludes any 
meaningful statistical analysis. 
It is hoped that offering the lessons learned in this study to other 
researchers will add to the knowledge base of conducting more effective 
intervention studies. In order to conduct intervention studies for community 
samples, realistic and practical feedback is essential to continually increase 
and develop trustworthy knowledge in what is effective in serving older 
adults.
