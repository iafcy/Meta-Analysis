The use of case management for community-dwelling 
older people: the effects on loneliness, symptoms of 
depression and life satisfaction in a randomised 
controlled trial 
Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management 
intervention for community-dwelling frail older people, 
with functional dependency and repeated contacts with 
the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive 
symptoms and life satisfaction. 
Design: A two-armed, nonblinded, randomised control 
trial with repeated follow-ups, of N = 153 participants at 
baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control 
(n = 73) group. 
Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥65 years 
of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance 
in two or more self-reported activities of daily living, 
having at least two hospital admissions or at least four 
visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. 
Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an 
intervention of general case management, general infor- 
mation, speciﬁc information and continuity and safety. 
The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or 
more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An 
intention-to-treat analysis was applied for the primary 
outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life sat- 
isfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity 
analyses. 
Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 
dropped out. No signiﬁcant difference was 
found 
between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemo- 
graphic characteristics, subjective health or primary out- 
comes. The intention-to-treat analysis did not result in 
any signiﬁcant effects for the primary outcomes at any of 
the follow-ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case 
analysis resulted in a signiﬁcant difference in favour of 
(RR = 0.49, 
the 
p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 
(ES = 0.47, 
6 months and for depressive symptoms 
p = 0.035) at 12 months. 
Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older 
people did not result in clear favourable effects for the 
primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case 
management may be beneﬁcial 
in terms of these out- 
comes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elabo- 
ration of the components and assessments is suggested.

Poor psychological health among older people is wide- 
spread, albeit a neglected area, where providing social 
support is highlighted as an area in need of improvement 
(1, 2). Among older people loneliness is a prevalent phe- 
nomenon, internationally (3, 4) as well as nationally (5).

Loneliness has serious consequences for cognition, emo- 
tion, behaviour and overall health if left unattended (6) 
where a reciprocal association between loneliness and 
depressive symptoms appears to be salient (4, 6). The 
importance of promoting and utilising psychological 
resources has been highlighted as 
for 
healthy ageing (7). However, frail older people, in partic- 
ular, have complex medical and social needs and their 
overall care is characterised by fragmentation and weak 
accountability (8). Case management is one approach to 
face the challenge of delivering coordinated, and inte- 
grated care, which encompasses prevention as well as 





including dealing with poor 
medical and social needs, 
psychological health. To date, there are very few pub- 
lished randomised controlled trials (RCT) aiming to eval- 
uate the effects of using case management for frail older 
people in regard to dealing with loneliness, depressive 
symptoms and life satisfaction. 

The core of case management comprises planning, facili- 
tation, coordination, evaluation and advocating, based on 
an individual’s comprehensive health needs (7, 9). In a 
systematic review by You et al. (10) (N = 15, n = 10 
RCTs, n = 5 quasi-experimental trials), the available evi- 
dence showed that case management in community aged 
care can improve psychological health and well-being of 
the clients. Assessing these psychological aspects, includ- 
ing loneliness, are emphasised as an important part of 
case management (8, 11, 12) in order to achieve success- 
ful client outcomes (13). Moreover, when being frail, the 
importance of prevention and early intervention has 
been emphasised to counteract negative outcomes expe- 
rienced by these individuals (14). Brieﬂy, the term frailty 
can be seen as a state with multiple causes and contribu- 
tors, resulting in an increased vulnerability for develop- 
ing increased dependency and/or death (15) as well as an 
increased risk of institutionalisation and use of healthcare 
services (16). 

Masi et al. (17) highlights the distinction between 
loneliness and social 
isolation, where loneliness is the 
social equivalent of physical pain, and seeking connec- 
tions to feel safe, secure and content with life allevi- 
ates, whereas social isolation is an objective measure of 
social interactions and relationships. Thus, loneliness is 
a subjective and undesired experience involving a nega- 
tive affect 
the known reciprocal 
relationship between loneliness and depression (4, 6, 
19) is apparent when older people themselves describe 
the experience of depression as being associated with 
isolation and shielding (20). Symptoms of 
loneliness, 
depression among older people differ 
from younger 
people where the former displays somatic symptoms, 
cognitive changes and loss of interest. This can be char- 
acterised by depressed mood, decreased energy, feelings 
of worthlessness and inability to enjoy pleasurable 
activities or events, among others (21). In regard to the 
fact that loneliness is associated with both physical and 
psychological adverse health outcomes 
including 
lower life satisfaction (5, 22), and depressed mood (4, 
5), elucidates the importance of recognition in clinical 
practice. 

There is evidence that case managers beneﬁt a client’s 
perception of psychological support in terms of providing 
reassurance, feelings of security and social support (12). 
In addition, attributes such as self-efﬁcacy, self-esteem, 
conﬁdence, optimism, purpose in life and coping are of 
major importance for healthy ageing (7) and these attri- 
butes are reﬂected in the concept of life satisfaction as 
described by Neugarten et al. (23). Low self-esteem has 
been found to be associated with lower life satisfaction 
among older Europeans, along with being unsatisﬁed 
with social contacts and feeling hindered by health prob- 
lems (24). Accordingly, the actual effect of case manage- 
ment for frail older people in regard to life satisfaction as 
further interest, but remains 
well as loneliness is of 
unclear due to the limited number of published experi- 
mental trials and, in particular, RCTs. 
Frail older people living at home are currently at risk 
of receiving fragmented care with limited focus on psy- 
chological health as well as social support. Evaluation of 
the comprehensive approach, as provided in case man- 
agement, with focus on loneliness, depressive symptoms 
and life satisfaction, would generate additional knowl- 
edge concerning the care and well-being of frail older 
people. 

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a 
case management intervention to community-dwelling 
frail older people with functional dependency and 
repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing 
on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. 


The study had a nonblinded, two-armed randomised con- 
trolled design (RCT) with repeated follow-ups. The study 
has been developed applying the Medical Research 
Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions 
(25–27) using a stepwise approach including develop- 
ment, feasibility/piloting, evaluation and implementation 
(25, 26). The development phase included a literature 
review (28). Thereafter, the intervention programme was 
developed and included a pilot study (29) and ﬁnal mod- 
iﬁcations of the intervention. To date, there are three 
published experimental studies evaluating the effect of 
the case management intervention in relation to falls 
(30), in relation to healthcare utilisation (31) and in rela- 
tion to cost utility (32). 

The study was conducted in a medium-sized municipality 
in the County of Sk(cid:2)ane in Southern Sweden, with 
approximately 32 000 inhabitants. The municipality con- 
tains one town and rural areas. In total, 153 participants 
were enrolled in the study, with 80 participants 

randomised to an intervention group, and 73 participants 
randomised to a control group (Fig. 1). The participants 
were consecutively recruited between October 2006 to 
April 2010 from three clinics at the local university hos- 
pital (n = 20), three primary healthcare centres in the 
municipality (n = 117), the home care organisation in 
the municipality (n = 13) or through self-referrals by 
contacting the research group (n = 3). Inclusion criteria 
were as follows: 65 years of age or older, living in ordi- 
nary housing in the municipality, being in need of assis- 
tance in two or more self-reported activities of daily 
living (ADL), having at least two hospital admissions or 
at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to 
enrolment in the project. The participant was also able to 
communicate verbally in Swedish and had no severe cog- 
nitive impairment. To determine cognitive impairment, 
the Mini Mental State Examination (33) was used with a 
range between zero and 30 points, where a cut-off score 
of ≥25 points was considered as having no cognitive 
impairment. 


Altogether, 1079 persons were assessed for eligibility. 
The participants were recruited by staff at the facilities 
who asked a potential participant if he or she agreed to 
be contacted by a team member in the research group. 
At the hospital, three nurses involved in the study man- 
aged the recruitment process. The majority of the partici- 
pants (n = 862) were assessed for eligibility through a 
screening procedure performed on two occasions at two 
primary healthcare centres in the municipality (≥4 visits 
at the primary clinic during the previous year) and con- 
tacted by telephone or mail. When contacted by tele- 
phone, 
the potential participants were given verbal 
information and were assessed for eligibility by a member 
in the research group. When contacted by mail, potential 
participants were given written information about the 
study and asked to complete and return a prepaid form 
saying that they were interested in the study. If this was 
done, a research group member called up, providing 
further information, gained consent and assessed for 
eligibility. Finally, some participants were recruited by 





regarding the study 
self-referral. 
were provided at eligible settings, enabling individuals 
themselves to contact the project team. Reasons for not 
being recruited were as follows: did not respond to invi- 
tation (n = 571), did not meet 
the inclusion criteria 
(n = 231), declined to participate (n = 71), could not be 
reached (n = 28), were too sick or tired (n = 18) or had 
died before randomisation (n = 7) (Fig. 1). 
The randomisation procedure, carried out by members 
of the research group, included sealed envelopes contain- 
ing a note informing if the participant was allocated to 
the control or the intervention group. The possibility of 
being randomised to either group was equal, and the 
procedure was undertaken after inclusion and prior to 
baseline. 
intervention. The intervention was 
The case management 
given over a 12-month period. The case managers repre- 
sented two professions, nurses (RN) and physiotherapists 
(PT). All participants in the intervention group were 
given a case manager (CM) from each profession. 
It 
should be noted that in the piloting phase of the inter- 
vention, there was only a RN CM (29). The PT CM was 
introduced after the piloting phase. The two CMs (RN 
and PT) did either a monthly home visit together or sep- 
arately (i.e. one monthly visit for each CM, respectively). 
Thus, home visit’s occurred at least once a month for 
each CM or more frequently, if needed. The intervention 
comprised of four main components: general case man- 
agement (I), general information (II), speciﬁc information 
(III) and continuity and safety (IV) (29, 34). General case 
management (I) included assessment of lifestyle, func- 
tional and cognitive status and nursing needs of the indi- 
vidual. A care plan was developed based on the 
assessment undertaken and included monitoring and 
evaluation. In addition, this component of case manage- 
ment also comprised care coordination, navigation in the 
healthcare system, advocating as well as encouraging 
social activities. This could mean guiding, assisting and 
supporting participants in their contact with different 
establishments in the healthcare system, including guid- 
ing towards an accurate level of care or accompany the 
participant to outpatient visits. General information (II) 
was provided regarding the healthcare system, as well as 
details concerning ageing and its consequences. Informa- 
tion regarding activities arranged by the municipality, 
such as social activities, was also given. Speciﬁc informa- 
tion (III) was comprised of information focusing on the 
participants’ speciﬁc health problems and needs, includ- 
ing the use of medication and exercise, as well as psy- 
chosocial aspects. This could, for example, mean how 
and when to administer a certain medical product or give 
ideas and support of what to do if feeling lonely or iso- 
lated. In addition, an evaluation of the prescribed medi- 
cations was made, and a physician connected to the 
project, also reviewed the prescribed medications for 
inaccuracies in both the intervention and control groups. 
Continuity and safety (IV) 
included availability and 
reachability. This meant that the CMs were reachable by 
telephone to participants during ofﬁce hours for answer- 
ing questions, assist in solving problems, as well as pro- 
vide assistance in crisis situations. 
The CMs intervened according to the four main com- 
ponents, although focus differed depending on the indi- 
vidual professionals’ expertise. The RN CM focused on 
nursing care related to health, medications and psychoso- 
cial aspects. The Mini Data Set for Home Care (MD-HC) 
(35) was used by the RN CM as a regular part of the 
overall assessment and covers demographic characteris- 
tics, functional and cognitive status and nursing needs. 
The PT CM focused on fall prevention and physical func- 
tioning. In addition, the PT could include a social activity 
as a part of an exercise session and the RN used a similar 
approach where a social activity could be combined with 
a practical errand, such as stopping for coffee while going 
to the pharmacy (34). The interventions given to each of 
the participants were documented by the CMs, including 
diaries with personal reﬂections (29). It was also possible 
to contact a physician involved in the project if needed. 
All CMs communicated and collaborated regularly with 
including attending steering group 
the research group, 
meetings (29, 34). During the steering group meetings, 
the CMs presented speciﬁc participant cases that were 
brought up for discussion both from a problem-solving 
aspect and/or success aspect. On average, each RN CM 
made eleven visits and two phone calls throughout the 
12-month intervention period to those participants who 
completed the intervention. Corresponding average for 
the PT CM was ten visits and one phone call (34). 
Standard care. During the study, all participants were 
receiving standard care. This care was according to the 
Swedish Health Medical Services Act, encompassing health 
and medical care, and the Social Services Act, encompass- 
ing home care services. The care according to the two 
legal acts is provided by the municipality and the county 
council in terms of in- and outpatient care, and home 
care services. Home care services are based on a 
need assessment carried out by the municipality and 
can include meals-on-wheels, cleaning, shopping and 
assistance in personal activities such as showering. 
If 
medical specialised care is needed, the participants could 
receive home nursing and/or other assistance such as 
rehabilitation. 

Questionnaires were collected by means of structural 
interviews in the participant’s home at baseline, and at 
3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month intervals. The questionnaires 

from baseline, 6- and 12-month intervals were used in 
this study and encompassed several assessments and 
questions from which primary and secondary outcomes 
were selected. The assessors were members of the project 
team who all had training in performing structural inter- 
views as well as assessing the questionnaire. 

Three primary outcomes were chosen and analysed at 
baseline, 6 and 12 months for the purpose of evaluating 
the effects of the intervention in regard to loneliness, 
depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. For baseline 
covering 
sample, 
characteristics of 
sociodemographics and health aspects were chosen. 


Primary outcomes. Loneliness was assessed by a single- 
item question regarding the prevalence of loneliness (at 
the time of the assessment): ‘Do you feel lonely nowa- 
days?’ with three response alternatives: 1. Yes, I feel very 
lonely 2. Yes, I feel rather lonely 3. No, I don’t feel 
lonely. A dichotomisation (0/1) of the response alterna- 
lonely (3 = 0) and lonely 
tives was made into not 
(1–2 = 1). The Geriatric Depression Scale-20 (GDS-20) 
comprising of 20 questions (yes/no) assessed depressive 
symptoms. The GDS-20 generates a score from zero to 
20, where a cut-off score ≥6 indicates risk of depression 
and has been validated in a Swedish context (36). Levels 
of life satisfaction was obtained by using the Life Satisfac- 
tion Index-Z (LSIZ) (37) consisting of 13 items in state- 
and positive 
including both negative 
ment 
statements, on a three-point Likert scale (agree, don’t 
know, disagree). The scores range from zero to 26, and a 
higher score indicated greater satisfaction. The LSIZ has 
been translated into Swedish, and the instrument is suit- 
able for measuring general life satisfaction in older people 
(38). 

Baseline measures. To describe the characteristics of the 
sample, single-item questions covering age, gender, civil 
status, educational level and use of municipal care was 
applied. In addition to this, the following assessments 
were made: level of dependence in personal activities in 
daily living (PADL) and instrumental activities in daily 
living (IADL) was obtained by a supplemented ADL stair- 
case (39) based on Katz’s ADL index (40), and the sup- 
plement constitutes four well-deﬁned IADL (39). PADL 
refers to six activities: bathing, dressing, going to the toi- 
let, transfer, continence, feeding, with IADL referring to 
four activities: cleaning, shopping, 
transportation and 
cooking. The instrument generated a score ranging from 
zero to ten based on the performance of each of the ten 
activities (can (0)/cannot (1)), where ≥1 indicates depen- 
dency in ADL. The EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D) (41), 
which assesses health-related quality of life, contains a 



visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS ranges from zero 
(worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable 
health state), on which the participant was asked to score 
his or her current health status (41). This information 
was used as an indicator of the subjective health status 
among the participants. A single-item question for assess- 
ing depressive mood as a health complaint was drawn 
from a total of 32 different questions regarding common 
health complaints for older people, which were assessed 
by the presence and severity during the last 3 months, 
with four response alternatives (1. No; 2. Yes, little; 3. 
Yes, quite a lot; 4. Yes, very much). The original version 
of health complaints (42) has been revised by adding 
response alternatives and symptoms from a later study 
(43). The response alternatives for the item assessing 
depressed mood were dichotomised as ‘no’ = 0 and ‘yes, 
little’, ‘yes, quite a lot’ and ‘yes, very much’ = 1. Data on 
(1)/no (0)) 
prescribed antidepressive medication (yes 
were assessed using the Downton Fall Risk Index (44) 
and treated as a single item. Finally, a dichotomous sin- 
gle-item question was used covering whether the partici- 
pant had a conﬁdant or not (yes (0)/no (1)). The latter 
three items served as background data, primarily for the 
main outcomes of depressive symptoms (the items for 
depressed mood and prescribed antidepressive medica- 
tion) and loneliness (having a conﬁdant or not). 


study was performed 
Intention-to-treat 
according to the intention-to-treat principle (ITT), mean- 
ing that all participants were kept in the group to which 
they were assigned, or accounted for in the ﬁnal analysis 
of treatment effects (45). The primary outcomes: loneli- 
ness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, were 
included in the ITT analysis. A complete case analysis 
was also performed for the primary outcomes. For the 
ITT analysis, missing outcome data pattern was analysed 
and plausible assumptions about the missing data were 
considered. 
Imputation method was chosen based on 
these assumptions (46). The last observed value replaced 
the missing value according to the last-observation- 
carried-forward (LOCF) method (47) applied, and when 
baseline data was missing, the subsequent value for the 
item replaced the baseline data. In those cases where no 
data were available at any time point on item level, the 
replaced the missing value. This 
value of zero (0) 
occurred in two cases for the loneliness variable and in 
seven cases at item level for the GDS-20 variable. To 
enhance the robustness of the ITT analysis, supplemen- 
tary analyses were undertaken for the main outcomes at 
baseline and the follow-ups (46). For the item assessing 
loneliness, all missing values were imputed with (0) for a 
best-case scenario, and (1) for a worst-case scenario. For 
the GDS-20 and the LSIZ, a likelihood-based approach 


and expectation maximisation (EM) (46, 48) were used. 
The supplementary analyses investigating the missing 
data from different approaches served as a sensitivity 
analysis of the results from the ITT analysis (44). 
Statistical tests. For comparisons between the intervention 
(0) and control groups (1), the Student’s t-test was used 
for normally distributed interval data and the Mann– 
Whitney U-test was used for interval data, which was 
the chi- 
not normally distributed. For nominal data, 
square test or the Fischer’s exact probability test was 
used. One-Way repeated-measures ANOVA, for interval 
data, and Cochran’s Q-test, for nominal data, were used 
for comparisons over time within the intervention and 
control groups. When signiﬁcant values, Cohen’s d for 
interval data was calculated and used to determine the 
effect size (ES), 0.20 was considered a small effect, 0.50 a 
medium effect and 0.80 a large effect (49). For nominal 
data, the relative risk (RR) was used as an indicator of 
ES. The differences (Δ) in ES for each of the primary out- 
comes were calculated between baseline and 6 months, 
and baseline and 12 months for the intervention and 
control groups, applying the values suggested by Cohen 
(49) or if RR, in percentage. For repeated measures, the 
p-value was adjusted according to the Bonferroni method 
and set to 0.017; for all other analyses, a p-value less or 
equal to 0.050 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant. 
The software program IBM SPSS Statistics (versions 21, 
22) was used for the statistical analyses. 
Power analysis. To avoid type II errors, a power analysis 
was conducted a priori to determine the sample size of 
the study. Depressive symptoms, assessed by the GDS-20, 
and life satisfaction, assessed by the LSIZ, were consid- 
ered. The a-level was set to 0.05 and power (1 (cid:1) b) to 
0.80. A mean change of 1.5 points with a standard devia- 
tion (SD) of 3.4 points over 12 months was considered 
relevant for depressive symptoms. Corresponding mean 
change for life satisfaction was set to 2.5 points with a 
SD of 4.8 points. Based on these assumptions, a total of 
59 (LSIZ) to 81 (GDS-20) participants were required in 
each group. 

The CONSORT 2010 statement (50) and the CONSORT 
extension for nonpharmacological trials (51) were used 
as guidance when reporting. The main study is trial regis- 
tered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01829594. 
principles: respect for autonomy, nonmaleﬁcence, beneﬁ- 
cence and justice, were used for additional ethical 
guidance. 


Of 
the 153 participants randomised, 108 participants 
remained at the 12-month follow-up (n = 12 died, n = 33 
dropped out), leaving 56 participants in the intervention 
group and 52 participants in the control group (Fig. 1). At 
baseline, the age span in the study ranged from 66 to 
94 years of age, with a mean (M) age of 82 (SD = 6.4) 
years. The women were in the majority (67% vs. 33%) 
(Table 1), but did not differ in age compared to the men 
(M = 82, SD = 5.7 vs. M = 81, SD = 6.7). No signiﬁcant 
difference was found between the intervention and con- 
trol groups regarding age, marital status, educational level, 
ADL and use of municipal care (Table 1). The majority 
(68%) of the participants lived in an apartment or condo- 
minium, compared to 32% who lived in a house. 
When using the EQ-5DVAS to rate current health status 
at baseline, the mean score of the total sample was 60 
(SD = 17.5) on a zero to 100-scale, with 40% of the total 
sample reporting depressed mood as a health complaint, 
and with 16% prescribed antidepressive medication 
(Table 1). No signiﬁcant differences were found between 
the two groups in regard to health status, depressed 
mood as a health complaint, prescribed antidepressive 
medication or having a conﬁdant (Table 1). 
The prevalence of loneliness at baseline, in the total 
sample (complete cases), was 24% (Table 2). The corre- 
sponding mean score for the GDS-20 was 6.0 (SD = 3.4), 
and for the LSIZ 14.7 (SD = 5.1), respectively. No signiﬁ- 
cant difference was found between the groups regarding 
the three primary outcomes at baseline (Table 2). 

In the 6-month follow-up, the complete case analysis 
resulted in signiﬁcant differences between the groups 
regarding both loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life 
satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) (Table 2). At the 12- 
month follow-up, a medium-sized effect was found in 
favour of the intervention (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) regarding 
depressive symptoms. In addition, the mean score for the 
intervention group was below cut-off (M = 5.0, SD = 3.48) 
for the GDS-20, whereas the mean score for the control 
group was above (M = 6.7, SD = 3.74) (Table 2). 

The study was designed and conducted in accordance 
with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of 
Helsinki (52). Beauchamp and Childress’ (53) four ethical 

After replacing the missing data and conducting the ITT 
analysis, no signiﬁcant differences between the two

life satisfaction 
(p = 0.641 and p = 0.421). The worst- and best-case sce- 
nario for the item assessing loneliness as well as the EM 




approach for the LSIZ and the GDS-20 did not result in 
any signiﬁcant differences between the two groups at 
any time point (data not shown). 


According to the ITT analysis, this study showed that 
the intervention did not have a favourable signiﬁcant 
effect on loneliness. Although the intervention com- 
prised aspects regarding psychosocial health, there was 
no standardised or explicit strategy when intervening 
it was individually tailored 
against loneliness. Instead, 
and this could be reﬂected in the lack of effectiveness. 
However, identifying the frail older person’s own barri- 
ers for overcoming loneliness has been suggested as a 
research (54). Considering the 
strategy in previous 
trend for prevalence of 
loneliness over time in the 
intervention group, along with the signiﬁcant effect of 
the complete case analysis, it appears that the interven- 
tion may have had an effect on loneliness at 6 months 
from baseline. This could indicate that the support in 
terms of alleviating loneliness provided by the CM was 
sufﬁcient initially, but not over a longer period of time. 
The content of the case management intervention may 
cover some dimensions of 
loneliness related to social 
aspects, which resulted in an initial favourable effect, 
but 
the strategy failed to accomplish a sustainable 
effect. Sandberg et al. (55) found that the participants 
in the case management study experienced the CM as 
an important source of social support and enjoyed hav- 
(17) 
ing someone to talk to. However, Masi et al. 


suggests that due to the complexity of loneliness, social 
interventions targeting social support and social skills 
are not the most effective strategies in combating lone- 
liness, but rather targeting ‘maladaptive social cogni- 
behavioural 
tion’, 
therapy (CBT). In line with previous ﬁndings, further 
improvement of case management 
should include a 
more structured and evidence-based approach in assess- 
speciﬁcally,

In addition, changing

skills and associated feelings 
thoughts, behaviours, 
through CBT have shown to be effective in reducing 
depressive symptoms among older people (58). This is in 
line with suggested strategies in combating loneliness 
(17). Given the reciprocal relationship between loneliness 
it would be of further 
and depression (4, 6, 19, 20), 
interest to elaborate and investigate the possibilities of 
providing support beyond social dimensions. Neverthe- 
less, early recognition of depressive symptoms has shown 
to be effective in preventing recurrent episodes of depres- 
sion (21). Thus, the CM could play an important role in 
detecting those at risk, providing basic preventive or 
reductive strategies and when needed, advocating and for 
advanced treatment such as CBT. 
The ﬁnal primary outcome of this study was related to 
life satisfaction and can be seen as the opposite to depres- 
sive symptoms experienced by individuals since it refers 
to the positive aspect of the psychological well-being, 
including maintaining happy and optimistic (23). The 
mean scores of the LSIZ, in the total sample as well as in 
both groups, 
respectively, are in line with previous 
reported scores for similar samples in Sweden as well as 
in other European countries (59). However, among older 
(60+ years) Swedes in general, a mean score of 18 
(SD = 4.8) has been reported (60) and supports that frail 
older people appear to have a lower life satisfaction com- 
pared to older people in general. Moreover, being less 
satisﬁed with life is associated by deﬁcits in social con- 
tacts, feeling hindered by health problems and low self- 
esteem (24). The components of the intervention were 
intended to cover the mentioned factors as well as 
enhancing overall psychological well-being of individuals. 
Previous research on case management for frail older 
people has shown favourable effects in regard to aspects 
of life satisfaction such as satisfaction with psychological 
health (61). Nevertheless, 
in 
attempting to provide an intervention against psychologi- 
cal well-being due to stigma as well as referring to physi- 
cal symptoms instead of psychological (57). Seemingly, it 
could be that the physical-oriented components of the 
intervention were more feasible for the CM delivering 
the intervention as well as for the older person himself 
or herself. Despite the absence of signiﬁcant positive out- 
comes for case management in this study, there are indi- 
cations that frail older people could beneﬁt from the use 
of case management in terms of loneliness, symptoms of 
depression and life satisfaction. However, when aiming 
to target these complex phenomena, this study indicates 
that an elaboration comprising a focused and speciﬁc 
intervention strategy, with well-deﬁned outcomes, could 
potentially be more beneﬁcial for the frail older person.

analyses in the intervention and control groups, respectively. 
Figure 4 Mean score of the GDS-20 for the ITT and complete case 
analyses in the intervention and control groups, respectively. 
A further important ﬁnding was that the participants 
in the total sample, as well as in both groups, were likely 
to be depressed, when applying the cut-off score for the 
GDS-20 (36). Although this is not equal to a clinical 
diagnosis, the ﬁnding shows that depressive symptoms 
are common among frail older people. Research con- 
ducted by Mezuk et al. (56) shows that there is a known 
reciprocal relationship between depression and frailty, 
and the need for providing appropriate support has been 
highlighted (1). The case management intervention did 
not result in a favourable signiﬁcant effect on depressive 
symptoms. Nevertheless, when accounting for the trend 
of the GDS-20 scores over time, along with the complete 
it indicates that the intervention group 
case analyses, 






This compared to a broader approach such as applied in 
the case management 
this 
study indicates that the CMs and the services they pro- 
vide have an important role in the caring process for frail 
older people living at home. By applying the core princi- 
ples of case management, assessment, planning, facilita- 
tion, 
(9), 
loneliness and depressive symptoms could be relieved 
either by the CM or by referrals to primary care, includ- 
ing the advocating for evidence-based, state-of-the-art 
treatment and counselling. Moreover, 
this could also 
potentially result in increased life satisfaction for the frail 
older person. Given the vulnerable situation for those 
who are frail, and the importance of prevention in order 
to counteract disability (14), the potential inﬂuence of 
psychological well-being needs to be recognised as well 
as further investigated and evaluated. 

In this study, as well as in the main study, loneliness was 
conceptualised as a negative experience. When assessing 
loneliness in form of a single-item question, neither a deﬁ- 
nition nor a speciﬁc type of loneliness was articulated. It 
cannot be ruled out that the participants may have had a 
diverging conceptualisation, hence threatening construct 
validity. However, using a single-item question when 
assessing loneliness has the advantage of approaching 
direct feelings of loneliness (4). Also, in the questionnaire 
used in the main study various aspects of loneliness were 
assessed by single-item questions and it would be reason- 
able to assume that diverging conceptualisations were not 
frequently occurring among the participants. 
The participants in the study were considered to be frail 
based on the inclusion criteria of functional dependency 
and repeated contacts with the healthcare services. Not 
using a well-established assessment for identifying frailty 
could threaten the external validity. However, there is no 
international standard or perfect frailty assessment tool 
(62). Nevertheless, there is a consensus regarding prefer- 
able screening assessments where the Clinical Frailty Scale 
(CFR) (63) has been recommended (15). In line with the 
CFR, the participants in the present study can be consid- 
ered to be mildly or moderately frail, that is being need 
for help in IADLs or being in need for help in IADLs and 
some PADLs (15, 63). Although an assessment with the 
CFR was not performed, there is nevertheless support that 
the sample in fact was frail in various degrees. 
In regard to internal validity, the random assignment 
itself improves and supports internal validity by enabling 
other conditions, apart from the intervention effects, to be 
experienced equally between the groups within the limits 
of chance (64). However, 
the attrition that occurred 
after participants were randomised, encompassing missing 
items in the questionnaire, as well as declining further 
participation, may affect the internal validity (64). During 
the study period, 29% (n = 45) of the participants dropped 
out due to several reasons, as described in the ﬂow dia- 
gram (Fig. 1), although nearly one-third of the dropouts 
were inevitable due to death. In regard to the intervention 
and control groups, the attrition was fairly equally dis- 
tributed. A previously published dropout analysis of the 
study sample showed no signiﬁcant difference between 
the dropouts and the remaining sample in regard to age, 
functional 
gender, ﬁnancial status, health complaints, 
dependency and depressive symptoms (31). Accordingly, 
there appears to be no treatment-correlated attrition of 
participants, which strengthens the internal validity (64). 
Based on the assumptions regarding the missing data in 
the study, 
it was considered to be missing at random 
(MAR); that is, the systematic difference can be traced or 
predicted within the complete data set but not directly due 
to the variables in which data were missing (48, 65). The 
ITT principle was applied to maintain the beneﬁts of ran- 
dom assignment (64), and with the intention of reporting 
unbiased results (46, 65). The appliance of ITT and imput- 
ing missing values have implications for the statistical con- 
clusion validity in terms of both threats and strengths. 
Applying LOCF as a method for imputing is common (46) 
but also criticised. However, 
the sensitivity analyses 
yielded no signiﬁcant differences between the intervention 
and control groups, at any time point, supporting the 
validity of 
the chosen approach. Furthermore, when 
imputing missing data, the gained estimate of the treat- 
ment effect is often conservative (66, 67) or underesti- 
mated (68). Nevertheless, applying ITT when conducting a 
RCT is recommended as well as required according to the 
CONSORT statement (50). Given the potential threats and 
strengths for statistical conclusion validity as well as inter- 
nal validity, it is suggested that the interpretation of the 
results from the ITT analysis in this study should be com- 
plemented with the results from the complete case analy- 
sis. Finally, according to the MRC complex intervention 
framework, identifying the active ingredient in the inter- 
vention is of interest (26). However, due to the ﬂexibility 
within the intervention in the present study, identifying 
the active ingredient(s) may be difﬁcult (69). It is therefore 
suggested that conducting a process evaluation would be 
beneﬁcial to further understand the barriers and facilita- 
tors in the provided intervention (25, 26). 

Case management for frail older people living at home 
did not result in signiﬁcant favourable effects regarding 
the prevalence of loneliness, symptoms of depression and 
life satisfaction. However, when accounting for the ITT 
analysis, as well as the complete cases, there are indica- 
tions that case management can beneﬁt the frail older 
person in terms of these three outcomes. Due to the 

in relation to experience, 
complexity of the outcomes, 
deﬁnition and assessment, an elaboration of the interven- 
tion is suggested along with further research in accor- 
dance with the MRC framework.
