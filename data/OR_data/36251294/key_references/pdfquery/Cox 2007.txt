Purpose: The primary goal of the Care-Receiver Efﬁcacy 
Intervention (CREI) was to increase the capacity of 
cognitively able elderly care receivers to effectively 
manage their own care and optimize relationships with 
caregivers. To accomplish this, two forms of the CREI 
were created: an individual and a small-group form. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of these 
two CREI forms when compared to a case management 
approach. Design and Methods: Utilizing a quasi- 
experimental design, between January 2002 and 
August 2004 we collected data from 177 elders at 
three time points: pretest, 2 months following the last 
session, and 12 months following the last session. The 
Care-Receiver Efﬁcacy Scale and the Philadelphia 
Geriatric Center Morale Scale–Revised were the out- 
come measures. Results: We found signiﬁcant effects 
favoring the CREI for relationship with caregivers, self- 
care strategies, loneliness, and quality of life. Effects 
were strongest for the small-group form of the CREI. 
Overall, the care receivers in both forms of the CREI 
showed improved self-performance, with small-group 
Support for this work was provided by Grant 90-2545 from the

Services.

CREI participants showing remarkable improvement 
related to quality of life. 
Implications: The results of 
this research suggest that care receiver intervention can 
be effective in improving the care process. 
Key Words: Self-efﬁcacy, Care-receiver, Caregiver, 
Caregiving relationships 
Elder care has become an issue of critical dimensions 
in the United States and around the world, as more 
individuals live longer lives that often include varying 
degrees of disability requiring personal care. Research, 
policy, and intervention programs targeting caregivers 
have proliferated during the past 
three decades. 
Caregiver intervention programs have included educa- 
tional programs, social support groups, and a number 
of other psychosocial interventions. Researchers have 
represented the caregiver/care-receiver relationship as 
an important component of the caregiving process 
(Ingersoll-Dayton & Raschick, 2004; Lyons, Zarit, 
Sayer, & Whitlatch, 2002; Whitlatch, Schur, Noelker, 
Ejaz, & Looman, 2001), as well as central to the 
perceptions of caregivers and care receivers (Pillemer & 
Suitor, 2006; Tetz et al., 2006; Thompson, 2004). 
Scholars have given far less attention to the care- 
receiving role faced by older individuals or to the policy 
and intervention strategies suggested by the nature of 
this role. The challenges of being a care receiver and the 
attitudes, knowledge, and skills that facilitate strong 
and effective participation of care receivers in their care 











To encourage participants to familiarize themselves with appropriate 
health and social service resources and to explore self-advocacy. 
To explore what ‘‘being in charge of your own health care’’ means 









To help participants think about their current social support networks 
and their role in maintenance and expansion of support networks. 
To assist participants in identifying their strengths and deﬁning quality 




process have not been a primary focus of gerontological 
research, even though there is an increasing consensus 
that care receiving plays a major role in late-life tasks. 
There is a growing recognition in the health care ﬁeld 
regarding the patient role of care receiver as being of 
critical import to mental health and physical health 
(Berman & Iris, 1998; Kempen et al., 2003; Li, Fisher, 
Harmer, & McAuley, 2005; Maddux, Brawley, & 
Boykin, 1995). Care receiver interventions are a key 
next step with respect to the consumer-directed care 
movement 
fostered by the Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation (Polivka & Salmon, 2001). 
The primary goal of the Care-Receiver Efﬁcacy 
Intervention (CREI), the effects of which we report 
herein, was to increase the capacity of elderly care re- 
ceivers to effectively manage their own care, including 
optimizing their relationships with caregivers. More 
speciﬁcally, this intervention was designed to reduce the 
sense of powerlessness and increase the sense of efﬁcacy 
of care receivers as partners in their care process by 
increasing their knowledge and skills to cope with and 
overcome challenges associated with the care-receiving 
process, thereby decreasing caregiver stress. Two dif- 
ferent forms of the CREI were created to accomplish 
this goal: a small-group and an individual approach. 
Many elderly care receivers cannot, or are unwilling 
to, participate in small-group interventions due to iso- 
lation, lack of transportation, or physical conditions. 
Geographic location of residence (such as a senior 
housing facility) can be a key factor in developing group 
interventions. Consequently, the availability of both a 
small-group and an individual intervention was deemed 
important to meeting the needs of elderly care receivers. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effec- 
tiveness of the CREI. To accomplish this, we compared 
the two forms of the CREI to a case management 
approach. 

The CREI was based on studies regarding the ways 
in which elders of diverse ethnic backgrounds experi- 
ence and deﬁne their role in the care process, as well as 
the perceptions of caregivers (Cox, 1999; Cox & 
Dooley, 1996; Cox, Parsons, & Kimboko, 1998). These 
studies, combined with extant 
literature regarding 
caregiver challenges, led to focusing this intervention 
on the following themes: (a) psychosocial coping with 
increased dependency; (b) participating in self-care 
(c) communicating with 
education and activities; 
personal and professional caregivers; 
(d) ﬁnding, 
assessing, and managing the use of formal health and 
social services; (e) sustaining and developing late-life 
social support networks; (f) caring for and working 
with one’s caregiver; (g) maintaining quality of life; and 
(h) making end-of-life decisions. 
Project staff prepared structured educational mate- 
rial for the CREI for each session. Gerontological social 
workers, trained by project staff with regard to the 
empowerment-oriented intervention approach and 
speciﬁcally the CREI intervention process, provided 
the intervention, pretest, and post-test data collection. 
Both the small-group and individual 
interventions 
consisted of 10 biweekly sessions of 1.5 to 2 hr in 
length related to the themes listed in the preceding para- 
graph and 2 review sessions with caregivers present. A 
typical session included (a) assessment of issues by the 
individual/small group and values clariﬁcation pro- 
cesses; (b) sharing of strategies from research on indi- 
viduals in similar situations and from the participant’s 
perspective; (c) sharing of related educational material, 
such as mediation and conﬂict management skills, com- 
munication skills, how to access and manage formal 
agency care, and advanced directives; (d) engaging in 
mutual support and self-help activities; and (e) taking 
part in social action strategies if indicated by issues 
that arose. Table 1 describes the 10 session topics and 
objectives. 
To summarize, the CREI was designed to initiate 
care receiver involvement in increasing knowledge 
and skills related to the role of care receiving and in 
assisting others through sharing in the group or 
allowing their ideas and knowledge to be added to the 
materials utilized by the project. (For more informa- 


tion on the intervention, see CREI ﬁnal products at 
http://portfolio.du.edu/ecox.) 

Members of the comparison group received a stan- 
intervention modeled after 
dard case management 
the services of case management agencies that receive 
state contracts to provide this service for home- and 
community-based service recipients. This service in- 
cluded (a) a comprehensive needs assessment, using 
long-term 
Colorado’s standardized multidimensional 
care assessment tool; (b) referral and assistance, with 
access to all appropriate long-term-care services; (c) 
monthly follow-up to determine changes in needs; and 
(d) ongoing telephone assistance at the request of the 
participant. 


In order to determine the effectiveness of the CREI in 
its two forms, we created three groups: two treatment 
groups, representing the small-group and individual 
intervention; and a comparison group, consisting of 
persons 
interven- 
receiving the case management 
tion. Eligibility for the small-group or individual 
CREI depended upon the person’s ability to access 
and participate in a group model. We assigned all small- 
group-eligible intervention participants to the small- 
group treatment. We assigned all 
individual-eligible 
intervention participants randomly to either the CREI 
individual treatment or the case management/compar- 
ison intervention. 
For all three groups, we collected data at three time 
points: Time 1 (pretest), Time 2 (2 months following the 
last session), and Time 3 (12 months following the last 
session). We collected pretest data between January 2002 
and July 2003; we collected ﬁnal data by August 2004. 

Elders who were selected for this project met the 
following criteria: (a) were 55 years old or older, (b) 
required a minimum of 6 hr of personal care per 
week, and (c) were cognitively able to participate in the 
intervention as determined by the mini-mental status 
screen from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Folstein, 
Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) and the decision of a 
clinical social worker (a few applicants did not respond 
well to the mini-mental status screen but were deter- 
mined by gerontological social workers to be able to 
make decisions 
themselves and discuss care- 
receiving concerns). The participants included primar- 
ily individuals with disability related to one or more of 
the following conditions: stroke, heart disease, osteo- 
porosis, mild dementia, cancer, and severe arthritis. All 
participants required assistance with one or more acti- 
vities of daily living (e.g., dressing, bathing, feeding). 
Recruitment was accomplished with the assistance of 
agencies throughout the Denver metropolitan area, 

seniors’ groups, and churches. In the case of agency 
referral, agency staff contacted potential participants to 
determine their willingness to participate in the pro- 
gram. Clients then contacted the project’s research 
staff. Elders received no payment other than the oppor- 
tunity to participate in an intervention. 

from the Denver, 
Colorado, metro area were recruited. One individual 
younger than age 55 was selected for participation due 
to a severe disability, need for care, and initial con- 
fusion about her age. 
The mean age of participants in Time 1 data was 
78.42 years (SD ¼ 9.78), with ages ranging from 51 to 96. 
Most of the participants were female (76.3%), Cauca- 
sian (78.5%), and widowed (51.4%). The modal 
residential 
location was an independent retirement 
community (40.7%), with 27.1% in assisted living, 
24.9% in their own home, 5.6% in a relative’s home, and 
1.7% in a skilled nursing facility. The self-reported 
health status of most participants was fair or good 
(39.5% in each category), with 13.0% in poor and 7.3% 
in excellent health. The modal annual income category 
was $4,860 to $11,064 (42.9%), with income categories 
ranging from $0 to $4,860 (6.8%) to more than $45,000 
(2.3%). Table 2 provides information on demographic 
characteristics of the sample by treatment group. 

We administered two measures via one-to-one 
interviews. The Care-Receiver Efﬁcacy Scale (CRES: 
Cox, Green, Seo, Inaba, & Alyla Quillan, 2006) was 
created speciﬁcally for this project and therefore was 
anticipated to be the most sensitive to the study’s theme 
of efﬁcacy. The other was a published measure, the 
Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale–Revised 
(PGCMS; Lawton, 1975). In total, we used 8 subscale 
and 1 total measure scores. 
CRES.—The CRES (Cox et al., 2006) consists of 48 
items comprising ﬁve subscales, with a 5-point response 
scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). The ﬁve 
subscale names, number of items, and the internal 
consistency ranges over the three data collection time 
points in this study were as follows: Self-Care Strategies 
(15 items, .89–.91), Relational Coping With Caregivers 
(10 items, .82–.84), Perceptions of Dependence (5 items, 
.67–.69), Performance-Related Quality of Life (10 
items, .86–.88), and Accepting Help (8 items, .64–.71). 
Higher 
self-efﬁcacy on all 
subscales except Perceptions of Dependence, where 
higher scores indicate stronger perceptions of depen- 
dence. The CREI was designed to directly affect self- 
care strategies and relationships with caregivers. (See 
Cox et al., for complete item text by subscale.) We 
anticipated that all CREI subscales except Perceptions 
of Dependence would be signiﬁcantly affected by both 
the small-group and individual CREI. 


PGCMS.—The PGCMS (Lawton, 1975) consists of 
17 items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of morale. 
This scale assesses three factors related to aging. The

subscale name, number of items, and the internal 
consistency reliability ranges over the three measure- 
ment points were as follows: Agitation (6 items, .73– 
.77), Attitude Toward Own Aging (5 items, .55–.68), 
and Lonely Dissatisfaction (6 items, .68–.72). We also 
used a total score reﬂecting global life satisfaction (17 
items, .81–.85). We used all four scores (three subscale 
scores and the total score) in this study. Although the 
CREI did not directly address morale, we anticipated 
that the interventions would affect the care receivers’ 
loneliness and global life satisfaction. 

Project staff gave participants a general description 
of the project at the ﬁrst contact, often by telephone. At 
this time, if the individual wished to participate, the 
contact site was determined. The ﬁrst in-person contact 
typically occurred at 
the participant’s home, but 
occasionally participants chose the home of relatives, 
a senior center, health care facility, or another site. At 
this point, project staff assigned participants to the 
appropriate form of intervention. One-to-one inter- 
views, administered to all participants, allowed staff to 
complete the consent form and the study instruments at 
each of the three time points. Individuals trained in 
social work and gerontology conducted the interviews. 
The project employed Spanish- and Russian-speaking 
social workers as needed to conduct interviews as well 
as provide the interventions 
in linguistically and 
culturally appropriate ways. During the interviews, 
all items from the three outcome measures were read to 
the participants and answers recorded. Interviewers 
administered the items to 177 care receivers three times 
between January 2002 and August 2004: Time 1 data 
were collected between January 2002 and July 2003. 
Two months after the participants completed baseline 
administration, Time 2 data were collected. Twelve 
months after completion of the interventions, Time 3 
data were collected.

We used repeated measures analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) to assess overall treatment group differences 
using Time 1 measures as covariates. Prior to this anal- 
ysis, we conducted several preliminary assessments. 
First, we evaluated group differences on Time 1 mea- 
sures and on demographic variables to assess group 
equivalence prior to treatment. Second, we evaluated 
group differences in attrition from baseline to Time 3 
to assess whether there was differential attrition by 
treatment. Third, we assessed ANCOVA assumptions. 
In the case of ANCOVA assumption violations, we 
employed an alternative analysis. 
We tested the following planned hypotheses: (a) 
Combined CREI group means will be signiﬁcantly 
higher than the case management group mean at Time 
2 and Time 3 (Hypothesis 1); (b) The mean for the 
small-group CREI will differ signiﬁcantly from the 
mean for the individual CREI (Hypothesis 2; there were 
no a priori expectations regarding direction of effect); 
and (c) There will be a signiﬁcant interaction between 
group and time, suggesting a statistically signiﬁcant 
increase over time for both CREI versions, but not for 
the case management group (Hypothesis 3). 


We found no statistically signiﬁcant differences (p , 
.05) among the three groups for age, marital status, 
gender, ethnicity, income, or health status. We found 
statistically signiﬁcant differences for type of residence 
and living status. Case management group participants 
were more likely to live in assisted living facilities than 
CREI participants, who were more likely to live in their 
own or a relative’s home, v2(8, N ¼ 177) ¼ 31.45, p , 
.001. Given signiﬁcant differences among treatment 
groups by type of residence, we conducted exploratory 
time, and type of 
analyses with treatment group, 
residence as factors. 
We found no statistically signiﬁcant Time 1 group 
differences on the PGCMS total score or subscales or 
on any of the CRES subscales. 
Differences in Attrition by Group and by 
Demographic Variables 
Sample sizes for the three groups at Times 1, 2, and 
3 were as follows: individual treatment—49, 41, 35; 
group treatment—71, 62, 51; and case management 
group—57, 51, 44. We found no statistically signiﬁcant 
association between group and attrition. Participants 
dropped out because of death (15), illness (19), move 
(10), or no desire to be in the study (3). 
There were no statistically signiﬁcant associations 
between attrition and type of residence, marital status, 
gender, ethnicity, or health status. There was a statis- 
tically signiﬁcant association between income level and 
remaining in the study. Those participants in income 
categories $11,064 and above were less likely to remain 
in the study, whereas those participants in income 
categories below $11,064 were more likely to remain in 
the study, v2 (3, N ¼ 147 ¼ 9.47, p ¼ .024. 

We used repeated measures ANCOVAs to assess 
signiﬁcance of the main effects of time, group, and the 
interaction between time and group when means were 
adjusted for baseline (Time 1) differences. ANCOVA 



assumptions were met, but no statistically signiﬁcant 
effects were found for the CRES subscales Perceptions 
of Dependence or Accepting Help, or for the Agitation 
and Attitude Toward Own Aging subscales of the 
PGCMS. Assumptions were met and main or in- 
teraction effects statistically signiﬁcant at p , .05 
were found for the CRES Relational Coping With 
Caregivers and the PGCMS Lonely Dissatisfaction 
subscales. Table 3 provides an abbreviated ANCOVA 
summary table and also displays the unadjusted and 
adjusted means and standard deviations by group for 
Times 1, 2, and 3 for measures yielding statistically 
signiﬁcant effects. Figures 1 and 2 present the results by 
group by time. Covariate-adjusted CREI group means 
increased, whereas case management means decreased 
or remained the same. CREI group means exceeded case 
management group means at Time 3, indicating overall 
gains for Relational Coping With Caregivers and the 
PGCMS Lonely Dissatisfaction subscale for the treat- 
ment groups but not for the case management group. 

The assumption of homogeneity of regression was 
violated for the CRES subscales Self-Care Strategies 
and Performance-Related Quality of Life and for the 
PGCMS total score. Therefore, we conducted an 
alternative analysis, a repeated measures analysis of 
variance (Keppel & Wickens, 2004). 
We found a statistically signiﬁcant Treatment 
Group 3 Time interaction for Self-Care Strategies and 
Performance-Related Quality of Life but not for the 
PGCMS. Table 4 displays the abbreviated analysis of 
variance summary table and provides the means and 
standard deviations for group by time. In these ana- 
lyses, the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and 
sphericity (Greenhouse–Geisser epsilon . .80) were 
upheld. Figures 3 and 4 present results by group by 
time. CREI group means increased over time, whereas 
case management means decreased, indicating overall 
gains for treatments groups in Self-Care Strategies and 
Performance-Related Quality of Life with decreases for 
the case management group. 

Hypothesis 1.—The complex comparison of com- 
bined CREI approaches (small group and individual) to 
the case management approach yielded statistical 
signiﬁcance (p , .05) at Times 2 and 3. At Time 2, 
we found statistically different differences between 
CREI and case management conditions for Relational 
Coping With Caregivers and Performance-Related 
Quality of Life. The combined mean for the treatment 
groups exceeded the mean for the case management 
group. At Time 3, for Self-Care Strategies, Relational 
Coping With Caregivers, and Performance-Related 
Quality of Life, the combined mean for the treatment 
groups exceeded the mean for the case management 
group. Hypothesis 1 was partially supported, with 
for Relational 
signiﬁcant advantage to treatment 



Coping With Caregivers, Self-Care Strategies, and 
Performance-Related Quality of Life. 
Hypothesis 2.—We found a statistically signiﬁcant 
difference (p , .05) between means for the small-group 
versus individual CREI at Time 2 for Perceptions of 
Dependence, with the mean for the small-group CREI 
participants exceeding the mean for the individual 
CREI participants (Mgroup ¼ 3.77, Mindividual ¼ 3.31), 
indicating stronger negative views of dependence for 
the small-group participants. This difference was also 
signiﬁcant at Time 3, with the small-group mean again 
exceeding the mean for the individual CREI (Mgroup ¼ 
3.80, Mindividual ¼ 3.29). At Time 3, we found 
a statistically signiﬁcant difference between means for 
the small-group versus individual CREI for Relational

Coping With Caregivers, with the mean for the small- 
group CREI exceeding the mean for individual CREI 
(Mgroup ¼ 4.10, Mindividual ¼ 3.82). Comparisons 
between the individual and small-group interventions 
that yielded statistically signiﬁcant results favored the 
group form of the CREI except that the small-group 
participants held more negative views of dependence 
than the individual CREI participants. 
Hypothesis 3.—We found statistically signiﬁcant 
(p , .05) Treatment Group 3 Time interactions 
for Lonely Dissatisfaction, Self-Care Strategies, and 
Performance-Related Quality of Life, yielding support 
for Hypothesis 3 for those measures. Follow-up simple 
effects analyses indicated statistically signiﬁcant differ- 
ences of time only for the CRES subscale Performance- 
Related Quality of Life (g2 ¼ .06) for the individual 
form of the CREI. For the small-group CREI, we found 
statistically signiﬁcant differences by time for the CRES 
subscales Self-Care Strategies, Relational Coping With 
Caregivers, Performance-Related Quality of Life, and 
Accepting Help. Means increased from Times 1 to 3 for 
Self-Care Strategies, g2 ¼ .14; for Relational Coping 
With Caregivers, g2 ¼ .10; for Performance-Related 
Quality of Life, g2 ¼ .13; and for Accepting Help 
(MTime1 ¼ 3.75, MTime2 ¼ 3.88, MTime3 ¼ 3.95; g2 ¼ .04). 
(Means by group by time are in Tables 3 and 4 or are 
provided above.) We found no statistically signiﬁcant 
simple effects of time for the case management group. 
In all cases of a signiﬁcant Group 3 Time interaction, 
the pattern of change over time favored the CREI 
groups, whereby the means increased relative to stable 
or decreasing means for the case management group. 

Due to small cell sample sizes resulting from 
crossing the factors time, treatment group, and type 
of residence (cell ns ranged from 8 to 24), these analyses 
are tentative. We gave primary attention to the three- 
way interaction term to see if treatment effects over 
time varied by residence type. We found one statisti- 
cally signiﬁcant (p , .05) three-way interaction for 
Performance-Related Quality of Life, with g2 equal to 
.079. Although we again found gains for the CREI 
groups and not for the case management group, the 
pattern of gains differed for individuals receiving care 
at home, in a facility, or in their retirement community. 
We found the greatest gains for CREI group partic- 
ipants who received care at home, whereas CREI 
individual participants’ gains were greatest in a re- 
tirement community setting. Both CREI forms were 
equally effective for persons in a care facility. 
We conducted one further analysis with gender as an 
added factor. We found no statistically signiﬁcant 
three-way interactions between gender, 
time, and 
treatment group. 

We used eight subscale scores and one total score as 
outcomes in this study. We found no statistically 



signiﬁcant effects of the interventions for ﬁve of these: 
the PGCMS Agitation and Attitude Toward Own 
Aging subscales, the PGCMS total score, and the CRES 
Perceptions of Dependence and Accepting Help sub- 
scales. We found statistically signiﬁcant effects for the 
remaining four measures: CRES Relational Coping 
With Caregivers, Self-Care Strategies, and Performance- 
Related Quality of Life subscales; and PGCMS Lonely 
Dissatisfaction subscale. In all cases, differences favored 
the CREI—small-group and individual forms—with 
moderate to large effect sizes (g2 ¼ .05–.11). The 
strongest effects of the CREI (both versions) were on 
Relational Coping With Caregivers and Performance- 
Related Quality of Life. Exploratory analyses resulted 
in a signiﬁcant three-way interaction between type of 
residence, treatment group, and time with Performance- 
Related Quality of Life as the dependent variable, 
suggesting the potential for varying efﬁcacy of CREI 
form depending upon residential setting. 
We found some differences between the two forms 
of the CREI. In the small-group version, participants 
(a) were somewhat, but not signiﬁcantly, more likely to 
be living in a retirement community than at home; (b) 
reported signiﬁcantly stronger perceptions of depen- 
dence; but also (c) had signiﬁcantly more positive 
scores on Relational Coping With Caregivers than did 
participants in the individual version. 
Differences over time indicated positive change, with 
a large effect size for both forms of the CREI for 
Performance-Related Quality of Life. The care re- 
ceivers in the small-group CREI also demonstrated 
signiﬁcant positive change over time for the other 
CRES subscales (excluding Perceptions of Depen- 
dence); and again, effect sizes were large. 

The absence of signiﬁcant effects of treatments on 
two PGCMS subscales and the CRES subscale Percep- 
tions of Dependence were in line with expectations. 
Signiﬁcant effects were anticipated but not found for 
the PGCMS total score and for the CRES subscale 
Accepting Help. The reliability of Perceptions of 
Dependence and Accepting Help were lower than 
reliabilities for other CRES subscales, which may 
have contributed to the lack of signiﬁcant ﬁndings 
with respect to those two measures. Lack of signiﬁcant 
ﬁndings for those subscales may also simply reﬂect the 
difﬁculty inherent in aging and in losing one’s in- 
dependence to become dependent on others. The 
PGCMS total score had adequate reliability, but it 
was generated by adding scores on three subscales. For 
two of those subscales, we had not expected to ﬁnd any 
effects; hence, we should have anticipated failure to 
ﬁnd signiﬁcance with the total score. 
We found signiﬁcant effects for the CRES subscales 
Relational Coping With Caregivers, Self-Care Strate- 
gies, and Performance-Related Quality of Life. With 
respect to the speciﬁc objectives that guided inter- 
vention creation, 
the study demonstrated success 
with respect to all objectives except lack of effects 


on coping with dependence and accepting help. The 
intervention seemed successful in moving participants 
toward positive action but not toward any positive 
attitude toward dependence. That goal may be un- 
realistic. 
Overall, as shown in the ﬁgures, both forms of the 
CREI were effective in enhancing elderly care receivers’ 
self-care strategies, performance related to quality of 
life, and late-life satisfaction (i.e., resulted in less 
loneliness). In particular, the small-group CREI was the 
most effective at improving care receivers’ self-efﬁcacy 
in the areas of relational coping with their caregivers 
and performance related to quality of life. The sig- 
niﬁcant differences between the outcomes of the small- 
group CREI and individual CREI were not anticipated 
but were encouraging in that the group intervention is 
more economical to provide. The strong effect of group 
support and sharing of common issues and coping 
strategies appeared to be an important factor. Twelve 
months after the intervention ended, scores for the 
small-group CREI showed a more positive increase 
than we had expected. We had anticipated that scores 
would level off or even decline, but scores for the small- 
group CREI continued to increase. 
A number of limitations of this study need to be 
addressed in future studies. First, the quasi-experimental 
design used in this study was necessitated because some 
individuals simply could not attend group meetings. 
The limitations placed on random assignment resulted in 
a difference in residence type across groups. Although 
too small a number of cases was available in this 
study to provide an adequate test, analyses indicated 
that residence type may have differentially affected 
outcomes of the two forms of the CREI. Future study 
would ideally employ a randomized design, with sufﬁ- 
ciently large samples to investigate the effects of factors 
such as residence type, extent of need for care, length of 
time care has been needed, and availability of family 
member support. 
A quantitative instrument to assess caregiver per- 
ceptions is needed. One overall goal of the CREI is to 
improve caregiver as well as care receiver experiences. 
The ﬁndings of this study, coupled with the qualitative 
responses collected from participants and their care- 
givers, call attention to the potential of care receiver 
interventions to improve quality of care as well as to 
alleviate stress of caregivers. More resources and atten- 
tion should be directed to assisting care receivers with 
the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to be 
active partners in their care. Further intervention 
research is needed to implement, evaluate, and modify 
the CREI with more culturally diverse care receivers, 
and to more effectively address care receivers’ skills 
in coping with increasing dependence. Overall, efforts 
need to be made to increase policy and program 
support for interventions targeting care receivers as 
well as caregivers to enhance effective partnerships as 
they engage in care process interventions. The CREI 
group method can be especially effective in senior 
housing facilities, senior centers, senior health clinics, 
and other settings that allow easy access to older adults 
who are experiencing disability and a need for personal 
care. The CREI individual method can provide out- 
reach to persons unable or unwilling to access group 
settings.
