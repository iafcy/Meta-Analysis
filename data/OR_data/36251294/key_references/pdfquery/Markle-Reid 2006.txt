Health promotion for frail older home care clients 
Aim. This paper reports a study evaluating the comparative effects and costs of a 
proactive nursing health promotion intervention in addition to usual home care for 
older people compared with usual home care services alone. 
Background. An ageing population, budget constraints and technological advances 
in many countries have increased the pressure on home care resources. The result is 
a shift in nursing services from health promotion to meet the more pressing need for 
postacute care. For frail older people with long-term needs, these changes combine 
to create a fragmented system of health service delivery, characterized by providing 
nursing on demand rather than proactively. 
Methods. A two-armed, single-blind, randomized controlled trial was carried out 
with older people ‡75 years and eligible for personal support services through a 
home care programme in Ontario, Canada. Participants were randomly allocated 
either to usual home care (control) or to a nursing (experimental) group. In addition 
to usual home care, the nursing group received a health assessment combined with 
regular home visits or telephone contacts, health education about management of 
illness, coordination of community services, and use of empowerment strategies to 
enhance independence. The data were collected in 2001–2002. 
Results. Of the 288 older people who were randomly allocated at baseline, 242 
(84%) completed the study (120 nursing group; 122 control group). Proactively 
providing older people with nursing health promotion, compared with providing 



nursing services on-demand, 
resulted in better mental health functioning 
(P ¼ 0Æ009), a reduction in depression (P ¼ 0Æ009), and enhanced perceptions of 
social support (P ¼ 0Æ009) at no additional cost from a societal perspective. 
Conclusions. Home based nursing health promotion, proactively provided to frail 
older people with chronic health needs, enhances quality of life while not increasing 
the overall costs of health care. The results underscore the need to re-invest in 
nursing services for health promotion for older clients receiving home care.

An ageing population, technological advances and budget 
constraints have led to major healthcare reforms worldwide. 
Extensive reform initiatives have given rise to fewer acute 
care hospitals and increasing pressure to continue to expand 
and enhance home care services for older, more vulnerable, 
and frail 
individuals within the conﬁnes of economic 
constraint (Bergman et al. 1997, Anderson & Hussey 2000, 
United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 
Population Division 2002). Formal home care has expanded, 
such that the proportion of persons over 65 receiving home 
care now substantially outweighs the proportion receiving 
health services through residential institutions (Anderson & 
Hussey 2000). The result of 
these trends is increasing 
competition for scarce home care resources. Home care 
programmes have responded to this increased demand for 
their services by shifting the provision of care from health 
promotion and preventive functions, for individuals with 
chronic health needs, to substitution functions to meet the 
more pressing need for postacute care (Soderstrom et al. 
1999, Merlis 2000). Notably, nursing is the professional 
service most frequently reported as being reduced or elimin- 
ated by home care programmes for older people with chronic 
needs (Phillips 1988, Canadian Nurses Association 1998). 
Substitution of relatively inexpensive home care nursing 
services for inpatient acute care offers the prospect of 
improved health 
savings, as well as 
considerable cost 
outcomes (Soderstrom et al. 1999, Johri et al. 2003).Yet 
the efﬁciency resulting from this shift from preventive nursing 
functions to acute care substitution functions remains unclear 
(Parr 1996, Jacobzone 2000). On the contrary, a number of 
studies, done mostly in a national system of health insurance, 
suggest that for older people with chronic health needs, these 
trends combine to create a fragmented system of healthcare 
services 
delivery, 
on-demand rather than a comprehensive and proactive 
system of care (Browne et al. 2001b, Johri et al. 2003). 




Typically, on-demand care is less effective and more costly 
than providing comprehensive care. Delays or errors in 
detecting and responding to chronically ill older people’s 
changing health needs can contribute to more complications, 
cause functional decline and negative changes in quality of 
life (Fletcher & Bulpitt 2000), and an increased demand for 
healthcare services (Browne et al. 2001b). 
Older adults, and in particular frail older adults, are 
particularly vulnerable. In Canada, 75–80% of home care 
users are older adults (Roos et al. 2001). They are typically 
over 75 years of age, and have co-occurring health problems, 
which are acute and chronic in nature, as well as functional 
disabilities. Their social support networks are frequently 
overextended or at risk of breaking down (Johri et al. 2003). 
Additionally, 
the prevalence of depression among those 
receiving home care is estimated to be between 26% and 
44% – at least twice that among older people in general (Illife 
et al. 1993). These factors lead to comparatively greater risk 
for increased morbidity, 
institutional and general health 
service utilization and death (Gill & Sharpe 1999). 
Recent reports on the future direction of health policy in 
Canada (Kirby & LeBreton 2002, Romanow 2002, Health 
Canada 2003) emphasize the need to coordinate and target 
the most 
home care services based on evidence about 
beneﬁcial and efﬁcient mix of services (type of provider and 
dose). This evidence is needed to ensure that the most 
appropriate services are available to those who most need 
them, to ensure the best health outcomes (Shapiro 2003). 
However, there is little information available to inform policy 
makers as they attempt to restructure how home care services 
are provided (Soderstrom et al. 1999, Fassbender 2000). 

Home care nurses are well placed to promote the health of 
frail older people and carry out preventive functions (Byles 
2000, Elkan et al. 2001). Although there is promising 
evidence from trials conducted to evaluate the effects and 




of professional nursing services for home care clients with 
chronic needs allowed for a natural comparison of the effects 
of a proactive service with the effects of on-demand use of 
these services. Our hypothesis was that this model of care 
delivery would result in improved functional health status 
and quality of life, a reduction in depression, and an increase 
in coping and perceptions of social support at no additional 
cost from a societal point of view. 

The model of vulnerability (Rogers 1997) provided the 
theoretical basis for the development and evaluation of a 
proactive nursing health promotion intervention. Vulnerab- 
ility is a net result of an interaction between the person’s 
intellectual and 
personal resources (cognitive, emotional, 
(social, 
behavioural) and their environmental 
material and cultural), both of which, along with biological 
characteristics (age, gender and genetic endowment), are 
determinants of health. Within an individual, personal 
resources and environmental supports intersect, as shown in 
Figure 1, and can be synergistic and cumulative (Browne et al. 
2001b). The base of the triangle represents the degree of 
vulnerability (Rogers 1997), and thus also their health status 
and quality of life. Based on published evidence (Browne 
et al. 1999), we hypothesized that the costs of health and 


costs of preventive in-home nursing care of older people in 
terms of reducing hospital admissions and lengths of stay 
(Hendriksen et al. 1984, Zimmer et al. 1985, Hall et al. 1992, 
Pathy et al. 1992, Bernabei et al. 1998), improving functional 
status (Pathy et al. 1992, Stuck et al. 1995, Bernabei et al. 
1998, Stuck et al. 2000), reducing mortality (Hendriksen et al. 
1984, Vetter et al. 1984, Hall et al. 1992, Pathy et al. 1992), 
decreasing admission to long-term institutional care (Gunner- 
Svensson et al. 1984, Zimmer et al. 1985, Hall et al. 1992, 
Stuck et al. 1995, Bernabei et al. 1998,), reducing depression 
(Bernabei et al. 1998), increasing use of health and social 
services (Hendriksen et al. 1984, Vetter et al. 1984, Pathy et al. 
1992, van Rossum et al. 1993, Stuck et al. 1995, 2000), 
reducing cost (Hendriksen et al. 1984, Zimmer et al. 1985, 
Stuck et al. 1995, Bernabei et al. 1998, Stuck et al. 2000), and 
improving caregiver outcomes (Zimmer et al. 1985), there are 
methodological shortcomings in many of these studies. 
There is a lack of research that documents the effectiveness 
of an in-home health promotion intervention on quality of 
life, mental health (depression), perceptions of social support, 
or examines speciﬁc sub-groups of home care recipients who 
beneﬁt most (Markle-Reid 2002). Although several of the 
studies suggested cost savings, 
the costs are limited to 
reductions in admissions to institutions rather than examin- 
ing the use and costs of the full range of health services. 
Economists argue that the effect of a home care service on 
society as a whole should be considered when making 
decisions about the use of that service (Gold et al. 1996). 
The interventions in these trials are limited in their primary 
focus on preventive care strategies rather than on health 
promotion. To date, research in this area has largely taken a 
deﬁcit approach, focussing on illness and disease prevention 
strategies, to minimize the risks of chronic diseases and 
debilitation associated with ageing (Pender et al. 2002) vs. a 
strengths orientation focussing on health promotion and 
expanding an individual’s positive potential for health (Caelli 
et al. 2003). Yet the data suggests that a combination of 
approaches is needed to enhance health and well-being and 
contribute to maximizing older person’s independence (Hodg- 
son et al. 1996, World Health Organization 1998, McWilliam 
et al. 2000). Furthermore, many of the interventions are 
staffed by different types of providers in addition to nursing 
(i.e. lay community workers and geriatricians), thus, limiting 
their ability to identify how the type and quality of nursing 
involvement contributes to the outcomes of the studies. 
This study was designed to address these gaps in know- 
ledge by examining the comparative effects and costs of a 
proactive nursing health promotion intervention for frail 
older home care clients in addition to usual home care, 
compared with usual home care services alone. The rationing

social services increase proportionately with the level of

developed by Rogers (1997) was extended to include a 
health services index. 


The aim of the study was to evaluate the comparative effects 
and costs of a proactive nursing health promotion interven- 
tion in addition to usual home care for older people 
compared with usual home care services alone. 

This was a two-armed, single-blind, randomized controlled 
trial of proactive nursing health promotion in addition to 
usual home care vs. usual home care services alone for frail 
older people. Eligible and consenting participants were 
randomized to one of two treatment strategies, using a 
computerized randomization schedule, which randomly 
assigns subjects to two groups to ensure equal numbers at 
baseline in both groups. The data were collected in 2001– 
2002. 

The sample size was calculated to detect a clinically import- 
ant difference of ﬁve points in mean change scores between 
groups in the SF-36 mental health component summary score 
(Ware & Kosinski 2001). A sample size of 276 (138 older 
people per arm) was estimated to be sufﬁcient to address this 
primary outcome including an allowance of an additional 
(two-tailed alpha ¼ 0Æ05; be- 
20% to offset drop-outs 
ta ¼ 0Æ20). 


Study participants were 75 years of age or older and newly 
referred to and eligible for personal 
services 
through the Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) in 
Ontario, Canada. The CCAC provides publicly funded 
home care using a contractual model of service delivery. In 
this model, publicly funded employees (case managers) 
contract out home care services to agencies which provide 
care to clients. CCACs also provide long-term care facility 
placement, and information and referral to other commu-

they required 
if 
services 
eligible for personal 

assistance with personal care. Personal care may be 
support 
provided either by a caregiver or a personal 
worker contracted by the CCAC. Potential study partici- 
pants were excluded if 
they refused to give informed 
consent, were unable to understand English or if they were 
deemed eligible for nursing services. At study start-up, 63% 
of CCAC clients eligible for personal support services in 
this CCAC were 75 years of age and older. 

Both study groups received usual home care services. The 
interventions are described below. 
Usual home care services 
Home care services in Ontario, Canada consisted of case 
management, personal care, home support (or homemaking), 
nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social work 
and speech language therapy through community-based 
agencies (MacAdam 2000). While this full array of services 
was in place, funding cutbacks during the time of the study 
resulted in rationing and waiting lists for both professional 
and non-professional home care services. The CCAC Case 
Manager determined eligibility and priority level for home 
care services and the amount and type of home care services 
required based on set criteria. Because of growing caseloads 
(ratio of 1:150 case managers to clients at study start-up), 
there was minimal case planning available for study partici- 
pants. 

Nursing group: proactive nursing health promotion 
A detailed description of the intervention can be found 
elsewhere (Markle-Reid 2002). The model of vulnerability 
provided the conceptual approach to the study intervention 
(Rogers 1997). The main goal of the intervention was to 
bolster the participant’s personal resources and environ- 
mental supports in order to reduce the level of vulnerab- 
ility, enhance health and quality of life, and reduce the 
on-demand use of 
resources. A 
Registered Nurse from a community-nursing agency visited 
the home or contacted participants by phone over a 
6-month period. The nurses had basic education and held a 
general class registration license through the College of 
Nurses of Ontario. Strategies for bolstering personal re- 
sources included: conducting an initial and ongoing health 
assessment, 
for 
functional decline (i.e. depression, dementia, polypharmacy 
and co-occurring illnesses) (Stuck et al. 1999), and provi- 
ding health education regarding healthy lifestyles, and 
the management of chronic illnesses using a participatory 






approach. A participatory approach to enhancing health 
involved the use of empowerment strategies designed to 
promote positive attitudes, knowledge and skills to main- 
tain and enhance health (Maville & Huerta 2002), and 
enhance self-efﬁcacy and participation (McWilliam et al. 
2000). Strategies 
supports 
included referral to and coordination of community servi- 
ces, building a trusting, supportive and meaningful rela- 
client and his/her 
caregiver, and 
tionship with the 
providing caregiver 
inﬂuencing health 
support. Factors 
were identiﬁed and addressed together with clients, through 
the development of a health plan, which included speciﬁc 
short-term and 6-month goals. 

Trained interviewers, blinded to the purpose of the study and 
the treatment assignment, obtained baseline (prerandomiza- 
tion) and follow-up outcome assessments at 6 months from 
the participants. Data were collected from February 2001 to 
June 2002. Table 1 shows the study variables and their 
measures. Participants completed the questionnaires at struc- 
tured in-home interviews. 
Participant characteristics 
Sociodemographic information was obtained at baseline, 
including age, gender, education, culture, 
living 
arrangements and medical diagnosis. 

Engagement rate (measure of dose of intervention) 
For the nursing health promotion intervention, engagement 
was deﬁned as at least one home visit or telephone contact 
that lasted for ‡10 minutes. 

Functional health status and quality of life 
Functional health status and related quality of life were 
assessed using the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 
(SF-36) Health Survey (Ware et al. 2000). Several studies 
using the SF-36 have established content, concurrent, con- 
struct, criterion and predictive validity of the measure in a 
variety of 
including older people 
(McHorney et al. 1993, 1994). The SF-36 consists of eight 
scales that assess the following dimensions of health: phys- 
ical functioning, role limitations related to physical prob- 
lems, bodily pain, general health perception, energy/vitality, 
social functioning, and role limitations related to emotional 
problems and mental health (Ware & Gandek 1998). Each 
of these eight scales is scored separately on a scale of 0–100, 
the higher the score, the more favourable the health status. 
These eight scales contribute to two summary scores, the 
Physical Health Component Summary and Mental Health 
Component Summary (Ware & Kosinski 2001) that are 
reliable and reﬂect of the eight dimensions (Jenkinson et al. 
1997). 
Mental health (presence of depression) 
Mental health (presence of depression) was assessed using the 
Center for Epidemiological Studies in Depression Scale (CES- 
D) (Radloff 1977). The CES-D scale is a 20-item self-reported 
questionnaire that assesses the current frequency of depres- 
sive symptoms. Total scores can range from 0 to 60; the 
higher the score, the more depressed. It was chosen as a 
measure of depression because of its applicability to the 
population (Davidson et al. 1994, Irwin et al. 1999), prior 
use in studies of adults with mood disorders (Davidson et al. 
1994, Roberts et al. 1997), high degree of reliability 
(Himmelfarb & Murrell 1983), and validity (Santor et al.

1995). In support of its validity, the CES-D has been shown 
to have good internal consistency for the general population 
(Corcoran & Fisher 1987) correlates strongly with the Beck 
Depression Inventory (Santor et al. 1995), and distinguishes 
between depressed vs. non-depressed people (Schein & 
Koenig 1997). 



Perceived social support 
Perception of social support (subjective) was assessed using 
the Personal Resource Questionnaire 85 (part two) (Weinert 
& Brandt 1987). The PRQ85 – part two is a 25-item scale 
that measures perceived social support along ﬁve dimensions: 
integration, 
provision 
opportunity for nurturing behaviour, reassurance of worth as 
an individual and in role accomplishments, and the availab- 
ility of informational, emotional and material help. The total 
scale score was calculated and reported for each participant. 
The maximum score that can be attained is 175 – the greater 
the score, the greater the perception of social support. This 
measure was chosen because of its applicability to the pop- 
ulation, prior use in studies involving older adults, and high 
degree of reliability, construct and content validity (Weinert 
& Brandt 1987). 
Coping style 
Coping style was assessed using the coping questionnaire 
(Moos et al. 1985). The coping questionnaire focuses on 
the cognitive and behavioural coping responses that indi- 
viduals use when a stressful event has occurred. Respond- 
ents are asked to rate their frequency of use of 33 different 
coping responses. Responses are classiﬁed into two major 
categories: the method of coping (active cognitive coping, 
active behavioural coping and avoidance coping), and the 
focus of coping (problem solving, 
logical analysis, emo- 
tional distress, affective regulation and information seek- 
ing). In support of its validity, the coping questionnaire has 
been shown to have good internal consistency, and con- 
struct validity based on a general population (Moos et al. 
1985). 
Costs 
The Health and Social Service Utilization Inventory was used 
to tally the frequency of self-reported use of all types of health 
services by study participants in the previous 2 weeks 
(Browne et al. 2001a). The 2-week frequency was annualized 
and multiplied by the dollar value of the service and summed 
as a per person dollar measure of utilization compared 
between the two groups. This measure has been previously 
tested and assessed for reliability and validity (Browne et al. 
2001a). 

Ethics approval 
for the study was obtained from the 
McMaster University Research and Ethics Board and 
renewed yearly as required. Informed consent was obtained 
from all study participants. An information letter outlining 
the purpose of the study, expectations of the participants, and 
beneﬁts and risks, were given to potential participants prior 
to obtaining consent. Participants were assured that their 
decision about participation would not affect the care and 
services they would receive from the CCAC. They were 
assured that the data would be reported in aggregate form 
without the ability to identify speciﬁc individuals, and would 
be kept conﬁdential and used only for the purpose of the 
study analysis. Participants were also assured of their right to 
withdraw from the study for any reason, at any time, without 
penalty of any sort (and without loss of access to relevant 
services). 

Data analysis was done using SPSS 11.0 for Windows. 
Participants who completed the 6-month follow-up were 
compared with those who dropped out on baseline charac- 
teristics. Participants in each group retained at 6-months 
were also compared on baseline characteristics. The direction 
and impact of any differences or biases on results were 
examined. The level of statistical signiﬁcance for all tests was 
alpha <0Æ05. The hypothesis of effectiveness and efﬁciency 
was tested in a two-group comparison of all participants who 
completed the 6-month follow-up using intention-to-treat 
analysis (Jadad 1998). Chi-square, Kruskal–Wallis tests, 
independent t-tests, and repeated measures analysis of vari- 
ance were used to compare proportions or mean scores in the 
two groups. The frequency of using different types of health 
services in each group were described and quantiﬁed as a 
Canadian dollar value (Can$1 ¼ US$0Æ641, £0Æ445 and 
€0Æ717). 

Of the 577 older home care clients eligible to participate in 
the study, a total of 288 (49Æ9%) were successfully recruited 
and randomized (273 refusals; 16 unable to locate). The 
study ﬂow diagram (Figure 2) summarizes the disposition of 
participants throughout the study. The baseline characteris- 
tics of the 289 non-consenters were not available due to their 
refusal to provide informed consent to participate in the 
study. As outlined in Figure 2, the loss of 46 participants by 
the 6-month follow-up resulted in a 16Æ7% drop-out rate in 




Figure 2 Study ﬂow diagram. *For the

the nursing group and a 15Æ3% drop-out rate in the usual care 
group at the end of the follow-up period. Reasons for loss to 
follow-up included death (37%), unable to locate or phys- 
ically unable to participate (37%), and refused to participate 
(26%). 
Chi-square, independent t-tests and Kruskal–Wallis tests 
were used to compare drop-outs with those participants 
retained at the 6-month follow-up (i.e. completers) on their 
characteristics at baseline. Completers were similar to drop- 
outs (P > 0Æ05) 
in their age, cognitive status, marital 
income level, number of medications taken daily, 
status, 
ethnicity, 
type of health disorders, % living with and 
receiving help from an informal care provider, % living in 
a retirement home, % with more than one health disorder, 
% with depression, % with one or more hospital admis- 
sions in the last 6 months, and % reporting physical 
discomfort that limited activities of daily living. A greater 
proportion of completers were female (76Æ9%) compared to 
drop-outs (63%; v2 ¼ 3Æ90; d.f. ¼ 1; P ¼ 0Æ048). Compl- 
eters in comparison with drop-outs reported higher scores 
in overall physical functioning [mean difference 9Æ45; 95% 
t ¼ 3Æ421, 
conﬁdence 
P ¼ 0Æ001], mental health functioning (mean difference 
9Æ95; 95% CI 2Æ33, 17Æ58; t ¼ 2Æ615, P ¼ 0Æ011), problem 
solving (mean difference 1Æ06; 95% CI 0Æ04, 2Æ08; 
t ¼ 2Æ050, P ¼ 0Æ041), and a lower per person cost of 
family physicians or walk-in clinics (v2 ¼ 6Æ434; d.f. ¼ 1; 
P ¼ 0Æ011). 




Chi-square, independent t-tests and Kruskal–Wallis tests 
were used to compare the two groups of study participants 
retained in the 6-month follow-up on their characteristics at 
baseline. Participants in the nursing group, compared with 
the usual care group, reported, at baseline, lower scores in 
role functioning related to emotional health (mean difference 
(cid:1)10Æ08; 95% CI 2Æ53, 17Æ61; Table 2), and lower scores in 
mental health functioning (mean difference (cid:1)10Æ6; 95% CI 
5Æ13,16Æ07). It would appear that the respondents in the 
nursing group, who participated in the 6-month follow-up, 
were somewhat more disadvantaged than those in usual care 
with respect to mental health functioning. Additional details 
on client baseline variables for the two study groups are 
presented in Table 2. 

A visiting nurse engaged 84Æ7% of those older participants 
who were randomly allocated to the nursing intervention at 
baseline or time 1 (n ¼ 144) (Figure 2). Subjects randomized 
to the nursing group received a median of ﬁve home visits and 
one telephone contact over the 6-month follow-up compared 
with a median of zero nursing visits in usual care using 
(Mann–Whitney U ¼ 793Æ0; 
the Mann–Whitney U-test 
P < 0Æ001). The average duration of the visits was 1 hour. 
Notably, 90Æ8% of the sample randomized to the nursing 
group received care from the same nurse throughout the 
entire intervention period.

Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to 
compare the difference in mean change scores (T1 (cid:1) T2) 
in the two groups at 6-months. There was a statistically 
in the mental health 
signiﬁcantly greater 
component summary score in the nursing group than in 
the usual care group (mean difference (cid:1)6Æ32; 95% CI 





(cid:1)11Æ04 and (cid:1)1Æ59; Table 3). From baseline to the 6-month 
follow-up, participants in the nursing group experienced an 
increase in role functioning related to emotional health 
compared with a decrease in the usual care group (mean 
difference (cid:1)10Æ48; 95% CI (cid:1)18Æ87, (cid:1)2Æ09). Participants in 
the nursing group also experienced an increase in mental 
health functioning compared with a decrease in usual care 
(mean difference (cid:1)7Æ46; 95% CI (cid:1)12Æ60, (cid:1)2Æ32). There 
was a clinically important improvement in the score for 
physical 
functioning at 6-months in the nursing group 
compared with the usual care group (mean difference 
(cid:1)5Æ39; 95% CI (cid:1)11Æ13, 0Æ35).

*Negative values for differences in scores favour the nursing group. 




Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare 
the difference in mean change scores (T1 (cid:1) T2) in the two 
groups at 6-months. As indicated in Table 2, 25Æ6% of the 
participants were assessed with depression at baseline. From 
baseline to the 6-month follow-up, there was a statistically 
signiﬁcantly greater reduction in the depressive symptom 
scores in the nursing group compared with the usual care 
group (mean difference 2Æ72; 95% CI 0Æ39, 5Æ07; Table 4). 
This difference in the prevalence of depressive symptoms 
translated into a clinically important reduction in the number 
of clients who were depressed in the nursing group (16Æ8%) 
compared with usual care (11Æ3%) (v2 ¼ 2Æ83; d.f. ¼ 3; 
P ¼ 0Æ419), using a cut-off score of ‡21. 

Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare 
the difference in mean change scores (T1 (cid:1) T2) in the two 
groups at 6-months. There was a statistically signiﬁcant 
increase in the perceived social support scores in the nursing 
group compared with a reduction in the usual care group 
(mean difference (cid:1)5Æ26; 95% CI (cid:1)9Æ18, (cid:1)1Æ34; Table 4). 
However, from baseline to the 6-month follow-up, there was 
no statistically signiﬁcant or clinically important difference in 
coping styles between the two groups. 

Using Kruskal–Wallis test, there was no statistically signi- 
ﬁcant difference between the two groups in the mean 
cost of all types of health and social services, and the 
total annual per person direct costs of health services at 
6-months (v2 ¼ 0Æ001; d.f. ¼ 1; P ¼ 0Æ979). Noteworthy, is 
that although there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference 
in total costs, there was a statistically signiﬁcantly lower 
per person cost of prescription medications in the nursing 
group compared with usual care (v2 ¼ 5Æ718; d.f. ¼ 1; 
P ¼ 0Æ017). 


Healthcare planners argue that 
in home care 
function from health promotion and prevention to acute 
care substitution functions will improve health outcomes and 
reduce healthcare costs (Soderstrom et al. 1999, Chappell 
2001, Penning et al. 2002). This study demonstrates that this 
assumption is incorrect and untenable. On the contrary, 
nursing health promotion, provided to a general population 
of frail seniors, 25Æ6% of whom are depressed and 79Æ3% of 
whom are functionally limited, enhanced quality of life 
(deﬁned and measured to include mental health, depression 
and perceived social support) while not increasing the overall 
costs of health care, thus making the intervention highly 
feasible given its clinical beneﬁts. This study demonstrated 
that, with modest reorganization of the delivery of existing 
home services, statistically signiﬁcant enhancements in qual- 
ity of life can result. McWilliam et al. (1999) reported similar 
positive ﬁndings from a postdischarge health promotion 
intervention for chronically ill seniors, but the costs were 
limited to the use of acute hospitalization and home care 
services. Previous studies have only focussed on the use of 
institutional care and home care services as measures of cost 
(Hendriksen et al. 1984, Zimmer et al. 1985, Stuck et al. 
1995, Bernabei et al. 1998, Stuck et al. 2000). Thus, the 
present study is unique in that it measured the use and costs 
of the full range of health services.

At 6 months, compared with baseline, participants in the 
nursing group reported a greater improvement in physical 
functioning than the usual care participants. Given the fact 
that 79Æ3% of the participants were functionally limited to a 
moderate to severe degree, this is a clinically important gain 
for those receiving nursing health promotion. Other studies 
have reported similar positive effects on functional health 
status (Stuck et al. 1995, Bernabei et al. 1998, Stuck et al. 
2000) and self-rated physical health (Pathy et al. 1992), but 
only two of 
these studies involved a health promotion 
intervention that was staffed by a nurse alone (Pathy et al. 
1992, Stuck et al. 2000). 
As expected, improvements in physical functioning in the 
nursing group resulted in a statistically signiﬁcantly greater 
reduction in depressive symptom scores, and a statistically 
signiﬁcantly greater improvement in overall mental health 
functioning for participants in the nursing group compared 
with those in usual care. Given the lower level of mental 
health functioning in the nursing group at baseline, this is 
statistically signiﬁcant gain for those receiving nursing health 
promotion. Bernabei et al. (1998) reported similar positive 
ﬁndings but the intervention was provided by a multidisci- 
plinary geriatric team. Unrecognized, untreated and under 
treated mood disorders such as depression increase the risk of 
functional decline and the use of expensive healthcare 
resources (Stuck et al. 1999). The study results provide 
support for including depression screening and management 
as a component of a nursing health promotion program for 
frail older people as a means of decreasing morbidity, 
enhancing quality of life and promoting the appropriate use 
of health services. 
At 6 months, compared with baseline, participants in the 
nursing group reported a statistically signiﬁcantly lower cost 
of prescription medications. This ﬁnding is noteworthy, given 
the fact that nearly 50% of all medications used by older 
people are used inappropriately, and almost 25% of hospital 
admissions of older people are due to medication problems 
(Halton Region Health Department 2004). In summary, the 
ﬁndings underscore the need to re-invest 
in Registered 
Nursing services for health promotion including disease 
prevention for frail older home care clients with chronic 
needs. 
This trial is unique in that it was designed and evaluated 
using a theoretical model. Previous studies lack a theoretical 
foundation. As a result, it is difﬁcult to assess the appropri- 
ateness of the intervention to the outcomes being measured, 
or to formulate hypotheses regarding why or how a particular 
intervention should be expected to result in a particular 
outcome (Pawson & Tiley 1997). The study results provide 
empirical support for the positive synergistic and cumulative 
effects of bolstering personal resources (physical and mental 
health functioning) and environmental supports (perceived 
social support) on health status and related quality of life 
(Rogers 1997) to considerable economic effect (no additional 
cost). Future intervention studies need to incorporate a 
theoretical model, and focus more on the process of 
delivering care to identify the relative contribution of each 
component of the intervention, and the synergistic effect of 
the sum of the parts (Elkan et al. 2001). 
Our results support and extend the literature regarding best 
practice guidelines for providing nursing health promotion to 
older home care clients. Key recommendations include a 
ﬂexible, client centred and interdisciplinary approach to care 
delivery, an initial and ongoing health assessment (including 
depression screening), combined with regular home visits or 
telephone contacts (Elkan et al. 2001, Stuck et al. 2002), 
education regarding healthy lifestyles, and the management 
of chronic illnesses, referral to and coordination of commu- 
nity services (Rubenstein et al. 1991), and empowerment 
strategies designed to enhance independence and self-efﬁcacy 
(Robinson & Hill 1998, McWilliam et al. 2000). Our 
ﬁndings also underscore the importance of nurse–client 
relationships and continuity of care for positive outcomes 
(McWilliam et al. 1997, McNaughton 2000). 
We also examined the characteristics of participants (age, 
depression, living arrangement, availability of an informal 
caregiver, coping style and cognitive status), which may have 
interacted with the approach to treatment 
to explain 
improvement in SF-36 mental component summary score. 
There were no particular types of clients who beneﬁted more 
from nursing health promotion vs. usual home care services. 
This ﬁnding is consistent with Browne et al. (1999) in a 
review of 12 studies evaluating a community-based approach 
to care in Canada, who concluded that regardless of age, 
chronic illness or circumstance, setting or speciﬁc interven- 
tions, early proactive and comprehensive care is both more 
effective and no more expensive in a system of national health 
insurance. 

Although our large sample size, high retention and engage- 
ment rate were major strengths, a limitation of the study was 
the retention of a higher functioning group of older people 
when compared with dropouts. This may limit the general- 
izability of the results to lower functioning elders, speciﬁcally 
those with cognitive impairment. Since the study took place 
in a well-developed urban region in Ontario, the results may 
not be transferable to recipients of home care services living 
in rural areas or other environments (Birch & Gafni 2003). 





• Extensive health service reforms have given rise to a 
shift of home care nursing services from health pro- 
motion and preventive functions for older people with 
long-term health needs to short-term postacute care 
substitution functions. 
• These changing trends in the provision of home care 
combine to create a fragmented system of healthcare 
delivery, characterized by providing nursing services on 
an on-demand basis rather than proactively. 
• Typically, on-demand care is less effective and more 
costly because delays or errors in responding to chron- 
ically ill older people’s changing health needs can con- 
tribute to functional decline and dependency that often 
leads to use of expensive healthcare resources. 

• Health promotion proactively provided by nurses to a 
general population of frail older home care clients, 
compared with providing nursing services on-demand, 
enhanced quality of life, mental health and social sup- 
port while not increasing the overall costs of health 
care. 
• Health service providers need to re-invest in nursing 
services for health promotion, including disease pre- 
vention, for older home care clients with long-term 
needs. 
• Effective nursing health promotion interventions should 
use a ﬂexible, client-centred and interdisciplinary 
approach to care delivery, continuity of care provider, 
comprehensive assessment combined with regular home 
visits, health education about management of chronic 
illnesses, and use of empowerment strategies designed 
to enhance self-care and independence. 
The CCAC Case Managers were aware of which participants 
were assigned to the nursing group. This was unavoidable 
and the only feasible means to conduct such a trial in a 
clinical setting without unduly disrupting service provision. 
Blinding was not 100% assured. Participants may have 
inadvertently alerted the interviewers of their assignment to 
the nursing group. The ﬁnding that there was no statistically 
signiﬁcant difference between the two groups in total annual 
per person cost of health and social services may be due to an 
insufﬁcient sample size and limited power to detect differ- 
ences in cost. Future trials with an economic evaluation are 
needed that have sufﬁcient power to detect differences in cost. 
In conclusion, nurses have an important role to play in 
providing health promotion to older home care clients with 
long-term healthcare needs. Our results suggest that with 
modest reorganization of the delivery of existing home care 
services, giving greater priority to nursing health promotion, 
frail older home care clients can experience improved quality 
of life at no additional cost to society as a whole. Implemen- 
tation of efﬁcient care reforms for older people requires a 
comprehensive rethinking of entire delivery systems (Hol- 
lander & Pallan 1995). That is, decisions made in one part of 
the system (such as reducing access to nursing services for 
health promotion and preventive functions), need to be 
evaluated for their impact on the larger whole, considering 
both health outcomes and costs to society. Lessons learned 
from this study have opened the space for dialogue between 
service providers and decision-makers and can be used to 
inform clinical practice and resource allocation in home care 
to enhance the quality of life of older people with chronic 
needs.
