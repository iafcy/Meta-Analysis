Background: Older adults are more vulnerable to health risks than younger people and may get 
exposed to various dangers, including elder abuse. This study aimed to design and implement 
an empowerment educational intervention to prevent elder abuse. 
Methods: This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2014–2016 for 18 months 
on 464 older adults aged above 60 years who visited health houses of 22 municipalities in Tehran. 
Data were collected using standard questionnaires, including the Elder Abuse-Knowledge 
Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Behavior Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, 
Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle, Perceived Social Support, Perceived Self-Efficacy, Loneliness 
Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the 
SCARED (stress, coping, argument, resources, events, and dependence) tool. The interven- 
tion was done in twenty 45- to 60-minute training sessions over 6 months. Data analysis 
were performed using χ2 tests, multiple linear and logistic regression, and structural equation 
modeling (SEM). 
Results: The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support and health 
promoting lifestyle before the intervention was similar in the two groups. However, the fre- 
quency of high knowledge of elder abuse (94.8% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the 
control group), high self-efficacy (82.8% and 7.8%, respectively), high social support (97.0% 
and 10.3%, respectively) and high health promoting lifestyle (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) 
was significantly higher (P,0.001) and the frequency of elder abuse risk (28.0% and 49.6%, 
respectively) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention. SEM stan- 
dardized beta (Sβ) showed that the intervention had the highest impact on increase social support 
(Sβ=0.80, β=48.64, SE=1.70, P,0.05), self-efficacy (Sβ=0.76, β=13.32, SE=0.52, P,0.05) 
and health promoting behaviors (Sβ=0.48, β=33.08, SE=2.26, P,0.05), respectively. The effect 
of the intervention on decrease of elder abuse risk was indirect and significant (Sβ=-0.406, 
β=-0.340, SE=0.03, P,0.05), and through social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting 
behaviors. 
Conclusion: Educational interventions can be effective in preventing elder abuse. 
Keywords: elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support, health promotion, health education

Introduction 
The world’s population is rising, and the population of older adults is increasing rapidly 
as well, and their health and well-being require more attention.1 Due to physiological 
and anatomical changes caused by aging, the increase in physical and mental illnesses, 
social isolation due to retirement and disconnection with colleagues and friends, 
reduced social activity, low income, death of relatives and friends, and being away

from children due to a number of factors, the older adults feel 
more lonely and depressed than other age groups.2 As a result, 
they are more vulnerable and subject to risks. One of these 
risks is elder abuse.3 Elder abuse, along with other indices 
such as life expectancy, is among the indicators of longevity 
and health.4 The World Health Organization describes elder 
abuse as any action or lack of appropriate action that causes 
injury or distress to an elderly person.5,6 Elder abuse is an 
indirect cause of death, and its evaluation is difficult.7 Elder 
abuse has many systemic and individual effects. Any injury 
or distress to elders can result in worsening of their health 
and well-being. Even minor injuries can have serious and 
permanent effects on their health.8 Elder abuse has different 
forms.9 While most people think that elder abuse is physical, 
there are other types of elder abuse: psychological, financial, 
and sexual abuse. Other types of harassment, such as exploi- 
tation, abandonment, and neglect, have also been raised.10 
In some forms of elder abuse, the older adults have little 
or no insight into this problem or are unaware/unable to take 
care of themselves.11 Factors that affect elder abuse are sex, 
age, education level, marital status, housing status, lifestyle, 
social network and support, financial status, nutritional 
behavior, physical activity, sleep, leisure time, and recre- 
ation.12 Some of these factors can be controlled, and some 
are uncontrollable. Adopting health promoting behavior and 
implementing changes in lifestyle are feasible and have an 
impact on quality of life.13 
Population aging is now an important public health issue 
in Iran.14 In the near future, Iran will face a high proportion 
of elders in its population. It is estimated that the popula- 
tion over .60 years in Iran in 2021 will be .10%; by 
2025, the proportion aged .65 years will be 10.4%; and by 
2050, this will become .20%.15 This increase in the elder 
population can cause a health crisis that the nation should be 
prepared for. One crisis may be elder abuse. Elders should 
be empowered against abuse by education.13 Empowerment 
is a health promotion concept and one of the strategies for 
healthy aging. Research has shown that if the elderly can 
equip themselves with skills and abilities that empower 
them, then they can protect themselves from health threats, 
including elder abuse.16 
There is a view that empowerment education should 
focus on social support, self-efficacy, and health locus of 
control.12 Social support is one of the main health indica- 
tors of healthy aging and has a protective effect on disease. 
Self-efficacy is also an effective factor in healthy aging and 
can prevent elder abuse, along with other health promoting 
behavior and social support.2,17,18 Studies have confirmed 
the importance of self-efficacy as a determinant of health 
promoting behavior,19,20 while others have confirmed the 
relationship between social support and health promot- 
ing behavior20–22 and between self-efficacy and social 
support.20,23,24 The overall aim of this study was to design 
and evaluate the efficacy of an educational intervention for 
empowerment of the older adults, focusing on self-efficacy, 
social support, and health promoting behavior, in order to 
promote healthy aging and prevent elder abuse. 
Purpose 
The educational intervention in this study was designed 
focusing on older adult empowerment, and then its impact on 
self-efficacy, social support, health promoting behavior, and 
risk reduction was investigated. In addition, we investigated 
relationships among demographic, socioeconomic, and life- 
style factors, perceived health status, feelings of loneliness, 
severity of depression, knowledge of elder abuse, health 
information sources, health barriers, health locus of control, 
and health promoting behavior, social support, self-efficacy, 
and level of elder abuse. The main hypothesis was to find out 
if the older adults that have social support and self-efficacy 
have more ability to adopt health promoting behavior and 
protect themselves from abuse. 
Methods 
Trial design 
This study was a parallel randomized controlled educa- 
tional trial study done on older adults. The study lasted for 
18 months and was conducted in 2014–2016. 
Participants 
This study was conducted on 464 older adults aged .60 years 
who visited health centers in 22 municipalities of Tehran. 
Inclusion criteria for the participants were being .60 years of 
age, ability to speak Persian, lack of mental and psychological 
problems, and being aware of place and time. People were 
excluded if they did not want to participate in the study. 
sample size 
The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 
education on health promoting behavior. Each relationship’s 
correlation coefficient was calculated, and the number of 
samples was determined based on the correlation coefficient 
matrix. The weakest significant correlation was 0.2. The 
sample size was determined based on Equation 1, assuming 
r=0.2, α=0.05, and β=0.2. The initial size was 193 in each 
group. Participants were selected from Tehran municipality 






eight questions. This asked about transportation, linguistic, 
cultural and belief barriers, health insurance, cost of living, 
dependence on others, knowledge about health resources, and 
preference for traditional or modern medicine. The score 
range for each question was from 1 to 4. A score .20 was 
considered high, and a score #20 was considered low. The 
validity and reliability of this questionnaire were evaluated 
and approved by the authors before use. Cronbach’s α for 
this questionnaire was 0.78. 
Health promoting lifestyle profile II 
This was designed by Walker et al and comprised six 
dimensions: physical activity, nutrition, spiritual growth, 
interpersonal relationships, stress management, and health 
responsibility.54 The HPLP II is made up of 52 questions and 
scored based on a Likert scale.30 In this study, based on the 
median score, each health promoting behavior was divided 
into “desirable” and “undesirable” categories. This tool has 
been translated into various languages, including Persian. 
The con tent, construct, and criterion validity of this ques- 
tionnaire have been approved in Persian and the Cronbach’s 
alpha was reported to be 0.84.20,21 In this study, this validated 
questionnaire was used and based on the median score, each 
health-promoting behavior was divided into desirable and 
undesirable categories. 
Personal resource questionnaire 85 – part 2 
This was based on Weiss et al’s social protection theory31 
and was used to measure perceived social support. The tool 
has five dimensions: intimacy, assistance, social integration, 
affirmation of worth, and nurturance. It comprises 25 items 
on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from “I strongly disagree” 
to “I strongly agree”. The total score can be 25–175. This 
tool has been translated into Farsi, and its validity and reli- 
ability have been confirmed (Cronbach’s alpha =0.81).22 
This validated questionnaire was used in the present study 
and the perceived social support score was divided into two 
desirable and undesirable categories based on the median 
cutoff point. 
Schwarzer & Jerusalem general self-efficacy scale 
This was used to measure perceived self-efficacy.32,33 The 
questions are answered on a 4-point Likert scale: “Not 
entirely correct”, “Rarely correct”, “Somewhat correct”, 
and “Completely correct”. The total score can be 10–40. A 
score of 10–20 indicates low self-efficacy, 20–30 average 
self-efficacy, and 30–40 high self-efficacy. This questionnaire 
has been translated into Persian and is valid and reliable to

health centers, and the elders of each health house had some 
correlated responses; therefore, the number of samples was 
multiplied by 1.2. We also considered a 15% chance of loss, so 
a total sample of at least 464 participants was calculated: 
randomization 
In this study, participants were selected by two-stage clus- 
ter sampling. Based on the register of health houses in the 
22 districts of Tehran, of 375, 44, ie, two health houses from 
each area, were selected randomly: one for the intervention 
group and the other for the control group. In each health house, 
from their list of older adults, 10–12 people were randomly 
selected (five men and five women or six men and six women). 
Eventually, 232 people were allocated to the intervention 
group and 232 to the control group. The intervention and 
control groups did not have any contact with each other. 
Instruments 
The following questionnaires were used to gather informa- 
tion in this study. 
Demographic characteristics questionnaire 
This included age, sex, marital status, education, type of 
housing, financial status (stable, unstable),25 type of health 
insurance, history of chronic disease, perceived health status 
(“How do you assess your overall health at the moment?”),26 
and life companions (“Who do you live with now?”). 
elder abuse knowledge questionnaire 
This measured the level of knowledge of participants 
about elder abuse and comprised 10 questions. This was a 
researcher-made questionnaire, based on Gironda et al’s27 
and Almogue et al’s28 questionnaires. The validity and reli- 
ability of this questionnaire was evaluated and approved by 
the authors of this study before use. Cronbach’s α for this 
questionnaire was 0.84. The maximum score was 30. A 
score #15 was considered low knowledge, and a score .15 
was considered good knowledge. 
health barriers questionnaire 
A researcher-made questionnaire was drawn from the 
Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle Questionnaire29 and comprised 



 
 



use in Persian and its Cronbach’s alpha was reported to be 
0.82. This validated questionnaire was used in this current 
study; however, low and average self-efficacy groups were 
merged and responses were divided into “desirable” and 
“undesirable” categories. 
loneliness scale 
This questionnaire was created by the University of California, 
Los Angeles,34 and consists of 20 questions. Each question has 
three options: “never”, “sometimes”, and “often”. A score ,35 
in this questionnaire indicates a low sense of loneliness, 
35–49 indicates a moderate sense of loneliness, and .50 
indicates an intense sense of loneliness. This tool has been 
translated and validated in Persian by Pasha and Ismaili in 
2007 and its Cronbach’s alpha was reported to be 0.75.35 This 
validated questionnaire was used in the current study. 
geriatric depression scale 
This was used to measure depression in the older adult.34 The 
questionnaire includes 15 questions with yes/no answers. A 
score ,5 indicates no symptoms of depression, 5–10 indi- 
cates somewhat depressed, and .15 indicates moderate and 
severe depression.26 This questionnaire has been translated 
and validated in Persian by Malakouti et al in 2006 and it 
Cronbach’s alpha was reported to be 0.90.36 This validated 
questionnaire was used in the current study. 
health locus of control scale 
This is used to measure people’s beliefs and thoughts about 
the locus of control for health.33 It examines the health locus 
of control at three levels – internal, external, and chance 
control – with three types: A, B, and C. In this study, type A 
was used. This scale has 18 questions, of which six questions 
measure internal locus of control, six questions measure 
external locus of control, and six questions measure chance 
locus of control. A higher score in external control and 
chance control means that the individual sees his/her health 
more due to chance and external factors.33 Type A is used 
for healthy people, and its psy chometric properties have 
been approved for use in Iran.37 The Cronbach’s alpha of 
the internal health locus of control (0.68), powerful others 
health locus of control (0.72), and chance health locus of 
control (0.66) subscales were moderately acceptable.37 This 
validated questionnaire was used in this study. 
consists of six questions, each measuring one construct. These 
are stress level, coping, argument, resources, events, and depen- 
dence (SCARED). The total score can be 6–18. A score ,7 
means less vulnerable, 7–11 means somewhat vulnerable, and 
12–18 means highly vulnerable to elder abuse.38 The authors of 
this study translated and retranslated the original questionnaire. 
The face validity and content validity of the questionnaire were 
determined by expert opinion. In order to determine the internal 
consistency and reliability of the questionnaire, the authors 
asked 110 people to complete the questionnaire. Cronbach’s 
α for the SCARED questionnaire was 0.74. 
Data collection 
A briefing was held beforehand for interviewers about how 
to complete the questionnaires. The questionnaries were 
completed before and after the intervention by trained 
instructors through face to face interviews and were com- 
pleted simultaneously in both intervention and control 
groups. The questionnaires were kept confidential. 
Intervention 
The educational content for reducing the risk of elder abuse 
was designed based on results of the preintervention stage, 
opinions of health education experts, and a health promotion 
literature review. The older adults themselves also helped 
design the training program and were actively involved in 
setting up the program and implementing it. 
The content of the educational interventions was based 
on the dimensions of health promoting behavior and com- 
prised physical activity, recreation and entertainment, 
sleep, nutrition, interpersonal relations and social support, 
responsibility for health, mental health, and older adult 
stress management. These interventions were designed to 
improve and identify ways to strengthen self-efficacy, raise 
knowledge about elder abuse, its outcomes, risk factors, 
and causes, ways to reduce and combat abuse, benefits of 
health promoting behavior, barriers to conducting health 
promoting behavior, methods for removing barriers, iden- 
tifying sources of support, and ways to receive support. In 
preparing this educational content, factors such as being 
easy, comprehensive, applicable, creating motivation, and 
acceptability for the older adult were considered. For each 
session, a particular topic was considered. Educational 
technology methods, such as lecture, question and answer, 
and problem-solving, were used. 
Assessment of elder at risk for abuse tool 
This is a type of screening tool for identifying aged people at 
risk of elder abuse and determining that risk (vulnerability) of 
abuse. This tool was designed by the University of Ontario. It 
The contents of the training were provided as CD, 
booklet, and pamphlet to the participants. A few short films 
provided by the Iranian Health Policy Council, Ministry of 
Health and Medical Education tailored to the content of the 






educational intervention were displayed. A number of edu- 
cational messages were designed and sent to participants by 
text message. The official sources used for health promot- 
ing interventions included the Ministry of Health’s Healthy 
Lifestyle for Seniors: Principles of Healthy Aging booklet39 
and elder abuse prevention protocols.38 
After the educational package had been finalized, the 
educational intervention was performed. For each health 
house, at least 20 training sessions lasting 45–60 minutes 
were arranged. The total educational program took 6 months. 
In total, 600 hours’ training was provided for each person. 
Training was provided by health care professionals, and 
classes were held in health houses. Training was based on 
an adult education strategy.17 Three months after training 
was finished, the questionnaires were again completed by 
the two groups. 
Outcomes 
The effects of demographic factors, social support, 
self-efficacy, health status, information resources, source 
of control, perceived barriers, loneliness, and severity of 
depression on health promoting behavior were investigated, 
and then the effect of health promoting behavior on the risk 
of elder abuse was estimated. 
statistical methods 
Data analysis was done using χ2 tests using multiple regres- 
sion methods. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was 
also used to find direct, indirect, and total effects of each 
path, as well as standardized effects. In this analysis, fit- 
ness indicators – including the comparative fit index and 
goodness-of-fit index (GFI) – indicating the suitability of 
the model were calculated. These indicators should be .0.9. 
In this research, the model for preventing the risk of elder 
abuse was obtained based on the results of the initial data 
analysis (Figure 1). Data were analyzed using SPSS 21 and 
AMOS software, and the level of significance was ,0.05. 
ethical considerations 
The project was approved by the ethics committee of the 
Tehran University of Medical Sciences (code 19230) 
and was registered in the Iranian Clinical Trials registry 
(IRCT2013070813904N1). Written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants. All information remained con- 
fidential. Participants were able to withdraw at any time. 
Results 
The mean age of participants was 65.9±3.6 years. The major- 
ity were married (57.3%) and had an educational degree 
less than a high school diploma (75.2%). Also, 57.3% 
(266 people) lived with their spouse and children. Regarding 
the question “How do you assess your health in the present?”, 
most reported that their health status was excellent (63.4%). 
The distribution of the demographic, social, economic, and 
clinical characteristics of the intervention and control groups 
was similar before the intervention (Table 1).

The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy, 
social support, health promoting behavior, and risk of elder 
abuse before the intervention was similar in the two groups. 
However, frequency of these variables in two groups was 
significantly different after intervention (P,0.001). Most 
of those in the intervention group received a more favorable 
score than the control group after intervention (Table 2). 
The effect of educational intervention on self-efficacy, 
social support, and health promoting behavior (after inter- 
vention) and after control for variables before the interven- 
tion (sex, age, marital status, educational level, housing 
ownership, financial status, life structure, history of chronic 
illness, insurance, date of last referral to a physician, health 
status, information resources, health barriers, depression rate, 
loneliness, health locus of control, and amount of knowledge 
of elder abuse) was estimated using backward logistic and 
linear regression analyses.

receiving the intervention, age, and education. Also, in the 
logistic model, social support (after the intervention) showed 
a significant relationship with intervention, sex, and health 
status (Table 3). These significant variables entered SEM. As 
such, the primary model of self-efficacy, health promoting 
behavior and social support in preventing the risk of elder 
abuse was modified (Figure 2). For each path, the unstan- 
dardized coefficient was calculated. Positive and negative 
signs for each path indicated that for a 1-unit increase in each 
variable, the other variable’s score increased or decreased. 
The GFI of the original SEM model was tested. GFI of 0.79 
and incremental fit index of 0.78 indicated the fitness of 
the model. The standardized coefficients (Sβ) of the model 
showed that the effect of the intervention was primarily 
on social support (Sβ=0.80, β=48.64, SE=1.70) than on 
self-efficacy (Sβ=0.76, β=13.32, SE=0.52) and ultimately 
health promoting behavior (Sβ=0.48, β=33.08, SE=2.26) 
(Figure 2). 
The adjusted SEM model for the prevention of elder 
abuse was fitted again after removing insignificant variables. 
The final SEM model is presented in Figure 3. The GFI of 
the final model was tested, and the indicators GFI of 0.9 and 
incremental fit index of 0.91 showed good fit. The results of 
the final model showed that receiving intervention, perceived 
health status, educational level, social support, and self- 
efficacy had an indirect effect on the risk of elder abuse. The 
intervention did not directly affect the risk of elder abuse, but 
this variable directly affected self-efficacy and social support, 
and these affected health promoting behavior. The effect of 
intervention on decrease of elder abuse risk was indirect and 
significant (Sβ=-0.406, β=-0.340, SE=0.03, P,0.05), and 
through social support, self-efficacy, and health-promoting

Discussion 
Various types of interventions have been designed and 
implemented with a variety of strategies, including edu- 
cational, supportive, and legal strategies, for addressing 
the problem of elder abuse.40 In general, interventions in 
the area of primary or secondary prevention of elder abuse 
are divided into two broad categories. The first of these 
is interventions that are aimed at reducing the burden of 
abuse on the older adults and improving their health. These 
interventions are known as “elder-centered” strategies for 
empowering the elderly by using health promoting strategies, 
such as social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting 
behavior. The focus of this current study was on the design 
and implementation of these interventions. The second cat- 
egory of interventions is empowerment of the staff of health 
centers and organizations related to the health of the older 
adults in the area of primary prevention, in order to reduce 
the risk of elder abuse.41 
The focus of this current study was on the design and 
implementation of the first category interventions. In this 
study, knowledge in the field of elder abuse, self-efficacy, 
perceived social support, and health promoting behavior 
significantly improved in the intervention group. The results 
of this study are consistent with other studies that showed 
that educational interventions can be effective in improving 
elders’ abuse-related knowledge,27,28,42–45 and intervention 
programs for prevention of elder abuse can lead to short-term 
improvements in the level of knowledge of the older adult 
in the field of elder abuse.

In this study, the self-efficacy score in the intervention 
group significantly increased, though self-efficacy scores in 
the two groups were mostly at an undesirable level before 
the interven tion. Self-efficacy was used to increase health 
promoting behavior and to develop behavioral changes in the 
prevention of elder abuse in the target group. Self-efficacy 
directly promotes health promoting behavior through effi- 
cient expectations and indirectly affects planned behavioral 
change by influencing perceived barriers.46 Self-efficacy is an 
important factor in interventions aimed at changing unhealthy 
behavior and creating and maintaining healthy behavior. 
A person can make a behavioral change only if they believe 
that they are able to change.19,47 
Score for perceived social support for elder abuse risk 
reduction increased in the intervention group. These results 
are consistent with other studies that showed that educational 
interventions are effective in improving perceived social 
support for the older adult.47,48 Social support is the strongest 
coping force to successfully cope with chronic diseases and 
stressful living conditions.48,49 Social protection has two 
levels: understanding support and getting it. Among older 
people, understanding social support is more important than 
getting it. In many cases, there are social support resources, 
such as the family and the community, but the older adults do 
not receive favorable support for a variety of reasons, as they 
do not realize that they need help and should get help from 
someone. Several factors, such as cultural beliefs and elders’ 
beliefs, affect the understanding of their need for social sup- 
port. Thinking about having independence and not imposing 
oneself on others are among the mental beliefs of the older 
adult and the most important obstacle to understanding their 
need for social support. If elderly people find themselves in 
situations requiring support and seek social support, then 
they will suffer less, because social support reduces their 
stress and improves their mental health.50,51 Research has 
shown that older people with more social support have better 
mental health.12 
Health promoting behavior in terms of decreasing the 
risk of elder abuse was significantly higher in the group that 
received intervention. Health promoting behavior is among 
the major determinants of health and is directly associated 
with the prevention of disease.12 In order to cope with elder 
abuse, the elderly must have physical, psychological, and 
social well-being. In numerous studies, it has been proven 
that the adoption of health promoting behavior increases the 
quality of physical and mental health and reduces susceptibil- 
ity to elder abuse.12 
The intervention caused a significant increase in self- 
efficacy, social support, and health promoting behavior. 
The SEM showed that the effects of educational interven- 
tions on perceived social support, self-efficacy, and health 
promoting behavior were not the same. Interventions had a 
greater impact on social protection than self-efficacy or health 
promoting behavior. This finding is very important, because 
it shows that in designing interventions to create behavioral 
changes, perceived social support and self-efficacy should 
be considered as important factors. 
The final SEM model also showed that people with 
higher self-efficacy had a higher chance of understanding and 
gaining social support, and this resulted in more behavioral 
changes. The results of this study are consistent with other 
studies13,31 that showed that those who had more efficacy and 
perceived and received social support were more likely to 
change behavior. Another finding from the present study was 
that interventions are effective in reducing the risk of elder 
abuse in the older adult, and the risk score among the older 
adult in the intervention group decreased after the interven- 
tion. The coefficients of SEM showed that the path coefficient 
of health promoting behavior to elder abuse risk was -0.01; 
and for every 1-unit increase in health promoting behavior 
score, the average risk of elder abuse decreased by 0.01. 
The SEM model showed that the effect of interventions 
on elder abuse was indirectly and significantly determined 
through social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting 
behavior. However, the impact of health promoting behavior 
on the risk of elder abuse was direct. In other words, older 
adults can protect themselves against the threats of elder 
abuse if they have health promoting behavior and the older 
adults who take care of their health and get through life better 
than others. This conclusion is consistent with the findings 
of other studies.52,53 
The results of this study show a model for prevention of 
elder abuse. The GFI of the model was also tested statisti- 
cally and showed its relevance. Most likely, this is the first 
research to use SEM to reduce the risk of elder abuse. The 
use of conceptual frameworks and planning to understand the 
factors associated with reducing the risk of elder abuse plays 
an important role in improving the quality of interventions. 
A limitation was that there was no follow-up to examine 
the long-term effects of the intervention on quality of life 
or health status of the target group. Other limitations of this 
study are lack of blinding, probable social desirability bias, 
volunteer bias, selection bias, and limited international and 
external validity of the findings. 
Conclusion 
The increasing number of older adults and changes in cul- 
ture, household structure, and lifestyle have increased the 






incidence of misconduct and elder abuse. Therefore, we 
need more understanding of the reasons for elder abuse and 
accurate planning for preventing it. In Iran, due to the cultural 
and religious context in which respect for older adults is 
emphasized, families are the most important and the original 
providers of emotional and psychological care for the older 
adult. For this reason, it is likely that in the absence of gov- 
ernment attention and support, families are under pressure 
and experience trouble, which may increase the likelihood 
of elder abuse. The results of this study indicate a positive 
and significant effect of intervention based on empowerment 
of the elderly in improving health promoting behavior and 
reducing the risk of elder abuse. Therefore, organized and 
short-term training courses on elder abuse, risk factors, and 
methods for reducing it for all age groups can be effective 
in preventing this phenomenon. It is recommended that 
educational interventions for the prevention of elder abuse 
be started before reaching an advanced age. In addition, 
interventions focusing on the health system should be con- 
sidered, in order to empower employees of health centers 
and organization in preventing elder abuse. Interventions 
focused on the health services system can sensitize health 
care providers, encourage them to do routine examinations, 
and design and implement management protocols for the 
older adult.
