Abstract 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can impair language, but active music therapy (AMT) and memantine (M) can improve communication. 
This study aimed to clarify whether adding AMT to M may improve language in comparison with drugs alone in patients with 
moderate AD on stable therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchEI). Forty-five AD patients treated with stable dose of AchEI 
were randomized to receive AMT plus M 20 mg/day or M 20 mg/day for 24 weeks. The Severe Impairment Battery-Language (SIB-l), 
SIB, Mini Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Lubben Social Network Scale, Activities of Daily Living, and 
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks assessed language (primary variable) and overall 
cognitive, psycho-behavior, social, and functional aspects (secondary variables). The SIB-l showed a stabilization of the baseline 
condition in both groups, in the absence of between-group differences. The NPI depression and appetite scores significantly improved 
in the M-AMT group. Moreover, significantly less patients in the M-AMT group than those in the M group showed worsening of the 
NPI total score. Daily activities, social relationships, and overall cognitive performance did not deteriorate. In patients with moderate 
AD, AMT added to pharmacotherapy has no further benefits for language in comparison with pharmacotherapy alone. However, this 
integrated treatment can improve the psycho-behavioral profile.

Impaired verbal communication is a distressing manifestation 
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1]. Frequent language defects 
include anomia, altered comprehension, paraphasia, empty 
speech, decreased verbal fluency, and digression from the top- 
ic [2], impacting mood and quality of life (QoL) of patients 
and caregivers [3]. 
Cholinesterase inhibitors (AchEI) and memantine (M) 
(an uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antago- 
nist) are pharmacologic options [4]. M demonstrated safe- 
ty and efficacy in monotherapy [5] or in combination with 
AchEI [6, 7] and, in a meta-analysis collecting 1826 pa- 
tients with moderate or severe AD, it resulted more effec- 
tive than placebo on global health, cognition, function, 
and behavior [8]. In patients with mild to moderate AD, 
treatment with AchEI and M resulted in significant but 
clinically marginal improvement of cognition, behavior, 
or functionality [9], while M alone did not relate to any 

significant changes [10]. AchEI and M are indicated in 
mild-to-moderate and moderate AD, respectively, but al- 
most 50% of patients with mild AD have been receiving 
M [11]. In this regard, Schneider et al. [11] completed a 
meta-analysis of clinical trials, stating that there was 
scarce evidence for benefits of M in mild to moderate 
AD and posed indications to prospective trials of M either 
alone or in combination with AchEI in this condition. 
Overall, treatment with AchEI and M resulted in small 
cognitive and functional improvements, but outcome assess- 
ment did not comprehend any measures of communication, 
social life, progression of disability, or caregiver burden. 
In patients with severe AD, M improved language and 
communication [12], but there are no information concerning 
patients with less serious forms of AD. 
Music therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention 
with theoretical and operational bases that applies the ef- 
fects of sound, music, and sound-movement integration 
on cognition and behavior, stimulating interpersonal rela- 
tions and non-verbal communication, as well as personal 
expressions, creativity, and emotions [13–15]. In patients 
with AD, active music therapy (AMT) involving sound 
and music playing resulted in improved coordination, at- 
tention, and memory [16]. Furthermore, AMT can facili- 
tate communication [17] and improve language [18] and 
determine positive effects on emotions, mood, and social 
behavior [17, 19, 20] and QoL [16], and may enhance the 
effects of drugs for dementia [17]. Patients with mild to 
moderate AD undergoing AMT for 3 months showed a 
mild decline of initiative and episodic memory and a sig- 
nificant decrease of anxiety and depression [21]. In pa- 
tients with chronic vascular encephalopathy, AMT may 
improve executive functions and mood [22]. To our 
knowledge, no randomized clinical studies have compared 
the effects of pharmacological treatment using M or 
AchEI and AMT on language in AD patients. 
Given the positive influence for AMT on language and 
communication [17, 18] and that these effects were also 
documented with M [12], and AMT may also contribute 
to stabilize initiative in patients with not serious cognitive 
decline [22], the question has been risen whether the ad- 
dition of AMT to a pharmacological treatment may give 
additional benefits compared to drug therapy alone in pa- 
tients with moderate AD. The primary objective of this 
study was to determine the effect of an integrated ap- 
proach on language in comparison to M added to stable 
AchEI treatment. Secondarily, we evaluated the influence 
of such an approach on global cognitive functioning, 
psycho-behavioral and social aspects, and daily activities. 
We hypothesized that, in comparison with pharmacother- 
apy alone, combining AMT and pharmacotherapy may 
contribute to stabilize language and improve psycho- 
behavioral aspects. 



Patients with probable AD were selected in one center accord- 
ing to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
IV TR [23] and NINCDS-ADRDA revised criteria [24]. 
Patients followed up at the hospital outpatient clinic for cog- 
nitive disturbances were contacted to participate to a 
prescreening evaluation and to receive information about the 
trial. Six to 8 months after the prescreening, consenting pa- 
tients underwent the baseline assessment and were randomly 
assigned to a study group. At baseline, overall cognitive func- 
tioning (as expressed by the Mini Mental State Examination, 
MMSE) [25] indicated a moderate cognitive decline in all of 
the patients. The MMSE mean scores decreased from 
prescreening (mean ± SD: M-AMT group, 17.86 ± 5.53; M 
group, 17.48 ± 5.54) to baseline. The adjusted mean changes 
from prescreening to baseline in the M-AMT group (− 1.27, 
95% CI − 2.31 to − 0.24, p = 0.018) did not significantly differ 
from those observed in the M group (− 1.24, 95% CI − 2.16 to 
− 0.32, p = 0.011). Eligible patients were on stable treatment 
with AchEI for at least 4 weeks and had impaired language 
[2]. Gate imbalance, extrapyramidal signs, seizures, 
neurovegetative failures, and severe psychiatric conditions 
(major depression, psychosis, bipolar disorders) preceding 
cognitive decline were exclusion criteria. 

M 20 mg/day was added to AchEI. AMT included twice week- 
ly sessions, each lasting 40 min, conducted by a music thera- 
pist. A non-verbal approach and free sound-music interac- 
tions, using rhythmical and melodic instruments, were 
adopted. The sound-music interaction involved cognition 
and emotions, stimulating interpersonal adaptation. Each ses- 
sion began with musical improvisation inviting patients to 
choose an instrument and to play using a free technique. 
Patients contemporarily listened to other patients playing, 
freely searching an interplay. No music knowledge was re- 
quired [13, 18]. The equipment included xylophones, glock- 
enspiels, triangles, wind chimes, maracas, small woods, 
guiros, and ethnic percussions. The sessions were 
videotaped. The interventions lasted 24 weeks. 

The randomization was made using a computer-generated list 
of random numbers, assigning the patients to treatment with 
M or M plus AMT (M-AMT). Figure 1 shows the partici- 
pant’s flow through the study. The patients were evaluated 
blindly by a neuropsychologist at baseline and at weeks 12 
and 24.

The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to 
week 24 of the Severe Impairment Battery Language (SIB-l) 
subscale score [26]. The SIB-l, included in the Severe 
Impairment Battery (SIB) [27], includes 24 items evaluating 
naming, reading, writing, and repetition (maximum score 46, 
the higher the score, the better the language). The secondary 
efficacy endpoints were the SIB [27], Activities of Daily 
Living (ADL) [28] and Instrumental Activities of Daily 
Living (IADL) scales [29], Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
(NPI) [30], MMSE [25], and Lubben Social Network Scale 
(LSNS) scores [31] at 12 and 24 weeks. The SIB [27] is a 40- 
item, 100-point scale that assesses, in addition to language, 
social interactions, memory, orientation, attention, praxis, 
visual-spatial ability, and orientation, with lower scores indi- 
cating greater impairment. The ADL [28] measures indepen- 
dence in daily activities (bathing, dressing, toileting, 
transferring, eating, and the use of incontinence materials), 
with a score ranging from 0 (total independence) to 6 (total 
dependence). The IADL [29] assesses eating, dressing, 
sphincter control, house works, cooking, using telephone, 
using money, and outside movement, with scores ranging 
from 0 to 8 (complete independence). The NPI [30] assesses 
psychic and behavioral symptoms in individuals with demen- 
tia, using a caregiver’s interview. It evaluates delusions, hal- 
lucinations, depressed mood, anxiety, agitation, euphoria, ap- 
athy, irritability, inhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night- 
time behavior disturbances, and eating behavior changes, for 
which the frequency and severity are rated 1–3 (higher num- 
bers indicate greater frequency or severity); a score for each 
symptom is computed by multiplying the frequency by the 
severity. The LSNS [31] evaluates the perceived social sup- 
port received by family, friends, and neighbors. It is a self- 
report 10-item scale; each item is rated 0–5 (higher scores 
indicate better social support). The MMSE [25] is based on

questions testing five cognitive functions (orientation, regis- 
tration, attention and calculation, recall, language), giving a 0– 
30 total score (the higher the score, the higher the cognitive 
level). 

Previously published data of patients with moderate to severe 
AD [12] were taken into consideration to determine baseline 
SIB-l total score, but preliminary assessment of patients did not 
support such a comparison. In particular, the MMSE scores in- 
dicating moderate cognitive impairment did not match to mod- 
erate to comparable impairment on the SIB. Therefore, the sam- 
ple size was determined according to an observational design of a 
naturalistic condition, prospecting 20 patients in each group. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS 
Inc., Cary, NC) and all statistical tests were two-sided. All sub- 
jects who received at least one dose of M were included in the 
data analysis (intention-to-treat population). Descriptive statistics 
for demographic and other baseline characteristics, efficacy, and 
safety variables was expressed as mean ± SD for continuous 
variables and as frequency and percentage for categorical vari- 
ables. The paired t test was used to assess the changes from 
baseline to 12 and 24 weeks. An ANCOVA model including 
the baseline values as covariate was used in the comparisons 
between groups. Unpaired t test was also used in the comparisons 
between groups of subscales scores. A χ2 test compared between 
groups the rates of patients with worsening in NPI total score 
from baseline to week 24. 


Forty-five patients (31 females; mean age 73.2) were randomly 
assigned to the M-AMT (n = 23) or M group (n = 22). One pa- 
tient in each group did not perform the post-baseline visits and 
was not evaluable for assessment of treatment effects. Table 1 
shows the demographic and other characteristics of patients at the 
baseline and week 12 and week 24 visits. The comparisons be- 
tween groups did not show statistically significant differences for 
all examined parameters, except in mean NPI total score 
(p < 0.001), which was significantly higher in the M group than 
in the M-AMT group. 

Table 2 shows the results of SIB total score and subscales in the 
two groups at baseline and 12- and 24-week follow-ups. The 
mean SIB-l score significantly decreased from baseline to week 
24 in the M-AMT group (adjusted mean change − 4.70; 95% CI 
− 8.16 to − 1.23), compared to a small decrease in the M group 

(adjusted mean change− 2.46; 95% CI − 6.01 to 1.09), with no 
between-group differences. Both groups showed no relevant de- 
creases from baseline to week 12. 
In the M-AMT group, the SIB total (adjusted mean change − 
10.65; 95% CI − 17.50 to − 3.80) and memory scores (adjusted 
mean change − 2.40; 95% CI − 3.88 to − 0.93) decreased signif- 
icantly from baseline to week 24. In the M group, the SIB social 
interactions score decreased significantly from baseline to week 
24 (adjusted mean change − 0.46; 95% CI − 1.09 to 0.17), com- 
pared to a small decrease in the M-AMT group (adjusted mean 
change − 0.15; 95% CI − 0.76 to 0.46). 
ANCOVA showed no significant between-group differences 
and the baseline value was a significant predictor of results at 
24 weeks for the SIB total [F(1) = 10.61, p = 0.002] and SIB-l 
scores [F(1) = 8.28, p = 0.006]. 
Table 3 shows the ADL, IADL, and LSNS scores. The ADL 
score significantly decreased from baseline to week 24 in the M- 
AMT group (p = 0.039). The IADL score significantly decreased 
from baseline to week 24 in the M-AMT (p = 0.005) and M 
group (p = 0.001). At week 24, the adjusted mean changes from 
baseline of the ADL score were − 0.61 (95% CI − 1.07 to 0.15) 
in the M-AMT group and − 0.27 (95% CI − 0.74 to 0.20) in the 
M group, while the corresponding values for IADL in the two 
groups were − 1.05 (95% CI − 1.75 to − 0.34) and − 1.48 (95% 
CI − 2.20 to − 0.75), respectively. No significant between-group 
differences were found for ADL and IADL in the ANCOVA 
model. The baseline value of ADL resulted in a significant pre- 
dictor of values at week 24 [F(1) = 9.11, p = 0.004]. The baseline 
IADL value also predicted the IADL score at week 24 [F(1) = 
81.25, p < 0.001]. 
In the M-AMT group, the LSNS total score decreased from 
baseline to weeks 12 and 24, while the Relatives and Neighbors 
scores, but not the Friends score, decreased at week 24. In the M 
group, all scores decreased except for an increase of the Relatives 
score. However, no significant changes within-group or 
between-group differences were observed. ANCOVA showed 
that the baseline LSNS total score was a significant predictor of 
results at 24 weeks [F(1) = 6.21, p = 0.017]. 
The NPI total, Depression (mean change ± SD − 1.77 ± 3.78; 
p = 0.039), and Appetite disorders scores (mean change ± SD − 
1.68 ± 2.82; p = 0.011) decreased significantly in the M-AMT 
group at week 12. The mean change in NPI total score from 
baseline to week 24 was advantageous for the M-AMT group 
(− 0.55 ± 20.64) but not for the M group (6.29 ± 17.78). The 
between-group difference in mean changes from baseline of the 
NPI total score was not significant (p = 0.253). However, the 
rates of worsened/no worsened patients at week 24 differed sig- 
nificantly (p = 0.048) due to a lower rate of worsened patients in 
the M-AMT group (7 patients, 31.8%) than in the M group (13 
patients, 61.9%). Between-group comparisons showed a signifi- 
cant difference for depression at week 24 due to a decrease from 
baseline in the M-AMT group and an increase in the M group 
(mean ± SD difference between groups, − 2.87 ± 1.25; 95% CI −

This study provides Class II evidence that, in patients with 
moderate probable AD on stable therapy with AchEI, com- 
bined treatment with AMT and M was associated with im- 
provement in depressive symptoms and stabilized psychiatric 
health status compared to M monotherapy. 
Eight adverse events (AEs) were reported in 5 patients 
(21.8%) in the M-AMT group and 17 AEs were reported in 
11 patients (50.0%) in the M group. The most common AEs 
were somnolence (six patients in the M group), insomnia (two 
patients in the M-AMT group, one in the M group), and

neurological disorders [40]. 

We investigated the effects of M plus AMT on verbal commu- 
nication and, secondarily, on daily living, psycho-behavioral 
aspects, social relations, and global cognitive functioning in 
patients with moderate AD on stable treatment with AchEI. 
The baseline SIB-l mean score of the two groups of inter- 
vention indicated a mild to moderate language impairment 
and hence a small probability of detecting differences between 
baseline and follow-up. Indeed, the probability of achieving a 
clinically relevant language improvement related to the SIB-l 
baseline score, with lower scores corresponding to greater 
improvements [12]. As further confirmation of the importance 
of the extent of baseline impairment, ANCOVA showed that 
the baseline SIB total and language scores predicted the results 
at 24 weeks. Significant effects of the baseline values were 
also observed for ADL, LSNS, and NPI. 
The primary variable (SIB-l) and other SIB scores showed 
an overall stabilization over time of the baseline condition up 
to the end of the 12-week treatment phase. 
The NPI total and subscale scores revealed significant ben- 
efits in the M-AMT group for Depression and Appetite disor- 
ders after 12 weeks of treatment, and a significant between- 
group difference for Depression at week 24, due to an im- 
provement from baseline in the M-AMT group and a worsen- 
ing in the M group. The rates of worsened/no worsened pa- 
tients at week 24 also showed a significant difference in favor 
of the M-AMT group. In both groups, the other secondary 
variables (ADL, IADL, LSNS, MMSE) showed no substantial 
deterioration from baseline to week 24. 
Worth noting, M-AMT was associated with improved psy- 
chiatric symptoms compared to drug therapy alone. Moreover, 
there was an advantage on the social interactions SIB subscale 
in the M-AMT group compared to the M group. This extends 
previous findings concerning a positive influence for AMT on 
mood and behavior [19, 32–34]. The activations of the emo- 
tions and memory circuits may explain the psycho-behavioral 
effects of AMT in dementia [35]. 
According to the cognitive reserve model, the variability in 
the clinical manifestation of a neuropathology reflects individ- 
uals’ ability to use cognitive strategies [36]. Cognitive reserve 
can be continuously modified by experience even when the 
brain is already affected by pathology [36]. Education and 
personal experience can enhance cognitive reserve, contrast- 
ing the clinical AD manifestations [37, 38]. The capacity of 
the baseline SIB total, SIB-l, ADL, LSNS, and NPI scores to 
predict the results at week 24 suggests that cognitive reserve 
may enhance the effects of the treatment [39]. This extends the 
spectrum of non-pharmacological treatment, which may be 
The small sample size, mild language impairment, and high 
variance of baseline data may have compromised the possibil- 
ity of observing between-group differences in the outcome 
variables. 
To conclude, in patients with moderate AD, an association 
of AMT added to pharmacotherapy has no further benefits for 
language and verbal communication in comparison with phar- 
macotherapy alone. However, this integrated approach can 
improve the psycho-behavioral profile.
