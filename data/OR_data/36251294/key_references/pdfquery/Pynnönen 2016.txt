Declining health and changes in a person’s social network 
with aging may threaten the maintenance of mental well- 
being in older people. However, older people who have 
access to social relations in which they experience mutual 
proximity and security and through which they can get help 
when they need it, suffer less often from feelings of loneliness 
and depressive symptoms (Tiikkainen & Heikkinen, 2005). 
Other observational studies have shown that the incidence of 
depressive symptoms is lower among people involved in 
social activity (Glass, Mendes de Leon, Bassuk, & Berkman, 
2006; Wahrendorf, Ribet, Zins, & Siegrist, 2008). However, 
intervention studies suggest that alleviating loneliness and 
depressive symptoms in older people may not be as straight- 
forward as the observational studies suggest. In a systematic 
review, Dickens, Richards, Greaves, and Campbell (2011) con- 
cluded that only 3 out of 12 group interventions were effec- 
tive in reducing loneliness and 3 out of 8 effective in 
alleviating depression. 
Loneliness may be deﬁned as an unpleasant, anxiety- 
inducing subjective experience resulting from inadequate 
social relationships (Peplau & Perlman, 1982). The association 
between loneliness and social contacts has been addressed in 
several studies. An important predictor of loneliness is living 
alone (Routasalo, Savikko, Tilvis, Strandberg, & Pitk€al€a, 2006). 
Receiving fewer visits from friends and having a less extensive 
social network were also related to loneliness (Adams, 



Sanders, & Auth, 2004). However, the frequency of contacts 
may not be paramount. Routasalo et al. (2006) found that the 
feeling of loneliness was associated not with the frequency of 
contacts with children and friends, but with satisfaction with 
these contacts. Thus, especially qualitative aspects of social 
contacts count for feelings of loneliness. 
Depression is a broader phenomenon than loneliness, as it 
may result from changes in social relationships or in non- 
social situations (Peplau & Perlman, 1982). Earlier studies have 
shown, for example, that chronic diseases, disability, poor 
self-rated health, poor vision, perceived negative changes in 
life, lack of a friendly companion, less participation in orga- 
nized social activities, and irritation with one’s family are pre- 
dictors of depressive symptoms (see Adams et al., 2004; 
Heikkinen & Kauppinen, 2004; Kaneko, Motohashi, Sasaki, & 
Yamaji, 2007; McGuire, Strine, Allen, Anderson, & Mokdad, 
2009). Grieving over a recent loss of a close person was associ- 
ated with both depressive symptoms and loneliness (Adams 
et al., 2004). Depressive symptoms and loneliness are strongly 
associated, and often co-occur both with each other and 
other setbacks in life. It is possible that loneliness and depres- 
sive symptoms can act in a synergistic way to impair well- 
being in older people (Cacioppo, Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & 
Thisted, 2006).

ABSTRACT 
Objectives: This study examined effects of a social intervention on depressive symptoms, melancholy, 
loneliness, and perceived togetherness in community-dwelling Finnish older people. 
Method: Promotion of mental well-being in older people (GoodMood; ISRCTN78426775) was a single- 
blinded randomized control trial lasting 1.5 years. Two hundred and twenty-three persons aged 75– 
79 years reporting symptoms of loneliness or melancholy were randomized into intervention and 
control groups. The intervention group was allowed to choose among supervised exercise, social 
activity, or personal counseling. Follow-up measurements were conducted at the end of 6-month 
intervention, and at 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention. 
Results: Number of depressive symptoms remained unchanged, while loneliness and melancholy 
decreased in both the intervention and control groups during the study (p < 0.001). Social integration 
increased in the intervention group but not in controls (p D 0.041). Attachment and guidance 
increased in both groups (p < 0.001). 
Conclusion: The intervention did not alleviate depressed mood. Positive changes over time were 
feelings of melancholy, attachment, and guidance but these occurred 
observed in loneliness, 
independently of the intervention. Our secondary analysis suggests that the intervention increased 
perceived social integration. In sum, the effects of the intervention were moderate only and did not 
expedite further overcoming depressive mood or loneliness. 


kinds of social relationships to fulﬁll their various social needs. 
Perceived togetherness describes the way people experience 
interaction and the social support they receive 
their social 
(Tiikkainen, Heikkinen, & Leskinen, 2004). According to Weiss 
(1973), feelings of loneliness may result from a deﬁcit in one 
or more relational functions: attachment, social integration, 
sense of reliable alliance, guidance, nurturance, and reassur- 
ance of worth. Emotional loneliness arises from the lack of an 
intimate relationship or a conﬁdant, whereas social loneliness 
refers to negative feelings resulting from the absence of 
integration. Tiikkainen 
meaningful relationships and social 
and Heikkinen (2005) found that, among 80-year-old persons, 
loneliness correlated with the lack of reliable alliance, social 
integration, and attachment, while depressive symptoms 
were explained by low scores in guidance, reassurance of 
worth, reliable alliance, and attachment. Thus, experiencing 
insufﬁciently met social needs may negatively affect mental 
well-being. Although all six relational functions are important 
to older people, their relative importance may vary depend- 
ing on age and life situation. 
Previous systematic reviews concluded that interventions 
that were effective in decreasing loneliness were typically 
conducted in a group setting, involved some form of educa- 
tional or training input and social activity, and in which older 
people were active participants (Cattan, White, Bond, & Lear- 
mouth, 2005; Dickens et al., 2011). For older women living 
alone, discussion on health-related topics reduced their feel- 
ings of loneliness (Anderson, 1985). A group intervention 
focusing on self-management abilities attenuated social lone- 
liness in older women (Kremers, Steverink, Albersnagel, & 
Slaets, 2006). A group intervention including therapeutic writ- 
ing and group psychotherapy or physical exercise and discus- 
sion or art activities, 
increased psychological well-being in 
older participants suffering from loneliness (Routasalo, Tilvis, 
Kautiainen, & Pitkala, 2009). In addition, reminiscence and life 
review have been reported to be potentially effective meth- 
ods for the enhancement of psychological well-being (Bohl- 
meijer, Roemer, Cuijpers, & Smit, 2007), and for treating 
depressive symptoms in older adults (Bohlmeijer, Smit, & 
Cuijpers, 2003). A group-based exercise training program was 
more effective than individual home exercise in improving 
mood in older women (Timonen, Rantanen, Timonen, & 
Sulkava, 2002). 
Among the Finnish community-dwelling older popula- 
tion, approximately 5% report feeling lonely often or almost 
always (Savikko, Routasalo, Tilvis, Strandberg, & Pitkala, 
2005; Tiikkainen & Heikkinen, 2005) and 39% suffer from 
loneliness at least occasionally (Routasalo et al., 2006). Heik- 
kinen and Kauppinen (2004) found that over one-third of 
75-year-old women and one-quarter of same age men were 
depressed, and that the proportion of depressed persons 
increased, particularly among women, 
from age 80 to 
85 years. Minor depression among older people is typically 
a dynamic and episodic phenomenon (Heikkinen & Kauppi- 
nen, 2004). Similarly, 
loneliness often is a result of situa- 
tional factors and may be transitory (Luanaigh & Lawlor, 
2008). However, when depressive symptoms and loneliness 
become prolonged, a person may need support to recover. 
Regardless of the positive results of intervention studies on 
enhancing the mental well-being of elderly people, 
more intervention studies are called for to investigate cost- 
effective ways to mitigate loneliness and depressive mood 
in older people. 
The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a 
social 
intervention on depressive symptoms, melancholy, 
loneliness, and perceived togetherness in community-dwell- 
ing Finnish people aged 75–79 years who reported depressed 
mood or loneliness at study entry. In addition, the aim was to 
study whether the parallel effects would be found across the 
three intervention subgroups, and between the depressed 
and not-depressed groups. The basic idea behind the inter- 
vention was that by giving the participants a possibility to 
interact and by promoting social integration their loneliness 
would decrease. 


The GoodMood, project, with the purpose of promoting men- 
tal well-being in older people, was a single-blinded random- 
ized controlled trial (RCT) lasting 1.5 years. The speciﬁc aims 
of the project were to develop screening tools to identify per- 
sons with early signs of declining mental well-being, to 
develop counseling and group interventions promoting per- 
ceived togetherness and mental well-being, and to evaluate 
the impact of early intervention on depressive mood, loneli- 
ness, and participation in older people who were at increased 
risk for impaired mental well-being. GoodMood was carried 
out in co-operation with the GeroCenter Foundation for 
Research and Development, University of Jyv€askyl€a, JAMK 
University of Applied Sciences, and the City of Jyv€askyl€a, Fin- 
land. The Ethical Committee of the Central Finland Health 
Care District approved the study. All participants gave their 
written informed consent prior to the study. 
The selection of the participants and study design are 
shown in Figure 1. The target population comprised of all the 
75- to 79-year-old residents of Jyv€askyl€a, Central Finland, who 
were living in the city center area in August 2008 (N D 1167). 
This age group is suitable for an intervention of this kind: 
although a large proportion of them will have some health 
issues, in most cases these are unlikely to be severe enough 
to restrict participation. Based on earlier studies, it was pre- 
sumed that some 30%–40% of population in this age group 
would report symptoms of loneliness or melancholy (see e.g. 
Heikkinen & Kauppinen, 2004; Tiikkainen & Heikkinen, 2005), 
and that two-thirds would be willing to participate in a study 
of this kind (Leinonen et al., 2007). Therefore, we assumed 
adequate coverage of the target population. Contact informa- 
tion was gathered from the Finnish population register. Of 
the original target population of 1167 people, information on 
perceived loneliness and melancholy was obtained for 985 
persons via phone screening. Of these, 24% reported feeling 
lonely and 37% melancholy at least sometimes. Altogether 
50% reported feelings of melancholy or loneliness at least 
sometimes. All the inclusion criteria: (1) feeling loneliness, 
melancholy, or depressive mood at least sometimes, (2) a 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score greater than 21 
in order to be able to participate in discussions, and (3) willing 
to participate in the study, were met by 296 persons, of whom 
39 withdrew from the study before randomization. After a 
more detailed structured face-to-face home interview 
between September and November 2008, the participants 
met a counselor once. The meeting included discussion of the 
participant’s life situation and available social support. After 
completion of the screening and data collection process, 



257 persons were allocated to the intervention or control 
groups, using a randomized ratio 1:1, by drawing lots. The trial 
administrator performed the randomization. Interviewers and 
data collecting assistants were blinded to the group assign- 
ment of the participants throughout the study. After the end 
of the six-month intervention, a larger follow-up face-to-face 
interview was carried out between April and June 2009, in the 
participants’ homes. Shorter follow-up interviews were carried 
out by phone at 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention 
ended. One participant died and 33 withdrew from the study 
during the intervention. Only the data on the persons who 
participated in both home interviews (intervention group n D 
105, control group n D 118) were analyzed in this study. 
Drop-outs did not differ from those who remained in the 
study in sex, self-rated health, or melancholy. A slightly larger 
proportion of participants lived alone (66% vs. 56%), felt 
lonely at least sometimes (68% vs. 52%), and did not have a 
supporting person in their network (22% vs. 13%) than drop- 
outs. At each stage, reasons most often given for withdrawal 
were lack of interest (24%), no expected beneﬁt from partici- 
pation (27%), lack of time (28%), and poor health (27%). In 
addition, drop-outs in the intervention group during the inter- 
vention did not differ signiﬁcantly from drop-outs in the 
control group in depressive symptoms (mean Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS) 5.17 in the intervention group vs. 4.22 
in the controls). 

The primary outcome of this study was information on depres- 
sive symptoms measured using a short form of the GDS. The 
GDS is specially designed to screen for depressed mood in 
older adults. A larger score indicates greater severity of symp- 
toms and the scale maximum is 15. The cut-off score for 
depression has most commonly been deﬁned as (cid:2)5 (see 
Greenberg, 2007). We used the summary score of the scale in 
the analyses. 
The secondary outcomes were melancholy, feelings of lone- 
liness, and dimensions of perceived togetherness. Melancholy 
was assessed with the question: ‘How do you perceive your 
mood in general?’ The response options were almost always 
good, sometimes melancholy, and often or almost always 
melancholy. The response options for the question ‘Do you 
feel lonely?’ were very rarely or never, sometimes, and often or 
almost always. Perceived togetherness was measured using the 
Social Provisions Scale developed on the basis of Weiss’s the- 
ory (Cutrona & Russell, 1987). Its 24 items are equally divided 
between the six different dimensions or provisions: attach- 
ment, social integration, reliable alliance, guidance, opportu- 
nity for nurturance, and reassurance of worth. Attachment 
refers to social relationships which satisfy the need for prox- 
imity, affection and love, and which can promote feelings of 
security and well-being. Social integration refers to a sense of 
belonging to a group or community where people can share 
common concerns and exchange experiences. Reliable alli- 
ance refers to having a relationship one can turn to in an 
emergency. Guidance refers to having access to advice and 
assistance. Opportunity for nurturance means having the rela- 
tionships in which a person feels responsible for the well- 
being of another. Reassurance of worth is possible in social 
relationships where the individual’s skills and competencies 
are respected. Two of the four questions in each dimension 


are positively and two negatively worded. On a scale from 
strongly disagree (scored 1) to strongly agree (scored 4), the 
they 
respondents were asked to assess to what extent 
thought that each statement described their current social 
relationships. The responses to the negatively worded items 
were reversed. A composite measure was calculated for each 
dimension with scores ranging between 4 and 16, where 
larger values indicated a more positive aspect. Depressive 
symptoms and perceived togetherness were assessed at 
baseline and at the end of the six-month intervention, and 
melancholy and feelings of loneliness were further assessed 
at the 3-, 6-, and 12- month post-intervention follow-up 
measurements. 
Information on age (in years), sex, full-time education (level 
of schooling), perceived economic situation (good, moderate, 
or poor), living alone (yes/no), morbidity, cognitive function- 
ing, and mobility were gathered during the face-to-face inter- 
views. Morbidity was assessed by asking the participant to 
state what physician-diagnosed chronic diseases of more 
than three months’ duration he or she currently had. Cogni- 
tive functioning was assessed with the MMSE (Folstein, Fol- 
stein, & McHugh, 1975). Mobility was assessed by asking 
about perceived difﬁculties in walking 2 km, 500 m, ambulat- 
ing indoors, and climbing stairs. The response options for 
these were ‘not able’ (scored 0), ‘not able without somebody 
to help’ (scored 1), ‘yes, but has difﬁculties’ (scored 2), or ‘yes, 
without difﬁculties’ (scored 3). Summary measures were com- 
puted for mobility. 

The participants randomized to the intervention group were 
allowed to select from three alternatives the intervention 
regime they thought would beneﬁt them the most (Table 1). 
The exercise program was the most favored (n D 45) followed 
by personal counseling (n D 33) and the social activity pro- 
gram (n D 27). The three regimes were similar in that each 
included social interaction, participants were able to inﬂuence 
the content of the meetings, and well-being was promoted. 
Participants in the exercise and the social activity programs 
met weekly altogether 19–21 times. The exercise program 
involved varying types of exercise and was conducted by 
qualiﬁed instructors in municipal gyms. The social activity pro- 
gram was delivered by health care students from JAMK Uni- 
versity of Applied Sciences and participants met in the city 
library. Activities included group discussions, self-expression 
using art and creative methods, and going on day-trips. Per- 
sonal counseling was conducted by a rehabilitation counselor 
and meetings took place in a health care center. Meetings 
were held approximately every third week and each partici- 
pant attended 4–5 meetings. The issues discussed in the 
meetings varied depending on what topics the participant 
considered important. Counseling was given when needed. 
The control group received one counseling session which 
took place prior to randomization. Controls had access to the 
usual services offered by the municipality and other service 
providers. 

Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were used to 
estimate parameters for group- and time-main effects and 
group-by-time interaction for depressive symptoms, melan- 
choly, loneliness, and the dimensions of perceived together- 
ness. We report the type III effect p-values that are invariant 
to the choice of reference category. In the analyses, to opti- 
mize statistical power relative to the control group, we did 
not separate the three intervention subgroups but treated 
them as a single group. We then conducted ancillary GEE 
analysis for the intervention subgroups and for those above 
and below the GDS cut-off score ((cid:2)5). These analyses were 
performed with IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22.0. The propor- 
tion of missing data in individual variables varied between 0% 
and 3.6%. The Multiple Imputation procedure of SAS for Win- 
dows (version 9.1) was used to impute missing values using 
the available information from the model variables and on 
background characteristics, physical activity, and functional 
ability. 

Average participant age was 77.0 years at baseline, 75% were 
women, and 65% lived alone (Table 2). Mean MMSE score was 
27.2 and mean number of chronic diseases was 2.9. Partici- 
pants typically had only early signs of mobility decline as 35% 
reported difﬁculties only in walking longer distances (2 km) 
and 60% reported no difﬁculties in any mobility tasks. 
In 
loneliness, and dimen- 
depressive symptoms, melancholy, 
sions of perceived togetherness, the intervention and the 
control groups were comparable. 
Primary outcome: the six-month intervention did not affect 
depressive symptoms. The number of symptoms remained at 
the same level over the six-month intervention (Table 3). 
Secondary outcomes: Table 3 shows that feelings of loneli- 
ness and melancholy decreased in both the intervention and 
control groups. The improvement in melancholy (Figure 2)

and loneliness (Figure 3) remained up to the 12-month post- 
the dimensions of perceived 
intervention follow-up. Of 
togetherness, guidance and attachment increased in both 
groups during the six-month intervention. Time and group- 
by-time interaction effects were statistically signiﬁcant for 
social integration indicating positive change only in the inter- 
vention group. 
Ancillary analyses conducted for the intervention regimes 
did not add to the existing results. In each regime, social inte- 
gration, attachment, and guidance increased, and feelings of 
loneliness and melancholy decreased during the six-month 
intervention. One difference between regimes was observed 
in reassurance of worth. Participants who chose personal 
counseling reported less often than those in the exercise 
group that they felt their individual’s skills and competencies 
were respected. 
Ancillary analyses among those who were categorized as 
depressed (GDS score (cid:2) 5; n D 36 in the intervention and 34 
in the control group) or non-depressed (GDS score 1–4; n D 
69 in the intervention and 84 in the control group) revealed 
no additional information on the effectiveness of the inter- 
vention. Overall, while the time effects indicated that depres- 
sive symptoms decreased among those who were depressed 
and loneliness decreased among those who were non- 
depressed, the changes were similar in the intervention and 
the control groups. As a consequence of the intervention, 
social integration increased only among those who were non- 
depressed at baseline. 

The results of our study showed that the intervention did not 
alleviate depressed mood. Feelings of loneliness and melan- 
choly decreased and perceived attachment and guidance 
increased over time similarly in both the intervention and 
control groups. The intervention was efﬁcacious in increasing 
social integration. However, changes in social integration and 
feelings of loneliness were observed only among those who 
felt lonely but were not depressed. 
Our results add to the diversity of previous ﬁndings on the 
effectiveness of interventions in reducing depressiveness or 
loneliness in older people. Some randomized controlled trials 
have reported a decrease in depressive symptoms (Bohlmeijer 
et al., 2003; Constantino, 1988; Pinquart, Duberstein, & Lyness, 
2007; Timonen et al., 2002) or loneliness (Anderson, 1985; 
Ollonqvist et al., 2008). Other targeted interventions, however, 
have not been successful 
in alleviating depressive mood 
(Arnetz, Theorell, & Arnetz, 1983; White et al., 2002) or loneli- 
ness (Routasalo et al., 2009; White et al., 2002). We designed 
our intervention based on studies that had obtained positive 
results, but we were not able to detect additional beneﬁts 
with respect to loneliness, melancholy, and depressive symp- 
toms beyond those achieved naturally over time. Some other 
studies have similarly reported that, e.g. loneliness was also 
attenuated in the control group during the study (Kremers 
et al., 2006; see e.g. Martina & Stevens, 2006).

and loneliness in the whole study group over time may partly 
result from the attention participants received during the 
study. In addition to a home interview, each participant had a 
meeting with a counselor at baseline. This may also have 
brought about an increase in perceived guidance and attach- 
ment in both groups. Another explanation may be the Haw- 
thorne effect, according to which people behave differently 
just because they know that they are being studied (see 
Becker, Roberts, & Voelmeck, 2003). It is also possible that sim- 
ply reporting about their feelings of loneliness and melan- 
choly, social relationships, and activities outside the home led 
the control group members to independently make efforts to 
change their situation, which was subsequently reﬂected in 
reduced loneliness and melancholy. 
In our study, the intervention did not expedite the process 
of overcoming the depressive mood or loneliness. However, a 
more individualized therapeutic perspective might have 
resulted in an improvement in depressiveness (see Pinquart 
et al., 2007). Loneliness may be difﬁcult to alleviate as it has 
many different causes and perceived deﬁciencies in social 
relationships affect loneliness in many different ways. Theo- 
ries of loneliness emphasize factors relating to personality or 
traits, or various states in a person’s life. Loneliness may be 
associated with the loss of a conﬁdant and the resultant grief, 
lack of meaningful social relationships, dissatisfaction with 
existing relationships, existential questions, deﬁcits in early 
attachment relationships, or shyness and fears in social situa- 
tions. These matters should be taken into account and inter- 
ventions targeted accordingly. 
In this study, social integration increased in the interven- 
tion but not in the control group. Social integration refers to 
experiencing oneself as part of group or having people 
around one who like the same social activities, think the same 
way about things, have the same interests and concerns, and 
like to do things in the same way as oneself. Lack of social 
integration is associated with social loneliness and might best 
be resolved by acquiring new contacts. In a pilot study focus- 
ing on older people who were clients of home health care, 
receiving volunteer visitors during a period of six weeks 
improved older persons’ perceived social integration (MacIn- 
tyre et al., 1999). Meeting peers in a group setting or a coun- 
selor in a one-to-one setting may offer the older person 
positive stimulation along with emotional support and

attention (see the multidimensional model of afﬁliation in Hill, 
1987, 2009) which, in turn, may enhance the experience of 
acceptance and belonging (see Leary & Kelly, 2009). All three 
intervention regimes in our study included social interaction 
and were participatory, which may explain the ﬁndings. 
Participants were allowed to choose from three possible 
regimes selected on the basis of the results of previous stud- 
ies. This was done because the opportunity to choose enhan- 
ces the experience of control over one’s life and the 
motivation to complete the intervention (see Mannell & 
Kleiber, 1997, p. 144). In our study, the proportion of drop- 
outs from the intervention group was 16%, whereas in studies 
offering the same intervention regime to all participants, the 
drop-out rate has ranged from 20% to 27% (Kremers et al., 
2006; Ollonqvist et al., 2008; White et al., 2002). 
Depressive symptoms were measured with the GDS, which 
has been found to be a good screening tool for depressive 
symptoms among older adults (e.g. de Craen, Heeren, & Gus- 
sekloo, 2003) and has been observed to detect changes in 
depressive symptoms. In a study among 85-year-old persons 
who experienced a major negative life event, the shorter form 
of the GDS was able to detect a change in their depressive 
symptoms (Vinkers, Gussekloo, Stek, Westendorp, & Van Der 
Mast, 2004). The meta-analysis by Pinquart et al. (2007) con- 
cluded that the GDS detected improvements in depressive 
symptoms. Consequently, we believe that GDS is valid and 
reliable and that the present result is not an outcome of deﬁ- 
ciencies in the assessment scale. 
This study has both strengths and weaknesses. One weak- 
ness may be that we assessed loneliness with a single ques- 
tion which does not enable a distinction to be drawn 
loneliness, or between the 
between emotional and social 
state and trait aspects of the experience (Luanaigh & Lawlor, 
2008). However, the question is understandable and generally 
acceptable, and measures loneliness directly (Bowling, 2005). 
In addition to loneliness, we measured perceived together- 
ness, which is a positive perspective on social relationships 
that correlates negatively with feelings of loneliness. 
The strengths of the study were its sampling and screening 
methods and design. First, the target population included all 
the residents in a particular age group living in a certain geo- 
graphical area. Those recruited, based on their feeling of lone- 
liness or melancholy, were otherwise comparable with those 
who did not meet the study inclusion criteria. Compared to 
studies based on non-probability or convenience samples, 
our study gives a more realistic picture of the prevalence of 
loneliness and melancholy among older people and of the 
possibilities to alleviate these problems. Second, those who 
dropped out during the study did not differ in their feelings 
of melancholy from those who continued their participation 
in the study. Third, having a control group in the study 
allowed to conclude that the observed positive changes hap- 
pened over time independent of the intervention. Had we 
not had a control group, we would likely have concluded that 
the intervention alleviated the problems, which would have 
been a misleading interpretation of the results. Fourth, the 
participants were allowed to choose the intervention regime 
they preferred, which probably reduced the drop-out rate. 
Drop-out during the study was comparable to that reported 
in other similar studies and it was factored into the study 
design. 
In light of the aspects discussed earlier, we may conclude 
that the results of our study are generalizable to the older 


home-dwelling population in other parts of Finland and in 
other similar cultures. The design and implementation of the 
study could also be applied in other older population. How- 
ever, the effect of social intervention of the present kind on 
loneliness and depressive mood among older populations 
requires further research. 

In sum, the effects of the social intervention of choice were 
moderate and did not expedite the process of overcoming 
depressive mood or 
loneliness. These phenomena were 
somewhat alleviated, but these improvements occurred inde- 
pendently of the intervention. Notwithstanding, our second- 
ary analysis suggests that some positive changes occurred in 
perceived social integration as a direct consequence of the 
intervention, and the improvement was parallel in each of 
the three intervention regime. Loneliness, melancholy, and 
the dimensions of perceived togetherness are intertwined, 
and thus more research is needed to achieve deeper under- 
standing of the links between these psychosocial phenomena.
