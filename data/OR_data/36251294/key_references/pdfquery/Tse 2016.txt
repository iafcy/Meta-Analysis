Objectives To examine the feasibility of a peer-led 
pain management program among nursing home 
residents. 



Methods The experimental group (n ¼ 32) was 
given a 12-week group-based peer-led pain manage- 
ment program. There were two 1-hour sessions per 
week. Education in pain and demonstrations of 
nonpharmacological pain management strategies 
were provided. The research team and 12 trained 
peers led the sessions. The control group (n ¼ 18) 
received one 1-hour session of pain management 
program each week over 12 weeks from the re- 
search team only. Outcome measures for the par- 
ticipants were collected at baseline (P1) and at 
week 12 (P2). Data from peer volunteers were col- 
lected prior to training (V1) and at week 12 (V2). 
T-tests were used to compare the differences in 
outcome measures collected at two time points. 
Results There was a significant reduction in pain 
intensity from 5.8 6 2.6 (P1) to 3.4 6 2.5 (P2) for the 


experimental group (p ¼ 0.003) and from 6.3 6 3.0 
(P1) 
the control group 
(p ¼ 0.001). Activities of daily living significantly im- 
proved for both the experimental group (p ¼ 0.008) 
and the control group (p ¼ 0.014). There was an en- 
hancement in happiness level for the experimental 
group (p < 0.001), while the loneliness level dropped 
significantly for the experimental group (p < 0.001) 
and the control group (p ¼ 0.031). The peer volun- 
teers showed a significant increase in self-rated 
pain management knowledge (2.9 6 2.6 to 8.1 6 1.2, 
p < 0.001) and self-efficacy in volunteering (5.8 6 2.9 
to 8.3 6 1.5, p ¼ 0.032). 
Conclusion The peer-led pain management pro- 
gram was feasible and has potential in relieving 
chronic pain and enhancing the physical and psy- 
chological health of nursing home residents.

When people enter the aging process, they are more 
vulnerable to suffering from age-related disease and 
hence pain. Chronic geriatric pain is defined as an un- 
pleasant sensory and emotional experience affecting 
persons who are over 65 years old for more than 3 
months, and it is associated with actual and potential 
tissue damage that is noncancerous in nature [1] or is 
described in terms of such damage. It is estimated that 
37–50% of community-dwelling older people in Hong 
Kong suffer 
from pain [2,3]. The prevalence of pain 
among nursing home residents may even be as high as 
70% [4]. Consequences of unrelieved chronic pain 
among older adults include hindered activities of daily 
living, depression and anxiety, decreased social 
inter- 
action, impaired mobility and falls, sleep disturbances, 
malnutrition, and, ultimately, an increase in health care 
utilization and expenditures [5]. Therefore, 
innovative 
and cost-effective ways of managing chronic pain 
should be explored. 
To address chronic pain, analgesics remain the primary

popular among older adults, as they worry about

adverse drug reactions and accept chronic pain as part 
of aging [7]. Due to low compliance with the pharmaco- 
logical approach for pain management, an increasing 
number of studies have been conducted to support the 
use of nonpharmacological pain management strategies 
as an effective approach to dealing with chronic pain 
[8]. The commonly used strategies include education 
programs, empowerment programs for pain sufferers, 
exercise programs, acupuncture, transcutaneous nerve 
stimulation, massage, relaxation therapies, cognitive-be- 
havioral therapy, listening to music, visual stimulation, 
guided imagery, motivational 
interviewing, acupressure, 
and multisensory stimulation arts and crafts therapy. 
Indeed, it is expected that the use of nonpharmacologi- 
cal 
interventions is more acceptable for older adults 
who are already taking multiple medications for their 
chronic diseases. 
A pain management program (PAP) has been carried 
out in nursing homes in Hong Kong by health care pro- 
fessionals [4]. Nursing homes were randomized into an 
experimental group in which the participants (n ¼ 296) 
received a 1-hour session of pain management educa- 
tion each week, or a control group in which the partici- 
pants (n ¼ 239) were provided with regular care only, 
such as routine physio sessions and social activities 
organized by the nursing homes. The PAP included pain 
education and an introduction to and demonstration of 
various nondrug strategies. Those in the experimental 
group showed a significant reduction in pain scores, 
higher scores in happiness, and lower perceptions in 
loneliness than the control group. The use of nonphar- 
macological methods of pain relief significantly increased 
among the participants in the experimental group as 
compared with those in the control group.

fectiveness of self-managed interventions for pain 
among older adults has been explored in a review, in 
which 96% of the 27 articles identified showed positive 
outcomes from using nonpharmacological approaches 
to manage pain, with a median reduction in pain scores 
of 23% [10]. Despite the benefits of self-management 
for people with chronic pain, it is challenging to imple- 
ment pain self-management due to limited health care 
resources in a busy clinical setting. 
Peer support models are becoming widely used be- 
cause they are cost-effective in helping patients manage 
chronic conditions and have shown promising results 
[11]. Peer support, where lay individuals receive a mod- 
erate amount of training to support those with whom 
they have shared experiences, has been regarded as an 
effective self-management strategy for chronic condi- 
tions. Using peers to lead health programs helps to 
build a high level of rapport among people of similar 

ages and life experiences [12], and allows participants 
to feel less threatened when supported by someone like 
themselves as compared with the experience of seeking 
professional help [13]. 
Pain management programs with peer support have 
been shown to yield positive outcomes, including an im- 
life, functional cap- 
provement in perceived quality of 
acity, number of complaints about pain, and belief 
in

showed that self-management education programs by 
lay individuals (rather than health professionals) for peo- 
ple with chronic conditions had positive outcomes, such 
as reductions in pain, disability, and fatigue [16]. Peer 
support interventions for community-dwelling adults with 
chronic noncancer pain were also reported to be effect- 
ive in a systematic review [17]. 
Although positive outcomes have been shown in peer 
education programs in pain management, to the best of 
our knowledge, none of them have focused on older 
adults and those living in nursing home settings. A PAP 
led solely by health care professionals has been found 
to be effective [4]. Therefore, the question of whether a 
PAP using peer volunteers for older adults in nursing 
homes would also be effective seemed well worth 
exploring. Thus, 
the present study 
were to examine the feasibility of a peer-led PAP in 
reducing pain, enhancing pain self-efficacy and activities 
of daily living (ADL), reducing loneliness and increasing 
happiness for nursing home residents; and to evaluate 
the volunteer experience for the peer volunteers. 



A quasi-experimental design was applied to investigate 
the efficacy of adding peer volunteers (PVs) 
into PAP. 
Ethical approval from the ethics committee of the uni- 
versity was obtained. 

Peer volunteers were recruited from a pool of regular 
members of the Institute of Active Ageing (IAA) of the 
Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which is dedicated 
to delivering innovative educational programs to pro- 
mote active aging. The IAA staff announced and pro- 
moted this study to those members. 
Individuals who 
expressed an interest attended a selection interview. 
The selection criteria for the PVs included those who 
were (cid:2) 50 years old (the requirement for membership in 
the IAA), retired, and committed to completing two 2- 
hour training sessions, and who had passed an exit test 
that 
included knowledge, demonstration, and re- 
demonstration of skills in the use of the program mater- 
ials and in leading the program. 
Educational materials on pain relief were prepared. A 
“Guidebook for Peer Volunteers” was given to all PVs to 
ensure that the procedure and content of each session 
were standardized. Safety and privacy issues were men- 
tioned in the guidebook. It also included instructions on 
how to use the “I can do it” booklet, which summarized 
the information on pain management strategies and the 
use of drugs and various nondrug therapies, and gave 
pictures of the steps involved in the physical exercises. 
The “I can do it” booklet was given to all participants. 
The contents of these materials were validated by the 
research team. 

Nursing homes were approached and invited to partici- 
pate in the study by phone or email. Two nursing 
homes responded to the invitation, and they were 
randomized at cluster levels according to a randomiza- 
tion list (i.e., all participants in a nursing home were ei- 
ther in the experimental group or control group). The 
randomization list was kept in an opaque sealed enve- 
lope and held by a person who was independent of the 
trial. The two nursing homes that participated in this 
study were run by the same elderly care group. They 
can be considered comparable settings, as the organ- 
ization, management, and service provided were similar. 
Inclusion criteria were older adults aged (cid:2) 60 years, who 
scored (cid:2) 6 in the Abbreviated Mental Test 
[18], had 
been experiencing nonmalignant physical pain either 
continuously or intermittently for more than 3 months, 
and were able to understand Cantonese. Exclusion cri- 
teria were those with cognitive impairment and a history 
of mental disorders, and those with cancer and cur- 
rently in cancer treatment. Those suffering from condi- 
tions that limited safe participation were excluded, as 
this program involved physical activities. These included 
individuals who had suffered from a fracture or under- 
gone surgery in the past 2 months, and those with se- 
vere chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute 
stroke, or acute myocardial infarction. 
Nursing home residents underwent screening. Those 
who were eligible to participate in the study were as- 
the experimental group or control 
signed to either 
group. Clustered randomization was used so that all 
participants in a nursing home were either in the experi- 
mental group or control group to prevent potential com- 
munication between participants of the intervention and 
control groups (information flow). The randomization list 
was kept in an opaque sealed envelope and held by a 
person who was independent of the trial. 

A 12-week group-based peer-led PAP was given to the 
experimental group participants during weeks 1 to 12. 
Each session involved a small group of six participants. 
Each PV was responsible for guiding and providing as- 
sistance to two to three participants each time. There 
were a total of 24 sessions, with two 1-hour sessions 
each week. Table 1 shows the details of the program.

components: physical exercise, 
interactive teaching, 
and sharing of pain management education and port- 
folio entry. All teaching components were provided in 
the “I can do it” booklet, which was developed and vali- 
dated by physicians in pain management and geriatric 
care and a physiotherapist. The session started with 
physical exercises (20 minutes), including towel dancing; 
exercises on correct body posture and alignment; and 
the stretching of arms, legs, and body muscles. The se- 
the session was the pain management 
cond part of 
education or revision (30 minutes), which included infor- 
mation on pain situations, the effects and impacts of 
pain on older adults, and the use of drugs and nondrug 
strategies in pain management. The use of nondrug 
therapies included viewing photographs of the natural 
environment, listening to music, and participating in mul- 
tisensory stimulation arts and crafts activities. At the end 
of each session, portfolio entries on the knowledge and 
activities of the day were made to help the participants 
recall the various pain relief methods learned in class. 
Session 1 was led by the research team with PVs as 
observers, and session 2 of the same week was led by 
the PVs only without 
the research 
team. 


A weekly 1-hour session of PAP was solely delivered by 
the research team over 12 weeks. The content of the 
session was the same as the experimental group. No 
PVs were involved in the control group. 

To ensure adherence and compliance with the content 
and process of the protocol, regular meetings were held 
among the research team, peer volunteers, and nursing 
home staff. Ongoing supervision, monitoring, support, 
and encouragement of peer volunteers were given in 
the regular PV group meeting. Onsite visits in the nurs- 
ing homes were provided to give feedback and coach- 
ing. The peer volunteers were encouraged to contact 
the research team for prompt support when necessary. 

The following data were collected from the participants 
for both groups at baseline (P1): demographic data 
(including age, gender, level of education, marital status, 
and frailty status), pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, ADL, 
loneliness level, and happiness level. Outcome meas- 
ures were collected again at week 12 on the completion 
of the intervention (P2). The peer volunteers were asked 
to complete a questionnaire at two time points, i.e., be- 
fore the training (V1) and at week 12 (V2). 
The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was used to measure 
pain intensity using an 11-point scale. The NRS is a line 
marked in equal segments from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst 
possible pain). The NRS has been shown to be a

the Pain Self-Efficacy 
of 
The Chinese 
Questionnaire (PSEQ-HK) was used to assess the par- 
ticipants’ confidence in their ability to perform specific 
tasks or their confidence in performing more generalized 
constructs such as coping with chronic nonmalignant 
pain. It is a 10-item self-report inventory. Each item is 
scored on a 7-point Likert scale (ranging from 0, “not at 
all confident” to 6, “completely confident”), with a higher 
total score indicating stronger self-efficacy beliefs. It is a 
reliable assessment tool with satisfactory psychometric 
properties [20]. 
The Modified Barthel Index (MBI) was used to measure 
performance in activities of daily living, testing 10 items 
such as feeding, grooming, toileting, ambulation, and 
bathing. The score varies from item to item and the 
maximum total score is 100, indicating total 
independ- 
ence [21]. The interrater reliability is greater than 0.95, 
and the test-retest reliability is 0.89 [22]. The Chinese 
Loneliness level was measured using the Chinese ver- 
sion of the Loneliness Scale [24]. The scale consists of 
20 items to assess the participants’ perception of loneli- 
ness and social 
isolation using a 4-point Likert scale 
(1 ¼ never, 2 ¼ seldom, 3 ¼ sometimes, 4 ¼ always). The 
total possible scores range from 20 to 80, with higher 
scores indicating greater loneliness. The Chinese version 
with a Cronbach’s alpha was used. 
The level of subjective happiness was assessed using 
the Chinese version of the subjective happiness scale 
[25]. The scale consists of four items rated on a 7-point 
Likert scale. The total scores range from 4 to 28, with 
higher scores indicating higher subjective happiness. 
The Cronbach’s alpha is 0.82, and the 2-week test- 
retest reliability was 0.70. 
A questionnaire containing closed-ended questions was 
completed by the peer volunteers. The peer volunteers 

were asked to rate their confidence in implementing the 
pain education program (Likert scale from 10 [the most 
confident] through 1 [the least confident]) and their level 
of pain management knowledge (Likert scale from 10 
[the most adequate] through 1 [the least adequate]). 

All statistical analyses were performed using the 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). A 
descriptive statistical analysis of 
the quantitative data 
was carried out. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test 
was used to examine the normality of the outcome vari- 
ables. To examine the effects of the intervention, t-tests 
were used to compare outcome measures collected at 
two time points (i.e., P1 and P2) because the data fol- 
lowed a normal distribution. The questionnaires for the 
volunteers collected at two time points (i.e., V1 and V2) 
were compared using a pair sample t-test. A score of 
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 


Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of subject recruitment. 
Table 2 shows the demographics of the nursing home 

residents. Fifty nursing home residents participated in 
the study. There were no significant differences in 
demographic data between the two groups. Most were 
female and over 80 years old. Over 50% of the nursing 
home residents were widowed and had received no for- 
mal education. Almost 75% of them had suffered from 
chronic pain over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, 12 
PVs completed the training and led in the program. 
Most of the PVs were female, and about 50% of them 
were below 60 years old. Over 75% of the PVs were 
married and had received a secondary level of educa- 
tion or above. Nearly half of the PVs had experienced 
chronic pain in the past 12 months, and over 90% of 
the PVs had participated in volunteer service in the 
past.

from

The present study demonstrated that a pain manage- 
ment program significantly 
reduced pain intensity, 
enhanced ADL, and improved loneliness levels among 
nursing home residents, regardless of whether the pro- 
gram was led solely by health care professional staff or 
with the use of peer volunteers. The peer-led pain man- 
agement program also showed potential 
to improve 
happiness levels among older adults living in a nursing 
home, while there was no significant change in happi- 
ness level among control group participants. The study 
generated evidence to support the feasibility of peer vol- 
unteers, and the results add to the growing body of evi- 
dence supporting the feasibility of peer volunteers in 
pain education programs [14–17,26,27]. 

In a literature review, 
to the self- 
management of chronic pain have been identified [28], 
namely, treatment (a belief that pain-relief strategies are 
ineffective), personal (challenges to controlling pain due 
to disability, a lack of self-efficacy, and limited re- 
sources), mental health (the presence of depression, 
anxiety, and fear of pain), and social barriers (a lack of 
social support). Treatment and personal barriers are 
overcome by transferring knowledge to the participants 
in traditional pain education programs led by health care 
professionals. In this study, the addition of PVs helped 
to address the remaining barriers. PVs reinforced the 
home 
knowledge 
pain management 


residents, 
re-demonstrated nonpharmacological pain 
management strategies, praised the residents’ accom- 
plishments, shared personal experiences and developed 
social bonds with them, and persuaded them to adhere 
to treatment 
findings 
showed improvements in the pain levels and physical 
and psychological health of the participants, indicating 
the feasibility of using PVs. 



Previous studies showed that the use of peers in pain 
education programs 
in the 
the participants and increased their 
pain situation of 
pain self-efficacy [26] and functional capacity [15,27]. 
However, the content and duration of the intervention, 
the instruments for measuring outcome measures and, 
most 
the target population differed from 
those in this study. Therefore, this study is the first to in- 
vestigate the feasibility of using peers in a pain educa- 
tion program for nursing home residents. 

The current study also indicated that peer support has 
the potential to improve the psychological parameters of 
the participants. Having a chronic pain condition can be 
a lonely experience. A previous study demonstrated that 
even those participants who described themselves as 
possessing strong social networks reported feeling iso- 
lated and lacking in support for dealing with their pain 
conditions [27]. General social support does not neces- 
sarily ensure the receipt of effective pain-specific sup- 
port, which may be difficult for the family to provide, as 
they lack the coping resources required to support a 
person in pain. Therefore, peer volunteers with similar 
experiences may provide pain-specific support and 
emotional support, resulting in improvement 
in loneli- 
ness and happiness levels among nursing home resi- 
dents with chronic pain. The positive outcomes of this 
pilot study provide evidence of this. However, it should 
be noted that the effects of peers on psychological par- 
ameters were examined over a short-term follow up; 
whether the same effects can be sustained for the lon- 
ger term when peer support is no longer provided is un- 
In addition, experimental group participants

received added attention, as a total of 
two sessions 
were offered compared with only one session given to 
the control group participants. Therefore, these psycho- 
logical parameters may have improved when the nursing 
home residents participated in more social activities ra- 
ther 
the use of peer volunteers. 
Whether the findings can be attributed to the use of 



peer volunteers or greater attention are not well known, 
and further study with a strengthened study design is 
required. 
Although not investigated in our pilot study, another fre- 
quently mentioned advantage of 
the peer education 
model 
is that it is a cost-effective way of delivering an 
intervention, especially to those who may be unable to 
afford professional fees [30]. Given that the global popu- 
lation is aging and the demand for health services is 
increasing, using older volunteers is considered an alter- 
native model of delivering services, particularly where 
health systems are underfunded [13]. The current study 
showed that pain management programs led by both a 
research team and peer volunteers also improved the 
pain situations and physical and psychological param- 
eters of participants in a similar direction as the program 
led solely by the research team. Therefore, it is worth 
studying if the program led solely by peer volunteers 
would be as effective as one led by health care profes- 
sionals in a larger sample. Future study should also 
compare the cost between PV-led and research team– 
led pain education programs. 
The benefits of using older volunteers are that they are 
not constrained by time and are a readily available, 
cost-effective labor resource [31]. However, 
it should 
also be noted that time and cost are involved in recruit- 
ing, training, and retaining peer volunteers. From our 
observation in this pilot study, recruiting and training 
peer volunteers are important. There are more than 
1000 members in the IAA pool, and within 100 of them 
are active members. The research team spent about 1 
month to recruit the PVs, and some eligible PVs who 
were not able to complete the two training sessions 
were excluded. The research team had provided two 
sessions of training to PVs, with demonstration and re- 
demonstration on the skills and knowledge in leading 
the PAP. The cost to develop educational materials was 
about HK$100 per session, and HK$20 per person was 
required for the travelling. The cost and time of training 
those PVs would be worthwhile when they could be 
empowered and continue to contribute to society via 
participation in the PAP. It should be emphasized that 
regular meetings with nursing staff are important to en- 
sure adherence and compliance with the content and 
process of the protocol; therefore no conflict has been 
observed in this pilot study. In addition, all the peer vol- 
unteers who were involved in this pilot study agreed to 
assist in the future, indicating that the retention rate is 
high and the trained peers can be used again in future 
pain education programs. Therefore, drawing on them 
to help older adults with chronic pain will help to reduce 
health care expenditures. 
One of the limitations of this study was the exclusive re- 
liance on self-reports for the quantitative data that were 
collected. However, it was assumed that people would 
be as honest as possible to the extent that they were 
aware of 
feelings, and functional 
abilities at the time of the collection of the data. Our 



subjects were also mentally intact and oriented as to 
time and place. It was recognized that some patients 
with chronic pain may either exaggerate or minimize 
their reports of pain. Nonetheless, it was assumed that 
these reporting patterns would be consistent over time. 
Given that the primary focus of this study was to docu- 
ment changes over time, 
it was determined that the 
benefits of self-reported questionnaires provided ad- 
equate justification for their use [32]. In addition, data 
were collected by individuals who were not responsible 
for 
reporting biases were 
minimized, as the subjects did not necessarily report 
positive answers to please the researchers. Secondly, 
no measure of residents’ pain knowledge was included 
at baseline and post-intervention. Therefore, whether re- 
duction in pain intensity was due to the addition of PVs 
or pain knowledge of residents per se is not well known. 
Another limitation of this study is that it was a pilot study 
with a relatively small sample size, and therefore was 
underpowered to determine effectiveness. The sample 
was limited to two nursing homes, which limits the gen- 
eralizability of the study’s findings. Moreover, the find- 
ings may be due to the fact that participants from the 
experimental group received greater attention than the 
control group participants rather than the inclusion of 
peer support. However, 
this study has demonstrated 
the feasibility of recruiting and retaining peer volunteers 
and older adults for a peer-support intervention for nurs- 
ing home residents with chronic pain. Future study with 
a strengthened study design (i.e., the same intervention 
duration for both groups, with one session led by PVs 
for 
the experimental group and one session led by 
trained research assistants for the control group) will be 
required to consolidate the effectiveness of peer volun- 
teers in pain education program. 

Findings of this pilot study indicate that education on 
pain self-management 
is essential. Although nursing 
staff and other health care professionals are the major 
sources of pain knowledge in nursing homes, studies 
have found that their pain knowledge is not adequate 
[33]. In addition, pain is a common problem in elderly 
persons, especially those in nursing homes [33]. Due to 
the limited health care resources and budgets, training 
of laypersons provides an opportunity for them to trans- 
fer pain self-management knowledge to nursing home 
residents. In the future, there is potential for the govern- 
ment to set up an accreditation scheme to enhance the 
ability of well-trained peer volunteers to contribute to 
home 
education 
pain management 
residents. 



Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults. This pilot 
study supports the feasibility of using peer volunteers in 
pain education programs for older adults. We believe 
that peer support may be beneficial for older adults, and 
there is a trend to incorporate peer support into elderly
