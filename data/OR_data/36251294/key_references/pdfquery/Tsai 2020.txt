videoconferencing program for older 
nursing home residents on depression, 
loneliness, and quality of life: a quasi- 
experimental study

Background: Smartphones can optimize the opportunities for interactions between nursing home residents and 
their families. However, the effectiveness of smartphone-based videoconferencing programs in enhancing 
emotional status and quality of life has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate of the 
effect of a smartphone-based videoconferencing program on nursing home residents’ feelings of loneliness, 
depressive symptoms and quality of life. 
Methods: This study used a quasi-experimental research design. Older residents from seven nursing homes in 
Taiwan participated in this study. Nursing homes (NH) were randomly selected as sites for either the intervention 
group (5 NH) or the control group (2 NH); NH residents who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate. 
The intervention group was comprised of 32 participants; the control group was comprised of 30 participants. 
The intervention group interacted with their family members once a week for 6 months using a smartphone and 
a “LINE” application (app). Data were collected with self-report instruments: subjective feelings of loneliness, using 
the University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale; depressive symptoms, using the Geriatric Depression 
Scale; and quality of life using the SF-36. Data were collected at four time points (baseline, and at 1-month, 3- 
months and 6-months from baseline). Data were analysed using the generalized estimating equation approach. 
Results: After the intervention, as compared to those in the control group, participants in interventional group 
had significant decreases in baseline loneliness scores at 1 months (β = − 3.41, p < 0.001), 3 months (β = − 5.96, 
p < 0.001), and 6 months (β = − 7.50, p < 0.001), and improvements in physical role (β = 36.49, p = 0.01), vitality 
(β = 13.11, p < 0.001) and pain scores (β = 16.71, p = 0.01) at 6 months. However, changes in mean depression 
scores did not significantly differ between groups. 
Conclusions: Smartphone-based videoconferencing effectively improved residents’ feelings of loneliness, and 
physiological health, vitality and pain, but not depressive symptoms. Future investigations might evaluate the 
effectiveness of other media-based technologies in nursing homes as well as their effectiveness within and 
between different age cohorts.

Background 
Placement of older adults in a nursing home (NH) can 
be a stressful life event that produces a higher preva- 
lence of depression [1–3], loneliness, and a reduction in 
quality of life (QoL) [4, 5]. Depression is a leading cause 
of disability worldwide and feelings of loneliness contrib- 
ute significantly to depression, resulting in reductions in 
QoL [6–8]. NH residents often feel isolated, which can 
further increase feelings of loneliness and depression. 
Therefore, developing interventions for NH residents 
that can reduce feelings of loneliness and depression 
could improve their quality of life. 
Providing social support for NH residents is im- 
portant because the quality and quantity of social 
support systems used by older people are closely re- 
lated to both their health status and QoL [5, 9]. One 
important aspect of such emotional support for older 
NH residents is the continuous involvement of their 
family members. This involvement is something espe- 
cially vital in the Chinese culture where families play 
role in maintaining residents’ emotional 
a salient 
well-being. 
However, one-third of NH residents rarely have visi- 
tors [10]; and only about 45–60% of the NH residents’ 
families visit them once a week [11, 12]. A longitu- 
dinal study revealed that there is a tendency for family 
visits to decline slightly over time [13]. Providing 
weekly desktop-based videoconferencing to NH resi- 
dents was shown to effectively reduce depression and 
general feelings of loneliness among Taiwanese NH 
residents [12, 14]. Nevertheless, no research has ex- 
plored the effect of videoconferencing on residents’ 
QoL. Furthermore, the size and weight of desktop- 
based equipment may limit their convenience. Yet, 
with the development of 
technology, smartphones 
have become a particularly attractive modality for de- 
livering health related interventions because of their 
widespread adoption and increasingly powerful tech- 
nical capabilities. Unlike desktop computers or even 
laptops, smartphones are hand-held devices [15]. Such 
a technology can, accordingly, support daily life activ- 
ities, address safety issues, and provide communica- 
tion and entertainment. Compared to desktop devices, 
smartphones may optimize the opportunities for inter- 
actions between NH residents and their families. How- 
ever, the effectiveness of this medium in enhancing 
QoL and emotional status for older adults has not 
been evaluated. Consequently, the lack of empirical 
evidence on videoconferencing for NH residents pro- 
vides ample justification for examining the impact of 
this modality more fully. Therefore, the purpose of 
this study, was to evaluate the effectiveness of a 
smartphone-based videoconference program on NH 
residents’ loneliness, depressive symptoms and QoL. 
Methods 
Design, sample, and setting 
A quasi-experimental design was employed. Participants 
were recruited from seven nursing homes in Taiwan. 
The NH were purposively sampled based on size 
(medium-large, > 65 beds) and located within easy reach 
of the researchers [16]. Each NH was randomly assigned 
to provide participants for either the intervention or 
control group. Assuming a power of .80, alpha value of 
.05, and moderate effect size of t-test (.05), it was esti- 
mated that 26 participants were needed for two groups 
(experimental and control). We then factored in an esti- 
mated 15 to 20% attrition rate, due to mortality. Each 
NH was assigned a number and potential participants 
from each NH were randomly selected until we achieved 
a target of 30 participants in each group [17]. 
Residents were recruited if they: 1) were over 60 years 
of age; 2) had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
score ≥ 16 for residents with no formal education or 
MMSE> 20 for residents with at least a primary school 
education [18, 19]; 3) had no experience in using smart- 
phones for videoconferencing with people prior to this 
research; and 4) both residents and their family mem- 
bers agreed to participate in the study. A total of 32 par- 
ticipants in 5 NHs and 30 participants in 2 NHs were 
recruited for the intervention group and control group, 
respectively. 
Smartphone-based videoconferencing program 
The smartphone-based videoconferencing program was 
designed to be used once a week, which was similar to 
the in-person visiting frequency for the majority of 
families [11, 12]. Yet, residents could videoconference 
with their family as many times as they wished. The goal 
of the duration of each videoconference was set for a 
minimum of 5 min [12, 14]. To achieve this goal, we 
provided some discussion topics to nurses and the par- 
ticipants, such as their meals, organised activities and 
‘news’ on NH life. However, there was no enforcing or 
limitation on the duration. Videoconferencing with their 
family was recommended when participants were having 
meals or during activities to show their lives in the NH 
and to increase vivid interactions among the participants 
and their families. Trained research assistants or nursing 
staff recorded the number and duration of each video- 
conferencing session. 
The mobile application, “LINE”, was the videoconfer- 
encing platform, in which the participant either used this 
technology independently or with the assistance of NH 
staff. This strategy was designed to achieve a real-time 
transmission between the participant and family. The 
intervention smartphone was a high-quality 8-in. HD 
(1280 × 800), chosen in recognition of residents’ physical 
limitations. The two sites (family and nursing home) 


were linked via Wideband Code Division Multiple Ac- 
cess (WCDMA) & Wi-Fi systems to achieve an appro- 
priate video quality, providing a 3G connection (NT850/ 
per month). A portable Android system with full 3G 
phone functionality allowed participants to be connected 
at any time of day. To obtain a better quality in the 
video image, high quality pictures were possible through 
a 2.0 Megapixels (MPs) front-facing camera and 5MP 
rear camera. 
Demographic variables 
Demographic variables included participants’ age, gen- 
der, marital status, number of children, educational 
background, morbidity, duration of residency in the NH, 
and frequency of family visits. The number of family or 
friends who contacted residents and the frequency of 
these communications either by phone or in person dur- 
ing the previous week was also confirmed by asking 
nursing home staff to record the number of visits and 
phone calls made to the residents. Residents’ physical 
status was measured at baseline using the Barthel Index 
[20], which assesses performance of activities of daily 
living (ADLs). Outcome variables included subjective 
feelings of 
loneliness, depressive symptoms and QoL 
which were measured at baseline and repeated at 1, 3 
and 6 months and compared to baseline scores. 
Outcome variables 
The revised 10-item UCLA Loneliness Scale [21] mea- 
sures subjective feelings of loneliness. Items are scored 
with a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (“I often feel this 
way”) to 3 (“I never feel this way”); total scores range 
from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating a greater 
feeling of loneliness. This scale had a reliability of 0.87 
in a study of older institutionalized adults [22]; in this 
study the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.91. 
Depressive symptoms were measured with the 30-item 
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [23]. Each item is 
scored with a yes/no response; possible scores range 
from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating higher de- 
pressive symptoms. Previous studies in Taiwan have 
demonstrated the reliability and validity of the GDS have 
been supported in previous studies in Taiwan [12, 14]. 
In this study the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.91. 

We measured QoL with the Taiwanese version of the 
short-form health survey, SF-36 [24]. The SF-36 is a self- 
report 
that assesses eight dimensions of 
health-related QoL: physical functioning (PF), mobility 
restriction (MR), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), 
vitality (V), social functioning (SF), emotional problems 
(EP) and mental health (MH). Each dimension is scored 
from 0 through to 100, with 100 representing good 
health and 0 representing poor health [25]. In a study of 
older adults with hip fracture the Cronbach’s alpha 
ranged from .59 to .96 [26]. In this study the Cronbach’s 
alpha ranged from 0.72 to 0.93. 
Procedure 
Ethical consideration of the research was approved by 
the researchers’ 
Institutional Review Board. NHs in 
Taiwan do not have institutional review boards, there- 
fore, we also obtained permission to conduct this study 
from the directors at each site prior to data collection. 
After this permission was granted, an announcement 
was posted at the NH entrance with details of our re- 
search purpose and procedure. We first asked NH staff 
to speak with residents who met our criteria and with 
their family members about their willingness to partici- 
pate in the study. Residents and their families who were 
interested in taking part were contacted by research as- 
sistants who explained the goals and methods of the 
study. In addition, the potential risks, the entitlement of 
all participants to withdraw from the study at any time, 
the right to refuse to answer questions and the strategies 
used to protect anonymity and confidentiality were fully 
explained. After signing an informed consent document, 
we demonstrated how to use the smartphone and initi- 
ate videoconferencing to the residents and their family 
members in the interventional group. The residents and 
family members then made an appointment to use vid- 
eoconferencing. Family members of residents in the 
intervention group could continue their in-person visits 
or telephone contacts as usual. Smartphones were avail- 
able in the NHs for 6 months. Participants were able to 
use the smartphone in their own room or, at whichever 
location in the NH it was most convenient. The device 
could be used independently by the resident or with the 
assistance of the NH staff. 
Data analysis 
All data were coded before being entered into a com- 
puter. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
24.0. Participants’ demographic data were analysed using 
descriptive statistics. Differences between the two groups 
were compared at four points (baseline, 1 month, 3 
months and 6 months) using multiple linear regression 
of the generalized estimating equations (GEE) [27]. To 
examine the effect of the videoconferencing intervention 
on each variable, we constructed regression models 
which tested only one fixed effect. 
Results 
Participants 
Sixty-two NH residents participated in this study. Demo- 
graphic and clinical characteristics of the intervention 
and control group at baseline are shown in Table 1. The 
intervention group was significantly older than the con- 
trol group (p < .001). The presence of hypertension and

diabetes was significantly higher for the control group 
(p = .01 and p < .05, respectively). 
The number of weekly phone calls and weekly in- 
person visits from family members was significantly 
greater (p < .05) in the intervention group than the con- 
trol group. 
During the 6-month study period, 12 participants in the 
intervention group withdrew from the study (3 declined to 
continue participating, 7 were discharged home, and 2 
died), for an attrition rate of 37.5%. In the control group, 
10 participants dropped out of the study (3 declined to 
continue participating, 4 were discharged home, and 3 
died), for an attrition rate of 33.3%. There was no signifi- 
cant difference between participants who dropped out of 
the study and those who remained in age (t = 0.11, p = 
0.74) or length of residency in the NH (t = 1.58, p = 0.21). 


Trajectory of videoconferencing intervention 
During the 6 months of the study, the mean number of 
videoconferencing interactions in the first, third, and 
sixth months was 2.13 (SD = 2.52, range 0–12), 1.18 
(SD = 1.34, range 0–15), and 1.62 (SD = 1.68, range 0– 
15), respectively. The mean number of videoconferenc- 
ing interactions from the first to the sixth month did not 
significantly (F = 0.38, p = 0.68). Although the 
differ 
mean duration for videoconferencing interactions in- 
creased from the first month (270.48 s, range 0–1221 s) 
to the sixth month (367.31 s, range 0–1194 s), the in- 
crease was not statistically significant (F = 2.69, p = 0.07). 
Outcomes 
Scores for outcome variables at baseline for both groups 
are shown in Table 2. The mean scores for feelings of 
loneliness were significantly different between groups 
(t = 0.87, p = 0.03). There was no significant difference 
between groups in mean scores for depressive symptoms 
(t = − 0.24, p = 0.81). Quality of life subscale scores were 
for emotional-role for both the control and 
highest 
intervention group (M = 84.44, SD = 29.99 and M = 
81.25, SD = 32.72, respectively). The lowest scores were 
in physical functioning (M = 12.83, SD = 18.79 for the 
control group; M = 15.16, SD = 18.16 for the intervention 
group). The mean scores for physical-role (t = − 2.27, 
p = 0.03), pain (t = − 2.62, p = 0.01), and vitality (t = − 
2.11, p = 0.04) were 
significantly different between 
groups. 
The effect of the videoconferencing intervention on 
scores for feelings of loneliness and depressive symp- 
toms is shown in Table 3. Mean scores for feelings of 
loneliness for the intervention group at 1-, 3- and 6- 
months decreased, on average, − 3.41 (95% CI − 1.78 to 
− 4.90), − 5.96 (95% CI − 3.14 to − 8.77), and − 7.50 (95% 
CI − 3.90 to − 11.10) units, respectively. Controlling for 
in-person family 
the effects of age and frequency of 
visits, these changes were significantly lower for the 
intervention group compared to the control group (all 
p-values < .001), demonstrating that feelings of loneli- 
ness decreased significantly at all three timepoints. How- 
ever, there was no significant decrease from baseline in 
mean scores for depressive symptoms at any time point, 
and there were no significant differences between 
groups. 
The effect of the videoconferencing intervention on 
quality of life subscale scores is shown in Table 3. Com- 
pared to the control group, mean scores for social func- 
tion from baseline were significantly higher at 3-months 
(β = 10.89, p = .03, 95% CI 1.25 to 20.52) and 6-months 
(β = 21.79, p < .001, 95% CI 9.35 to 34.23); perceived 
health scores were also significantly higher at 3-months 
(β = 7.89, p = 0.01, 95% CI 2.22 to 13.56) and 6-months 
(β = 6.67, p = .02, 95% CI 0.94 to 12.41). Compared to 
controls, scores at 6-months for the intervention group 
were significantly higher than baseline for physical-role, 
vitality, and pain scores (β = 36.49, p = .01, 95% CI 10.84 
to 62.14; β = 13.11, p < .001, 95% CI 5.81 to 20.40; and 
β = 16.71, p = .01, 95% CI 4.67 to 28.75, respectively). 
Mean subscale scores were also significantly higher than 
baseline for the intervention group for mental health at 
3-months; scores increased, on average, 7.46 units (95% 
CI 2.49 to13.35) more than the control group (p = .004). 
Moreover, after controlling for age and frequency of in- 
person visits, scores for physical-role, vitality, and pain 
at 6-months, and social function and perceived health at 
3- and 6-months differed significantly from baseline 
scores for the intervention group compared to the con- 
trol group. 
Discussion 
This study demonstrated that a smartphone-based vid- 
eoconferencing intervention reduced feelings of loneli- 
ness in older NH residents at 1, 3 and 6 months. These 
results are similar to other studies showing that increas- 
ing the personal interactions of NH residents through 
the use of computer-based applications can significantly 
reduce feelings of loneliness [12, 14, 28]. 
There were some significant differences in baseline 
scores between the intervention and control group, 
which must be considered. The intervention group was 
significantly older than the control group. We have no 
data to explain this difference and can only speculate. 
One explanation for the age difference may be a result 
of the requirement that the NH residents’ adult children 
participate in the videoconferencing. The adult children 
willing to participate in videoconferencing may have had 
time because they were older, resulting in older NH resi- 
dents in the intervention group. In addition to the age 
differences, baseline scores for feelings of loneliness were 
significantly higher in the intervention than control 
group. However, a recent study reported that although 
advanced age is associated with increased loneliness 
[29], age is only one of many contributing factors. A 
study reported older adults born in the 1920s had higher 
levels of loneliness than those born in the 1940s [30]. 
However, after controlling for age and frequency of in- 
person visits, the decrease in scores for feelings of loneli- 
ness from baseline to 6 months was significantly greater 
than the control group. Therefore, we believe the reduc- 
tion in scores for feelings of loneliness is due to the vid- 
eoconferencing intervention. 
Our findings showed the videoconferencing intervention 
did not improve depressive symptoms of the NH residents 
at any timepoint. This result differs from previous reports, 
which demonstrated use of the Internet for communica- 
tion with friends and family was associated with decreases 
in depression among NH residents [12, 14, 31]. These

differences may be due differences in characteristics of the 
NH residents who participated. While two of the previous 
studies were conducted with NH residents [12, 14] the 
third study examined a large general population whose 
median age was 44 years [31]. Functional decline is an im- 
portant predictor of depression [32], therefore, further 
studies are suggested to understand the effects of video- 
conferencing on different age cohorts. Characteristics of 
social networks, social support, negative interactions with 
a partner or close friend, and feelings of loneliness are re- 
ported to be predictors of depressive symptoms [33]. 
Therefore, there might be differences in social and clinical 
characteristics of our participants and those of the previ- 
ous three studies. 
Differences in the format of communicating via the 
Internet also might explain the differences in our find- 
ings from previous studies. Two studies [12, 14] con- 
ducted videoconferencing via computers or tablets and 
the third study [31] examined on-line communication. 
The screen of the smartphone in our study was smaller 
(8 in.) than desk-based computers (15.6 in.), our inter- 
vention was free to use, and the previous studies exam- 
ined 3 months of weekly technology use. This is the first 
study to examine the effects of smartphone-based video- 
conferencing, 
therefore further study is suggested to 
understand the relationship of smartphone videoconfer- 
encing and depressive symptoms for older NH residents. 
A novel feature of this study was to better understand 
the effects of videoconferencing on QoL. With the ex- 
ception of a lower mean score for physical function, 
baseline subscale scores of the SF-36 in both the inter- 
vention and control groups is comparable to findings 
elsewhere [34, 35]. The lower scores for physical func- 
tion compared to other studies might be explained by 
cultural differences in the reasons family members are 
placed in residential NHs Taiwanese society, which is 
often poor health [36]. 
The study found that videoconferencing positive effects 
on QoL indictors for pain, vitality and physiological health 
dimensions at 6-months, but not on physical function. 
Pain among older adults in NHs is common [37]. Partici- 
pants may benefit from more support through videocon- 
ferencing and contact with their families because it is 
known that social interaction enhances pain management 
and is associated with pain reduction [37]. It may, thus, be 
important to include the use of videoconferencing tech- 
nology as possible options during patient education and 
the development of care plans for pain management. 
However, information and communication technologies 
can indeed be valuable tools enabling better 
self- 
management and self-empowerment of pain [38]. 

Our research also revealed videoconferencing had 
positive effects on vitality at the 6-month timepoint. It 
has been suggested that allowing older NH residents to 
use communication and information technology im- 
they 
proves their overall outlook; 
“feel young” or “become one of the modern gener- 
ation” [39]. Due to the limitation of the sample size 
of this study, it is only possible to speculate whether 
technology of this kind influences vitality because par- 
ticipants feel more youthful. Future qualitative studies 
may be needed to better understand this relationship 
between using videoconferencing technology and the 
vitality of our participants.

The study revealed that the frequency of videoconfer- 
encing per month ranged from 1.18 to 2.13 times, which 
was lower than anticipated. The frequency, however, is 
comparable to previous computer-based videoconferenc- 
ing research, which ranged from 1.22 to 1.46 times per 
month after the intervention period [14]. Such infre- 
quent use indicates that as useful and convenient as 
videoconferencing may be, it cannot replace in-person 
visiting; and videoconferencing visiting can only be 
regarded as a “second-best option” to an in-person 
visit [34]. 
The participants in the intervention group had more 
children, which could explain the greater frequency of 
in-person visits and telephone calls compared to the 
control group. Thus, it is possible that family members 
of participants in the intervention group may have com- 
municated by videoconferencing as an alternative to in- 
person visits and phone calls. Future videoconferencing 
interventions should assess frequency of weekly in- 
person visits to determine if there is a shift in the com- 
munication modality. We did not determine if adequate 
staff were available to help NH residents needing assist- 
ance with the 
smartphone-based videoconferencing 
equipment, which may have limited videoconferencing 
to participants who were more independent. 
Our total attrition rate at the 6-month timepoint of 
37.5% in the intervention group and 33.3% in the control 
group was higher than the 6-month attrition reported by 
two previous studies of older NH residents in Taiwan 
[14, 40]. Although the attrition rate in our study was 
high, an attrition rate of less than 40% is considered 
weak, based on the Effective Public Health Practice 
Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool [41]. Therefore, 
we consider the attrition rate of this study acceptable. 
The higher attrition in the intervention group was pri- 
marily due to patients being discharged prior to com- 
pleting the study, rather than dropping out; 7 out of 12 
in the intervention group compared with 4 out of 10 in 
the control group. Whether videoconferencing contrib- 
utes to discharge is something worthy of further study. 
This study had some limitations. First, parent-child re- 
lationships and interactions in Asian cultures differ from 
Western cultures. This relational difference may limit 
the generalizability of the study results to Western coun- 
tries. Second, we did not recruit cognitively impaired 
NH residents in our study. Whether smartphone video- 
conferencing can effectively increase QoL among older 
cognitively impaired residents has not been explored. 
Future studies should examine the use of this communi- 
cation technology among older NH residents with cogni- 
tive impairments. Third, we did not distinguish between 
social and emotional loneliness. The UCLA Loneliness 
Scale measures subjective feelings of loneliness as a sin- 
gle global score. Future studies should be conducted

generalizability of our findings. Additional studies with a 
larger population is recommended. 
The findings of our study demonstrate the effective- 
ness of a smartphone-based videoconferencing interven- 
tion on reducing feelings of loneliness and improving 
QoL for older NH residents. We suggest future research 
be conducted to better understand how Internet tech- 
nology can improve the emotional health and QoL for 
older NH residents. Studies should include examining 
the effect of videoconferencing using different combina- 
tions of media-based technologies and program designs; 
variables should include not only loneliness and depres- 
sive symptoms, but also stratification of age, number of 
children and/or family members, and cognitive status. 
Qualitative studies could add additional information re- 
garding the response of NH residents to such interven- 
tions. Finally, cultural differences should be explored to 
determine if interventions should be tailored to match 
the cultural setting of the NH residents. Such explorative 
studies could provide important considerations for the 
development of interventions to enhance health of the 
older population within the NH setting. 
Conclusions 
This study demonstrated that a smartphone-based vid- 
eoconferencing intervention reduced feelings of loneli- 
ness at 1-, 3-, and 6-months and improved variables of 
QoL. The findings suggest smartphone-based videocon- 
ferencing is a feasible option for enhancing the care of 
older NH residents by improving communication with 
their family members. Nursing home managers and care 
staff could incorporate videoconferencing technology as 
a standard part of NH resident care. Videoconferencing 
could be an important intervention for patients who are 
at risk for loneliness or have symptoms associated with a 
poor QoL. Such changes in the care of NH residents 
may be especially important for healthcare professionals 
working with populations of East Asian nationality or 
descent.
