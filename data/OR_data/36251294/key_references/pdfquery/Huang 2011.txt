Abstract 
Aim. To examine the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural strategies with/without 
intense Tai Chi exercise in reducing fear of falling among community-dwelling 
elderly adults. 
Background. Fear of falling is a major health problem among community-dwelling 
older persons. The prevalence of this fear ranges from 29% to 77%, indicating the 
importance of developing effective strategies to reduce fear of falling among elderly 
adults. 
Methods. Data were collected from January to December 2007. A randomized 
controlled trial with three groups (control, cognitive-behavioural and cognitive- 
behavioural with Tai Chi). Participants were assessed at baseline for demographic 
data, falls-related history, and fear of falling. Data on these variables plus falls, 
mobility, social support behaviour and satisfaction, and quality of life were also 
collected at 2 and 5 months after interventions. 
Results. Participants in the three groups differed signiﬁcantly in both measures of 
falling (F = 20Æ89, P < 0Æ001; F = 6Æ09, P < 0Æ001) and mobility 
fear of 
(F = 30Æ33, P < 0Æ001), social support behaviour and satisfaction (F = 3Æ32, 
P < 0Æ05 and F = 6Æ35, P < 0Æ001, respectively), and quality of life (F = 16Æ66, 
P < 0Æ001). 
In addition, participants who received the cognitive-behavioural 
intervention with Tai Chi had signiﬁcantly lower fear of falling scores (P < 0Æ001) 
and higher mobility (P < 0Æ001), social support satisfaction (P < 0Æ01) and quality 
of life (P < 0Æ001) than the cognitive-behavioural alone and control groups at 
5 months. The three groups did not differ signiﬁcantly in falls. 
Conclusion. The results of this trial suggest that the cognitive-behavioural inter- 
vention with Tai Chi exercise helped community-dwelling elderly adults to enhance 
their mobility, to manage their fear of falling and to increase their quality of life.

Fear of falling (FOF) is a major health problem among 
community-dwelling older persons both in older persons who 
have experienced a fall and those who have not (Scheffer et al. 
2008). The wide range of prevalence estimates for fear of 
falling (25–77%) may be due to differences between samples in 
age, gender, functional status, history of falls, measures of fear 
and other comorbidities (Howland et al. 1998, Friedman et al. 
2002, Suzuki et al. 2002). In many respects, FOF is a 
reasonable response to a probable and potentially risky event 
and could be regarded as the ﬁrst step for preventing falls. 
While some level of FOF is reasonable and can promote 
effective coping skills for preventing falls, too much fear may 
compromise physical and mental well-being (Huang 2005). 
The effectiveness of interventions to decrease FOF in older 
persons was examined in a meta-analysis of six studies (Jung 
et al. 2009). The results showed that FOF was signiﬁcantly 
decreased in interventions with the following designs: (1) 
combination of exercise and education, (2) effects measured 
after 4 months, and (3) setting is community or home based. 
The ﬁrst design had a mean weighted-effect size (MWES) 
= 0Æ249 (P < 0Æ05) because FOF is impacted not only by 
physical conditions but also by psychological and cognitive 
the combination intervention is more 
issues; Therefore, 
effective than either exercise or education programme alone. 
The second design had a MWES = 0Æ240 (P < 0Æ05) because 
interventions for FOF need some time to obtain their effects. 
The third design had a MWES = 0Æ228 (P < 0Æ05) 
for 
community-based and MWES = 0Æ418 (P < 0Æ05) for home- 
based (rather than facility-based) settings because older 
residents of facilities may be frailer than those living in the 
community. However, the effect of interventions was found to 
be small (MWES = 0Æ21), and Jung et al. (2009) suggested 
that FOF treatment interventions should involve cognitive 
reconstructing and behavioural changes to reduce fear of 
falling among the elders. No study was found that combined 
cognitive-behavioural strategies and an exercise programme 
for reducing FOF among community-dwelling elders. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown in 
many randomized controlled trials to be an effective treat- 
ment for depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder, for 
recommended in evidence-based clinical 
which CBT is 
(Haby et al. 
practice guidelines as a ﬁrst-line treatment 
2006, Kushner et al. 2009, Stanley et al. 2009, Allen et al. 
2010). CBT is an intervention modality for changing 
dysfunctional cognitive schemas and faulty thinking tied to 
FOF experiences (Haby et al. 2006). It is based on the 
premise that sensory precepts, feelings and actions inﬂuence 
the ways in which FOF is interpreted by the self and the rest 

of 
intervention is to attenuate 
symptoms tied to automatic thoughts and emotions about 
FOF. Counsellors arrange for speciﬁc learning experiences to 
help those affected by FOF identify, evaluate and alter 
automatic thoughts and emotions. Enduring improvement 
from FOF thus results from modiﬁcation of faulty thinking 
and faulty beliefs tied to the faulty behaviour (Tennstedt 
et al. 1998, Gitlin et al. 2006). Older adults need to feel 
comfortable discussing their fears and learning to ask for 
assistance in fearful situations (Legters 2002, Brouwer et al. 
2003), thus creating opportunities to devise and carry out fall 
and FOF prevention strategies. Physical ﬁtness programmes 
increase elders’ level of activity and reduce general physical 
dysfunction (Li et al. 2008, Logghe et al. 2009). Tai Chi is 
highly suitable for elderly people with limitations in balance 
and mobility because it consists of a series of slow, rhythmic 
movements that emphasize trunk rotation, weight shifting, 
coordination and a gradual narrowing of lower extremity 
stance. In addition to reducing risk of falls and FOF, and 
improving balance, Tai Chi has beneﬁts in physical and 
psychological functioning (Sattin et al. 2005, Li et al. 2008, 
Logghe et al. 2009). In fact, Tai Chi was found to reduce 
FOF signiﬁcantly more than other exercise programmes for 
older adults (Sattin et al. 2005). Similarly, more than 94% of 
the elders who participated in a 12-week Tai Chi intervention 
improved their functional status and conﬁdence (Li et al. 
2008). Also, 100% of participants agreed that the Tai Chi 
movements were appropriate and safe to perform, and they 
intended to continue doing the activity and to recommend it 
to others (Li et al. 2008). 

Therefore, the FOF interventions implemented in this study 
used two major strategies: Tai-Chi exercise and cognitive- 
behavioural (CB) intervention. Tai Chi focused on improving 
lower 
strength and balance. The 
CB intervention concentrated on improving awareness of 
environmental hazards and medically related risk factors, 
changing faulty thinking tied to FOF experiences, and selecting 
useful management strategies and resources and improving 
conﬁdence. 


The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of 
three interventions (control, CB alone and CB with Tai Chi) 
on primary outcomes (fear of falling and falls), and secondary 
outcomes [mobility (gait and balance), social support and 
quality of life] of community-dwelling elderly adults over 
5 months. 






This prospective, randomized control trial was conducted in 
a rural area of northeastern Taiwan between January and 
December 2007. 

In view of general health promotion and primary prevention, 
we targeted on community-dwelling elderly adults. The 
sample size was determined based on outcomes of a previous 
intervention study on FOF in frail elders (Zhang et al. 2006). 
The mean score of the Fall Efﬁcacy Scale (FES) (Tinetti et al. 
1990) at pretest was 76Æ2 (SDSD = 5Æ2) and at post-test was 78Æ3 
(SDSD = 4Æ0). To detect a between-group difference in FES 
scores at 80% power, a = 0Æ05, and two-tailed test. Using the 
2 ([(4Æ0) (1Æ96+0Æ85)/ 
model of N = [(r) (Z1-a/2+Z1-b)/(l(cid:2)l0)] 
(78Æ3(cid:2)76Æ2)]2 = 28) (Pagano & Gauvreau 2000), 28 patients 
were needed in each group. After making allowance for 
participants to drop out by 5 months, a larger sample was 
needed. 
Thus, the sample included 186 community-dwelling adults, 
aged 60 and older. Participants were randomized to each of 
three groups: cognitive-behavioural intervention, CB with Tai 
Chi intervention, and the control group. Participants were 
recruited from a randomly selected sample of 660 residents, 
age ‡60 years, 
living in registered households of a rural 
community in Yi-Lan county, northeastern Taiwan by 
mailing an invitation and following up with a phone call. 
Potential participants were screened over the telephone by 
registered nurses. Inclusion criteria for participation were (1) 
‡60 years old, mentally intact [Short Portable Mental Status 
Questionnaire (SPMSQ) score >6 for illiterate individuals, 
>7 for those with 6 years of education, >8 for those with 
>6 years of education] (Pfeiffer 1975) reside in the commu- 
nity, and able to communicate in Mandarin or Taiwanese. 
Participants were excluded if they had an artiﬁcial leg or leg 
brace, had unstable health problems or were terminally ill. 
Of the 660 invited to participate, 43Æ79% (n = 289) did not 
respond, 2Æ88% (n = 19) were ineligible (nine for having not 
being cognitively intact, and ten for not residing in the 
community every day), 16Æ21% (n = 107) refused partici- 
pation, and 9Æ94% (n = 59) had died or moved. The 
non-participants (n = 474) and participants (n = 186) were 
similar in age and gender (P > 0Æ05). A research assistant 
(RA) obtained written informed consent for each participant. 
Of 186 elderly adults recruited for this trial, 14 withdrew 
the ﬁnal sample 
during the 5-month study. Therefore, 
consisted of 176 participants (Figure 1). The dropouts and 
non-dropouts were similar in baseline data (Table 1). 
The ﬁrst author used a computer-developed random table to 
randomly assign patients 
to three intervention groups: 
control, CB alone or CB with Tai Chi. Allocation was 
concealed from the recruiting RA. The RA collecting data, 
and the second author assessing and analysing outcomes were 
blind to group assignment. 

At baseline, all three groups received a brochure explaining 
how to prevent fall incidents. 
Control group 
The control group received no extra care; they could use or 
apply for available services in the area as before participation 
in the study. 
CB group 
The CB group received an intervention adapted from previ- 
ous studies (Tennstedt et al. 1998, Zijlstra et al. 2005) and 
the FOF management model developed by the ﬁrst author 
(Huang 2005). The CB interventions developed by Tennstedt 
et al. (1998) and Zijlstra et al. (2005) include an introduc- 
tion, older adults’ point of view of FOF, positive and negative 
aspects concerning the topic, associations with falls or fear of 
falling, and implementation in the older adult’s daily life. 
The FOF management model (Huang 2005) describes and 
explains how community-dwelling elders think, feel and act 
when confronting FOF. FOF occurs in the context of believing 
that 
falling is an inevitable part of aging. With these 
misconceptions in mind, elders with FOF might pose a social 
problem because they curtail their activities rather than 
focusing on strategies to manage their FOF. The FOF model 
suggests that community-dwelling elders manage FOF by 
strategies: developing psychosomatic symptoms, 
various 
adopting an attitude of risk prevention, paying attention to 
environmental safety, and modifying behaviour. Finally, the 
FOF model found that outcomes were inﬂuenced by three 
interacting conditions: the management strategies used, satis- 
faction with strategies used, and the degree to which strategies 
used were supported by resources. Elders who use more 
negative strategies, have less satisfaction with their managing 
strategies and minimal support from their family/signiﬁcant 
others, are more likely to suffer from FOF (Huang 2005). 
The CB intervention consisted of 8-weekly sessions, lasting 
60–90 minutes, and in groups of 8–12 participants. The main 
strategy was restructuring misconceptions to promote a view 
of fall risk and fear of falling as controllable. Each session

covered the following topics: (1) introduction; (2) associa- 
tions with falls or fear of falling; (3) participant’s point of 
view of FOF (positive and negative aspects about the topic); 
(5) 
(4) strategies to manage FOF and family support; 
implementation in the participants’ daily life; and (6) 
problem-solving (during a fall learning how to fall, stand 
up and call for help). Participants in this study needed to 
complete all eight sessions of the CB intervention. Each 
session was conducted by a trained facilitator, who was a 
nurse qualiﬁed in geriatrics and community health nursing. 
CB with Tai Chi group 
Participants of this combination-intervention group received 
the same cognitive-behavioural strategies as those in the CB 
group in addition to Tai Chi exercise training. Two profes- 
sional Tai Chi instructors, who were experienced in working 
with older persons, gave the lessons using a predeﬁned pro- 
tocol. The core of the lessons consisted of ten positions derived 
from the Yang style. Participants in groups of 10–16 had 
lessons ﬁve times a week, for 8 weeks. Each session of Tai Chi 
began with warm-up exercises (10 minutes), and was followed 
by teaching and practicing individual forms of the Tai Chi 
programme (45 minutes), and ended with cool-down exercises 
(5 minutes). Participants in the CB with Tai Chi intervention 
needed to complete the Tai Chi at least three times a week for 
8 weeks, and the CB intervention all eight sessions. 

Data were collected from January to December 2007. 
Participants in all three groups were assessed in their homes 
for outcomes 
(see below) at baseline, 2 months, and 
5 months by an RA blinded to their group allocation. Data 
were also collected at baseline on participants’ age, gender, 
education, marital status, living status, enduring diseases, 
falls-related history and admitted FOF. 
Outcomes 
Primary outcomes: FOF and falls. Fear of 
falling was 
measured by the Geriatric Fear of Falling Measure (GFFM, 
Huang 2006) and FES (Tinetti et al. 1990). The 15-item 
GFFM assesses participants’ fear of falling in three domains: 
psychosomatic symptoms (four items), adopting an attitude 
of risk prevention (ﬁve items), and modifying behaviours

(six items). Sample items for the three domains include ‘I 
don’t sleep well because I worry about falling’, ‘I will sit on a 
chair when bathing or hold onto a support’, and ‘I go out less 
on rainy days’, respectively. Responses to items are indicated 
on a Likert-type scale from 1 (not at all concerned) to 5 (very 
concerned), with higher scores indicating greater concern. 
The total score is calculated by adding all the item responses 
(Huang 2006). GFFM scores are more strongly associated 
with physical and psychosocial functioning than FES and 
Activities-Speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence Scale (ABC, Powell & 
Myers 1995) scores, suggesting that it is more appropriate for 
studies on improving all aspects of fear of falling in commu- 
nity-dwelling elders (Huang & Wang 2009). Cronbach’s 
alpha for the GFFM in this study was 88. 
The FES (Tinetti et al. 1990) has been the tool most used in 
the literature to measure fear of falling. Respondents rate their 
conﬁdence in conducting ten non-hazardous activities of daily 
living that require transferring, bending, reaching, or walking 
(Tinetti et al. 1990). Responses range from 1 to 10, with 
higher scores indicating greater conﬁdence in maintaining 
daily living activities. The total score is calculated by adding all 
the item responses. The Chinese version of the FES had a 
2-week, test–retest reliability of 0Æ90 (Huang & Acton 2004). 
Cronbach’s alpha of the Chinese FES in this study was 0Æ98. 
Number of falls was recorded using the Falls Record 
Checklist (Huang & Acton 2004), which has a calendar for 
participants to circle dates when a fall occurred. 
Secondary outcomes: mobility, social support and quality of 
life. Mobility (gait and balance) was assessed using the 
Tinetti Mobility Scale (Tinetti et al. 1986). This scale is 
simple, requires no equipment and is quick and convenient to 
use. Each participant 
took approximately 5 minutes to 
perform the whole series of activities on the scale. The better 
is a participant’s performance, the higher is the score. The 
maximum scores for gait and balance are 12 and 16, 
respectively. Balance and gait scores are summed to give an 
overall mobility score. Low mobility scores (<14) have been 
associated with recurrent falling (Tinetti et al. 1986). Gait 
scores <9 and balance scores <10 were also independent 
predictors for recurrent falls. Interrater reliability for assess- 
ing differences in balance and gait scores of ten participants 
was <10% in all cases (Tinetti et al. 1986). Cronbach’s 
alpha of the Tinetti Mobility Scale in this study was 0Æ89. 



Social support behaviours and satisfaction were measured 
using the Chinese version (Huang & Lin 2004) of the 
Inventory of Social Supportive Behaviors (ISSB) (Barrera 
et al. 1981). The 13-item ISSB includes two subscales: 
behaviour and satisfaction. Responses on the behaviour 
subscale range from 1 (never) to 3 (always); responses on 
the satisfaction subscale range from 1 (very unsatisﬁed) to 4 
(very satisﬁed). A higher score indicates better behaviour and 
satisfaction. Cronbach’s alpha of the ISSB in this study was 
0Æ86. 
Quality of life (QOL) was measured by the Taiwanese 
version of the World Health Organisation’s WHOQOL- 
BREF, a widely used, self-administered, reliable and valid 
generic indicator of physical, psychological, social and 
environmental relationships (Yao et al. 2002). This 28-item 
scale has four subscales (physical health, psychological, social 
relationship and environment) that measure different health 
concepts. Responses to items range from 1 to 5. The total 
score is calculated by averaging all the item responses, with 
higher scores indicating better quality of life. Cronbach’s 
alpha of the WHOQOL-BREF in this study was 0Æ88. 
baseline, 2 and 5 months after interventions. Changes in 
outcome variables at various follow-up times were predicted 
using a mixed model approach with an intent-to-treat 
approach whereby 
randomized participants were 
included, and a mixed model was used to account for missing 
follow-up data. Internal consistency was examined by Cron- 
bach’s alpha. 



Regardless of 186 participants at baseline or 176 participants 
who completed this trial, the majority of participants were 
65 years or older, female, with ‡6 years education, married 
and half were living with their family (Table 1). More than 
half of them had at least one enduring disease, with little 
history of falls during the past year and some admitted fear of 
falling (Table 1). These groups were well-balanced for 
baseline demographic characteristics and falls-related history 
(Table 1), and for falling (Table 2), fear of falling, mobility 
(gait and balance), social support and quality of life (Table 3). 

Approval for this trial was obtained from the Institutional 
Review Board of the authors’ university. Each participant 
was assured of conﬁdentiality and the option to decline 
participation or withdraw from the trial at any time. 

Elderly adults in the CB with Tai Chi group had signiﬁcantly 
better outcomes at 5 months than the control group for all 
indicators, except for the average rate of falls. 

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
SPSS 15.0 (SPSS 
considered 
IL, USA). Signiﬁcance was 
Inc., Chicago, 
P < 0Æ05. Analysis of variance and chi-square statistics were 
used to test for differences among the three groups at 
Primary outcomes: fear of falling 
GFFM scores. 
In terms of fear of falling, the average GFFM 
scores for the CB and CB with Tai Chi groups decreased from 
35Æ66 (SDSD = 11Æ60) and 35Æ82 (SDSD = 9Æ77) at baseline to 32Æ33 
(SDSD = 11Æ14) and 30Æ30 (SDSD = 7Æ55), respectively 5 months 
later, whereas scores for elderly adults in the control group

F-test for all three groups: *P < 0Æ05; **P < 0Æ01; ***P < 0Æ001. 
(cid:2)Comparison group, (cid:3)Cognitive behavioural (CB) group, §CB + Tai Chi group. 
over the same period rose from 38Æ39 (SDSD = 12Æ06) to 42Æ00 
(SDSD = 13Æ21) (Table 3). Differences among the three groups 
were shown by mixed-model analysis to be signiﬁcant 
(interaction effect, F = 20Æ89, P < 0Æ001). These results 
indicate that the decreased FOF of elderly adults in the two 
experiment groups was signiﬁcantly higher at 5 months than 
that of the control group (F = 19Æ18, P < 0Æ001) (Table 3). 
whereas scores for elders in the control group descended from 
90Æ39 (SDSD = 16Æ83) to 88Æ40 (SDSD = 18Æ71). FES among the 
three groups was shown by mixed-model analysis to be 
F = 6Æ09, 
signiﬁcantly 
P < 0Æ001). The mean FES score of the CB with Tai Chi 
group was signiﬁcantly higher than those of the CB and 
the 5-month follow-up (F = 9Æ10, 
control groups at 
P < 0Æ001) (Table 3). 



FES scores. Mean total FES scores for elderly adults in the 
CB and CB with Tai Chi groups rose from 88Æ81 (SDSD = 17Æ40) 
and 94Æ26 (SDSD = 16Æ71) at baseline to 90Æ88 (SDSD = 15Æ72) and 
99Æ14 (SDSD = 11Æ66), respectively, at the 5-month follow-up, 
Primary outcomes: falls 
The average numbers of falls (comparing 3-month periods 
before and after intervention) were shown by ANOVA

among the three groups was not signiﬁcantly different during 
(v2 = 2Æ52, 
the 3-month period after 
P > 0Æ05). 


Secondary outcomes: mobility 
Mobility among the three groups changed signiﬁcantly over 
time (Table 3) as demonstrated by mixed-model analysis 
(interaction effect, F = 30Æ33, P < 0Æ001). The mean mobil- 
ity score of the CB with Tai Chi group was higher than that of 
the CB and control groups (P < 0Æ001) at the 5-month fol- 
low-up (Table 3). The gait scores among the three groups 
changed signiﬁcantly over time as demonstrated by mixed- 
model analysis (interaction effect, F = 35Æ08, P < 0Æ001). 
The mean gait score of the CB with Tai Chi group was sig- 
niﬁcantly higher than that of the CB and control groups 
(P < 0Æ001) at the 5-month follow-up (Table 3). Balance 
among the three groups also changed signiﬁcantly over time 
as demonstrated by mixed-model analysis (interaction effect, 
F = 25Æ22, P < 0Æ001). The mean balance score of the CB 
with Tai Chi group was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the 
CB and control groups (P < 0Æ001) at the 5-month follow-up 
(Table 3). 

Secondary outcomes: social supports 
The three groups were shown by mixed-model analysis to 
be signiﬁcantly different 
support behaviour 
for 
(interaction effect, F = 3Æ32, P < 0Æ05) and social support 
satisfaction (interaction effect, F = 6Æ35, P < 0Æ001) (F = 
6Æ67, P < 0Æ001). Elders who received the CB with Tai Chi 
intervention reported signiﬁcantly higher social support 
satisfaction scores than the CB and control groups (F = 7Æ43, 
P < 0Æ01) at the 5-month follow-up (Table 3). 
Secondary outcomes: quality of life 
Changes over time in total QOL and its subscales (physical 
health, mental health, social relationships and environment) 
for the three groups were signiﬁcantly different at 
the 
5-month follow-up as shown by mixed-model analysis 
(interaction effect, F = 16Æ66, P < 0Æ001; 
subscales F = 
17Æ14, 13Æ21, 3Æ39 and 8Æ80, P < 0Æ001 or 0Æ05, respectively) 
(Table 3). The mean scores for total QOL and the four 
subscales were signiﬁcantly higher at the 5-month follow-up 
for the CB with Tai Chi group than those of the CB and 
control groups (P < 0Æ01 or 0Æ001) (Table 3). 


This trial had several limitations. First, participants were 
recruited from only one community. The results from a multi- 
site trial would be more generalizable. Second, participants 
were followed up over a relatively short period. A longer 
follow-up period would better estimate effects of intervention 
on long-term management of FOF. Third, participants were 
randomly allocated into three different groups, and a Tai Chi 
only group was not included. Finally, it is unclear how much 
time and costs were incurred by these two 
additional 
individualized experimental approaches. A cost-effectiveness 
study may be needed. 

This study is the ﬁrst trial using a combined cognitive- 
behavioural strategy and Tai Chi intervention to reduce FOF 
among community-dwelling elders. This trial demonstrated 
that when community-dwelling elderly adults received CB 
with Tai Chi exercise, they had less fear of falling, better falls 
efﬁcacy, better mobility (gait and balance), better social 
support and better quality of life than elders in the control 
group. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the results of a meta-analysis 
(Jung et al. 2009), which found that fear of falling was 
signiﬁcantly decreased by interventions that combined exer- 
cise and education, measured intervention effects after 
4 months and were community-based. Moreover, they found 
that intervention effects were small, and suggested that 
interventions to reduce FOF among the elders should involve 
cognitive reconstructing and behavioural changes (Jung et al. 
2009). 
Our interventions adapted cognitive-behavioural strategies 
from previous studies (Tennstedt et al. 1998, Zijlstra et al. 
2005), and a FOF management model (Huang 2005). The 
merit of our trial is that it involved two forms of intervention 
used in everyday clinical practice. Cognitive-behavioural 
strategies have been useful in programmes to manage fear 
of 
falling (Tennstedt et al. 1998, Zijlstra et al. 2005, 
Gitlin et al. 2006), but are inadequate substitutes for inter- 
ventions that improve functional ability such as Tai Chi 
exercise. Therefore, elderly adults in the combination group 
had best outcomes at 5 months. 
We chose Tai Chi as an exercise intervention in our trial 
since it has been shown to be more effective than other 
exercises for improving FOF and mobility in elderly adults 
(Li et al. 2005, 2008, Sattin et al. 2005). As in our trial, that 







• Few studies exploring Tai Chi or cognitive behavioural 
strategies could reduce fear of falling among elders.

professionals to play an important role in decreasing 
older adults’ fear of falling, and in promoting their 
mobility, social support, and quality of life. 
literature review found strong evidence for the effectiveness 
of Tai Chi in reducing FOF. The Tai Chi interventions were 
found to vary greatly in duration, frequency and intensity 
in one study 
(Harling & Simpson 2008). For example, 
(Li et al. 2008), the participants needed ‡75% attendance 
rate of twice weekly 1-hour classes (40–45 minutes of 8-form 
Tai Chi) for 12 weeks, and ‡30 minutes of in-home practice 
per week. In another study (Sattin et al. 2005), two sessions 
of Tai Chi were given per week, 
increasing from 60 to 
90 minutes, excluding warm-up and cool down (progressing 
from 10 to 50 minutes) for 48 weeks. In our combined 
intervention, we gave 1-hour Tai Chi classes, ﬁve times a 
week, for 8 weeks, which seemed to effectively reduce FOF 
among community-dwelling elders. However, in this trial, we 
did not have an experimental group that received a Tai Chi 
intervention only; therefore, we are not able to distinguish the 
effectiveness of this trial because of Tai Chi or the combi- 
nation intervention. 
On the other hand, our study found no signiﬁcant 
differences in falls among the three groups at the 5-month 
follow-up. Our ﬁndings on falls are consistent with a 
literature review that found weak evidence supporting the 
effectiveness of Tai Chi in reducing the incidence of falls in 
older adults (Harling & Simpson 2008). The follow-up time 
may be too short to detect enough falls for analysis; also, in 
view of the relatively health and young participants in this 
trial. 
The participants who received the CB with Tai Chi 
intervention had better social support. This effect may have 
been due to about half of the participants being single 
(n = 83, 47Æ16%), and living alone (n = 86, 48Æ86%); thus, 
participating in Tai Chi group exercise at least three times a 
week might have created a sense of belonging. Our ﬁnding is 
consistent with a previous report that social support was 
positively associated with physical activity of older rural 
women (Plonczynski et al. 2008). 
All the participants in this group continued doing Tai Chi 
after the intervention, consistent with previous reports that 
100% of 140 community-dwelling older adults intended to 
continue doing Tai Chi after a 12-week intervention (Li et al. 
2008) and that peer groups are important to the well-being 
of single elders (Gupta & Korte 1994). Similarly, elders’ 
well-being was found to be strongly related to a level of 
social involvement and self-reported quality of social life 
(Kunzmann 2008). 


intervention 
improved multiple QOL domains of older adults should 
indicate that this intervention is acceptable to them and that 
they will adhere to it in the long term (Lin et al. 2007). Our 
results reinforce the need to further examine the meaning of 
QOL assessments in older adults. First, not all generic QOL 
measures, usually developed for the general population, are 
suitable for older people. However, the WHOQOL-BREF 
has been determined as a reliable, valid and responsive 
measure of the occurrence of falls in older people (Lin et al. 
2007). Second, improvements in the physical and psycho- 
logical QOL domains and mobility scores may have resulted 
from improved functional status as a consequence of Tai 
Chi exercise, peer support or the CB programme. Finally, a 
interpretation of changes in QOL scores is 
meaningful 
usually difﬁcult, because the statistical 
signiﬁcance of 
changes in QOL scores implies little about their clinical 
signiﬁcance. 
the QOL changes are related to more 
familiar or objective measures, clinicians may more easily 
grasp the anchor-based interpretation of clinical signiﬁcance 
in elderly populations. For instance, changes in scores on the 
physical QOL domain in this study were signiﬁcantly 
(r = 0Æ66) and gait 
correlated with those 
(r = 0Æ59), and changes in scores on the psychological 
QOL domain were signiﬁcantly correlated with those in 
falling (GFFM and FES, r = 0Æ54 and r = 0Æ49, 
fear of 
respectively). 






This is the ﬁrst trial using a cognitive-behavioural strategy 
with Tai Chi exercise among community-dwelling older 
adults to manage fear of falling and promote their mobility, 
social support behaviour and satisfaction, and quality of life. 
This study gives evidence to support the CB with Tai Chi 
intervention as an appropriate and effective programme for 
reducing fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults. 

The ﬁndings of this study indicate that the CB with Tai Chi 
intervention is effective for reducing FOF among community- 
dwelling older adults. These ﬁndings can be used by 
community health professionals to play an important role 
in decreasing older adults’ FOF, and promoting their mobil- 
ity, social support and QOL. Furthermore, implementing this 
intervention with a sample of older community-dwelling 
adults or those with admitted FOF may empower them to 
deal with FOF. This intervention also needs to be tested on 
hospitalized and institutionalized elders. Finally, to more 
precisely study the effects of the intervention, a longer term 
follow-up period will be needed.
