Background. A randomized controlled trial was con- 
ducted to examine: (a) the effect of two physical activ- 
ity modes on changes in subjective well-being (SWB) 
over the course of a 12-month period in older, formerly 
sedentary adults (N 5 174, M age 5 65.5 years) and (b) 
the role played by physical activity participation and 
social support in changes in SWB over time. 
Method. Participants were randomized into either 
an aerobic activity group or a stretching and toning 
group. Structural equation modeling was employed to 
conduct multiple sample latent growth curve analyses 
of individual growth in measures of SWB (happiness, 
satisfaction with life, and loneliness) over time. 
A considerable literature exists that suggests physi- 
cal activity participation to be associated with an im- 
proved sense of psychological well-being. Indeed, over 
90 reviews have been published in this area [1]. Al- 
though the mechanisms underlying the association 
between well-being and physical activity are not well 
defined, there appears to be a fairly consistent associa- 
tion reported between these variables. In a recent re- 
view of 38 studies of physical activity effects on psycho- 
logical well-being in older adults, McAuley and Rudolph 
[2] concluded that the relationship was consistent 
across age and gender, that it was unclear as to the 
effect that physical fitness had on this relationship, 
and that the measurement of psychological well-being 
was inconsistent. 
Results. A curvilinear growth pattern was revealed 
with well-being significantly improving over the 
course of the intervention followed by significant de- 
clines at the 6-month follow-up. Subsequent structural

identified as important influences on a number of psy- 
chological outcomes [12]. For example, the existence of 
stronger levels of social support has been associated 
with both the affective [13] and cognitive [14] compo- 
nents of SWB. Social support has been consistently 
identified as an important determinant of both physical 
and emotional well-being in the elderly [15,16]. Indeed, 
a recent report has identified reduction in the numbers 
of social contacts over time as an important predictor 
of cognitive declines in the elderly [17]. Given such 
findings, it would be reasonable to assume that the 
interactive nature of group exercise environments 
serves to foster the development of social relations and 
support systems and that such influences might operate 
independently of any physical activity influence on 
SWB. 
is not implicated in physical activity effects on well- 
being in older adults, much of this literature employs 
only aerobic conditioning modes of activity (e.g., walk- 
ing, jogging). Thus, it is concluded that aerobic activity 
has a beneficial effect on psychological or subjective 
well-being. Whether this effect is similar for nonaerobic 
forms of activity has not yet been determined. However, 
such a determination has obvious important implica- 
tions for older adults who may be unable to engage in 
more intense types of activity. Moreover, if less intense 
modes of activity also result in similar improvements 
on measures of well-being, this would provide further 
evidence to suggest that vigorous aerobic activity is not 
necessary for important psychological benefits to occur. 
Certainly, others have suggested that psychological out- 
comes can be improved regardless of exercise format [7]. 
In an attempt to address some of these issues, we

to activity regimens in clinical settings [8]. Duncan and 
his colleagues [9,10] have reported data from exercise 
trials involving older adults that have shown social 
support to be indirectly related to exercise behavior 
through its influence on self-efficacy [9] and self-efficacy 
and hardiness [10]. However, there is little empirical 
evidence to suggest a link between social support and 
SWB improvements that have resulted from extended 
exercise programs. 
Sedentary, older (M age 5 65.5 years) adults were 
recruited to participate in a 6-month randomized con- 
trolled exercise trial. Inclusion criteria for participation 


in the program were: (a) age 60 to 75 years, (b) seden-

We employed a variety of strategies to recruit partici- 
pants into the trial. These strategies involved use of 
the local media and included advertisements in the local 
newspapers, announcements and short “infomercials” 
on local radio shows known to have a large senior lis- 
tening audience, and announcements on public service 
sections of local television news programs. In addition, 
we posted flyers advertising the trial in grocery stores, 
churches, senior centers, and other similar locations 
around the area. The announcements and flyers de- 
tailed the opportunity for older adults, to participate 
in a 6-month professionally supervised exercise pro- 
gram at no cost. Interested individuals meeting the 
criteria were instructed to contact us by telephone for 
further information. 
An initial pool of 596 individuals indicated interest 
in participation and were contacted by telephone for 
preliminary screening. Following this screening, 363 
individuals were declared ineligible or declined further 
participation. Subsequent voluntary withdrawals and 
medical exclusions resulted in 174 participants (49 
males, 125 females) beginning the exercise trial. Six 
months after the completion of the trial 116 individuals 
(67%) returned for physiological assessment and 152 
respondents (87%) completed psychological measures. 

Participants were assigned to one of two treatment 
conditions, an aerobic activity program (walking) or a 
stretching and toning program using a modification of 
the baseline-adaptive randomization scheme of Begg 
and Iglewicz [19]. Medication use was employed as the 
baseline binary variable distinguishing the use or non- 
use of each of four major medication classes (cardiovas- 
cular, neuroleptic, anxiolytic, and antidepressant). This 
process was then implemented within each stratum of 
important baseline variables (e.g., gender and age), 
thus minimizing differences between groups. The proce- 
dure is further elaborated in McAuley et al. [20]. Details 
of medication use across groups can be found in Table 3. 

Aerobic exercise group. The aerobic exercise inter- 
vention was designed to influence physical fitness as 
typified by cardiorespiratory endurance (see [21] for 
details of these effects). The exercise classes were con- 
ducted by trained exercise specialists and employed 
brisk walking as the aerobic component. The exercise 
program was conducted three times a week for 6 
months. With respect to the exercise prescription, the 
intensity level began at light levels (50–55% VO2max) 
and gradually increased to more moderate levels (65% 
VO2max) by the midpoint of the program. Levels of inten- 
sity were prescribed based upon maximal responses 
during physiological testing and monitored via heart 
rate (Karvonnen method) and ratings of perceived exer- 
tion. Additionally, duration of exercise was also gradu- 
ally increased beginning at 10–15 minutes per session 
and increasing by a minute per session until partici- 
pants were exercising for 40 minutes per session. 
Stretching and toning control group. This group met 
three times per week for 6 months under the supervi- 
sion of an experienced exercise leader in a large gymna- 
sium. The focus of this program was on the provision 
of an organized program of stretching, limbering, and 
mild strengthening for the whole body designed specifi- 
cally for older individuals. Each individual was pro- 
vided with their own exercise mat and rubber resistance 
tubing. The program included (a) strengthening exer- 
cises consisting of one set of 8–12 repetitions per major 
muscle group and (b) flexibility exercises for all large 
muscle groups held for approximately 20–30 s. Each 
stretching/toning session lasted for approximately 40 
minutes with 10-minute warm-up and cool-down peri- 
ods [22]. 

Demographics and health and physical activity his- 
tory. Each subject completed an inventory providing 
demographic information and details of their medical 
history and lifestyle/exercise habits prior to participa- 
tion in the physical fitness assessment. The health in- 
formation obtained was used for four purposes: (1) to 
assess the individual’s risk of cardiovascular disease; 
(2) to determine supervisory requirements for exercise 
testing and training; (3) to identify potential contraindi- 
cations for participation in the study; and (4) to ascer- 
tain the physical activity histories of all subjects. Deter- 
mination of the above was based on the criteria 
established by the American College of Sports Medicine 
Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Training [22]. 

Exercise frequency. Frequency of exercise participa- 
tion was assessed by having participants complete an 
exercise log at the end of every scheduled exercise ses- 
sion during the program. Participants indicated on the 
log the number of minutes they had been active plus 
their resting and exercise heart rates. For the purpose 
of analyses, frequency was defined as the number of 
times during the 6 months that they had exercised 
within the group setting. 
Subjective well being. Deiner [5] has argued that 
assessments of subjective well-being should comprise 


affective and cognitive components. In the present Procedures 
study, we employed two affective measures assessing 
happiness and loneliness and a cognitive measure as- 
sessing satisfaction with life. Happiness was assessed 
by the Memorial University of Newfoundland Scale of 
Happiness (MUNSH) developed by Kozma and Stones 
[25]. The MUNSH is a 24-item measure comprised of 
four subscales, Positive Affect (PA), Negative Affect 
(NA), Positive Experiences (PE), and Negative Experi- 
ences (NE). A total happiness score is attained by the 
formula PA 2 NA 1 PE 2 NE. As this approach can 
result in negative numbers, we added a constant of 
(120) to the score as recommended by McNeil [24], thus 
giving a scoring range of 0–44. The scale was developed 
as a measure of happiness in the elderly and has been 
validated in a variety of settings [25,26]. Internal con- 
sistency for the MUNSH in the present study ranged 
from a5 0.84 to 0.90. Loneliness was measured with 
with UCLA Loneliness Scale [27]. This measure is con- 
sidered the “gold standard” of loneliness measures and 
is a 20-item scale ranging from 20 to 80. Internal consis- 
tency for this scale in the present study ranged from 
a5 0.92 to 0.94. 
Baseline assessments of well-being, demographic in- 
formation, physical activity, and general medical his- 
tory were mailed to participants at entry into the trial 
and returned prior to initial physiological testing. Fol- 
lowing this testing, participants embarked on a 6- 
month exercise program (either walking or stretching 
and toning). Two weeks into the program, participants 
completed the Social Provisions Scale. This 2-week time 
frame allowed participants an initial time period in 
order to get to know other group members and thereby 
to make an accurate assessment of initial levels of social 
support within the exercise group. Physical activity logs 
were completed on a daily basis by participants and 
verified by the exercise leaders, allowing us to accu- 
rately determine frequency of physical activity partici- 
pation in the program. The measures of exercise social 
provisions and well-being were once again completed in 
the final week of the intervention. Finally, at 6 months 
beyond the termination of the intervention, partici- 
pants completed the well-being measures and returned 
them by mail. 
Satisfaction with life. Satisfaction with life was 
measured by the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) 
of Diener et al. [28]. This measure was designed to 
assess an individual’s global judgment of life satisfac- 
tion by allowing the respondent to weight the impor- 
tance of life domains in accordance with his or her own 
values and standards. The SWLS is a 5-item scale with 
values ranging from 1 to 35. Internal consistency for 
the SWLS in the present study ranged from a5 0.87 
to 0.92. 
Social support. The Social Provisions Scale (SPS; 
[29]) was employed to assess social relations/support in 
the exercise groups. In a manner similar to that of 
Duncan and McAuley [9], we modified the wording of 
the items slightly to reflect social provisions that were 
supplied by the exercise group as opposed to more gen- 
eral assessments of support. The SPS is composed of 24 
items with 4 items each reflecting the social provisions 
proposed by Weiss [30]: social integration, reassurance 
of worth, reliable alliance, opportunity for nurturance, 
and guidance. For the purpose of analyses in the pres- 
ent study, we combined the scores from these subscales 
to create an overall social support score ranging from 
24 to 96. There is precedent for such action, as Cutrona 
and Russell [29] have shown the SPS to be adequately 
represented by a second-order single factor on which 
each of the provisions load. Cutrona and Russell [29] 
have concluded that the SPS assesses both specific com- 
ponents and overall levels of social support. Internal 
consistency for the total SPS in the present study 
ranged from a5 0.83 to 0.90. 

Missing data. As noted earlier, 174 participants en- 
tered the exercise intervention phase of the trial. With 
respect to the well-being data, there were 12.1 and 
18.4% missing MUNSH data, 18.4 and 25.3% missing 
SWLS data, and 6.3 and 13.2% missing UCLA data at 6 
and 12 months, respectively. In terms of social support, 
there were 17.2% missing data at the end of the inter- 
vention. Rather than discarding potentially useful data 
and increasing the likelihood of sampling bias if the 
missing data were not missing completely at random 
[31], we employed a raw maximum likelihood estima- 
tion procedure implemented in the structural equation 
modeling program AMOS [32]. In this procedure, the 
log-likelihood of the data is calculated providing reli- 
able standard errors for the missing data case. Thus, 
our analyses are based on a sample size of 174 (N 5 
89 in the stretching and toning group and N 5 85 in 
the walking group). 
Analytic plan. Our interest was in examining: (a) 
the differential effects of the two activity interventions 
on the form and shape of well-being over time and (b) 
to what extent changes in social relations as a function 
of the exercise intervention and frequency of exercise 
participation influenced growth in well-being.5 Because 
we have repeated measures over time, we elected to

Initial attempts to fit an associative model with a 
common intercept and slope for each measure of well- 
being proved unsuccessful due to high levels of multicol- 
linearity after correction for measurement error. There- 
fore, we employed a latent growth curve associative 
model that was analogous to a doubly multivariate re- 
peated measures analysis of variance. In essence, this 
is a saturated three-factor growth model which is fit to 
each of the measures of well-being testing a quadratic 
function for each measure. As noted earlier, we con- 
ducted these analyses in a multiple sample framework. 
The initial model tests the growth curve of the measures 
but fixes the means of each measure to be equal across 
the two intervention conditions. Subsequent analyses 
systematically estimated the means for each measure 
across the two conditions and conducted a x2 test to 
determine whether means were significantly different 
across the groups. 
Tests of the latent growth curve associative model fit 
were very good: x2 (60, N 5 174) 5 74.06, P 5 ns, 
CFI 5 0.97, RMSEA 5 0.037. Subsequent tests of group 
differences in growth of the well-being means were all 
nonsignificant, indicating that the estimation of equal 
means across treatment groups represented the most 
parsimonious model. The means and standard errors 
for each level of well-being at baseline and at 6 and 
12 months are shown in Table 3. Specifically, these 
parameters demonstrate a significant increase in hap- 
piness and satisfaction with life at the end of the exer- 
cise intervention, followed by a significant decrease in 
these constructs at 12 months. Indeed, these values 
at 12 months have dropped marginally below baseline 
levels. With respect to loneliness, improvements are 
indicated by a significant decrease at the end of the 
intervention with a small but significant increase being 
apparent at 12 months. In essence, the latent growth 
curve estimates take on a curvilinear growth pattern 
with both exercise groups exhibiting significant linear 
improvements in SWB parameters following comple- 
tion of the intervention followed by significant declines 
at the 6-month follow-up. 
In the second stage of our analyses, we examined 
structural models which examined the influence of ex- 
ercise frequency and changes in social relations over 
the course of the program on overall growth in the well- 
being measures. The fit of all models in our preceding 
analyses was tested by calculation of the x2 goodness- Effects of Physical Activity Participation and Social 
of-fit test, the comparative fit index (CFI), and the root 
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), which 
takes into consideration model complexity. A nonsignifi- 
cant x2 value, a CFI value .0.90, and a RMSEA value 
,0.05 are all considered indicative of a well-fitting 
model. 

The associative model tested above gives us a good 
representation of the general shape of growth in well- 
being over the 12-month period comprising the exercise 
intervention and subsequent follow-up. In the struc- 
tural model, we tested the relative contributions of the 
frequency of exercise participation and changes in so- 
cial support over the 6-month exercise trial to changes 
in each of the measures of well-being. We employed

with changes in satisfaction with life and loneliness as

SWB appear to be reversed at the 6-month follow-up 
post-intervention. This pattern was consistent for both 
exercise conditions. Structural models examining the 
effects of social support and exercise frequency on SWB 
suggested that neither variable played a role in im-

the exercise program contributed to any changes in 
SWB constructs over and above the influence of physi- 
cal activity participation. First, it should be pointed out 
that preliminary analyses did not reveal any influence 
of changes in physical fitness on SWB, supporting our 
previous claim that vigorous activity programs may not 
be needed for psychological health improvements. Vari- 
ous hypotheses have been generated identifying physio-

either group social interactions or physical activity fre- 
quency. In the case of satisfaction with life, we see that 
the extent to which social relations developed within both frequency of physical activity and changes in social 
support play a role in changes over the 6-month inter- 
vention and the 6-month follow-up periods. That is, 
individuals who exercised more frequently during the 
exercise intervention, regardless of mode of activity, 
and who realized greater improvements in social sup- 
port over the intervention period had significantly 
greater improvements in satisfaction with life. It is im- 
portant to note that satisfaction with life remains rela- 
tively stable across age despite changes in physical and 
material resources [45]. That physical activity partici- 
pation might enhance what is considered to be a rela- 
tively stable, but important element of overall health- 
related quality of life is underscored when we examine 
the pattern of relationships postintervention. As noted 
earlier, satisfaction with life declined at follow-up, as 
did the other elements of SWB. However, these declines 
appear to be attenuated by having been more active 
and having improved social support during the exercise 
program. What is interesting about these findings is 
that the shape and form of the SWB growth pattern 
are, as one would expect, curvilinear. That declines in 
SWB are attenuated by physical activity participation 
and social support in older adults has implications for 
exercise interventions. That is, emphasis should be

adults. There is, however, evidence to suggest that ac- 
tivity patterns among older African Americans are 
lower than older white Americans [46]. Given that Afri-

processes in this relationship in minority groups is 
warranted.

an integral part of a healthy lifestyle, there is an in- 
creasing interest in health-related quality of life. How 
the social environment of the exercise experience influ- 
ences this important public health outcome is deserving 
of continued attention. 
The final element of SWB to be considered is loneli- 
ness. Although loneliness is no more pronounced in 
older adults than other measures of negative affect, the 
present findings suggest that reductions in loneliness 
can result from physical activity interventions. Inter- 
estingly, it appears that the physical activity environ- 
ment provides the necessary social resources to combat 
loneliness. In the present study, greater levels of initial 
support from the exercise group in the first 2 weeks of 
the program and improvements in social support over 
the 6-month period were associated with significantly 
greater reductions in loneliness over the 6-month inter- 
vention. Although the exercise program (i.e., frequency 
of participation) does not appear to play a direct role 
in reductions in loneliness, it is apparent that the envi- 
ronment can provide the social resources to buffer feel- 
ings of loneliness. Further examination of this relation- 
ship in the context of exercising older adults is 
warranted. 
Although we believe that the results of this trial have 
both theoretical and practical significance, there are of 
course several limitations to be considered when inter- 
preting these data. First, as illustrated by the demo- 
graphic data, our sample was composed predominantly 
of females. However, we would note that the distribu- 
tion by gender is more reflective of the population at 
this age than would be an equal ratio of males and 
females. Moreover, there were no gender differences in 
any of the variables of interest. Additionally, despite 
best recruitment efforts, our sample was predominantly 
Caucasian. Little is known relative to physical activity 
effects on the psychosocial outcomes in minority older
