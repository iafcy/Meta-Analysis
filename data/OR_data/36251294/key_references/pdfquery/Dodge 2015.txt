Introduction: Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cogni- 
tive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether 
conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user- 
friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function 
among older adults without dementia. 
Methods: Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial 
period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. 
The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally 
deﬁned as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini 
mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in random- 
ization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention dif- 
ferences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and 
intervention groups using linear regression models. 
Results: Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). 
Their mean 6 standard deviation age was 80.5 6 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. 
There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among 
the intervention group was 89% (range 77%–100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, 
the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic ﬂuency test 
(P 5 .003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic ﬂuency test (P 5 .004) at the 18-week assess- 
ments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P 5 .04) toward improved psychomo- 
tor speed was observed in the intervention group. 
Conclusion: Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demon- 
strated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater 
improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through 
communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional 
studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows 
cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia.

Almost 2 decades ago, Rowe and Kahn [1] suggested the 
key elements of successful aging, including (1) a low proba- 
bility of disease, (2) high levels of function, and (3) active 
engagement with life. The deﬁnition of “active engagement 
with life” varies across individuals and cultures. In epidemi- 
ologic 
engagement—one 
self-reported social 
component of active engagement with life—has been exten- 
sively examined in relation to cognitive well-being. Howev- 
er, no set of standard activities was used across studies. 
Various activities were included, such as reading, playing 
games or musical instruments, going to classes, doing cross- 
word puzzles, playing cards, going to the cinema or theater 
(often categorized as cognitive activities), visiting friends 
or relatives and attending organizations (as social activities), 
and dancing and walking (as physical activities). Further- 
more, larger social networks (a structural aspect of social 
connectedness) were also found to be protective against de- 
mentia [2–12]. It is as yet unknown which factors of social 
engagement or networking might 
reduce the risk of 
dementia. For example, playing games has often been 
categorized as an intellectual/cognitive stimulating activity; 
however, playing games with someone requires social 
interaction. Thus, the question is whether it is the social 
interaction or playing the game itself that is protective 
against cognitive decline. Randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) with clearly speciﬁed elements and doses of social 
engagement are needed to clarify the mechanism of the 
protective function of social engagement and networks on 
cognitive

require 
and 
One integral component of being socially active is the 
ability to interact with others. Linguistic ability is known 
to be highly correlated with late-life changes in cognition 
in healthy older adults and those with dementia [13–15]. 
Furthermore, the results from psychological studies have 
suggested that the task of conversation is highly cognitively 
attention, working 
stimulating. Conversations 
memory, 
thought 
of 
organization 
(executive functions), and social cognition to understand 
others’ intentions and feelings [16,17], 
in addition to 
linguistic ability. To develop a prevention approach against 
cognitive decline that can be easily adapted to the oldest- 
old and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or 
those with low motivation or apathy, we developed a 
clinical RCT, focusing on conversation. We examined 
whether face-to-face conversation—a core component of so- 
cial interaction—can enhance cognitive functions by stimu- 
lating social cognition. To facilitate efﬁciency and 

quantiﬁcation of outcomes, we used contemporary technol- 
ogies, including personal computers (PCs), webcams, and 
the Internet, to deliver the conversational interventions. 
From the epidemiologic and psychological data discussed 
in the Introduction, we hypothesized that our trial interven- 
tion would lead to improved attention, executive function, 
verbal ﬂuency, and memory (i.e., domains frequently 
impaired among patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The ob- 
jectives of our study were to assess the feasibility, adherence, 
and post-trial changes in cognitive functions and loneliness. 
In the report, we present the protocol and results of the RCT. 


From November 2011 to August 2012, we distributed 2000 
survey questionnaires targeting those living in retirement com- 
munities and senior centers located in the Portland, metropol- 
itan area, within an approximately 1-hour commute from the 
Oregon Health & Science University (Portland, OR). Sixteen 
retirement communities and senior centers that covered a wide 
range of socioeconomic status (including low-income house- 
hold retirement communities designated by the municipal 
government) and that had agreed to collaborate in research 
studies with our university were included. We conducted infor- 
mation sessions at each community and center to explain the 
upcoming trial. The survey was distributed at the conclusion 
of the information session and also by mail through the retire- 
ment communities and senior center administrative ofﬁces. 
In the survey, we collected information, including demo- 
graphic data, types and frequencies of social engagement, 
loneliness, and PC usage. After a brief introductory para- 
graph describing our trial, we asked individuals whether 
they would be interested in participating in the trial, and, if 
so, to provide their contact information. They were informed 
that they could decline to participate any time after learning 
about the study. The main information collected in the sur- 
vey is listed in Table 1. 

We invited those who had provided their contact informa- 
tion to participate in in-person screening interviews 
(Figure 1). The information collected at the interview is 
listed in Table 1, and the study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are listed in Table 2. Trained research associates con- 
ducted the interviews. The subjects were randomly assigned 
intervention group using the

score (3 groups: less than 24, 24–26, 27 or more), and years 
of education (3 categories: less than 12, 12–15, and 16 or 
more). The cognitive status of normal subjects and those 
with MCI was operationally deﬁned as a global CDR score 
of 0 and 0.5, respectively. A modiﬁed randomized minimiza- 
tion algorithm was used [32]. 

The intervention group engaged in face-to-face conversa- 
tions with trained interviewers 5 days a week (Monday 
through Friday) for 6 weeks by way of a dedicated video- 
chat-enabled PC provided to each subject. Each conversa- 
tional session was designed to last 30 to 35 minutes. The 
control group received weekly telephone calls to assess their 
social engagement activities during the previous week (i.e., 
no PC or Internet provided). If the participants in the control 
group were already using a PC before the trial, they were al- 
lowed to continue. After randomization, within 2 weeks 
before the start of the conversational intervention, we admin- 
istered a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Af- 
ter the trial (within 2 weeks after trial completion) and at the 
endpoint 
the post-trial assessment or 
18 weeks from baseline), assessments were conducted to 
examine the post-trial effect and its durability. 


The CDR assessment was conducted by trained research 
nurses in a standardized manner, including information from 
informants or the collateral source [31]. 
2.5. Development of a user-friendly web-enabled 
conversational system 
We created our own version of a chat system in which par- 
ticipants did not need to know how to use a computer, other 
than to touch the touch screen of a computer preconﬁgured 
to receive calls and automatically begin the conversational 
session. The study computer was enabled to record the trial 
sessions and store encrypted audio data automatically. Tech- 
nical support personnel visited each participant’s home and 
set up the equipment. 

Conversation requires synthesis of multiple cognitive 
functions. To present an understandable story or “rational- 
ity,” the speaker must organize their ideas and thoughts 
and pay attention to the other’s response. Thus, attention, ex- 
ecutive function, and abstract reasoning are simultaneously 
engaged. To take full advantage of this synthetic aspect of 
conversation, we placed an emphasis on spontaneous re- 
sponses rather than structured answers (i.e., the participants 
had to organize their thoughts). We used unstructured con- 
versations such as talking about the participants’ “childhood 
memories,” “hobbies,” “siblings and parents,” and “movies/ 
books.” A topic that engages one participant’s attentiveness 
and interest might not do the same for others. Nevertheless, 
we attempted to create a degree of standardization by using a 
daily picture prompt to stimulate the conversation. For 
example, we presented Norman Rockwell paintings or pic- 
tures of famous events (e.g., the ﬁrst moon landing) on 
screen as evocative pictures and asked the participant about 
what was happening in the picture. Next, we asked whether 










the subject could connect their experience with the story 
seen in the picture. We aimed to primarily engage the 
executive functions, attention, semantic memory, and ab- 
stract reasoning with this type of a semistructured session 
approach. 
by the participant or interviewer during the recorded conver- 
sations served as a metric to improve the standardization 
of 
interview skills. The 
interviewers were unaware of the cognitive status of the par- 
ticipants. 




The interviewers practiced conversational sessions with 
our staff members and elderly volunteers to standardize their 
skills before the trial began. We also recorded each conver- 
sational session to monitor their interview quality. Permis- 
sion for recording each trial session was included in the 
consent form. Additionally, we randomly selected three re- 
corded conversational sessions per interviewer, one session 
each during the baseline, third, and sixth week and had 
them transcribed by a single professional transcriber. The 
proportion of words spoken by the interviewers was used 
as a tool to standardize the conversational sessions. The de- 
viation observed in the number of spoken words contributed 
We administered the following neuropsychological tests: 
(1) for immediate memory, the Consortium to Establish a 
Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease word list learning [26]; 
(2) for delayed memory, the Consortium to Establish a Reg- 
istry for Alzheimer’s Disease word list delayed recall [26]; 
(3) for language, the composite of verbal ﬂuency for letters 
(F, A, and S) [25]; (4) for psychomotor speed, the trail mak- 
ing A test [27]; (5) for executive function, the trail making B 
test [27] and verbal ﬂuency for category animals [25]; (6) for 
selective attention/inhibition, the Stroop test [25]; and (7) for 
premorbid and general intelligence, the wide range achieve- 
ment test-revised [28]. We also used the following items

from computerized cognitive test batteries: two domains 
from the Cogstate [30] (for psychomotor speed, the detec- 
tion test and for working memory, the one back and two 
back), and the full battery of the computer assessment of 
mild cognitive impairment [29]. 

The changes in loneliness from before to after the trial 
were assessed using a 3-item loneliness scale developed by 
Hughes et al [18]. The measurement asks three questions: 
“How often do you feel” (1) that you lack companionship, 
(2) left out, and (3) isolated from others? (1, hardly ever 
[or never]; 2, some of the time; and 3, often). A higher score 
indicates greater levels of perceived loneliness. 

Symptoms of depression can mediate possible treatment 
effects, especially as they relate to socialization. Therefore, 
we controlled for symptoms of low mood measured using 
the geriatric depression scale, 15-item scale [22] in the pri- 
mary analysis. As an exploratory analysis, we also examined 
personality measured using the NEO-5 factor personality 
scales [21] and controlled for them in the multivariate ana- 
lyses, hypothesizing that personality could affect changes 
in the primary outcomes. Finally, we included the interaction 
effect of PC usage (yes/no; the questions are listed in 
Table 1) and the study group (intervention versus control 
group, with the latter group as a reference) to examine 
whether the trial efﬁcacy differed by PC usage/experience. 
This was because our previous study found that those who 
provided contact information in the survey were signiﬁ- 
cantly more likely to be PC users [20]. If PC users have 
higher or lower efﬁcacy compared with non-PC users, this 
information would be useful for generalizing our study re- 
sults to nonparticipants. 
Our institutional review board approved the study proto- 
col (protocol no. 5590), and all participants provided written 
informed consent. The project is listed in ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT01571427), and the ﬁnal face-to-face interview with 
the participants was conducted on August 30, 2013. 

The characteristics were compared between the interven- 
tion and control groups using Pearson chi-square tests for 
categorical variables and the t test or nonparametric Wil- 
coxon ranked sum test for continuous variables. Adherence 
was calculated as the proportion of days the subjects in the 
intervention group completed the experiment. The pre- to 
postintervention differences in the cognitive tests and lone- 
liness scores were compared between the control and inter- 
vention groups using t tests (univariate analysis) and linear 
regression models (multivariate analysis). Statistical signif- 
icance was set at P , .004, the Bonferroni multiple compar- 
ison adjusted P value. All analyses were performed using 
SAS, version 9.3, software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 


Of 2000 surveys distributed, 1102 were returned (55.1% 
response rate). Of these, 383 subjects (19.1%) provided con- 
tact information (Figure 1). The characteristics associated

icant difference observed for category ﬂuency and word list 
delayed recall (P , .0001) and the mini mental state exami- 
nation (P , .0001), supporting the validity of our CDR 
assessment. The computer assessment of mild cognitive 
impairment overall scores were signiﬁcantly lower among 
the MCI group, although the items in the Cogstate computer- 
ized tests showed no differences between the two groups. 

All participants completed the pre- and post-trial neuro- 
psychological tests. Among the intervention group, session 
adherence was 89% (range 77%–100%). All subjects 
(control and intervention groups) completed the 6- and 18- 
week ﬁnal assessments. 

The results of the linear regression models in which the 
outcome was the differences in the test scores between the 
baseline and post-trial assessments (post-trial score minus 
the baseline score) with the study group as the independent 
variable and controlling for depressive symptoms (geriatric 
depression scale, 15-item scale), are listed in Table 4. The co- 
efﬁcients reported in Table 4 are “additional” changes ob- 
tained by the intervention group beyond those obtained by 
the control group. We found category ﬂuency scores (semantic 
ﬂuency scores) had improved more in the intervention group 
than in the control group (P 5 .02). The stratiﬁed analysis 
showed that this effect came mainly from the CDR 0 group 
(P 5 .003). Among the MCI group, the intervention group 
gained psychomotor speed, indicated by the Cogstate detec- 
tion tests, compared with the control group (P 5.04), although 
the differences were not signiﬁcant using the multiple 
comparison-adjusted P value. At 12 weeks after the end of 
the trial, we examined the durability of the effects (data not 
shown). The category ﬂuency scores no longer differed be- 
tween the two groups, but the letter ﬂuency scores showed 
greater improvement among those with a CDR of 0 in the inter- 
vention group (P 5 .004). Although both groups had similar 
levels of improvement/learning effects at the post-trial assess- 
ment, the letter ﬂuency scores had improved further in the 
the trial sessions 
intervention group after 
(Figure 2) but had declined in the control group. No difference 
was found between intervention and control groups in the pre- 
to post-trial changes in the loneliness score, the secondary 
outcome. As an exploratory analysis, we controlled for the per- 
sonality scores, in addition to the geriatric depression scale 
scores, which did not inﬂuence the obtained results. Finally, 
we included the interaction of the study group (intervention 
versus control) and PC usage. No interaction effect was found, 
and it did not inﬂuence the obtained results. 


We conducted a pilot behavioral clinical trial to improve 
cognitive functions among nondemented older elderly 
Fig. 2. Letter ﬂuency test results at baseline, post-trial, and ﬁnal assess- 
ments among clinical dementia rating (CDR) 0 group. Among the CDR 0 
group, the intervention group kept improving the test score after the trial, 
but the control group experienced a decline at the ﬁnal assessment, leading 
to a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups in the gain in scores from 
baseline to the ﬁnal assessment (P 5 .004). 
with those who provided contact information in the survey 
compared with those who returned the survey without 
providing the information (potential volunteer bias) have 
been previously summarized in detail [20]. In brief, those 
who provided contact information were more likely to be 
PC users and physically active and to have higher social 
isolation scores, with PC usage the most signiﬁcant predictor 
after controlling for education and other confounders. A total 
of 83 subjects were enrolled and randomized (41 in the inter- 
vention group and 42 in the control group; Figure 1). The 
participant characteristics at baseline are listed in Table 3. 
The mean age was 80.5 years, and 76% were women. Per pro- 
tocol, the age, sex, education, CDR score, and mini mental 
state examination score distributions were similar between 
the intervention and control groups. The other characteristics 
not used for randomization (i.e., marital status, wide range 
achievement test-revised scores, and PC usage) were also 
comparable between the two groups. We also compared the 
baseline characteristics between those with a CDR score of 
0 and those with a CDR score of 0.5. The MCI group was 
somewhat older and more likely to be women. Although 
the CDR score was assessed independently, all conventional 
neuropsychological test scores, except for letter ﬂuency, 
were lower among the CDR 0.5 group, with the most signif- 


subjects by enhancing their social 
interaction through 
Internet-based conversation. We achieved high adherence 
to the protocol, and the intervention groups showed im- 
provements in language-based executive functions within a 
short-duration trial period. 
Cognitive stimulation through Internet-based face-to- 
face conversation has some ideal features as a prevention 
approach. First, unlike video game-invoked cognitive 
training, the subjects participate in naturalistic “human” in- 
teractions that might be more engaging and require less 
motivation on the part of older participants, thus allowing 
those with low motivation and/or apathy to participate and 
remain in the trial. Second, one might achieve more cost- 
effective execution of trials by allowing a few interviewers 
to interact with many participants daily using the Internet 
and also gain access to those who are home-bound or in 
remote locations. Third, conversations with interviewers 
through the Internet eliminate potential trial confounders 
such as indirect effects of tangible support that could affect 
overall and cognitive health (e.g., transportation service). 
Fourth, the trial differs in nature from the neuropsychologi- 
cal test itself. Therefore, the observed gains in the neuropsy- 
chological test scores at the post-trial assessment (beyond 
the learning effects observed among the control group) 
should reﬂect improvement in cognitive function that could 
not be attributed to “test-taking” or “limited trained skills.” 
Finally, the method provides the ability to record all interac- 
tions for off-line analysis with the participants’ consent. 
Thus, acoustic speech characteristics, word selections, and 
sentence complexity associated with cognitive function, an 
area of growing research interest, could be analyzed for 
additional information [13,33–38]. 
We paid special attention to creating a user-friendly envi- 
ronment to achieve high adherence, including a large touch 
screen monitor that allowed eye-to-eye contact as experi- 
enced in in-person conversations to retain attention and 
pop-up pictures on the screen to evoke conversations without 
any effort by the participants. The published psychological 
data suggest that with age, adult cognition becomes more 
tightly linked to socioemotional systems, and emotional mo- 
tives play an important role in driving engagement and 
enhancing cognitive outcomes in later adulthood [39,40]. 
We believe that tailoring existing technologies to suit the 
current generation of the elderly, together with naturalistic 
human contact, is key to achieving high adherence when 
using contemporary communication technologies. 
We found improvements in semantic ﬂuency immediately 
after the trial sessions among the intervention group compared 
with the control group and at the 18-week assessment from 
baseline in phonemic ﬂuency. In Alzheimer’s disease, seman- 
tic ﬂuency has been found to be disproportionately impaired, 
with phonemic ﬂuency ability less impaired in some [41,42], 
although not all studies agree [43]. It has been hypothesized 
that the disproportionate impairment in semantic ﬂuency, 
compared with phonemic ﬂuency, could occur because the 
former relies more on temporal lobe semantic stores, the 
area affected by Alzheimer’s disease, and the latter on frontal 
lobe functions. It is noteworthy that the intervention group 
continued to show improvement in the phonemic ﬂuency 
test. The stimulation obtained from the present trial might 
have led to sustained or an increased amount of social interac- 
tion, even after the termination of the trial sessions, although 
we do not have data to conﬁrm this hypothesis. Future studies 
that examine the post-trial changes in functional and structural 
connectivity between medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe 
using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion 
tensor imaging could be useful in identifying the underlying 
mechanisms of the ﬁnding. 
The improvement in cognitive function we have described 
was limited to those with intact cognition, although we saw a 
trend toward improvement in psychomotor speed among the 
MCI group. The lack of improvement in cognitive functions 
among those with MCI likely was because our study was not 
powered to see changes among the MCI group (the sample 
size was predetermined for a combined analysis in this phase 
I study). Also, those with MCI are a heterogeneous group, and 
the efﬁcacy is likely to vary depending on whether the subjects 
have only memory impairment or also have impairment in 
other domains (multidomain MCI). The CDR sum of box 
scores in our MCI group ranged from 0.5 to 3, suggesting vari- 
ability in the types of MCI present. Future studies that allow for 
stratiﬁed analyses by MCI and its subtypes are warranted. 
Also, it will be important to identify the biomarker character- 
istics of those who improved and those who did not improve in 
cognitive functions, to examine the underlying mechanisms of 
those differences. This could aid in identifying who should be 
targeted for this type of behavioral trial and also in reducing the 
confounding effects and variability in outcomes. 
We did not see any improvement in the loneliness scores 
(the secondary outcome). The scale we used asked only 3 
questions (lack companionship, left out, and isolated from 
others), with each having 3 possible answers. It is possible 
that the variation in the scale is not great, and, therefore, it 
to capture within-individual changes 
would be difﬁcult 
within a short period. Alternatively, loneliness is a subjective 
state, indicating a gap between desired levels of social inter- 
actions and the amount of available social network and sup- 
port. Increasing the opportunity to converse or socialize 
might not be sufﬁcient to modify the level of loneliness. 
Recent magnetic resonance imaging studies found associ- 
ations between the size and complexity of the real-world so- 
cial networks and the density of the gray matter [44] and 
amygdala volume [45]. Modiﬁable effects of larger social 
networks on the symptomatic outcomes of Alzheimer’s dis- 
ease pathologic features have also been shown [6]. 
Nonhuman research has suggested that the social network 
size could actually contribute to changes in both brain struc- 
ture and function, providing additional support for causal 
links [46]. We have previously outlined the possible mecha- 
nisms for social interaction’s effects on cognitive function 
[47]. Despite the accumulating evidence, just a few RCTs 
have examined engagement-evoked cognitive changes

The limitations of our study included a selection bias. As 
shown in our previous study [20], those who volunteer to 
participate in such studies differ from the general popula- 
tion. For example, the high adherence we observed could 
have been in part because the participants were self- 
selected volunteers. The sample size for the present pilot 
study was determined for the normal/MCI combined ana- 
lyses, not for analyses stratiﬁed by cognitive status. Also, 
our trial duration was only 6 weeks, and the retention effects 
were limited to 18 weeks from baseline. To conﬁrm whether 
the rates of decline in cognitive functions are actually 
different between the intervention and control groups, we 
would need to monitor the participants for at least 6 months 
to 1 year to be able to observe and compare the natural his- 
tory of cognitive declines with those in the intervention 
group. Finally, more effort is required to control for con- 
founding effects such as the duration of daily conversation 
enacted outside the trial sessions. We intended to measure 
the amount of daily conversations; however, the currently 
available devices were limited in their battery life, and we 
were unable to include this confounder in the analyses. 
The strengths of our study included that rigorous ap- 
proaches were taken to standardize the interviewers, 
including intensive practice sessions before the trial initia- 
tion and assessment of recorded conversations, including ex- 
amination of 
the proportion of words spoken by the 
interviewers and the participants during the trial sessions. 
Second, our study participants were relatively old (mean 
age 80 years). This age group is the fastest growing segment 
of the population in most developed countries and faces the 
greatest risk of developing cognitive impairment or demen- 
tia because of their risk factor of age alone. Developing pre- 
vention approaches with high adherence that could delay the 
onset of dementia for even a few years could have a large ef- 
fect on the overall disease burden, especially among the old- 
est of the old group, and is urgently needed. To our 
knowledge, the present study is one of the ﬁrst RCTs aimed 
at increasing social interactions among this age group. 
demonstrated high adherence. The intervention group 
showed signiﬁcantly greater improvement in the neuropsy- 
chological test scores that evaluate both semantic and pho- 
netic ﬂuencies, despite the short duration of the trial 
period. Increasing daily social contacts through communica- 
tion technologies could offer cost-effective execution of 
home-based prevention trials. Additional studies are needed 
that are powered to analyze the efﬁcacy among those with 
MCI and have longer follow-up durations to examine the dif- 
ferences in the rate of decline in cognitive functions between 
the intervention and control groups. These studies should 
also examine the pre- and postintervention differences in 
biomarkers to identity the potential mechanism and should 
be able to assess the translational effects on everyday living. 


Our social engagement intervention (daily conversations) 
using user-friendly Internet communication programs 


1. Systematic review: We reviewed the available 
English-language data in PubMed to March 2014 
using the search terms “social network,” “social 
engagement” or “social interaction,” and “random- 
ized controlled clinical 
trials” to ﬁnd studies to 
include in our discussion. 
2. Interpretation: Previous epidemiologic studies have 
demonstrated that a larger social network or more 
frequent social interactions might have protective ef- 
fects on the development of Alzheimer’s disease. We 
conducted a randomized, controlled clinical 
trial 
aimed at improving cognitive functions among nonde- 
mented older subjects (mean age 80 years) by 
enhancing their social interaction through Internet- 
based conversation. We achieved high adherence to 
the protocol, and the intervention groups showed im- 
provements in language-based executive functions. 
3. Future directions: The cognitive stage at which this type 
of intervention is most effective should be identiﬁed. 
The study should be expanded to have a longer 
follow-up duration to examine the differences in the 
rate of decline in cognitive functions between the 
intervention and control groups. The pre- and post- 
intervention differences in biomarker levels should be 
examined to identity the potential mechanisms. Finally, 
an effective, yet sustainable, dose of social interactions 
and methods to deliver the program to a larger com- 
munity, scalable to a national level, should be identiﬁed.
