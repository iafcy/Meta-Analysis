Background: Due to the demographic ageing process and the increasing number of pre-frail and frail individuals, 
new lifestyle interventions to enhance the quality of life (QoL) in community-dwelling older adults are necessary. 
Therefore, we performed a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare effects of a lay-led home-based physical 
and nutritional intervention programme with social support alone on different QoL domains in community-dwelling 
pre-frail and frail older adults. 
Methods: In this analysis within a RCT (12 weeks), lay volunteers visited one-on-one pre-frail or frail older adults at 
home twice a week. Participants in the physical training and nutritional intervention (PTN) group performed six 
strength exercises and discussed main nutritional issues during each visit. The social support (SOSU) group received 
home visits twice a week for social exchanges. The QoL was assessed with the WHOQOL-BREF and the WHOQOL-OLD 
instruments. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to examine differences between groups with baseline values 
as the covariate. Changes within groups were assessed with paired t-tests. 
Results: Eighty participants (n = 39 in the PTN group and n = 41 in the SOSU group) were included. No significant 
differences were found between the two groups except in past, present and future activities domain [β = 3.66 (95% 
confidence interval 0.13 to 7.18)] in favour of the PTN group. However, there was some evidence of greater within 
group improvements in the PTN group particularly in overall QoL, social relations and social participation. In the SOSU 
group, no significant effect was observed in any QoL domain. 
Conclusion: A combination of a home-based physical and nutritional intervention was not more effective compared 
to social support alone, on QoL in community-dwelling pre-frail and frail older adults. However, the small but significant 
improvement within the PTN group suggests that a home-based physical and nutritional intervention delivered by 
volunteers may influence the QoL in a positive way.

Background 
Frailty is a serious emergent health-related problem in 
older adults [1]. Several studies have shown that func- 
tional disabilities and limitations on independency, caused 
by the frailty syndrome are associated with poor quality of 
life (QoL) [2–4], while others studies have shown that low 
QoL among older adults is linked with various negative 
health outcomes, including falls and nursing home place- 
ment [5]. In this context, numerous studies reflect that a 
broad majority of older people want to remain in their 
own homes as long as possible. Nevertheless, aging in 
place can become difficult if functional ability and the re- 
lated meaningful activities (e.g. take care of the household, 
running daily errands) are no longer possible to be inde- 
pendently performed [6, 7]. Independence and functional 
ability thus plays an important role for maintaining phys- 
ical and psychological health in frail older adults [5]. 
However, it is not only the objective changes in health 
and social structures that are important for the living 
situation in old age, but also the number of social con- 
tacts as well as the quality of social relations, which are 
associated with morbidity and mortality [8]. The higher 
the age, the smaller will the social network be. Especially 
under conditions of frailty, this has unfavourable effects 
on the QoL [9]. Consequently, older adults’ QoL can be 
improved and maintained at a high level, even with poor 
physical health, as long as they are satisfied with other 
dimensions of QoL, such as mental health, social and 
environmental relationships, and socioeconomic status 
[10]. Hence, a broad-ranging evaluation of QoL has be- 
come an essential component of many clinical studies 
across a wide range of patient populations [11]. 
The main objective of exercises for older adults is to 
increase their physical capacity to perform daily activ- 
ities, such as getting out of a chair or climbing stairs and 
with it maintaining functional 
independence and QoL 
[12, 13]. The loss of strength and impaired static and dy- 
namic postural control lead to increased frequency of 
falls, often with serious consequences with the loss of 
autonomy and decreased QoL [14]. The effects which 
can be achieved through resistance training, demonstrate 
the need for muscle training in old age [15]. Apart from 
the degree of frailty, the format and intensity of the exer- 
cise intervention, evidence indicates that physical activity 
and a balanced, healthy diet can improve and maintain 
the QoL in older adults [16–19]. 
Due to the demographic development, were there is a 
growing percentage of homebound frail old people [20] 
and apart from the basic need for at home care, the 
provision of exercise intervention and social support for 
frail older people has become a key concern of Austria’s 
social policy. Additionally, according to the Austrian 
Volunteer Report [21] the largest area of formal volun- 
tary work is in the field of sports and exercise. There is 
already good evidence that volunteering can yield double 
benefits, for the recipient and the volunteer themselves, 
in terms of improved self-esteem, well-being and social 
engagement [22–24]. Our research team recently dem- 
onstrated that a lay-led home-based physical activity and 
nutritional intervention programme can increase hand- 
grip strength, physical performance, nutritional and 
frailty status [25, 26]. To further explore whether such 
an approach can influence QoL, we compared the effects 
of a lay-led home-based physical and nutritional inter- 
vention programme with social support alone on various 
QoL dimensions in community-dwelling pre-frail and 
frail older adults. In addition we also wanted to know 
which factors were associated with improvements in 
several QoL domains. 
Methods 
Study design 
This study was conducted by the Centre for Public Health 
at the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, 
Medical University Vienna, Austria, from September 2013 
to June 2015. The study protocol [27] was registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01991639) and was ap- 
proved by the local ethics committee of the Medical 
University of Vienna (EK No. 627/2011). All study 
participants signed written informed consent for par- 
ticipation. The study methods were in accordance 
with the CONSORT guidelines for reporting rando- 
mised trials [28]. Primary aim of the study was to 
evaluate changes in handgrip strength in a group with 
exercise and nutrition intervention compared to a 
group with social support alone, with results pub- 
lished elsewhere [25]. Quality of life was prospectively 
defined as secondary outcome in this trial, and the 
results are presented in this paper. 
Sample size 
Details of the sample size calculation, based on the pri- 
mary outcome of the study, have been previously pub- 
lished [27]. In terms of power, we assumed there would 
be a dropout rate of 20% (including loss to follow-up). 
In order to observe a clinically important difference of 
2 kg (standard deviation of 3) in handgrip strength be- 
tween the physical training and nutritional intervention 
(PTN) and social support (SOSU) groups at 12 weeks, 
we estimated that a total sample size of 80 persons (40 
in each group) was required for 80% statistical power. 
For this purpose, sex-specific cut-off values (male: 22 kg; 
female: 15 kg) based on the median values of our pre- 
study were used. 
Randomisation 
Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were ran- 
domly assigned to the PTN group or the SOSU group. 


Based on the results of the pre-study [29], the random- 
isation was stratified by using sex-specific handgrip 
strength thresholds (males <22 kg and females <15 kg) 
and was centralized using the “Randomiser for Clinical 
Trials 1.8.1” [30]. 
Participants 
Pre-frail and frail older adults 
The eligibility criteria for recruiting were community- 
dwelling pre-frail or frail persons, according to the 
Frailty Instrument for Primary Care of the Survey of 
Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE-FI) 
[31]. The SHARE-FI instrument consists of five items, 
i.e., “exhaustion”, “loss of appetite”, “weakness”, “slow- 
ness” and “low physical activity”. The ratings of the five 
items are summarized to form a discrete factor score 
(DFS). Hence, patients can be classified as “frail”, “pre- 
frail” and “non-frail”. Additionally, malnourished persons 
(or persons at risk of malnutrition) according to the 
Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form (MNA-SF ≤11 
points) [32] were included. Further inclusion criteria 
were that the participants had to be older than 65 years, 
live in their own homes and had to be able to walk (with 
or without a walking aid). 
Individuals with the following diseases were excluded: 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV, 
impaired cognitive function of ≤17 points according to the 
Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [33], planned ad- 
mission to nursing home, cancer with on-going chemo- or 
radiotherapy, chronic kidney insufficiency with protein 
restriction or dialysis, insulin-treated diabetes mellitus or 
a higher-grade nursing level (more than 180 h of care per 
month is necessary). 
Lay volunteers (buddies) 
In cooperation with “Wiener Hilfswerk”, 
a non- 
governmental provider of social care services, the lay 
volunteers (aka “buddies”) underwent a structured inter- 
view with a psychologist in terms of personal motivation 
and their intention for participation. Further inclusion 
criteria were that the buddies had to be older than 
50 years and willing to conduct two home visits weekly. 
Before the buddies were included in the study, they 
underwent a four-day training course. In the course, the 
buddies learned to perform the different exercises. 
Frailty, important nutritional messages, social interaction 
and safety in the exercises were also discussed and prac- 
tised. The main elements of this programme were inter- 
active role play and simulation exercises in order to 
ensure the lay-person’s confidence, underpinning the 
practical workshops. Moreover, a telephone hotline to 
health professionals, including a physiotherapist and a 
dietician, was established in order to provide an add- 
itional level of safety for the buddies. 
Physical training and nutritional intervention (PTN) group 
Buddies visited the pre-frail or frail participants for 
12 weeks, twice a week, for approximately 1 h. The pre- 
scribed structured intervention programme was based 
on the recommendations of the American College of 
Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association 
[34] and was structured as follows: the training unit 
lasted about 30 min and included a 5-min warm-up 
(mobilisation) and six strength exercises, which were 
performed in two sets, with 12–15 repetitions, until 
muscular exhaustion, on the principle of progressive 
increasing exertion. The strength training included the 
following exercises: mini squats in front of a chair, 
“beetles” exercise for the abdominal muscles, hip exten- 
sion in standing position, reverse butterfly, chest press 
and shoulder press against elastic resistance. The exer- 
cises were designed to stimulate all major muscle 
groups. In addition, the importance of health-enhancing 
physical activity was discussed with the participants. A 
total of eight nutritional messages (such as fluid intake, 
animal and plant protein, energy intake), were discussed 
during each home visit. As an assistive device for the nu- 
tritional topics, buddies and the pre-frail or frail individ- 
uals were provided with a handbook covering all eight 
nutritional themes. In addition, participants were provided 
with the “Healthy for Life Plate”, which is a modification 
of the “Healthy Eating Plate” [35], to show the difference 
between recommended and actual food intake. 
Social support (SOSU) group 
The buddies visited the pre-frail or frail participants 
twice a week for social meetings only. The SOSU group 
served as an active control group. In addition to the so- 
cial contact, ideas for cognitive exercises (e.g. memory 
card, card games or they describe a random objective) 
were provided. However, the participants were allowed 
to spend their time as they wanted to (e.g. talk about 
their life experiences). 
Measures 
All measurements and questionnaires were completed in 
the home environment of the pre-frail or frail older adults 
by the study team. All measurements and questionnaires 
were completed before the intervention session (baseline) 
and after 12 weeks. For the sake of clarity, the following nu- 
tritional and physical covariates as primary outcome, which 
were published previously [25, 26], were added to explain 
the QoL and its changes. The adherence rate was moni- 
tored using diaries kept by the buddies. Any reports of ad- 
verse events associated with the intervention programme 
were also recorded. 
There are two questionnaires frequently used to evaluate 
QoL; the WHOQOL-BREF with four domains (physical, 
psychological, social and environmental aspects of QoL) 


and the WHOQOL-OLD, an add-on module, which is 
used in combination with the WHOQOL-BREF, with six 
domains (sensory abilities; autonomy; past, present and fu- 
ture activities; social participation; death and dying; and 
intimacy) [36, 37]. Thus, these domains have been identi- 
fied as highly relevant for the general elderly population 
and should be taken into account when evaluating their 
QoL [38]. The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item short-form 
rated on a five-point Likert scale, which is calculated ac- 
cording to the standard protocol by multiplying the mean 
of all the items included within the domain by a factor of 
four. In this study, in contrast to the original scoring in- 
structions of the World Health Organization, the social re- 
lationships domain was calculated using two instead of 
three items, because less than 10% of the participants re- 
plied to the question “How satisfied are you with your sex 
life?” The WHOQOL-BREF has a good test reliability, i.e., 
a Cronbach’s alpha score of 0.79 [36]. In addition to the 
WHOQOL-BREF, the WHOQOL-OLD [37] instrument 
was also used, because it specifically evaluates QoL in an 
elderly population. It is also recommended for use in com- 
bination with the WHOQOL-BREF [39]. Each item was 
scored on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sum of 
the domains was transformed into a 0–100 score. 
The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) [40] 
was used to assess physical performance. The SPPB con- 
sists of standing balance tests (side-by-side, semi-tandem 
and tandem stand), a timed 4-m walk and a timed test of 
five repetitions of rising from a chair and sitting down, all 
ranging from 0 points (lowest score) to 4 points (highest 
score). Finally, the physical performance score ranges from 
0 (worst) to 12 (best). Daily physical activities such as 
leisure time, household and work-related activities were 
assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly 
(PASE) [41]. This is a self-reported questionnaire that 
covers a single week. Results can range from 0 to 360, as 
the sum of the amount of time in each activity is multi- 
plied by the weight of the activity. Handgrip strength was 
measured with a Jamar© hydraulic hand dynamometer. 
For each side, three maximum attempts were made and 
the best score was used for the analysis. Nutritional status 
was assessed with the Mini Nutritional Assessment Long- 
Form (MNA®-LF). The MNA®-LF [32] consists of 18 items 
concerning housing, weight 
loss, medicine use, BMI, 
dietary intake and arm and calf circumference. The max- 
imum score is 30 points; 24–30 points indicates that the 
person is normal nourished; 17.5–23.5 points indicates at 
risk of malnutrition; and <17 points indicates malnutri- 
tion. Finally, cognition was measured using the German 
version of the MMSE [33]. 
Statistical analyses 
To describe the sample characteristics, baseline data 
were compared between the PTN group and SOSU 
group, with the use of either unpaired t-tests (for con- 
tinuous measures) or chi-square tests and F-tests (for 
categorical characteristics). Results are expressed as 
means (standard deviation) or frequencies (percentages). 
For all the statistical tests, an intention to treat analysis 
was used (all randomized patients in the groups to which 
they were randomly assigned were included irrespective of 
whether the intervention was completed or not). Missing 
values as shown in Fig. 1 (e.g. lost to follow-up, discontin- 
ued intervention), were imputed with the use of the last 
observation carried forward approach for measurements 
made after baseline. Thus, subjects with baseline data who 
were lost to follow-up were also included in the analyses. 
The last observation carried forward approach has been 
shown to be common elsewhere [42]. 
To assess the differences between groups with regard to 
the WHOQOL-OLD and WHOQOL-BREF domains, an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) [43] was used, with the 
follow-up value as the dependent variable (WHOQOL- 
OLD and WHOQOL-BREF domains), with the group 
(treatment) as the fixed between-subjects factor, and base- 
line WHOQOL-OLD and WHOQOL-BREF scores as a 
covariate, additionally adjusted for age and sex. Paired t- 
tests were used to assess changes within groups pre- to 
post-intervention. 
Further, several multiple linear regression analyses were 
used to estimate the association between changes from 
baseline to follow-up (post-test minus pre-test) in the nu- 
trition and physically related parameters (MNA®-LF score, 
SPPB score, maximum handgrip strength, PASE score), 
group, sex and age with change (post-test minus pre-test) 
in various QoL domains. We used those QoL domains, 
where we found a significant improvement in the PTN 
group (overall QoL, social relationship, social participa- 
tion, past, present and future activities) at follow-up. Thus, 
we undertook a stepwise multiple linear regression ana- 
lysis including all independent variables (MNA®-LF score, 
SPPB score, maximum handgrip strength, PASE score) 
and group, adjusted for sex and age. A value of less than 
<.05 was considered statistically significant. IBM® SPSS® 
Statistics for Windows Version 20 software (IBM Corp., 
Armonk, NY, U.S.) was used for all the statistical analyses. 
Results 
Study population 
As can be seen in Fig. 1, 197 older adults recruited via 
the media and 285 older adults recruited via three hospi- 
tals were included in this study. After exclusion of the 
participants not meeting the inclusion criteria, 80 partic- 
ipants were randomised, whereby 39 subjects were allo- 
cated to the PTN group and 41 to the SOSU group. The 
baseline characteristics of the included participants are 
shown in Table 1. The mean age of the participants was 
82.6 (SD 8.1) years, and 84% were women. One-quarter 



of the participants were ≥90 years old and three-quarters 
lived alone. Between the PTN and SOSU groups, there 
was no significant difference at baseline in any measure. 
Drop-out rate, adherence and adverse events 
According to Fig. 1, 14 persons dropped out, amounting 
to 18% of the baseline population. Five of the 39 partici- 
pants in the PTN group (12.8%) and nine of the 41 partici- 
pants (21.9%) from the SOSU group dropped out in the 
course of this trial. The main cause of discontinuations 
was that the participants in the SOSU group were disap- 
pointed not to be in the PTN group and lack of time. 
There were no significant differences between the PTN 
and SOSU group in respect to frequency (PTN group 
18 ± 4.9 and SOSU group 14 ± 5.2 home visits) and dur- 
ation (PTN group 94 ± 29 min and SOSU group 
82 ± 31 min per home visit). One participant in the inter- 
vention group reported an adverse event (back pain) that 
may have been associated with the exercise program. 
Effects on outcome parameters 
At the end of the 12-week intervention, a significant 
between-group difference (Table 2) in past, present and 
future activities, in favour of the PTN group, was observed. 
No significant differences between groups were found in all 
the other QoL domains. However, a significant between- 
group difference in the physical activity related parameters 
of the SPPB score and PASE score, but not in maximum 
handgrip strength and MNA®-LF score, was observed in 
the PTN group. Although significant within-group changes 
were found over time in overall QoL, social relations and 
social participation, 
the PTN group, no 
in favour of 
between-group changes were found regarding these out- 
comes. In contrast, no significant changes within the SOSU 
group were found in any QoL domain. 
Table 3 shows which changes in baseline variables 
(maximum handgrip strength, SPPB score, PASE score, 
MNA®-LF score) and group were associated with changes 
in several QoL domains (overall QoL, social relationship, 
social participation, past, present and future activities). In 
this regard, changes in maximum handgrip strength and 
physical function were found to be significantly related to 
changes in overall QoL. Changes in maximum handgrip 
strength and positive changes in physical activity were sig- 
nificantly related to changes in social relationship. Further, 
changes in nutritional status and physical activity were 
found to be related to social participation. Finally, changes 
in physical function and participants who were allocated

some evidence of greater within group improvements in

regard in the past, present and future activities domain, 
it can be assumed that the activities undertaken in the 
home visits (e.g., conversations about nutrition, exercise 
and social support), as a result of 
the intervention 
programme, was perceived as positive, and that this 
current status should be upheld in order to live inde- 
pendently at home as long as possible. In this context, 
the study of Salkeld et al. [44] showed that, after a hip 
fracture, 80% of older women stated that they preferred 
death to losing their independence or to possible admis- 
sion to a nursing home. 
Although the physical performance and physical activity 
in our study shows a significant improvement, there were 
no significant changes in the physical health domain. It 
can be expected that an active lifestyle preserves physical 
function in older adults [45], which in turn leads to higher 
levels of QOL scores in domains related to physical health 
[46]. The present study was not able to demonstrate 
greater values in the physical health domain. One possible 
explanation for the unchanged values is that almost 68%

of the participants had at baseline a low performance 
score (less than 6 points), 24% had a moderate score and 
8% had a high score (more than 10 points) in the SPPB. 
Thus, a total score lower than 6 points is considered an 
indication of serious functional limitations in older adults 
[47]. These results imply that the physical health (e.g. pain, 
discomfort, sufficient sleep, rest and good work capacity) 
due to serious functional limitations in this population 
may be responsible for the lack of change. However, as 
evident in our study the SPPB score improved of at least 1 
point. An improvement of one to two points is already 
substantial [48–50]. Thus, this trial is likely to be worth- 
while considering the importance of physical activity in 
homebound older people. 
A further explanation for unchanged value can be 
partly explained by the fact that home visits with social 
support alone had a tendency towards improvement and 
due to the limited statistical power. A study in South 
Korea indicated that social support influences QoL in 
older adults in a positive way [51]. Moreover, a two-year 
longitudinal study showed that social frailty (i.e., living 
alone, lack of social contacts and lack of social support) 
was associated with receiving nursing care and the num- 
ber of contacts with health care professionals [52]. It is 
not surprising that in the qualitative study of Puts et al. 
[53], social contact was identified as the most important 
factor for pre-frail or frail people. In addition, the results 
of Seeman [54] demonstrated an association between in- 
creased levels of social support and reduced risk of phys- 
ical disease, mental 
in 
contrast, older participants who were lacking in social 
relationships and contacts were found to have a higher 
possibility of suffering from loneliness during their daily 
activities [55]. Hence, it is possible that a supportive at- 
mosphere with social exchange, as experienced by the 
SOSU group, might be positively linked to the minor 
changes in the QoL domains. However, surprisingly, the 
SOSU group showed no significant change in any QoL 
domain. One possible explanation for this could be that 
the highly motivated participants recruited through the 
media, who were allocated to the SOSU group, were dis- 
satisfied with the lack of activities or, as can be seen in 
Fig. 1, were disappointed not to be in the PTN group. 

The adherence rate of 75% in our study, which is com- 
parable to similar studies analysed in the meta-analysis 
of Chou et al. [56], was essential to the success of our 
intervention, and likely resulted from the social inter- 
action and the encouragement of the volunteers. In 
addition, the home-based exercises were not connected 
to any adverse events (apart from one person with back 
pain), and appear to be safe. In summary, this highlights 
the importance of the measures being tailored to the re- 
sources of the pre-frail and frail older adults, in order to 
achieve a high level of adherence and, thereby, an effect. 
There is large body of evidence supports the claim that 
physical exercise has a positive impact on heath related 
QoL, even if it is not performed simultaneously to a nu- 
tritional intervention [57, 58]. As presented in Table 3, 
changes in nutritional status were found to be related to 
changes in social participation. In this respect, the study 
of Kwon et al., [59] who demonstrated that an exercise 
programme alone did not result in a significant change 
in health-related QoL when compared to a combined 
exercise and nutritional intervention programme. How- 
ever, interestingly we found a negative association be- 
tween change in nutritional status and change in the 
past, present and future activities domain when adjusted 
for sex and age, which is difficult to interpret. 
Finally, in the context of the linkage between older lay 
volunteers and pre-frail or frail older adults, Puts et al. 
[53] stated that, for non-frail people, health plays a central 
role for a good QoL, and that the importance of helping 
others, as well as social activity, is also beneficial for a 
good QoL. Considering that many health professionals 
have limited time resources [60] to deliver exercise inter- 
ventions during a routine home visit, social interchange is 
understandably not always possible. Thus, this kind of 
association can yield double benefits. On the one hand, 
the health status of both the pre-frail and frail subjects 
and the older lay volunteers can improve, due to the active 
engagement with nutritious food and physical training 
and, in particular, through the health education. However, 
the improvement in the health status of the volunteers still 
needs to be examined. While using senior volunteers in 
health promotion has many benefits [61] (e.g. cost effect- 
ive, feeling useful and self-fulfilled, be part of a commu- 
nity, reduced symptoms of depression) there are also 
some disadvantages. For instance, the burden on volun- 
teers in respect to training and service delivery can be 
overwhelming, and due to disability and illness, which are 
more prevalent in older age groups, the dropout rate can 
be high [62]. However, the pairing between lay volunteers 
and frail older adults can work well, provided that lay vol- 
unteers are well trained to ensure that they do not operate 
outside their sphere of competence. 
The mayor strength of this study is the implementation 
of the lay-led home-based programme, which adds new 
information to the knowledge about the effectiveness of 
nutritional education, social support and physical training 
delivered by lay volunteers. Such “buddy system” could be 
used as a resource in terms of reaching frail older adults 
who are bound to their own homes. 
Study limitations 
The study does have some limitations. Firstly, there was 
no inactive control group. Since nonspecific input factors 
such as social support can improve QoL [63], it is difficult 
to attribute the changes to the specifics of the home-based 


programme. However, the aim of this randomised con- 
trolled trial was to examine if the approach is feasible, and 
whether additional nutritional and physical training inter- 
vention is more effective than social support alone. Sec- 
ondly, a large proportion of the study participants (95%) 
were enrolled via the media due to the lack of success in 
the hospital environment. It cannot be ruled out that a 
sample of well-motivated participants and only those in- 
terested participated in the study. Thus, the participants 
were largely self-selected. Therefore, this might not only 
limit the generalizability of the findings, but also result in 
failure to target those who may most need and benefit 
from such an intervention. Thirdly, the sample size of 80 
subjects, which is of small to medium scope, is a major 
limitation of the study, especially for the sub-group ana- 
lyses and the more complex statistical procedures. How- 
ever, the sample size was calculated based on the data of 
the pre-study [29]. Finally, blinding of participants and 
researchers was not possible, due to the nature of the 
exercise-based intervention. Thus, the possibility of obser- 
ver bias must be taken into account. 
Conclusion 
The linking of lay volunteers with frail older adults in a 
structured programme with physical training and nutri- 
tional intervention was not effective compared to social 
support on several QoL domains in community-dwelling 
pre-frail and frail older adults. However, the small but sig- 
nificant improvement within the PTN group suggests that 
a home-based physical and nutritional intervention deliv- 
ered by volunteers may influence the QoL in a positive way.
