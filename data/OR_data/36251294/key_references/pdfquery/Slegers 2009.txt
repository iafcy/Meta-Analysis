ABSTRACT. Background and aims: According to the 
concepts of ‘use it or lose it’ and cognitive reserve, 
cognitively challenging activities may boost cognitive abil- 
ities in older adults. Using computers and the internet 
provides divergent cognitive challenges to older per- 
sons, and the positive effects of computers and internet 
use on the quality of life have been found in earlier stud- 
ies. Methods: We investigated whether prolonged guid- 
ed computer use by healthy older adults (64-75) may be 
beneficial to cognitive ability in a randomized con- 
trolled study. The intervention consisted of brief train- 
ing and subsequent use of a personal computer with an 
internet connection at home for a 12-month period. 191 
participants were randomly assigned to three groups: In-

INTRODUCTION 
Most cognitive abilities tend to decline with age (1). For

numeric and verbal abilities. An important question, how- 
ever, is whether this decline in many cognitive abilities is 
reversible when potential causative factors are manipu- 
lated. Several studies have suggested that engagement in 
cognitively challenging activities is associated with main- 
tenance or even improvement of cognitive skills and 
seems to protect against age-related cognitive decline. For 
instance, Hultsch et al. (3) found a positive relationship be- 
tween changes in participation in intellectually engaging 
activities and changes in cognitive functioning in middle-

aged 75 and older, who engaged more often in activities 
such as reading and playing games, demonstrated a low- 
er risk of developing dementia (5). In other studies, more 
general measures of activity, such as participation in ev- 
eryday mental, social or physical activities, were found to 
be associated with protection from cognitive decline 
(e.g., 6, 7). These studies all suggest that intellectual and 
cognitively challenging activities are related to the preser- 
vation of cognitive capacity.

Results such as those described above suggest that 
cognitive functioning can be improved by promoting the 
participation of older persons in cognitively challenging ac- 
tivities. This idea is in line with Swaab’s ‘use it or lose it’ 
principle (8), which is based on neurobiological findings in 
animals that the use of neurons and neuronal networks 
prolongs the efficiency of central nervous system (CNS) ac- 
tivity during life. According to Swaab, candidate factors to

stimulate the CNS may originate from within the organ- 
ism, but also from the environment. When the notion of 
‘use it or lose it’ is translated to a functional level, this 
would imply that mental stimulation can counteract the re- 
duced efficiency of higher brain functions that come with 
age. This has actually been found in several animal stud- 
ies in which enriched or challenging environments proved 
to be beneficial to cognitive functioning in aged laboratory 
animals (e.g., 9, 10). Such findings are not only consistent 
with the ‘use it or lose it’ notion, but also to the concept 
of cognitive reserve, which assumes that individuals with 
more elaborate cognitive strategies are better protected 
against symptom onset following brain damage (11). 
Several examples of interventions that specifically tar- 
get cognitive capacities of older adults have been de- 
scribed in the literature. Such studies involved memory 
training (e.g., 12, 13) or mnemonic techniques (14, 15), 
all of which had positive effects on memory performance 
to a variable extent. Apart from memory, other cognitive 
abilities, such as reasoning, spatial orientation and speed 
of processing (15, 16) have been taught successfully and 
shown to improve in older adults.

The studies cited above suggest that cognitive functions 
in older adults can be improved with specific, dedicated in- 
terventions. However, in order to function independent- 
ly in everyday life, multiple cognitive functions are drawn 
rawrawnn 
upon. For instance, a daily activity such as grocery shop-

memory (which items to buy), information processing

The use of the internet may qualify as a candidate ac- 
tivity in a multifactorial intervention. It provides an intel- 

l 
lectually challenging activity which is intrinsically re- 
warding, because internet-based services may have par- 
ticular benefits for older persons (e.g., 17, 18). In order to 
use internet services such as web surfing or e-mail, many 
of the cognitive abilities that are drawn upon for everyday 
functioning are recruited. Therefore, through the internet, 
one may use the same cognitive functions that are re- 
quired to execute everyday tasks (such as memory for re- 
membering errands, attention to focus on a particular task, 
etc.). In terms of “use it or lose it”, by using cognitive func- 
tions during computer and internet use, deterioration of 
cognitive functions that are essential to everyday tasks due 
to age-related decline may be prevented. For instance, 
long-term or procedural memory is required to repro- 
duce the routines needed to use a computer program, e.g., 
to launch a web browser, and to execute specific com- 
mands in that browser. Short-term memory, or working 

memory, is activated to keep track of information al- 
ready attended or to decide on the next action to take. Ex- 
ecutive functions come into play in order to sort necessary 
actions into the correct order. Visual search, information 
processing and attentional processes are recruited in order 
to find relevant cues, to evaluate which information on a 
web page is relevant within a given context, and to focus 
on those cues while ignoring or inhibiting irrelevant cues. 
Furthermore, Stronge et al. (19) mention the importance 
of problem-solving ability and concept formation, which is 
essential for building a mental framework of computer-re- 
lated knowledge representations. Spatial orientation is 
also considered an important ability for web surfing, in or- 
der to keep track of one’s location in cyberspace (20).

Very few attempts have actually been made to study 
the impact of computer and internet use on the cognitive 
abilities of older adults. Several broader studies show 
that psychosocial measures, such as self-confidence,

puter service for six months. This service consisted of e-

p 
mail, access to a digital encyclopedia, bulletin boards, 
maia l,, accccesses 
m 
games, and other educational and recreational applica- 
gaamem 
g 
tions. Comparable results were found in a subsequent 
study, in which 29 nursing home residents aged 50 and 
older were divided into a computer training group and a 
control group (matched in terms of ability to take care of 
daily needs, cognitive functioning and depression level) 
(22). Participants in the training group used the same on- 
line computer service as had been used in the previous 
study, and those in the control group participated in 
regular nursing home recreational and educational activ- 
ities. After six months of using the computer service, 
participants in the computer training group had im- 
proved in MMSE, ADL and depression scores, whereas 
the control group remained unchanged. In sum, circum- 
stantial evidence indicates that learning to use a computer 
and the internet in later life may have beneficial effects on 
the cognitive ability of older individuals. However, a 
number of factors may affect the results of internet- 
based intervention studies such as described above. For in- 
stance, as participation in such an intervention is on a vol- 
untary basis, selection bias may have occurred, i.e., the 
fact that individuals are interested in information tech- 
nology may affect the outcome variables of the study 
for example, as a result of differences in motivation with 
respect to task performance. There may also have been 
an effect of computer training apart from the actual sub- 
sequent period of computer use. Therefore, one should 
account for both the effect of initial computer training and 
participants’ interest in learning to use these facilities in or- 
der to be able to study exclusively the effect of using 
computers and the internet for a period of time. To 
date, systematic studies on this topic are not available. 
Because many of the above-mentioned cognitive abil- 
ities needed to use the internet decline with advancing age 
(for an extensive overview, see ref. 1) and as information 
technologies are often unfamiliar to older adults, it is to be 
expected that using the internet provides a cognitive 
challenge to older people. We hypothesize that engaging 
in such a cognitively challenging activity will stimulate old- 
er adults to develop more efficient cognitive skills and (al- 
ternate) strategies for daily life task requirements. If 
proven successful, this study may support the notion 
that age-related cognitive decline can be counteracted by 
aspecific mobilization of cognitive resources. 
We conducted a randomized controlled intervention 
study to test the above-mentioned hypothesis. A large 
group of participants with interest in computer usage 
was recruited from the general population and randomly 
assigned to three conditions in which a cognitive challenge 
(an intervention consisting of computer and internet use

METHODS 

S 
Participants 
For the present study, we aimed at recruiting 240 par- 
ticipants in four separate groups. Invitation flyers were 
randomly sent to older adults from the Maastricht city 
register. Participants were included in the study if they 
were aged between 64 and 75, considered themselves to be 
healthy, and were sufficiently mobile to travel indepen- 
dently to the research center. Exclusion criteria were prior 
experience with any of the neuropsychological tests used in 
this study and general mental functioning in a range sug- 
gesting possible cognitive disorder (score below 24 on the 
MMSE) (23). Also, participants were to have no prior active 
computer experience and be willing to refrain from com- 
puter use or computer lessons for the duration of this 
study (i.e., twelve months). Both participants with and 
without interest in learning to use computers and the in- 
ternet were asked to respond to the flyer by returning an ap- 

plication card for more detailed information. On this card 
they could indicate by ticking one of two options whether 
they were interested in learning to use the internet or not 
(but were willing to participate). All participants signed a 
form stating that they would refrain from any self-initiated 
computer use during the study, and signed an informed con- 
sent form. The Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht Uni- 
versity Hospital approved the study. 
It was decided that exposure to the intervention was to 
be compared with three control groups. Two groups 
consisted of individuals with interest in learning to use the 
internet, as was the case with individuals in the inter- 
vention group. One of these two groups received the 
same training as those in the intervention group. The oth- 
er group was not trained in computer or internet skills. 
These two control groups made it possible to control for 
training effects. The third control group consisted of in- 
dividuals without any interest in computers or internet use, 

but who were willing to participate in the study. Partici- 

pants who were interested were randomly assigned to the

were scheduled for two baseline administrations of a cog- 
nitive test battery. This dual baseline administration (with 
ninititivvee 
one to two weeks in between) was applied to minimize pro- 
cedural learning of the tests during the intervention period. 
Cognitive data from the first baseline measurement were 
discarded. One hundred and twenty-six people (34.4%) 
were excluded from the study because of: computer ex- 
perience, n=54; health-related problems, n=14; experience 
with tests from the test battery, n=11; they were not will- 
ing to refrain from computer use during the study, n=4; no 
cable TV connection at home (required for the internet con- 
nection) or lack of space for a personal computer, n=2; or 
no specific reason, n=41. After the first baseline adminis- 
tration, four participants dropped out of the study due to 
health problems, being ‘too busy’, put off by the test pro- 
cedure, or a score of below 24 on the MMSE. The test bat- 
tery was administered again after four and twelve months, 
with parallel test versions. A questionnaire was also ad- 
ministered on all three test occasions. 
Initial recruitment did not yield sufficient participants for 
the control group, so again an invitation was sent to 
585 new people from the municipal registry to recruit on- 
ly additional participants who were not interested in 
computers and the internet. After these two recruitment 
procedures, the number of participants in the control 



Participants who were interested in learning to use 
computers and the internet (n=191) were randomly as- 
signed to one of two conditions: two-thirds of the par- 
ticipants (n=123, 64.4%) received brief training; and 
one-third (n=68, 35.6%) did not receive this training 
and were assigned to the No training/No intervention 
Group. 
Participants in the training condition were scheduled for 
three four-hour training sessions over a period of two 
weeks. In these sessions, a maximum of six participants 
were introduced to and could practice with, a personal 
computer (Apple) and its operating system, customary 
software applications (e.g., a word processor), and several 
internet applications (e.g., an internet browser and e-mail). 
The training sessions were supervised by two teachers with 
high levels of proficiency in internet applications, the 
system software, and providing technical support. Each 
teacher hosted one specific session for each training 
group (either focusing on the computer operating system 
and software skills or on internet applications). The 
teachers alternately supervised the final practice session. 
Participants received general information and were in- 
structed on how to perform basic computer and internet 
assignments from a custom-made course book. Ample 
time was available at each meeting to practise with several 

everal

ing/No intervention Group. No data were collected with 
respect to training activities. 
After training, individuals in the Intervention Group re- 
ceived a personal computer with a broadband internet 
connection in their homes. They were instructed to use it 
according to their personal needs. These needs were 
not specified or assessed. In training, participants re- 
ceived demonstrations of several purposes for which the 
internet could be used (e.g., e-mail contact with family and 
friends, finding hobby-related information, finding open- 
ing hours, public transport time schedules, phone num- 
bers, etc.). Internet-related assignments (once every two 
weeks in the first four months; once every month in the 
remaining period of the study) and a helpdesk were 
used to motivate participants and to stimulate computer 
use. Table 1 shows the 16 assignments participants re- 
ceived by e-mail. They were asked to respond to them by 
replying to the e-mail. These assignments were thus 
useful in monitoring the progress of participants with re- 
spect to their computer abilities. When no response

Nineteen participants (8.1%) dropped out before the 4- 
month follow-up, and six participants (2.5%) were not 
available for the 4-month follow-up measurements (one 
participant was absent for a long time; one did not like the 
tests and questionnaires, one was disappointed by the ran- 
domization result; one was too worried about personal 
memory performance; one could not be reached; and one 
gave no reason). Another thirteen participants (6.0%) 
dropped out before the 12-month follow-up measure- 
ments. Participants gave various reasons for dropping out 
[time constraints (n=7), health problems (n=5), disap- 
pointed about randomization (n=5), partner’s health 
problems (n=2), partner died (n=2), bought/received

(n=1), computer training was too much (n=1), and other 
reasons (n=3)]. 
Thus, baseline tests were administered to 236 partic- 
ipants and complete follow-up data were available for 204 
participants. A few participants did not complete all 
questionnaires, which resulted in Cognitive Failure Ques-

(VVLT) (27) was used to measure verbal memory and 

learning. In this test, 15 monosyllabic low-associative 
words are presented one after another on a computer 
screen. After the presentation, participants are asked to re- 
call as many words as possible without any time or order 
constraint (immediate recall). This procedure was repeat- 
ed five times with the same list of words. Twenty minutes 
after the recall of the fifth trial, participants are again 
asked to recall as many words as possible (delayed recall). 
The score in the first trial of the immediate recall, 
sum of the scores in the first three trials and delayed re- 
call scores were used in this study. In addition, the dif- 
ference between the maximum scores in any of the five 
trials and the scores in the first trial was used as an indi- 
cation of verbal learning capacity. 
Psychomotor speed. To measure psychomotor speed, 
the Motor Choice Reaction Time test (MCRT) (28) was 
added. This test is administered with a six-button panel,

containing one red button and five white buttons, laid out 
in a semicircle around the red button. Participants were 
asked to hold down the red button with the index finger 
of the preferred hand as long as no white button was lit. 
As soon as one of the white buttons lit up, participants 
were to release the red button and then press the lit 
button (or a button adjacent to it) as quickly as possible. Af- 
ter this, the red button had to be held down again. The 
MCRT involved three conditions. In the first (simple re- 
action time), only the upper white button was lit. In the 
second condition (choice reaction time), one of the three 
upper buttons was lit. In the third condition (incompatible 
choice reaction time), one of the three upper buttons was 
lit, but the button immediately to the right of the lit button 
was to be pressed. Two variables were of interest for the

purposes of this study. First, the difference between the 
median response times of the second and first conditions 
was used as an indication of response selection. Sec- 
ondly, a measure of inhibition of a prepotent response 
(29) was provided by the difference between the third and 
second conditions. 
General cognitive speed. The Letter-Digit Substitu- 
tion Test (LDST) (30) was used to measure the speed of 
processing general information. This test is a modification 
of the Symbol-Digits Modalities Test (31). A code is pro- 
vided at the top of a sheet of paper that couples the num- 
bers 1 to 9 with random letters. Participants were asked 
to fill in on the rest of the sheet as many corresponding 
numbers as possible in boxes that contained only letters 
in 90 seconds.

Cognitive flexibility. The Concept Shifting Test (CST) 
(32) was used to measure cognitive flexibility. This test 
consists of three sheets of paper with 16 small circles that 
are grouped within a larger circle. On the first sheet, num- 
bers appear in the small circles in a fixed random order. 
Participants are asked to cross out these numbers in the 
right order as fast as possible. Instructions for the second 
sheet were identical to those for the first, except that now 
letters appear in the circles. On the third sheet, partici- 
pants had to alternate between numbers and letters. The 
time needed to complete each of the sheets was record- 
cordcord--

ed. The mean of the scores for the first and second 
peed aandnd thethe difdi -f

aloud as fast as possible. On the second card, colored

of each of the patches as fast as possible. On the third 
card, color names are printed in incongruously colored 
ink. Participants have to name the color of the ink the 
words were printed in as fast as possible. The time need- 
ed to complete each of the cards was recorded. Two vari- 
ables were computed: the mean of the scores for the first 
two cards as an indication of simple speed, and the dif- 
ference between the score for the third card and the 
mean of the scores for the first and second cards (inter- 
ference score) was used as a measure of the capacity to in- 
hibit a habitual response (reading the word), which reflects 
selective attention. 
Cognitive failures. The Cognitive Failure Question- 
naire (CFQ) (34) was included to measure subjective cog- 


nitive functioning. It has been validated and adapted for 
the use in a Dutch population (35). This questionnaire 
consists of 25 items that measure the frequency of failures 
within several cognitive domains (e.g., attention, memo- 
ry and planning) rated on a five-point scale. The sum of 
the scores for these items was used as the dependent vari- 
able, a higher score indicating more cognitive failures. 
Measures of computer use. To measure the actual 
involvement of individuals in the Intervention Group in 
computer-related activities at both the 4-month and 12- 
month follow-up moments, participants were asked to in- 
dicate how many hours per week they had used the 
computer and the internet. These questions were asked 
retrospectively at the end of the follow-up tests. That is, 
participants were not asked to keep a continuous record 
of their computer use because this might have intruded 
with their experience of normal computer use. We chose 
to rely on self-report data instead of logging participants’ 
pa 
computer use for two reasons. First, without asking par-

(age, sex, education and income as a measure of socio- 
economic status) in order to study differences between the 
four groups. General Linear Model (GLM) with repeated 
measures analysis of variance was used to study the effect 
of the intervention. Analyses were conducted with group 
as between-subject variable (four levels: Intervention, 
Training/No intervention, No training/No intervention, 
Control Group) and time as a within-subject variable 
(three levels: second baseline, 4-month follow-up, and 12- 
month follow-up). Contrasts were defined to compare 
changes in performance over time (between the three 
measurements) of the four groups. Age, level of education, 
sex, and monthly income were used as covariates. We 
were especially interested in the interaction of time and 
group, as this interaction shows whether the groups dif- 
fered from one another with respect to changes in the de- 
pendent variables, for example, as a result of the inter- 
vention. The data of participants who completed all 
measurements of the particular test were included in the 
analyses. Therefore, the number of complete cases is not 
exactly identical for all measures. All analyses were re- 
peated with only the individuals in the Intervention Group, 
to account for the extent of computer use. In these anal- 
yses, the between-subject variable ‘extent of computer use’ 

had two levels: light and heavy. This variable was calcu- 
lated by a median split method on the number of hours 
per week participants said they used their computers at 
the 12-month follow-up. In this case, the median was 7.5 
hours, so that participants who reported using their com- 
puters 7 hours per week or less were labeled ‘light users’ 
and those who reported using them 8 hours per week or 
more were ‘heavy users’. All variables included in the anal- 
yses were first checked for normal distributions, missing 
values and outliers. Distributions were considered suitable

for the analyses. All analyses were carried out with and 
without extreme values and also with replacement of 
extreme values by the highest value in the normal range. 
All statistical analyses were performed with p=0.05 as sig- 
nificance level. 
RESULTS 
Baseline comparisons 
At baseline, the four groups did not differ with respect 
to age, sex, level of education, monthly income or MMSE 
score. When participants who were interested in the in- 
tervention were compared with participants who were not 
interested, differences were found with respect to the 
MMSE scores (F(1,231)=4.321, p=0.04) and the CFQ 
(F(1,226)=4.118, p=0.04): interested participants had 
lower MMSE scores but reported fewer cognitive fail- 
ures. These differences were not found in analyses in 
which participants who dropped out had been removed 
from the sample. 
Baseline comparisons of participants who dropped 
out of the study at some point with participants who 
completed all test administrations showed differences in 
level of education (F(1,229)=4.129, p=0.04) and the 
MMSE score (F(1,234)=4.097, p=0.04) Participants 
who dropped out had lower levels of education and a low- 
er MMSE score.

Effects of intervention 
Table 2 gives an overview of the main effects of group 
on the three measurements and of the interaction between 
group and time. The main effects of group were found for 
the summed score on the first three trials of the VVLT, 
the flexibility score of the CST, and the simple speed mea- 
sure of the SCWT. Pairwise comparisons revealed that 
participants in the Intervention Group showed higher 
total scores in the VVLT (p<0.01) over time than those in 
the Training/No intervention Group. Also, participants in 
the Intervention Group showed better flexibility scores in 
the CST compared with the Training/No intervention 
Group (p<0.01). Lastly, participants in the Training/No 
intervention Group were faster in terms of the simple 
speed measure of the SCWT compared with the Inter- 

vention (p<0.01), the No training/No intervention 
(p<0.01) and Control Groups (p=0.01). A group x time 
interaction was only found for the verbal learning variable 
of the VVLT (F(6,178)=2.196, p=0.04). Post-hoc anal- 
yses showed that both Training Groups showed an in- 
crease in the verbal learning variable from baseline to 4- 
month follow-up measurements, whereas neither No 
training Groups showed a decrease (see Fig. 2). The dif- 
ference between the Intervention and the No training/No 
intervention Groups was significant (p=0.04). No statis- 
tically significant main effects of group or significant 
group x time interactions were found on any of the oth- 
er cognitive measures, nor on the CFQ. 
Repeating all analyses with exclusion or replacement of 
extreme values did yield comparable results. Also, all 
analyses were repeated with only baseline measurements 
and 12-month follow-up measurements, as six participants 
were not available for the 4-month follow-up (and there- 
fore not included in the original analyses). These analyses 

again yielded comparable results.

As regards the extent to which participants in the In- 
whichh parparticipticipantsants inin theth In 
tervention Group used their computers, a significant dif- 
ference between light and heavy use at baseline was on- 

ly found for the interference variable of the SCWT 


(F(1,50)=4.607, p=0.04). Participants who used their 
(F((1,1,500))=4.=4.660707,, pp=0.04) 
computers 8 hours or more per week had lower inter- 
coompmpututererss 88 hour 
c 
ference scores than participants who used their com- 
ferfe encnce sco 
puters less often. Repeated-measures analyses revealed 
put 
main effects of extent of computer use on the first trial of 

the VVLT (F(1,41)=10.125, p<0.01), summed score 
he VVVLTLT ((FF((1,1,41)41) 
on the first three trials of the VVLT (F(1,41)=7.578,

learning capacity score of the VVLT 
(F(1,41)=5.425, p=0.03) and interference score on the 
SCWT (F(1,40)=6.617, p=0.01). Participants who used 
their computers more often remembered more words 
on the first trial and on the summed score of the first three 
trials of the VVLT, and needed less time to inhibit a ha- 
bitual response in the SCWT. Instead, participants who 
used their computers less often showed higher verbal 
learning capacity in the VVLT. In other words, the dif- 
ference between the maximum number of immediately re- 
called words and the number of recalled words in the first 
trial of this group was higher than this difference in the 
group of heavy computer users in the Intervention Group. 
An interaction effect between the extent of computer 
use and time was found for the summed scores of the first 
three trials of the VVLT (F(2,46)=3.533, p=0.03), show- 
ing that, in the first four months of the intervention, the 
summed score of heavy computer users decreased, where- 
as that of light users increased (p=0.02). The same was 
found for the delayed recall score in the VVLT 
(F(2,46)=4.885, p=0.01). Here, the difference in change 
between light and heavy users was significant, both be- 
tween the 4-month follow-up and baseline measurements 
(p=0.02) and also for the period between the 12-month 

computers 8 hours or more per week had better scores 
in trial one of the VVLT, summed score of the VVLT, 
and interference score of the SCWT. In other words, par- 
ticipants with better verbal memory and better capacities 
to inhibit a habitual response (which is an attentional pro- 
cess) used their computers more extensively. Instead, par- 
ticipants who used their computers less than 8 hours per 
week showed better verbal 
learning scores. This was 
probably a result of the fact that these participants re- 
membered fewer words in the first trial of the VVLT and 
could thus improve more in the following trials, compared 
with heavy computer users. These results suggest that 
there is a relationship between computer use and cog- 
nitive abilities in older adults. However, as the differences 
between light and heavy computer users did not change 
over time, the intervention did not have an impact on 
these cognitive abilities. Rather, it seems that older 
adults with better cognitive abilities tend to use a com- 

puter more extensively. This relationship between com- 
puter use and cognitive abilities was also reflected in the

Besides the theoretical background of ‘use it or lose it’ 
BeBessides th 
and cognitive reserve, our hypothesis was based on earli- 
and 
er studies targeting cognitive functions in older adults, 
which showed that these functions improve as a result of 
which sshhowed 
training or intervention (12, 15, 16, 36). One major dif- 
trtraaininging oror inti 
ference between these studies and our study which may 
feferrenen 
have caused differences in findings concerns method- 
ological issues. Many studies on cognitive training or in- 
terventions have methodological limitations, such as ab- 
sence of control groups, small sample sizes and thus low 
power, or flaws in the design or psychometric instru- 
ments (37). We tried to overcome these flaws by using a 
large sample size and a randomized design. Such a design 
has major advantages. For example, by including three 
control groups, it was possible to study not just the effect 
of the intervention. We were also, at least theoretically, able 
to distinguish this effect from the effects of training and of 
participants’ interest in computers and the internet. It is 
possible that individuals who enrolled for the intervention 
differ from those who were not interested in the inter- 
vention with respect to uncontrolled characteristics that 
may also have had an effect on the outcome of this study 
(e.g., eagerness to learn, need for social contacts). Our de- 
sign made it possible to conclude that finding no effect of 
the intervention was unrelated to potential confounders 
such as computer training or interest. Also, because of our 
design, we were able to control for the social attention to 
which the participants of intervention studies are ex- 
posed. Since social interactions during training sessions

DISCUSSION 

D 
Thquestion addressed in this study was whether 
e main 
e 
an intervention for older adults - in which learning to use 

a personal computer and several internet services followed 
by the subsequent use of these applications for one year 
- has an impact on our measures of cognitive abilities. No 
effect of intervention was found on almost all these mea- 
sures. A difference in change over time between the 
groups was actually found on only one cognitive measure, 
i.e., the learning variable of the VVLT. However, this in- 
teraction effect between group and time was quite random 
and did not appear to be caused by the intervention. 
There were also some main effects of group membership 
over time but, since no interactions with time were 
found, these effects cannot be attributed to the inter- 
vention. 
We did find some interaction effects when the Inter- 
vention group was split into light and heavy computer 
users. Again, these effects appeared to be quite random 
and could not be attributed to the extent of computer use. 
The main effects of group (light vs heavy computer 
users) over time indicated that participants who used their

may have had an effect that is not related to the actual in- 
tervention, we included a control group that received the 
same training as the Intervention Group. 
Our findings do not differ only from findings in studies 
targeting specific cognitive functions. There are also a few 
earlier studies showing that computer-based interven- 
tions similar to ours to some extent did yield positive ef- 
fects on several psychosocial (17, 18, 21, 22, 38, 39) and 
cognitive measures (21, 22). 
There are a number of differences between our study 
and the limited number of studies that found effects of an 
intervention on cognitive ability measures. The first ma- 
jor difference is the study population. Both of the above- 
mentioned studies included residents of care facilities, 
i.e., not older adults living independently, whereas the par- 
ticipants in the present study were. It may be that our 
community-dwelling participants had less to gain from the 
intervention. Since similar interventions do yield im- 
provements of the cognitive abilities of care facility resi- 
dents, it is possible that individuals who have functional 
limitations may improve as a result of learning to use com- 
puters and the internet. Older adults with such limitations, 
that is, individuals with a reduction in reserves and an in- 
creasing number of losses amongst others within the 
cognitive domain, may have more potential to improve 
with respect to these losses. For instance, older adults with 
withwith

memory deficits may improve more as a result of training

A second major difference between our study and 
fferen ee betwbetw 
earlier studies using computer-based interventions con- 
cerns the measures of cognitive ability. Both of the 
above-mentioned studies (21, 22) used a rather general 
measure of cognitive ability, the MMSE. In our study, 
more specific measures of cognitive functions that tend to 
decline with age were included. Because of this, we were 
able to study the impact of our intervention on many more 
aspects of cognitive functioning compared with the gen- 
eral measures used in previous research. Not only did 
these objective measures of cognitive abilities not change 
as a result of the intervention used in this study, but we did 
not find any effect of intervention on reported cognitive 
failures, which is a more subjective measure of cognitive 
functioning. 
Apart from the advantages of the design and method- 
ology described above, there are also some limitations to 
this study. One explanation for the lack of an effect of our 
intervention on cognitive ability is that the intervention did 
not challenge the cognitive capacity of our participants suf- 

ficiently. This explanation seems less plausible though. The 
participants in this intervention study had no prior ex- 
perience with using computers and the internet. Ac- 
cording to the literature and the self-reports of our par- 
ticipants, older adults experience quite some difficulty 
in mastering computer skills and using computers and soft- 
ware applications. They are slower, make more errors, 
and need more steps to reach their goals than individuals 
who are younger (e.g., 40). Thus, learning to use com- 
puters and the internet requires considerable cognitive ef- 
fort from older adults. Another reason why it is not very 
plausible to assume that our intervention did not change 
the level of cognitive activity of the participants is the fact 
that the participants in the Intervention Group used their 
computers quite frequently, with an average of more 
than 8 hours per week at the end of the intervention pe- 
riod. Also, they were encouraged to use the internet by 
regular e-mail assignments of increasing difficulty through- 
out the study period. Overall, we do not believe that the 
intervention was insufficient in providing a true cognitive 
vidingg aa trtrueue cogniognititiv 
challenge for participants.

Also, based on the present study, we are able to con- 
clude that using computer and the internet has no effect

on the measures of cognitive functioning used in this 
study. However, we cannot rule out that such an inter-

Lastly, despite a very strict study design, we were not 
able to account for some aspects that might have influ- 
enced results. For instance, we cannot rule out the pos- 
sibility that the follow-up period of our study was too short 
to detect differential changes in cognitive measures over 
time. A period of one year may be insufficient to detect 
differences in aging patterns, although it does seem to be 
long enough to detect differential improvement, as sup- 
ported by other cognitive intervention studies with similar 
or shorter follow-up durations (e.g., 12, 15, 16, 36). 
Another related issue which we are not able to resolve 
here, but which may be very relevant for the independent 
functioning of older adults, is that older individuals who 
have learned to use a computer and the internet have bet- 
ter strategies to cope with (cognitive) limitations they 
may encounter in later life. As personal computers and the 
internet have several promising functions in this respect 
(e.g., providing reminders for people with memory prob- 
lems, easy contact with health care providers, ordering 
groceries for people with mobility restrictions, providing 
day schedules, including reminders, for people with de- 
clined executive functions, etc.), it is perfectly possible that 
older adults who master computer skills have more op- 
portunities to compensate for future age-related limita- 
tions. Future studies could address this issue in more de- 
tail, although this type of research is sometimes not very 
feasible because of problems such as high expenses and 
attrition. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We did not find any influence of learning to use com- 
puters and the internet on a broad range of cognitive abil- 
ity measures in a healthy group of independently living 
older adults with no prior computer experience. The re- 
sults of this study do not support the notion that stimu- 
lating the cognitive skills of older community-dwelling 
adults actually increases their cognitive abilities. How- 
ever, the question whether persons with more evident cog- 
nitive impairments have more to gain from such inter- 
ventions, if they are able to master the routines that are 
necessary for successful computer use, remains unre- 
solved. Lastly, another question that remains interest- 
ing for future research is whether older adults who have 
received timely training in using computers and internet 
services remain independent longer when functional lim- 
itations start to emerge.
