people in their last year of life? A 
pragmatic randomised wait-list trial in 
palliative care (ELSA)

Background: Clinical care alone at the end of life is unlikely to meet all needs. Volunteers are a key resource, 
acceptable to patients, but there is no evidence on care outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether 
support from a social action volunteer service is better than usual care at improving quality of life for adults in 
the last year of life. 
Methods: A pragmatic, multi-centre wait-list controlled trial, with participants randomly allocated to receive the 
volunteer support intervention either immediately or after a 4 week wait. Trained volunteers provided tailored 
face-to-face support including befriending, practical support and signposting to services, primarily provided 
within the home, typically for 2–3 hours per week. The primary outcome was rate of change of quality of life at 
4 weeks (WHO QOL BREF, a general, culturally sensitive measure). Secondary outcomes included rate of change 
of quality of life at 8 weeks and Loneliness (De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale), social support (mMOS-SS), and 
reported use of health and social care services at 4 and 8 weeks. 
Results: In total, 196 adults (61% (n = 109) female; mean age 72 years) were included in the study. No significant 
difference was found in main or secondary outcomes at 4 weeks. Rate of change of quality of life showed trends 
in favour of the intervention (physical quality of life domain: b = 3.98, CI, –0.38 to 8.34; psychological domain: b = 
2.59, CI, –2.24 to 7.43; environmental domain: b = 3, CI, –4.13 to 4.91). Adjusted analyses to control for hours of 
volunteer input found significantly less decrease in physical quality of life in the intervention group (slope (b) 4. 
43, CI, 0.10 to 8.76). While the intervention also favoured the rate of change of emotional (b = –0.08; CI, –0.52 to 0. 
35) and social loneliness (b = –0.20; CI, –0.58 to 0.18), social support (b = 0.13; CI, –0.13 to 0.39), and reported use 
of health and social care professionals (b = 0.16; CI, –0.22 to 0.55), these were not statistically significant. No 
adverse events were reported. 
Conclusions: Clinicians can confidently refer to volunteer services at the end of life. Future research should focus 
on ‘dose’ to maximise likely impact. 
Trial registration: The trial was prospectively registered. ISRCTN Registry: ISRCTN12929812, registered 20 May 2015.

Background 
In 2013, over half a million people died in England and 
Wales, mostly from long-term conditions such as cancer 
(29%) and circulatory (28%) and respiratory (15%) dis- 
eases that are known to be life limiting [1]. For deaths 
that can be anticipated, providing excellent care at the 
end-of-life that is responsive to need is critically import- 
ant. Compassionate support in the last year of life can- 
not be the responsibility of health and social care 
professionals alone and requires a public health response 
involving the wider community [2, 3], recognising the 
importance of social networks and social capital [4]. 
Proponents of these approaches argue that a primary 
focus on biomedical and physical aspects of end-of-life 
care ignores the social context within which dying takes 
place. Social relationships and networks can buffer the 
effects of crisis associated with dying, provide a frame- 
work that may prevent family carer burn out, and dem- 
onstrate the importance of supporting social contexts 
[5–7]. Effective personal network support can substi- 
tute for formal care and reduce health service utilisa- 
tion costs [8]. 
Individual and community networks and relations of 
support can, however, be inadequate to meet care needs 
[5]. Demographic changes such as increased female em- 
ployment, delayed childbearing, geographical mobility, 
divorce rates, and longer working lives all potentially im- 
pact on the availability of traditional family support. So- 
isolation on itself also has a major influence on 
cial 
health, comparable with well-established risk factors for 
mortality [9]. 
To supplement both clinical and community care 
many services are using volunteers as a critical part of 
the multi-disciplinary care offered at the end of life 
[10, 11]. Volunteers are important to care, and indeed 
42% of the adult population volunteer formally [12], 
with an estimated 3 million in health and social care 
[13] and 125,000 within hospices [14]. The Department 
of Health commitment to end-of-life care specifically 
recognises that such care is not simply ‘medical issues 
with medical solutions’, and pledges to developing the 
work of end-of-life care volunteer networks [15]. 
It is known that people are happy with volunteer sup- 
port at the end of life [16–20], but there is little evi- 
dence of their effect on care outcomes. Evaluation in 
well-designed comparative studies is therefore recom- 
mended [11]. This is particularly apt in palliative and 
end-of-life care, where the effectiveness of many inter- 
ventions are not evaluated using robust designs; this is 
potentially wasteful of resources and could lead to 
poorer or unintended outcomes. This is the first rando- 
mised trial of volunteer delivered support services at 
the end of life to evaluate the effectiveness of such 
interventions. 
Methods 
Design 
This study was a pragmatic, randomised, prospective 
open wait-list trial. The protocol for the study is pub- 
lished [21]. The trial used a wait-list design to ran- 
domly allocate participants on a 1:1 basis to receive the 
intervention either immediately or after a 4 week wait 
[22–24]. A wait-list approach, where consented partici- 
pants are allocated to either receive an intervention im- 
mediately or after a defined period on a waiting list 
during which they receive usual care is regarded as 
more ethically defensible in end-of-life care, and allows 
a valid comparison between the experimental and con- 
trol arms at the time when the delayed intervention 
starts [23–27]. 
Participants and setting 
Participants in the trial include people anticipated to 
be in their last year of life and their self-identified in- 
formal carer. Very low numbers of carers were re- 
insufficient data to report.

individual. They should be able to answer ‘no’ to 
the ‘surprise question’: ‘Would you be surprised if

2. Those who only understand or speak a language in 
which our main outcome measure (the World 
Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Scale 
(WHOQOL-BREF)) is unavailable. 

Setting 
Eleven English providers of end-of-life home care 
services (nine hospices, one alcohol and substance 
use charity, one NHS Trust), funded to provide the 
intervention through competitive tender with the UK 
Cabinet Office. The intervention was provided in 
community settings, primarily in participant’s own 
homes. 
Intervention 
Volunteers provided face-to-face individual support to 
people anticipated to be in their last year of 
life. 
Volunteer-provided services are a mode of support 



hypothesised to be distinctive from, but supplementary 
to, usual forms of health and social care, with an ef- 
fect on domains of quality of life, loneliness and so- 
services had 
In this pragmatic trial 
cial 
flexibility to deliver the intervention in a locally re- 
sponsive manner within agreed parameters. Key ele- 
ments of the volunteer-provided support intervention 
include its delivery by trained volunteers who were 
matched to individuals by a volunteer co-ordinator, 
and provided care tailored to the needs of the indi- 
vidual but offered from a suite of options including 
befriending, practical support and signposting, which 
could differ at each visit. Volunteer support was typ- 
ically provided face-to-face, one-to-one, in the home, 
but telephone contact and meeting outside the home 
were possible. Most contacts were befriending visits 
in the home. The frequency and length of contact 
was individually determined according to negotiated 
participant preference and service availability, but was 
typically a visit once a week for 1–3 hours. The ser- 
vice could continue as required after the study, but 
study participants were followed up for 8 weeks post 
intervention commencement. Volunteers could be any 
age (18+), sex or ethnicity, and all received basic 
training on boundaries, communication skills and or- 
ganisational policies according to the requirements of 
the organisation providing the intervention at each 
site. Data captured the type, length and frequency of 
each contact between participant and volunteer. 


Objectives 
The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the effect- 
iveness of receiving care from a social action volunteer 
befriending service plus usual care at 4 weeks at improv- 
life compared to usual care alone for 
ing quality of 
adults in the last year of life.

perception of social support for adults at 4 and 
8 weeks.

and available in many languages [28]. Data are 
reported across the physical, psychological, 
environment and social relationship domains which 
were considered likely to be important outcomes for 
this intervention. Cronbach’s Alpha (α) (Physical 
0.714, Psychological 0.776, Environment 0.712, 
Social Relationships 0.461). The low Cronbach’s 
Alpha for social relationships reflects that this is a 
3-item subscale, with an item which had many 
missing values in this study.

Study Social Support Survey (mMOS-SS), a short 
validated scale covering two domains (emotional (α

modifiable social support deficits [30]. 


The primary outcome was rate of change of quality of 
life at 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the rate of 
change of quality of life at 8 weeks, and loneliness, social 
support and reported use of health and social care ser- 
vices at 4 and 8 weeks. A short time period was chosen 
for the primary outcome as any end-of-life care inter- 
vention needs to work rapidly to be worthwhile. No data 
were available to predetermine intervention length, but 
follow-up for 8 weeks facilitates understanding of any 
persistence of effect. 
Socio-demographic data (age, sex, disease diagnosis, 
education, marital status, living status, spirituality and 
ethnicity) in the form of a self-completed question- 
naire was collected from both patients and informal 
carers at baseline. At baseline and subsequent time 
points, patient participants were asked to indicate the 
number, type and frequency of contact they have with 
networks of others. 
The schedule of data collection is presented in Table 1. 
Time periods were necessarily short to reflect the pos- 
sible prognosis of participants. 
Sample size 
Trial power was estimated using a worst case scenario 
assuming 5% attrition at primary outcome measure. 
With 350 or more participants per arm power exceeded 




0.80 to detect difference in change over time corre- 
sponding to an effect size of f = 0.10 between the inter- 
vention and wait-list groups. This power model uses 
alpha = 0.05, two tailed, and uses a conservative correl- 
ation of r = 0.6 for scores lagged 4 weeks, and r = 0.5 for 
12 weeks. 
Randomisation and study procedures 
Participants were those referred to participating services 
following eligibility, information and informed consent 
procedures. Baseline data were collected and partici- 
pants randomly allocated (1:1 allocation ratio) to either 
the intervention or the wait-list arm of the trial. Site 


coordinators contacted a randomisation line at Lancaster 
University, and the next sequence in the allocation 
(stored in sequentially numbered sealed opaque enve- 
lopes) was revealed. The randomisation sequence was 
computer generated, with rebalance in the arms after 
10 randomisations. Blinding of site staff and patient 
participants was not possible due to the nature of the 
intervention. Data collected at 4, 8 and 12 weeks 
were coordinated by the research team and sent by 
post 
self- 
completion. Data were returned directly to the re- 
search team. 




Statistical analysis 
All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22. 
The primary outcome was rate of change of quality 
of life at 4 weeks (WHOQOL-BREF). Basic explora- 
t and χ2 
tory and descriptive statistical 
tests) were conducted at the α = 0.05 individual 
level 
of significance. Confidence intervals were reported at 
the 95% level. Hierarchical Linear Models 
(HLM) 
used the full 
intention-to-treat sample over all avail- 
able assessments with the aim of differentiating treat- 
trajectories. The HLMs 
ment effects from natural 
compared primary and secondary outcome scores (e.g. 
WHOQOL-BREF) between the immediate and wait- 
list groups. A piecewise model was specified to index 
change from baseline to week 4 (Phase 1), and change 
from week 4 to week 12 (Phase 2). Restricted max- 
imum likelihood estimation was used, 
and fixed 
slopes and random effects of each time predictor 
were assessed to determine the most appropriate 
model. Final models were specified with intercepts as 
random effects to account for correlations among ob- 
servations at different time points from the same par- 
ticipant. Treatment condition, time and interactions 
between treatment condition × time were specified as 
fixed effects. 
With the interaction term, we tested whether there 
was a significant difference in rate of change between 
treatment groups before and after week 4. Secondary 
analyses were conducted by testing the same HLMs 
described with treatment completers. In the immedi- 
ate arm, 
treatment completers were those who re- 
ceived any intervention before 4 weeks, and who 
returned baseline and week 4 data. In the wait-list 
arm, treatment completers were those who did not 
receive any intervention before the return of week 4 
data. Finally, sensitivity analyses on primary outcomes 
were conducted to consider of the amount of volun- 
teer 
input people received in the initial 4-week 
period. Models were therefore specified using hours 
of input and controlling for site. 
Results 
Recruitment and flow through trial 
Figure 1 outlines the flow of participants in the trial. Re- 
cruitment took place from June 2015 to January 2016, 
with data collection to March 2016. Of 329 eligible 
people approached to participate, 196 consented. Rea- 
sons for the 133 not participating included not wishing 
to receive the service (n = 46), they died or moved away 
(n = 38), or they did not wish to take part in research 
(n = 30). One participant died between consent proce- 
dures and randomisation, thus 195 were randomised, 
100 to receive the intervention immediately and 95 to 
the wait-list control group. At each time point, missing 
data were noted, but participants continued to be en- 
rolled in the study unless advised otherwise, as data sets 
could be and often were returned at subsequent time 
points. Around 40% of those in the immediate arm re- 
ceived no volunteer intervention before week 4 assess- 
ment due to lack of volunteer availability and matching, 
and some in the wait-list arm received the intervention 
at or after 4 weeks, but prior to completing their week 
4 assessment. Few carers (n = 33) entered the study and 
hence their data are not given here. A total of 20% of 
enrolled participants (39 of 196) died during the study. 
Baseline characteristics 
Participants were recruited from all 11 sites (range 3–40 
participants per site). Participant mean age was 72 
(range 37–92), and 60% were female. No significant dif- 
ferences on demographic aspects between randomised 
groups were observed (Table 2). No adverse events were 
reported. 
Primary outcome 
The greater estimated difference in slopes between treat- 
ment conditions was 3.98 points on the WHOQOL- 
BREF Physical subscale at week 4 (95% CI, –0.38 to 
0.34). While this difference was not statistically signifi- 
cant, a clear trend was observed, showing that those in 
the immediate group did not deteriorate at the same rate 
as those in the wait-list group (b = 0.84, 95% CI, –2.24 to 
3.92 vs. b = –3.14, 95% CI, –6.23 to –0.05) (Table 3). 
Furthermore, after the wait-list group received the inter- 
vention following week 4, it was observed that the differ- 
ence in rate of change between groups over the follow- 
up period was reduced from 3.98 to 1.12 (95% CI, –2.93 
to 5.19), mainly explained by a reduction in the rate of 
deterioration previously observed in the wait-list group 
(from –3.14 to –0.15; 95% CI, –2.22 to 1.92). Estimated 
means are presented in Table 4.

served in the wait-list group when WHOQOL-BREF

fore not reported. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to take into ac- 
count the amount of volunteer input people received 
(“number of hours of contact”) in the initial 4-week 
period. After controlling for site, the estimated differ- 
ence in slopes between treatment conditions was 4.43 
points on the WHOQOL-BREF Physical subscale at 
week 4 (95% CI, 0.10 to 8.76). This significant differ- 
ence reflects that those in the immediate group did not 
deteriorate at the same rate as those in the wait-list 
group (Cohen d effect size = 0.27) (Table 5, Fig. 2). In 
terms of trajectories over the follow-up period, the 
pattern described above was replicated, where a reduc- 
tion in the deterioration of WHOQOL-BREF subscales 
in the wait-list group between Phase 1 and 2 were 
observed. 
Secondary outcomes 
Loneliness (De Jong Gierveld Scale [29]), social support 
(mMOS-SS [30]), and contacts with health and social 
care professionals were assessed as outcomes, where 
treatment effect was evaluated testing the interaction be- 
tween treatment and time. No significant differences be- 
tween treatment groups were found (Table 6).

Discussion 
This study found no statistically significant difference in 
effectiveness between volunteer provided support and 
treatment as usual in people anticipated to be in their 
last year of life. We saw that the rate of reduction of 
quality of life, loneliness and perceived social support 
was less steep in the intervention group, but this did not 
reach statistical significance. When we controlled for the 
amount of volunteer support that people received we 
found that there was a statistically significant difference 
on the physical domain of quality of life, but not in other 
domains. There was a pattern of deteriorating levels of 
quality of life in the wait-list group, a decrease not ob- 
served in the immediate group, and which tends to dis- 
appear when all receive the intervention. Trends in the 
data are in favour of the intervention, but the effect is 
small, and related to reducing the rate of decline rather 
than improving outcomes. 
Strengths and limitations of the study 
This is the first reported trial of volunteer support at 
the end of life, and provides important information on 
the outcomes of these commonly provided services, ef- 
fect size and study parameters. Its particular strength is 
its pragmatic design, particularly as the intervention de- 
sign and participants reflect the ways these services are 
provided and used in clinical practice rather than artifi- 
cially constraining or limiting the way the intervention 
was provided. 

Limitations include study power, blinding, missing 
data, attrition and intervention fidelity. Fewer service re- 
ferrals were received than sites expected, although re- 
cruitment was steady over the trial period, and required 
numbers would have been reached with a longer recruit- 
ment period. The recruitment period was constrained by 
governance and contractual delays and time limited 
funding, which also meant alternate designs such as 
stepped-wedge would not be feasible [31, 32]. Our 
planned effect size was small, and the effectiveness of 
volunteer services remain unknown because of these is- 
sues with study power, and questions about choice of 
outcome measures. The WHOQOL-BREF was specific- 
ally chosen for its wide usage, relevance and cultural ap- 
propriateness 
there were issues with 
completion of the short social subscale. It may be that 
end of life specific quality of life scales could be appro- 
priate and well completed [36, 37], but these were not 
chosen because many are disease specific, focus more on 
physical symptoms, flag serious illness in a way which 
may not be appropriate, and are not available in the 
same range of languages as the chosen measure. The 
lack of blinding could be viewed as a limitation, but it 
was not practical to blind patients, volunteers or site 
staff to treatment allocation. The amount of missing data 
and attrition were as expected for a study with partici- 
pants at the end of life [38], and robust arrangements 
were in place for data cleaning and error checking (error 
rate 0.56%). Whilst the intervention was flexible and 
data were collected on its provision, not all participants 
received the intervention as planned. Whilst per proto- 
col analyses revealed no difference to intention-to-treat 
analyses, greater fidelity in a powered trial may be

Comparisons with other studies 
No other trial of the outcomes of volunteer-provided 
support at the end of life has been conducted, although 
other trials are underway of volunteers building end-of- 
life networks [39] or supporting people with advanced 
dementia [40]. Previous studies of volunteer-provided 
services in the last year of life have been descriptive, ad- 
dressing issues such as patient and volunteer experience, 
acceptability, facilitators and barriers [10, 11, 16, 17, 19, 
41–43]. These studies have shown that volunteer pro- 
vided services are seen as complementary to clinical ser- 
vices, and their intuitive appeal means that services are 
currently recommended and increasingly commonly

Clinical services are known to be less accessed by 
those who are older, with non-malignant conditions, 
from ethnic minority communities or who are socio- 
economically disadvantaged [44–49]. Those accessing 
this volunteer provided service were less likely to have 
cancer than clinical service norms [49], and volunteer 
services may therefore be an access point to clinical 
end-of-life care services, although they did not facilitate 
access for those who were from black and minority eth- 
nic communities. 
Study participants had worse baseline scores for qual- 
ity of life and loneliness when compared to studies of 
the general population or those with early stage disease 
[50–52], and comparable to those with similar disease 
stages or using clinical end of life care services [53, 54]. 
Together with data on deaths during the study, it is clear 
that those accessing a volunteer provided service are not 
restricted to those who are considered relatively well. 
Implications of the study for clinicians and policymakers 
Clinicians often deliver palliative care within and across 
generalist and specialist multi-disciplinary teams, al- 
though referrals between providers can appear sparse or 
inequitable [44, 55, 56]. This research shows that doctors 
and other clinicians can confidently refer people in their 
last year of life to volunteer services for support which 
complements the clinical care offered. Clinicians should 
consider referring patients in the last year of life who 
have high social needs, and potentially those who live 
alone. They can expect that these services may slow a 
person’s decline in quality of life. 
Policymakers should continue to promote the involve- 
ment of volunteers in end-of-life care. The most recent 
commitment from the UK government on end-of-life 
care emphasises community and voluntary involvement 
[15], building on the recognition of volunteers within 
the end-of-life care strategy [57], and the present

research supports this policy direction. Policymakers 
should pay attention to making evidence-based recom- 
mendations about the amount of volunteer support pro- 
vided, as a dose effect is possible. 
Research should take account of our finding that the 
impact is in reducing rate of decline, and rate of change 
should be considered as an important outcome measure 
in palliative and end-of-life care research. 
Future research 
Further work is needed to further interrogate the effect 
of these interventions in powered trials, especially in de- 
termining key patient or service characteristics, and their 
interrelationship with services focusing on clinical needs. 
Important service characteristics that should be studied 
include the role of the volunteer as a direct supporter or 
in mobilising networks of support [39, 58], in the fre- 
quency and amount of support provided, and the type of 
person supported. Further work to determine the out- 
come measures best used to assess volunteer interven- 
tions is also recommended. 
Conclusions 
More hours or increased frequency of contact with a 
volunteer has a statistically significant effect on the rate 
of decline of physical quality of life at the end of life. 
Other measured outcomes of the volunteer provided 
support showed no statistically significant benefit over 
usual care, although a trend in favour of the intervention 
can be seen. This may have been due to the study being 
underpowered. This is the first trial of volunteer pro- 
vided support in the last year of life and provides an 
emergent answer to questions of whether volunteer sup- 
port should be used at the end of life; however, future
