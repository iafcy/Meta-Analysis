In order to improve older people’s well-being and quality 
of life, tackling the issues of social isolation and loneliness 
is recognised in an international policy (WHO, 2002). 
Absence of social isolation and loneliness may be seen as a 
desirable state that older people wish to maintain. Social 
integration and participation of older adults in society are 
seen as indicators of productive ageing, and alleviation of 
loneliness forms a part of policies aimed at achieving the 
goal of ‘successful’ ageing (de Jong Gierveld, 1998). 

in a person’s social relationships. It is a subjective experience, 
and not synonymous with objective social isolation. The expe- 
rience of loneliness is unpleasant and distressing (Peplau & 
Perlman, 1982). In addition, loneliness signifies a discrepancy 
between one’s desired and achieved levels of social contact 
(Perlman, 1987). The experience of loneliness is distinct from 
social isolation. Although some studies have tried to distin- 
guish these concepts, the results have been contradictory. On 
the one hand, loneliness has been associated with scarce 
contacts with close persons (Bondevik & Skogstad, 1998; 
Prince et al, 1998; Savikko et al, 2005), and on the other 
hand, it has not been associated with visits by children or 
friends (Dugan & Kivett, 1994; Fees et al, 1999). However, 
living alone is connected with loneliness (de Jong Gierveld & 
van Tilburg, 1999; Samuelsson et al, 1998; Yeh & Lo, 2004).

Most estimates suggest that a majority (two thirds) of 
older people are not lonely (Andersson, 1998; Wenger & 
Burholt, 2004; Victor et al, 2005), but a high proportion of 
older people suffer from loneliness in Finland. More than a 
third of older people (65+) have been found to suffer from 
loneliness, of whom five per cent report feeling this way 
often or always (Savikko et al, 2005). Feelings of loneliness 
increase with age (Andersson, 1998; Victor et al, 2000), 
especially among people aged 75 or older (Samuelsson et al, 
1998; Tijhuis et al, 1999). The increase in loneliness is not 
explained by age itself, but rather there is a complex web of 
underlying factors involving changes and losses in health 
(Wenger & Burholt, 2004; Victor et al, 2005), functional 
capacity (Andersson, 1998; Savikko et al, 2005; Wenger & 
Burholt, 2004) and social networks (Jylhä, 2004; Tiikkainen 
& Heikinnen, 2005; Wenger & Burholt, 2004). In addition, 
loneliness is associated with depression (Adams et al, 2004; 
Alpass & Neville, 2003; Prince et al, 1997), either as a cause 
or as a consequence. Loneliness contributes to increased use 
of health services (Ellaway et al, 1999), early institutional- 
isation (Russell et al, 1997; Tijhuis et al, 1999; Tilvis et al, 
2000) and impaired survival (Penninx et al, 1997). 

designed to alleviate and prevent social isolation and 
loneliness (Cattan et al, 2005), it was found that group 
interventions were effective when they involved some form 
of educational or training input and social activities targeted 
to specific groups of older people. Although there are a 
wide range of services and activities intended to alleviate 
and prevent social isolation and loneliness among older 
people, many of them do not meet the actual needs of older 
people (Cattan et al, 2003). 
Rehabilitation may be beneficial both by alleviating 
loneliness and by reducing some of the adverse effects of 
loneliness (Donaldson & Watson, 1996). First, during a 
rehabilitation programme, it is possible to develop a 
supportive network among the participants. Second, the 
rehabilitation professionals can strengthen the existing 
support systems of the participants by increasing their 
contacts with friends, neighbours and family, thereby 
affecting social loneliness. Third, the professionals may 
instruct the participants about how to gain access to the 
resources or organisations available to them. 
In Finland, the municipalities are responsible for 
providing social and health services, including rehabilitation 
of the elderly. Rehabilitation is carried out partly by rehabil- 
itation centres, which are independent of the general health 
care system. While rehabilitation after acute incidents is 
carried out in hospitals, the rehabilitation centres mainly 
serve individuals with chronic conditions. Since 1977, 
rehabilitation has been provided systematically for World 
War II veterans. At the same time, publicly funded rehabil- 
itation centres were founded across the country. Since 2000, 
a rehabilitation programme designed to support community- 
dwelling frail older people’s independent living has been in 
place. The programme is based on networking of private 
in-patient rehabilitation centres, the local offices of the 
Social Insurance Institution of Finland (SII) and the munici- 
pal social and health service providers. In order to explore 
the effectiveness of this new network-based model, a national 
randomised controlled multicentre research project, the AGE 
study, was initiated in 2002 (Hinkka et al, 2006). 

the effect on loneliness of group rehabilitation of frail 
older people. The primary objective of the present report 
was to assess whether a network-based rehabilitation 
programme has an effect on emotional loneliness among 
community-dwelling older people at high risk of long-term 
institutional care. 

The Ethical Committees of the Social Insurance Institution 
of Finland and the Turku University Hospital approved the 
study protocols. The participants were informed in person, 
and they gave their written informed consent. 

The trial was implemented in seven independent rehabilitation 
centres and 41 municipalities around Finland. All the 
municipalities and rehabilitation centres involved had pre- 
vious experience of the group rehabilitation model. The 
participants were recruited through a two-phase standard- 
ised selection process between January and October 2002 
(Figure 1, overleaf) (Hinkka et al, 2006). Representatives 
of the local social and health services in the municipalities 
made the preliminary selection according to written guide- 
lines. Thereafter, the rehabilitation centre concerned and 
the local SII office jointly assessed the selected individuals’ 
suitability for rehabilitation. 
The goal was to recruit a representative sample of frail 
older persons aged over 65 years who, at enrolment, were 
living at home but faced a risk of institutionalisation within 
the next two years owing to their progressively decreasing 
functional capacity. As an indication of frailty, they had to 
meet the criteria of eligibility for the SII care allowance for 
pensioners (Kela, 2004). This benefit is granted to pensioners 
with a medical disability verified by a physician, and a 
verified need of assistance. The benefit is independent of

the individual’s other income. For this study, the exclusion 
criteria were: 


(cid:132) acute or aggressively progressing diseases such as 
some cancers or heart diseases that would prevent 
participation in the group rehabilitation 


The outcome, on which the power calculations were 
mainly based, was living independently at home after the 
five-year follow-up. The important difference estimated 
between the intervention and control group was 10% 
(50% to 40%, respectively). A type I error of 0.05 and 
power of 80% were used in calculations, resulting in a 
sample size of 305 in both groups. Based on these calcu- 
lations, 44 rehabilitation groups were included. In order 
to ascertain the fulfilment of every intervention group, a 
substitute group was also created. If a person in the 
intervention group refused to participate in the rehabili- 
tation, he or she was replaced by a substitute. The 
intention was to find 18 persons per rehabilitation group 
to be randomised to the intervention (n = 8), control (n = 8) 
or substitute (n = 2) group. 
Altogether 741 older persons were recruited. After the 
baseline measurements, they were randomly allocated by 
the blinded examiners to the intervention (n = 332), control 
(n = 317) and substitute (n = 92) groups. The randomisation 
was based on numbered and sealed envelopes stratified by 
gender, using a computer random number generator. Each 



F EE AA TT UU RR EE 
F 
municipality had its own envelopes containing, in random 
order, an allocation to one of the three groups. Of the subjects 
in the intervention group, 33 dropped out and were replaced 
by substitutes. An additional 12 substitutes filled up the 
rehabilitation groups, while the rest of the substitutes were 
integrated into the control group. The final study group 
consisted of 343 people in the intervention group and 365 
in the control group. The drop-outs did not differ from the 
intervention group (Hinkka et al, 2006). 

The subjects in the intervention group participated in 
geriatric rehabilitation. The controls continued their 
normal life. The rehabilitation programme, which had 
been in use since 2000, was based on networking 
between the rehabilitation centres, the SII local offices, 
and the municipal social and health service providers 
(Hinkka et al, 2006; Ollonqvist et al, 2007). Since Finland 
is a sparsely populated country and the rehabilitation 
centres are often located far from the centres of the 
municipalities, an in-patient rehabilitation model was 
selected in preference to an outpatient rehabilitation 
model. The eight participants in each rehabilitation group 
came from the same municipality, and the groups kept 
together throughout the programme. 
The rehabilitation consisted of three separate in-patient 
periods (Figure 1) at a rehabilitation centre within eight 
months. The evaluation and follow-up periods were 
individually orientated. The key members of the rehabili- 
tation team (physician, physiotherapist, social worker, 
occupational therapist) met personally with the participants. 
In addition, these periods included group activities, most 
often physical activities (Ollonqvist et al, 2007). The actual 
rehabilitation period was based on group activities. Again, 
the main part of the group activities focused on physical 
activation such as exercises in a sitting position, pool 
exercises or resistance training in the gym. The participants 
also attended group discussions and lectures given by 
members of the rehabilitation team. The topics covered 
older people’s life situation and possible problems, 
promotion of self-care, psychological counselling, discussions 
on medical aspects, information on social services and 
recreational activities. Individual counselling was provided 
when indicated. Usually the individual encounters involved 
physical therapy (Ollonqvist et al, 2007). The total time 
used for group activity varied from 20 to 56 hours, and 
individual counselling from four to 19 hours during the 
three in-patient rehabilitation periods, depending on the 
rehabilitation centre. 

Baseline measurements between February and November 
2002 and the subsequent 12-month follow-up measurements 
(Figure 1) were carried out in the participants’ home 
municipalities by three blinded independent examiners, 
who were qualified physiotherapists, specially trained to 
perform the measurements, and who had no role in the 
intervention (Hinkka et al, 2006). 
The examiners checked a pre-mailed questionnaire and 
completed it together with the participant when needed. 
Living arrangements and type of dwelling were asked 
about. Loneliness was measured with three indicators. 
First, loneliness was assessed with the question ‘Do you 
feel yourself lonely?’ (0 = never, 1 = seldom, 2 = sometimes, 
3 = often, 4 = always). Loneliness was categorised into two 
groups: 1 (lonely) = those who suffered from loneliness 
sometimes, often or always, and 2 (not lonely) = those who 
suffered from loneliness seldom or never. This question 
type has been used in population-based studies and has 
good predictive validity (Pitkälä et al, 2004; Routasalo et 
al, 2006; Tilvis et al, 2000). The second and third measures 
were derived from a multiple-choice question ‘Does one of 
the following cause you insecurity?’. (Answer ‘yes’ to 
alternatives: loneliness, fear of being left alone). Participants’ 
social network was assessed by asking the number of their 
relatives and friends, and their satisfaction with their 
engagement with their children. 

of the Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS-15 (Sheikh & 
Yesavage, 1986; Yesavage et al, 1983), with a scale from 0 
to 15 expressing the severity of the symptoms of depression; 
the higher the score, the more severe the depression. A 
questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale was applied to 
enquire about the participants’ subjective health. Functional 
ability was assessed by asking about ability to move outdoors, 
using a three-point scale (1 = no difficulties, 2 = difficulties 
to perform, 3 = need of help). 

Baseline characteristics and associations were compared 
between the groups using the t-test and the χ2 test. In 
longitudinal studies, the repeated measurements of the same 
subject are correlated, and in order to take this into account, 
the generalised estimating equation (GEE) technique was 
applied in the analysis. Liang and Zeger (1986) introduced 
the GEE as a comprehensive and robust method of dealing 
with correlations when analysing data with generalised linear 
models. Using the SAS Institute’s GENMOD procedure 


F EE AA TT UU RR EE 
F 
(1993), it is possible to fit models to correlated data by the 
GEE method, and to apply different types of working 
correlation structures in calculations (Liang & Zeger, 
1986; Lipsitz et al, 1994). The changes in loneliness, 
satisfaction with seeing children, number of friends, 
subjective health, depressive mood and ability to move out- 
doors were expressed with rate ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). CIs that do not include unity are statistically 
significant when P < 0.05. Intragroup and intergroup mean 
changes and 95% CIs of the numerical outcome variables 
were analysed using the general linear mixed model 
with analysis of variance for repeated measures (MIXED 
procedure). 
In order to find variables that might explain the change 
in loneliness, the associations between changes in loneliness 
and changes in satisfaction with seeing children, number of 
friends, subjective health, depressive mood and ability to 
move outdoors were also studied. For the analysis, the 
subjects were divided into three groups according to the 
change in the variable in question: increased, no change 
and decreased. The associations were analysed using the χ2 
test or the Mantel-Haenszel χ2 test. All statistical analyses 
were performed using the SAS for Windows package (SAS 
Institute). P-values below 0.05 were taken as evidence of 
statistical significance. 


Baseline characteristics of the study groups are summarised 
in Table 1, below. The mean age of all participants was 78 
years (range 65–96 years); the majority of them were female 
(86%) and lived alone (72%). One third of the participants 
(28%) were feeling lonely. Participants had close relationships 
and frequent contacts with the members of their social 
network. The differences between the intervention and 
control groups were insignificant at baseline. A positive 
association with the three indicators of loneliness was 
found. In addition, loneliness was positively associated 
with satisfaction with seeing children, depressive mood 
and subjective health (Table 2, below). 

At follow-up, no statistically significant change was observed 
in loneliness (Table 3, opposite). However, a 0.9-fold decrease 
was observed in the rate of participants feeling lonely in 
the intervention group, and a 1.1-fold increase in the 
control group. In addition, the rate of participants reporting

loneliness or fear of being left alone as a source of insecurity 
was elevated in both study groups, but to a higher degree 
in the control group. During the follow-up, the number of 
friends decreased in both groups, while poor subjective 
health and depressive mood became more prevalent in the 
control group. 
Next, the associations of the change in loneliness were 
compared with changes in satisfaction with seeing children, 
number of friends, subjective health, depressive mood and 
ability to move outdoors. The change in loneliness was 
also analysed in the different age groups (Table 4, below).

satisfaction in engagement with children in both groups. 
Furthermore, the change in loneliness was associated with 
the change in subjective health in the intervention group. 

The aim of this study was to describe the effect of an in- 
patient group rehabilitation intervention on emotional 
loneliness among frail older people. Although the rehabili- 
tation programme was physically orientated, a decrease in 
feelings of loneliness was observed. The decrease was still 
visible two to three months after the programme had been 
completed. Physical activity interventions have been shown 
to reduce feelings of loneliness in older people, but these 
improvements were reversed following the programme 
termination (McAuley et al, 2000). This suggests that it is 
not the exercise programme itself but rather the environment 
that provides social resources to buffer feelings of loneliness. 
However, in our study there was an association between 
improved subjective health and reduced feelings of 
loneliness in the intervention group, suggesting that the 
programme was effective. Loneliness has been reported 
to be a symptom of health problems (Victor et al, 2000; 
Victor et al, 2005). 
The programme under study was implemented in groups 
whose members came from the same municipality. Besides 
the organised programme, the participants had the opportunity 
to spend time with other group members, for example during 
meals and in the evenings. The programme brought together 
older people in a way that enabled them to discover what 
they had in common. Unfortunately, it is not possible to 
conclude from our data whether the participants were actually 
able to make friends with each other. In a previous controlled 
study, loneliness among elderly women was reduced after 
participating in a programme that helped them to develop 
new friendships (Stevens & van Tilburg, 2000). 
In our study, the number of friends decreased during 
the follow-up, but this was not associated with any change 
in loneliness. One explanation is offered by the selectivity 
theory (Carstensen, 1992), which suggests that older 
people actively narrow down their social interaction to the 
most meaningful contacts. If this is really the case, the 
question could be raised of whether or not it is even possible 
to establish a deeper, meaningful relationship during the 
few weeks of shared rehabilitation. It has also been shown 
that when people’s social contacts decrease, the need to be 
engaged with others is also reduced (Perlman, 1988). 
In contrast, the change in feelings of loneliness was 
associated with a change in satisfaction with seeing one’s 
children. Consequently, this study confirms the findings of 
some previous studies suggesting that the unmet expectations 
of social relationships are important predictors of loneliness 
(Mullins & Dugan, 1990; Perlman, 2004; Routasalo et al, 
2006). However, it does not support the previous finding 
that older parents’ expectations of their children did not 
predict loneliness (Long & Martin, 2000). 
The level of loneliness was defined by asking the par- 
ticipants directly whether they felt lonely. It has been shown 
earlier that, although older people with deficiencies in their 
relationships describe feelings and actions closely associated 
with loneliness, they do not always admit that they are lonely. 
In addition, older people are reluctant to admit to being 
lonely because of the stigma of social failure; to be alone 
and to feel lonely is to have failed in the eyes of society and 
oneself (Cattan et al, 2003). Consequently, use of explicit 
questions in which the term ‘loneliness’ is mentioned, in 
investigating loneliness, may result in under-reporting (de 
Jong Gierveld, 1998). In order to avoid this effect, loneliness 
in our study was measured with multiple questions. 

and a few refused to participate in the study. As has been 
noted before (Andersson, 1985; Cattan et al, 2005; Stevens, 
2001), we may wonder whether or not the truly lonely 
older people were reached at all, or whether they were the 
ones who refused to participate. In addition, the study sample 
is selected, and so the results can be generalised only to 
frail older people, not older people in general. 
Assuming that the participants in our study were reluctant 
to admit that they were lonely and under-stated their feelings 
of loneliness, loneliness among them is actually quite 
extensive. Rehabilitation actions should be based on the 
participants’ needs, which in this case would be avoiding 
loneliness. The programme, however, was physically ori- 
entated. Earlier studies have shown that older people are 
often treated as a homogeneous group, and little consideration 
is given to the specific or individual needs of socially 
isolated or lonely older people (Cattan et al, 2003). 
The results of our study suggest that, in order to relieve 
loneliness and to prevent its negative predictive outcomes, 
it is not enough merely to seek to increase the number of 
social contacts of lonely older people, although this may 
have its benefits. Since satisfaction with social contacts 
was connected with feelings of loneliness, a greater under- 
standing of the significance of having meaningful contacts 
seems to be important in caring for older people.
