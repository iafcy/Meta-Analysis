loneliness, and quality of life: a quasi-
experimental study

Abstract
Background: Smartphones can optimize the opportunities for interactions between nursing homeresidents and
their families. However, the effectiveness of smartphone-based videoconferencing programs in enhancing
emotional status and quality of life has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate of the
effect of a smartphone-based videoconferencing program on nursing home residents’ feelings of loneliness,
depressive symptoms and quality of life.
Methods: This study used a quasi-experimental research design. Older residents from seven nursing homes in
Taiwan participated in this study. Nursing homes (NH) were randomly selected as sites for either the intervention
group (5 NH) or the control group (2 NH); NH residents who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate.
The intervention group was comprised of 32 participants; the control group was comprised of 30 participants.
The intervention group interacted with their family members once a week for 6months using a smartphone and
a “LINE” application (app). Data were collected with self-report instruments: subjective feelings of loneliness, using
the University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale; depressive symptoms, using the Geriatric Depression
Scale; and quality of life using the SF-36. Data were collected at four time points (baseline, and at 1-month, 3-
months and 6-months from baseline). Data were analysed using the generalized estimating equation approach.
Results: After the intervention, as compared to those in the control group, participants in interventional group
had significant decreases in baseline loneliness scores at 1months (β=−3.41, p<0.001), 3months (β=−5.96,
p<0.001), and 6months (β=−7.50, p<0.001), and improvements in physical role (β=36.49, p=0.01), vitality
(β=13.11, p<0.001) and pain scores (β=16.71, p=0.01) at 6months. However, changes in mean depression
scores did not significantly differ between groups.
Conclusions: Smartphone-based videoconferencing effectively improved residents’ feelings of loneliness, and
physiological health, vitality and pain, but not depressive symptoms. Future investigations might evaluate the
effectiveness of other media-based technologies in nursing homes as well as their effectiveness within and
between different age cohorts.
