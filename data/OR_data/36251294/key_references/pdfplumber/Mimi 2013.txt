and EMS) (Table 1).

an important non-pharmacological strategy in the

(Griffin, Harmon, & Kennedy, 2012; Stubbs et al,
2013). The physical exercise in this study is
beneficial to older adults. The authors suggest that
the physical exercise program should be
implemented in nursing homes as a routine activity.
Moreover, older residents should perform this
exercise in their free time to relieve pain and
maintain their functions.
The score change in the Barthel index indicated
a statistically significant improvement in the partici-
pant’sphysicalcapacityandnosignificantgroupdiffer-
ence in the Elderly Mobility Scale. This was possibly
due to the high physical functional capacity among
the enrolled residents (especially the PEP group) at
baseline. This might have caused a ceiling effect that
hinderedsatisfactoryimprovementsinphysicalmobil-
ityofthe participants.
The authors suggest that instruments such as the
Timed Up and Go test, the Timed Chair Stand test,
andtheGaitVelocitytestcouldbeothereffectiveout-
come measures used for further studies in the evalua-
tion of physical mobility (Csuka & McCarty, 1985;
Hayes & Johnson, 2003; Shumway-Cook, Brauer, &
Woollacott, 2000).
There were significant improvements in the psy-
chological measures regarding the change in happi-
ness, life satisfaction, loneliness, depression, and two
pain beliefs in permanence and self-blame in the PEP
group.Yet,thecontrolgroupdidnotshowanysignif-
icant improvement, even tending to deteriorate in
those variables. The favorable improvements experi-
encedbythePEPgroupweresignificantinenhancing
psychological well-being for older adults.
Indeed, the design of the PEP was an eight-week
program given by the research team, and the authors
could only deliver it once a week for eight weeks in
eachnursinghome.Infuturestudies,itwouldbeinter-
esting to explore the effectiveness of a four- or six-
week dose. To focus developing exercise as a habit,
older adults were encouraged to perform exercises
