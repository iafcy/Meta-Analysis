INTRODUCTION
Background
Extensiveresearchhasdocumentedtheassociationofregularphysicalactivitywithpositive
outcomes in health and wellbeing in later age (Thibaudetal.,2012; Stuartetal.,2008;
Landietal.,2010). Engaging in physical activities reduces the risk of falls (Thibaudetal.,
2012), slows the progression of degenerative diseases (Stuartetal.,2008), and improves
cognitiveperformanceandmoodinolderadults(Landietal.,2010).Conversely,sedentary
behaviourisassociatedwithmortality,riskofdepressionandadverseeffectsonhealthand
wellbeinginolderadults(Rezendeetal.,2014;Teychenne,Ball&Salmon,2010).
Intervention programs to promote physical activity in older adults, either in group
or individual (home) settings, have demonstrated the potential to improve health and
functional performance (El-Khouryetal.,2013). Both types of intervention have shown
equivalenthealthoutcomes(Freeneetal.,2013)butwithdifferentresultswhenconsidering
adherence.Group-basedinterventionsseemtoachievehigherparticipationinthelong-term
(VanDerBij,Laurant&Wensing,2002),whileintheshort-termtheresultsarecomparable
ornotconclusive(VanDerBij,Laurant&Wensing,2002;Freeneetal.,2013).
The existing evidence for a higher participation to group-based interventions can be
explained by the importance of socialization as a motivating factor in physical training
(Phillips,Schneider&Mercer,2004;DeGroot&Fagerström,2011).AsreportedbyDeGroot
&Fagerström(2011),olderadultsdoprefertrainingwithothersratherthanindividually.
However,therearemanyfactorsthatcanmakegroupexercisesachallenging(orinfeasible)
settingforolderadults.Amajorobstacle,duetotheheterogeneityofthisbroadpopulation,
is the big difference in the level of physical abilities between participants: unless the
training class is tailored to the needs and abilities of each group, we are likely to see
limited effectiveness as well as lack of motivation in performing the exercises (DeGroot
&Fagerström,2011; Müller&Khoo,2014), which proves itself difficult in heterogeneous
groups.Thisdifferenceinphysicalabilities,alongwiththelogisticandpracticalobstacles
thatmakeitmoredifficult,asweage,toregularlyattendagymandperformgroupexercises,
meansthat,forsomeadults,home-basedindividualinterventionistheonlyviabletraining
option.
Objective
In this paper we report on a technology-based physical intervention that enables older
adults with different abilities, and indeed inspite of their different abilities, to engage in
Baezetal. (2017),PeerJ,DOI10.7717/peerj.3150 2/27
group exercises from home while keeping these differences invisible to the group. The
intervention is based on the OTAGO Exercise Program for fall prevention (Gardneret
al.,2001) and supported by a set of applications that allow older adults to follow virtual
trainingsessionsviaatabletdeviceunderthesupervisionofaremoteCoach.

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the OTAGO Exercise Program
inreducingfallsandfall-relatedinjuriesamonghighriskindividuals,andincreasingthe
percentageofolderadultswhoareabletoliveindependentlyintheircommunity(Campbell
etal.,1997;Campbell&Robertson,2003).Althoughthisspecificprogramwasdesignedfor

foundthatcombininggroup-basedandhome-basedexercisesisastrategyusedinseveral
effectivetrials,thusrecommendingbothoptionstobeavailable(Sherringtonetal.,2011).
Technology-basedinterventionshavealsodemonstratedtobeeffectiveinincreasingand
maintaining physical activity (refer to Müller&Khoo,2014 and Aalbers,Baars&Rikkert,
2011forsystematicreviews).Amongthetechnologicalcomponentsthathavebeenexplored
we can mention: online newsletters (Hageman,Walker&Pullen,2005), personalized
emails(Ferneyetal.,2009),web-basedvideos(Irvineetal.,2013;Benavent-Caballeretal.,
2015), tablet applications (Silveiraetal.,2013a) and video game consoles (Jorgensenet
al.,2013).However,mostoftheexistinginterventionstudieshavefocusedonindividual
training,orprovidedasocialcontextthatwaslimitedtoforumsorchats(Aalbers,Baars
&Rikkert,2011). Even exergames, a type of technology that have traditionally provided
more immersive experiences (e.g., via MS Kinect and Nintendo Wii), have not been
exploredinanonlinegroupsetting.Asystematicreviewonexergamesbesidesreporting
onlackofconclusiveresultsontheimprovementsinphysicalfunctioning,reportedonly
one interventions with exercise performed in pairs, but that required physical presence
(Molinaetal.,2014).
In summary, there are no interventions exploring online group-exercising in home
settings, where training programs were tailored to individuals. In this paper, we report
Baezetal. (2017),PeerJ,DOI10.7717/peerj.3150 3/27

InGymcentral,personalisationisrelatedtothelevelofdifficultyoftheexercise,andit
works from two perspectives. On one hand, the user is able to request for an increase in
the training level (level-up). A coach receives and manages the requests of users (Fig. 1,

As part of the study kit, participants received a 10.1 inch Sony Xperia tablet with the

TEST PROCEDURES AND OUTCOME MEASURES
Primary outcomes
Participation measures
Attrition.Theattritionratewasusedtomeasuretheproportionofparticipantslostatthe
endofthestudy.
Adherence.Theadherencewasusedtomeasuretheconformityoftheparticipantswiththe
exerciseprogram.Foreachparticipant,twomeasureswereconsidered.Thefirstisrelated
to persistence throughout the eight weeks of the exercise program, and it was computed
considering the ratio between the number of participations in exercise sessions by a
participantandthenumberoftheexercisesessionsplannedintheprogram.Participation
was measured by logging the attendance to the scheduled training sessions in the virtual
classroom (considering also partial participation, where participants skipped exercises).
The second measure is related to the level of completeness of the exercise sessions. It was
calculated considering, for each session, the percentage of exercises videos that the user
actuallyfollowed(watched)—excludingthetimeofpreparationandskippedexercises—
withrespecttothetotaldurationoftheexercisesplannedforthesession.
Physical assessment exercises

Secondary outcomes
Psychological dimensions
Weinvestigatedchangesinpsychologicaldimensionsrelatedtodifferentaspectsofphysical
activity and wellbeing, by collecting participants’ feedback before and after the study on
thefollowingmeasures:
Enjoymentofphysicalactivity. Past literature has shown that intrinsically motivated
peopletendtoengageinphysicalactivityforpersonalimprovementandbecausetheyenjoy
it (Deci&Ryan,1985; Pelletieretal.,1995). Enjoyment of physical activity is believed to
developpositiveattitudestowardexercise,enhanceintrinsicmotivation,andconsequently
fosterlong-lastingadherencetophysicalactivity(Ryanetal.,1997;Wankel,1993).Inorder
tomeasureparticipants’enjoymentofphysicalactivityatthebeginningandattheendof
thestudy,weusedthePhysicalActivityEnjoymentScale(PACES;Kendzierski&DeCarlo,
1991), which has been validated in several studies, including one with an Italian sample
(Carraro,Young&Robazza,2008).Thescaleincludes16itemsscoredona5-pointLikert
scalewiththerangefrom1(disagreealot)to5(agreealot).Totalenjoymentscoresrange
from16to80(maximumenjoyment).
Subjectivewellbeing. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the application and
traininginimprovingsubjectivewellbeing,wecollectedparticipants’feedbackbeforeand
after the training period using the Wellbeing scale of the Multidimensional Personality
Questionnaire(MPQ;Tellegen&Waller,2008).Thisscalewasdevelopedtoassesspositive
emotional tendencies as distinct from the absence of a negative emotional disposition.
Wellbeing represents individual dispositions to experience positive emotions, and is an
importantmarkerofthehigherorderPositiveEmotionalitydimension.Thescaleincludes
12 items requiring a true / false response, with the total scoring ranging from 0 to 12.
People who scorehigher in this scaletend to describe themselvesas cheerful, optimistic,
hopeful, having interesting experiences and engaging in enjoyable activities (Tellegen&
Waller,2008,p.274).
Social wellbeing
The effects of the technology-based intervention on the social wellbeing was assessed on
thebasisofparticipants’feedback,collectedatthebeginningandattheendofthestudy
usingameasureofloneliness.
Loneliness is an aspect that negatively affects social wellbeing. Shifts in the social
environment, and in particular loneliness, are believed to be an important aspect in
thelifeofagingpeople(seeforexampleHughesetal.,2004;Liu&Rook,2013).Loneliness
involvesindividualperceptionofsocialisolationandfeelingsofnotbelongingandbeing
disconnected,andisacentralaspectofagroupofsocio-emotionalstatesincluding,among
others, self-esteem, optimism, anxiety, anger and social support. To measure loneliness,
Baezetal. (2017),PeerJ,DOI10.7717/peerj.3150 10/27
we used a shorter version of the R-UCLA Loneliness Scale (revised version of the UCLA
Loneliness Scale developed by University of California, Los Angeles) (Russell,Peplau&
Cutrona,1980)developedbyHughesetal.(2004).Thescaleusedincludes3itemsscored
on a 5-point Likert scale, with the total score ranging from 3 to 15, and higher scores
indicatinghigherlevelsofloneliness.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES

RESULTS
Application usage
Before reporting on the main outcome measures, we summarise the results from Baez
etal.(2016), which reported on how participants of the intervention—also studied in
this paper—perceived and used the trainee application. We also report on online social
interactions,toputthesocialwellbeingoutcomeincontext.
Participants’ perception
To collect feedback on the participant’s perception of the tool, we used a questionnaire
(https://goo.gl/zl7daL)assessingthemoststimulatingaspectoftheoverallexperienceand
theusefulnessofthevariousfeatures.
Moststimulatingaspects. A manual classification using a emerging coding scheme was
performedtoidentifymainthemesinparticipants’open-endedresponses.
As stimulatingaspects, two main themes emerged in the socialgroup: training with
othersandthepossibilityoffollowingthetrainingprogram.Otherparticipantsexpressed
thepossibilityofmessagingorchallengingthemselves.Inthecontrolgroupthepossibility
oftrainingfromhomewasalsoamainthemealongwiththepersonalsatisfactionofdoing
the exercises. Interestingly, in this group one person reported that ‘‘The experience was
interesting,thoughitwasapitythattheCoachwasinthevideoandnotactuallypresent’’.
Asnegativeaspects,thedominantissuewastheintermittentinterruptionsintheInternet
service that occurred at some point during the study, and which affected both groups
equally.
Usefulnessoffeatures. Participants of the socialgroup continued to use all features of
the application throughout the study, although with different perceived usefulness. As
reported in Baezetal.(2016), the features that are instrumental to the training were
naturallyexperiencedbymostofthetrainees,andthisincludesexercisingintheclassroom,
checking out the schedule, and more importantly, training with the company of others.
Togetherthesefeatureswerehighlyvalued.Persuasionfeatureswerealsoamongthemost
experienced and valued. This includes, following the progress and visualizing their own

Interestingly, social interaction features received mixed results. While group chat was
usedwidely,personalmessagingwasheavilyusedtointeractwiththeCoachbutlesswith

When discussing about physical activity, trainees focused on reporting their personal

The interaction between group and leg muscle strength shows a higher persistence
in participants of the control group that scored higher in the initial leg muscle strength
test. For the social group however, there is no significant difference in the persistence
of participants based on their initial leg muscle strength score. This suggests that, when
training individually, fitter participants tend to adhere more to the training, but when

The lower variability of persistence in the social group can be explained by the social
features(normativeinfluence,socialfacilitation,sociallearning)thatmighthavemotivated

effect to the duration of the video exercises that were assigned to fitter individuals (e.g.,
requiredmorerepetitions),whichwerelongerforhigherlevelsofintensity.
Thehigherlevelofcompletenessandlowervariabilityinthesocialgroupcanbeexplained
by the presence of self-monitoring tools (e.g., positive and negative reinforcement) and
social facilitation (exercising with others), which were lacking in the training sessions of
thecontrolgroupparticipants.
Muscle strength and gait speed
Two types of assessment exercises, developed and validated within the OTAGO Exercise
Program (Campbelletal.,1997; Campbell&Robertson,2003), were used to measure
participants’ leg muscle strength and walking ability at the beginning and at the end
ofthestudy.

significant in improving (reducing) loneliness (B=1.121, OR=3.068, 95% CI [1.177–

we took message received, as the exchanges were nearly symmetrical. The results show

of physical skills reaches the same level as that of more fit participants

Baezetal. (2017),PeerJ,DOI10.7717/peerj.3150 19/27
We should notice that despite the small sample we have observed a large effect size
(partial eta squared =.327). This pilot thus motivates further studies into the effect of
baselinemeasuresonadherence.
Inaddition,wehaveseenevidenceofthepreferenceofolderadultsforgroupexercising.
This comes from the debriefing of participants, and after observing the participation
of trainees in the Social group, who were able to choose whether to train alone or in
company, and largely participated of training sessions in company (after controlling for
casual meet-ups) (Faretal.,2015). This is in line with existing literature pointing to the
importanceofsocialfeaturesinfitnessapplications(Faretal.,2016).
These results contribute to the literature studying the effects of group-based and
home-based training, which on short-term settings have not provided conclusive results
(VanDerBij,Laurant&Wensing,2002;Freeneetal.,2013).However,thehybridnatureof
theproposedinterventionrequiresfurtherstudies,tocompareitseffectivenesstothatof
traditionalinterventions.
Virtual group-exercising enables tailored home-based intervention with
positive physical outcomes and increased persistence
In terms of physical outcomes, at the end of the eight-week program, both Social and
Control groups showed significant improvement in gait speed and leg muscle strength,
giventhehighlevelsofadherenceinbothgroups.Itisimportanttonotethatbyproviding
the feeling of trainingtogether to an otherwise tailored exercise program, participants of
theSocialGroupobservedthebenefitsofperformingexercisesthatweretailoredtotheir
individual abilities (traditionally part of an individual training program) while enjoying
the extra motivation of the social context (as indicated by the greater persistence of the
socialgroup).
Theseresultsareinlinewithpreviousliteraturepointingtotheequivalenthealth-related
outcomes of traditional group- and home-based training (Freeneetal.,2013), though in
thissettingwehaveachievedtheseresultswithaheterogeneousgroup.However,further
studiesarerequiredinordertoobservetheseeffectsinlong-termsettings.
Positive effects on enjoyment and subjective wellbeing at the end of the
training program (regardless of the control or social condition)
The psychological measures have shown a significant improvement after the eight-week
training program. Participants from both groups showed a significant increase in the
enjoymentofphysicalactivity, as measured by the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale
(PACES;Carraro,Young&Robazza,2008;Kendzierski&DeCarlo,1991),andinsubjective
wellbeing,asmeasuredbytheMPQ(Tellegen&Waller,2008).Thissupportstheliterature

Decrease in loneliness in both groups, attributed to contacts with the Coach
(and between participants)
Wealsoobservethat,althoughsocialfeaturesplayedapartinmotivatingparticipationto
trainingsessionsintheSocialgroup(Faretal.,2015),therewasnosignificantdifference
in terms of loneliness scores with respect to the Control group after the eight weeks of
training.AplausibleexplanationfortheimprovementintheControlgroupisthefrequent
contact with participants via telephone. This is common practice in clinical evaluation
studies involving older adults, where social visits to the control group are performed to
mirror the time and attention provided to the treatment group, and even suggested by
several authors (for example, Hoganetal.,2001; Michaeletal.,2010; Tinettietal.,1994).
In our study, each participant in the control group was contacted by phone, rather than
via the messaging features of the application, and it is possible that the effect of this
contactwasstrongenoughtoproduceasignificantdecreaseinparticipants’perceptionof
loneliness.Indeed,previousworkrelyingontheR-UCLAlonelinessscale,andwithsimilar
intervention periods (6–15 weeks), have achieved significant reductions of loneliness
but have also included the physical presence of educators, trainers, and peers during the
intervention(Shapira,Barak&Gal2007;Fukuietal.,2003).
Thus,wefoundnoteworthythesignificantdecreaseintheleveloflonelinessintheSocial
groupdespitetheuseofremoteinteractionsandinsuchashortperiod.Whatismore,the
onlineinteractionsintheformofprivatemessageswerefoundtopredictthedecreasein
loneliness.
Limitations
The complexity of the study setting resulted in limitations that are acknowledged in the
following:
Differenttoolsforsupport.TheinteractionsoftheCoachwiththeparticipantswerepart
of the study protocol and designed to give the same type of support. However, while
in the Social group the communication was carried on within the app via messaging
features,intheControlgroupitwasdoneviaphone.Thiswasdonesogiventheabsence
of social features in the version of the app used by the Control group. This difference in
thecommunication—i.e.,usingamoredirectchannelintheControlgroup—mighthave
introducedapotentialbiasinthesocialwellbeingoutcomesinfavouroftheControlgroup.
Samplesizeandgenderimbalance. Random variability, probably due to the small
sample size, might have influenced the initial difference between groups in some of
the measures. Although the comparisons reported in the paper were done in terms of
relativeimprovementsandnotstrictcomparisons,thisshouldbenotedasapotentialbias.
Thegenderimbalance,resultinginaskewedfemaletomaleratio,shouldalsobenoted
as a potential limitation. Previous studies, however, provide evidence in favour of the
generalization of our results, noting that male and female react equally to sport, despite
differencesininitialmotivesforparticipation(Koivula,1999;Ryanetal.,1997).
Durationofthetraining. The pilot intervention ran for a period of two months, which
was significant for observing differences in adherence and even some effects in physical
measures. However, the OTAGO program this intervention is based on, relied on a
Baezetal. (2017),PeerJ,DOI10.7717/peerj.3150 21/27
longerduration(fourmonths).Thus,thisconstitutesalimitationofourstudy,formore
meaningfulcomparisonsandoutcomesmightbeobservedinlongerperiods.
Nocognitivemeasuresatbaseline.Whiletheusabilityoftheapplicationwasamongthe
pre- and post- measures, we did not include any standard instrument for measuring
cognitive abilities of individuals, as to relate the usability (and other outcomes) to the
cognitive abilities of the participants. However, as reported in this paper, participants
were independent-living older adults that did not show any issues during the tablet and
applicationtrainingsessions.
CONCLUSION
Inthispaperweintroducedatechnology-basedphysicalinterventiontoenableolderadults
with different abilities, and indeed inspite of their different abilities, to engage in group
exercises from home while keeping these differences invisible to the group. We focused
particularly on the feasibility of delivering a tailored exercise program while keeping the
feeling of training in a group, and measuring the effects of such an intervention on the
adherenceoftraineesofdifferentabilities,andonthephysicaloutcomes.Inaddition,we
exploredtheeffectsoftheinterventiononpsychologicalandsocialwellbeingoutcomes.
