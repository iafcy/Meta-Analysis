Abstract
Introduction: Restraints and changes in social activities might contribute to loneliness and health decline for older adults. To
reducelonelinessandsupportactivities,socialinternet-basedinterventionsareindicatedtobeeffective.Theaimofthisstudywas
to evaluate the effects of a social internet-based intervention for olderadults who are vulnerable to loneliness.
Method: An explorative, randomised,crossover study with an AB/BA sequence was completed. The intervention was conducted
overaperiodofthree months.Thirty participants wereincluded(24women andsixmen,61–89yearsold)andallocated totwo
groups.Datawerecollectedatthreetimepoints.TheprimaryoutcomewastheUCLAlonelinessscale,andthesecondaryoutcomes
were satisfaction with social contacts and social interaction skills. Statistical analyses were conducted with the paired t-test,
Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test and repeated-measures analysis of variance.
Results: Loneliness was significantly decreased in both groups post intervention, and satisfaction with social contacts online
significantlyincreased in one group. Significant treatment effects were detected forall outcomes.
Conclusion: Theresults ofthesocialinternet-basedintervention programmearepromising,but furtherevaluationsareneeded.

Discussion and implications
The results indicate that the individually adapted SIBA
intervention programme for socially vulnerable older
adultshasthepotentialtoreduceexperiencesofloneliness.
The intervention effects were sustained post intervention,
which was expected and desired as part of the goal of the
programme.Aspreviousresearchindicatedarelationship
between health and loneliness (O’Luanaigh and Lawlor,
2008), the results from this study indicate that the SIBA
intervention has the potential to be used by occupational
therapists in health-promotive actions for older adults.
The occupational therapists’ ability to work in a client-
centred way, to tailor the intervention to the individual
(that is, level of independence and time needed to learn)
