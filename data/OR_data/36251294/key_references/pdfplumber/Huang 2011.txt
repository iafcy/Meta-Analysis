Methods. Data were collected from January to December 2007. A randomized
Psychiatry,Taoyuan,Taiwan
controlled trial with three groups (control, cognitive-behavioural and cognitive-
behavioural with Tai Chi). Participants were assessed at baseline for demographic
data, falls-related history, and fear of falling. Data on these variables plus falls,
mobility, social support behaviour and satisfaction, and quality of life were also
collected at2and5monthsafter interventions.
Results. Participants in the three groups differed significantly in both measures of
fear of falling (F=20Æ89, P<0Æ001; F=6Æ09, P<0Æ001) and mobility
(F=30Æ33, P<0Æ001), social support behaviour and satisfaction (F=3Æ32,
P<0Æ05 and F=6Æ35, P<0Æ001, respectively), and quality of life (F=16Æ66,
P<0Æ001). In addition, participants who received the cognitive-behavioural
interventionwithTaiChihadsignificantlylowerfearoffallingscores(P<0Æ001)
andhighermobility(P<0Æ001),socialsupportsatisfaction(P<0Æ01)andquality
of life (P<0Æ001) than the cognitive-behavioural alone and control groups at
5months.The threegroupsdid notdiffer significantly infalls.
Conclusion. The results of this trial suggest that the cognitive-behavioural inter-
ventionwithTaiChiexercisehelpedcommunity-dwellingelderlyadultstoenhance
their mobility, to manage their fearof fallingandto increase their qualityof life.
