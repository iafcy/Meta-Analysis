Discussion
The purpose of this study was to investigate the
impact of a 6-month Web-based intervention on the psy-
chosocial outcomes associated with diabetes manage-
ment. The specific hypothesis tested was that a 6-month
Web-based intervention would improve the psychosocial
well-being of the participants who received a 6-month
Web-based intervention compared with a control group.
Participants who received the Web intervention did
improve on their depression, quality of life, self-efficacy,
and social support ratings compared with the control
group. Findings from this study also provide support for
the premise that duration of diabetes, number of comor-
bidities, and glycemic control are not associated with
quality of life and depression.
The type of diabetes treatment regimen, however, was
associated with depression and quality-of-life outcomes.
Participants who were in the no-medication group reported These findings seemed inconsistent with the literature.37
