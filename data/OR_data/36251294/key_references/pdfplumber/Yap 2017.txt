Abstract
Background: Quality of life has become animportantaspect in themeasurement of thehealth ofan individualas
thepopulation ages. Rhythm-centred music making (RMM) has been shown to improvephysical, psychological and
social health. The purpose of this study was to explore theeffects ofRMM onquality of life, depressivemood, sleep
quality and social isolation in theelderly.
Methods: A randomised controlled trial with cross over was conducted. 54 participants were recruited with 27
participants in each arm. Inphase 1,group A underwent theintervention withgroup Bas the control. In phase 2,
group Bunderwentthe interventionwith group A as thecontrol. The interventioninvolved 10 weekly RMM
sessions. Patient related outcome data which included European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS), PittsburgSleep Quality Index(PSQI) and LubbenSocial Network Scale (LSNS) scores were
collected before theintervention, at11th and atthe 22nd week.
Results: A total of 31 participants were analyzed atthe end ofthe study. The mean age was 74.65± 6.40 years. In
analysing the change inpatientrelated outcome variables as a continuous measure,participation inRMM resulted
ina non-significant reduction in EQ5D by 0.004(95% CI: -0.097,0.105), GDS score by 0.479 (95% CI:-0.329,1.287), PSQI
score by 0.929 (95%CI:-0.523,2.381) and an improvement in LSNS by 1.125 (95%CI:-2.381,0.523). Inbinary analysis,
