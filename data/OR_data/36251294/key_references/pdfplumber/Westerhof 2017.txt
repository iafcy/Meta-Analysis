Methods: A randomized controlled trial was carried out with depressive symptoms as the primary

outcome. The experimental condition received the intervention Precious Memories one-on-one, therapy;institutionalcare;
whereas the control condition had individual unstructured contacts with a volunteer. Participants volunteers
were 86 older persons living in residential care. There were three measurements: pre-intervention,
post-intervention (2 months after the first measurement), and follow-up (8 months after the first
measurement). Besides depressive symptoms, the retrieval of specific positive memories was
measured as a process variable. Anxiety, loneliness, well-being, and mastery were assessed as
secondaryoutcomes.
Results:Depressivesymptomsimprovedequallyintheinterventionandthecontrolconditionatpost-
measurement.Participantswithclinicallyrelevantdepressivesymptomsalsomaintainedtheeffectsat
follow-up in both conditions. The retrieval of specific positive memories improved more in the
autobiographical memory intervention, although this was not maintained at follow-up. Anxiety and
loneliness improved equally well in both conditions, but no effects were found for well-being or
mastery.
