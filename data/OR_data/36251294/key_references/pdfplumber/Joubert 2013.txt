Elderly patients presenting to St. Vincent’s Health Emergency
Department (ED) constitute approximately one third of pre-
sentations. A significant proportion of these involve preexisting
conditions including depression that, within elderly patients, is
associated with social isolation, physical and mental health prob-
lems, and barriers to accessing community services. It is also
often overlooked as a clinical diagnosis among the elderly. This
study aimed to assess the efficacy of a brief depression screen-
ing tool and examine the change over time in quality of life
and social factors for elderly patients who present to ED. Patients

INTRODUCTION
Elderly patients presenting to St. Vincent’s Emergency Department (ED) con-
stitute approximately one third of all presentations. This situation is common
to metropolitan hospitals in Victoria, Australia and internationally, with those
aged 65 and over disproportionately represented. Specifically, while this age
group currently comprise 13% of the population in Australia, they account
for 33% of hospital admissions and 20% of ED presentations (Emergency
Demand Coordination Group, 2001). In addition, approximately 15.2% of
overall growth in demand on EDs within Australia stems from individu-
als within this age group (Emergency Demand Coordination Group, 2001).
Further, the number of individuals aged 60 and over within Victoria is
projected to increase from 1 million (19% of the population) in 2010 to
1.4 million (23%) in 2020 and 2.4 million (29%) in 2050 (Department of
Planning and Community Development, 2010). The aging nature of our
population emphasizes the importance of examining the aetiology of ED
admissions among the elderly and the patient experience of these pre-
sentations to ensure both positive health outcomes and a reduction in the
associated public health burden.
A significant proportion of elderly presentations to ED involve exacer-
bations or episodes of underlying or preexisting conditions. In older adults,
depression specifically is known to cause significant distress and disability,
which exacerbates, and is often exacerbated by, existing medical condi-
tions (Frazer, Christensen, & Griffiths, 2005). However, depression in the
elderly is often characterized by different symptomatology from that seen
in younger adults. Specifically, depressed mood may be less commonly
reported by health care professionals and the presentation of somatic symp-
toms, including a loss of appetite, lack of energy, irritability, sleeplessness,
rumination, and physical pain may be more prominent (Frazer et al., 2005).
Within the cohort of patients aged over 65, depression has significant impli-
cations for psychosocial health and well-being and is associated with social

isolation,carerstress,andbarrierstoeffectiveaccessofcommunityresources
(Achterberg et al., 2003; Ell, 2006; Fessman & Lester, 2000; VanItallie, 2005).
Not surprisingly, depression in the elderly is also associated with increased
health service use, medical costs, and general health burden (Ell, 2006).
However, it is also often considered to be a normal response to aging,
physical deterioration, and other life events including the loss of loved
ones (Birrer & Vemuri, 2004; Frazer et al., 2005). Accordingly, depression
is often overlooked as a clinical diagnosis and, as a result, elderly patients
may not receive optimal treatment during, or following, hospital admissions
for depressive episodes (Ell, 2006; Koenig et al., 1992; Raj, 2004; VanItallie,
2005). For these reasons, recent research has investigated the efficacy of cur-
rent treatment and management strategies for depression in the elderly in
both primary health and community settings.
International literature suggests that the appropriate management of
depression in the elderly, who present at the ED with complex care needs,
should involve an integrated approach across a continuum of care from
presentation to follow up with telephone tracking and supported linkages
established between primary care and community services (Aminzadeh &
Dalziel, 2002). Specifically, research has investigated the involvement of
general practitioners, geriatricians, and allied health in appropriate care of
the elderly, in conjunction with carers who are commonly the main source
of support for these patients (Jeon, 2004). Research has focused specifi-
cally on integrating internal liaison with effective networking within the
patient’s community to improve long-term outcomes (Spillane et al., 1997).
These studies have assessed the use of screening, geriatric and psychiatric
assessment, education, the promotion of self-care (Hendriksen & Harrison,
2001), rehabilitation services and counseling (Lee, Ross, & Tracy, 2001),
referral to appropriate community services (Aminzadeh & Dalziel, 2002) and
community–carer linkages (Jeon, 2004). Such research shows that collabora-
tive, holistic care is effective in improving outcomes for elderly patients with
depression (Birrer & Vemuri, 2004; Frazer et al., 2005; Jeon, 2004; McGarry,
Hegarty, & Gunn, 2005; Raj, 2004).
In response to the increasing recognition of this best practice care for
elderly patients who present with depressive episodes, St. Vincent’s Health
in Melbourne undertook a recent analysis of elderly patients presenting to
theED. The findingsindicatethat themajority of individualslivealone (44%)
with many more living with a primary carer (29%) (Joubert, Vale, Brock, &
Braddy, 2005). However, minimal attention was paid to carer liaison or the
linkages between primary health and community services. In response to
this discrepancy, and given international literature supporting continuums of
care for the elderly, St. Vincent’s Health has implemented three integrated
care programs under the Victorian Hospital Demand Management Strategy
to develop alternative treatment plans for elderly individuals whose con-
ditions are chronic or complex and who present frequently to ED. These

programs are of specific relevance to the elderly as their main purpose
is to increase linkages with, and the use of, primary health and commu-
nity services in instances where presentation at ED could be prevented or
care more appropriately provided elsewhere. These programs are: ALERT
(Assessing, Liaison and Early Referral Team), HiT (Holding it Together), and
TRAAC (Treating the elderly in the right place: Facilitating appropriate com-
munity care). The directive of both the ALERT and HiT programs stipulates
the importance of risk management, screening, early discharge planning for
ED patients, and case management for patients who have complex care
needs. The major objectives are to: screen for high-risk patients at all stages
of care; coordinate a central referral process for sub-acute care; ensure early
communication with relevant community agencies and programs; follow up
with patients who are at risk of unplanned readmissions; ensure community
supports are in place prior to discharge; centralize and improve timeli-
ness of the referral process; and avoid unnecessary duplication of services.

specific aims of this project were twofold. The first was to implement and
assess the efficacy of a brief screening assessment for depression into exist-
ing protocols in the three integrated care programs at St. Vincent’s Health
and assess the efficacy of this assessment compared to standardized mea-
sures. The second aim was to develop a protocol for the identification and
management of depression in elderly patients based on assertive outreach
programs, linking patients and carers into existing integrated care programs
at St. Vincent’s Health and with primary and community care resources.
This project was undertaken with the vision of contributing to the evidence
base for best practice care with elderly patients presenting to ED and the
identification and management of depression in this population.

METHODOLOGY
Participants
The study was conducted at St. Vincent’s Health, an acute health care facil-
ity,inMelbourne,Australia.Theparticipantsforthisstudyincludedmaleand
female patients aged 65 years and over who presented to the ED between
March 2005 and August 2005. The inclusion criteria for participation were
extensive due to the sensitive nature of screening for depression in elderly
patients who present to an ED. To qualify for inclusion, patients had to be
English speaking, have a nominated general practitioner (GP) in the local
community, and have no known psychiatric history and no identified medi-
cal issues that would hinder participation. Over the 6-month period, a total
of 771 participants aged 65 and over presented to St. Vincent’s Health ED.
Of these, 363 (47.08%) identified as non-English speaking and 126 (16.34%)
did not have a nominated local GP, 118 (15.30%) had an identified psy-
chiatric history, and 99 (12.84%) reported medical problems that excluded
them from participating including profound deafness, dysphasia, and cogni-
tive impairment. Therefore, in total, within this 6-month period, 66 patients
were determined eligible for participation in this study. The mean age of
these participants was 76.63 years (SD = 7.32) and 71% were female.
Procedure
All 771 patients who presented during this time were screened during Phase
1 for depressive symptomatology using a brief version of the Geriatric
Depression Screening (GDS-15) tool. This allowed for the evaluation of the
efficacy of this tool in screening for depression in this patient cohort.
During Phase 2, the sample was refined based on the exclusion cri-
teria described above and the remaining 66 patients were fully screened
for depression using the 15-item form of the GDS-15 tool (Sheikh &
Yesavage, 1986). The aim of this was to assess the efficacy and accu-
racy of the initial screen in the identification of depression. Using this
full screen, a total of 15 patients scored positively and the remaining
51 patients screened negatively. Of the 15 patients who screened positively
for depression, 7 refused to consent to participate in ongoing research. This
reflects complexities inherent to conducting research with elderly patients
demonstrating depression. During Phase 2, all participants who screened
positively and consented to ongoing participation were randomized into
control (n = 4) and intervention groups (n = 4). The characteristics of these
participants are presented in Table 1. Both groups then completed mea-
sures designed to assess depression (GDS-15), quality of life (Manchester
Short Assessment of Quality of Life), social support and social functioning
(Person-In-Environment Classification System and Medical Outcome Study

Social Support Scale), and patient experience using a semi-structured inter-
view. These measures are described below. Following the completion of
these measures, the control group received usual care. The intervention
group received a comprehensive, integrated management plan in accor-
dance with the ALERT, HiT, and TRACC programs. This involved assessment
outcome reports, patient education about depression in a one-on-one
session with a social worker at St. Vincent’s Health, emotional support, and
counseling utilizing a problem-solving framework. Contact was also made
with the participant’s GP who received assessment outcome reports and
links were established to community agencies for the provision of ongoing
monitoring and support.
During Phase 3, participants in both the intervention and control groups
were followed up with at 6 weeks post discharge from the ED. This fol-
low up was conducted via phone to examine between-group differences in
depression, quality of life, social support and social functioning, and patient
satisfaction as examined in Phase 2.

Measures
BRIEF GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCREENING TOOL
This tool was used during Phase 1 to screen elderly ED patients who had
depressive symptoms. It was adapted from the GDS-15 and consisted of four
questions. A score of two or more was indicative of depression.
GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE (GDS-15)
This measure has been used and validated extensively in past research to
examine depressive symptomatology, present during the past week, in older
patientpopulationsandinprimaryandcommunityhealthsettings(Friedman,
Heisel, & Delavan 2005; Pomeroy, Clark, & Philp, 2001; Rinaldi et al., 2003;
Scogin&Shah,2006;Sutcliffeetal.,2000;VanItallie,2005;Watson&Pignone,
2003). It contains 15 questions (Sheikh & Yesavage, 1986) and evidence

of acceptable but moderate internal consistency and reliability has been
found with the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the total scale previously
reported as 0.75 (Friedman et al., 2005). Construct validity for the assess-
ment of depressed mood has also been determined (Friedman et al., 2005).
Participant scores of 0–4 are considered within the range of normal function,
dependant on age, education, and complaints; a score of 5–8 indicates mild
depression, 9–11 indicates moderate depression, and 12–15 indicates severe
depression. Within this study, participants who scored at or above a score of
five were categorized as a positive screen, whereas those who scored below
five were categorized as a negative screen.
MANCHESTER SHORT ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE (MANSA)
QualityoflifewasexaminedusingtheMANSAscale(Priebe,Huxley,Knight,
& Evans, 1999). This scale consists of 16 items comprising 4 objective
questions and 12 subjective questions examining satisfaction with life, job,
financial situation, friendships, leisure activities, accommodation, personal
safety,people,sexlife,family,physicalhealth,andmentalhealth.Participant
responses are reported on a 7-point Likert scale. A higher score, calculated
as the mean scores of these scales, is indicative of a better reported quality
of life. Cronbach’s alpha for ratings using this measure has been reported at
0.74 and it has been found to be comparable to the Lancashire Quality of
Life Profile (Priebe et al., 1999).
PERSON-IN-ENVIRONMENT (PIE) CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
The PIE classification system (Karls & Wandrei, 1994) is widely field-tested
and determines social functioning in four domains: role functioning, the
environment, mental health, and physical health. It has good reliability and
validity and assesses social functioning using a systemic model. The PIE
was used in this study to examine the contribution of social functioning to
depressive symptomatology, quality of life, representation rates at ED, and
the use of primary care and community resources (Karls & Wandrei, 1994;
Karls, Lowery, Mattaini, & Wandrei, 1997).
MEDICAL OUTCOME STUDY (MOS) SOCIAL SUPPORT SURVEY
The MOS social support survey allows for the examination of medical
events and other stressors by assessing the availability of perceived social
support in four categories including emotional/informational, tangible,
affectionate, and positive social interaction (Sherbourne & Stewart, 1991).
This self-administered scale uses a five-category Likert response for each of
19 items. Scores range from 0 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time) and
a higher score indicates greater social support. High internal consistency

and reliability have been reported for this measure with Cronbach’s alpha
coefficients reported as 0.97 for the total social support scale (Sherbourne &
Stewart, 1991).
PATIENT SATISFACTION AND EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE
A semi-structured questionnaire was used to examine the needs of patients,
their perceptions of the ED experience, the lived experience of depression,
social supports and functioning, practical considerations including accom-
modation, transportation and financial concerns, and satisfaction with the
health care service.
Data Analysis
Trends in quantitative results were examined as data could not be statis-
tically compared due to a small sample size and the associated lack of
power. Qualitative results ascertained from the semi-structured interview
were analyzed using thematic analysis based on the framework of Grounded
Theory (Liamputtong & Ezzy, 2005). Two independent raters, who were
blind to the aims of the study, examined and coded qualitative data based
ontheidentificationofrecurrentwords,phrases,patterns,andthemes.These
categories were further refined to enable the formation of sub-categories as
defined by similar coding (Morse & Field, 1995). Inter-rater agreement was
established by comparing the coding of data and creation of sub-categories
between raters. Analyses were refined until agreement was reached about all
major coding categories and subcategories.
RESULTS
During Phase 1, a total of 771 patients participated in this study. Based on
exclusioncriteria,66patientswerethenfullyscreenedfordepression.Ofthese,
15 patients screened positively and the 8 who provided informed consent
were randomized into intervention (n = 4) and control (n = 4) groups.
Depression
The overall mean score for depression screening during Phase 1 (n =
66), was 0.90 (SD = 1.08) (Figure 1). After randomization of the patients
who screened positively and consented to ongoing participation, the mean
screening score for the intervention group was 2.75 (SD = 0.43) and the
mean score for the control group was 2.00 (SD = 0.00).
By comparison, the overall mean score for the GDS-15 (n = 66) was

indicate that participants reported multiple medical problems and frustra-
tion, primarily related to decreased mobility, as the most significant causes
for depressed mood, rather than psychological dysfunction. In relation to
reduced mobility, being unable to do what they would normally be able to
do, and prefer to do, was cited as the main reason for this frustration, not-
ing that they would lead normal happy lives if they were mobile. In terms
of participants’ perception of their mood, they described their feelings as
“flat,” “down,”,/ “weak,” and “very bad” but never used the words “sad” or
“depressed.” In addition, no participants expressed a fear of dying in this
study, appearing instead to adopt an attitude of acceptance about the fact
that when their time comes, it comes, although this was not perceived as
giving up, but rather acceptance by participants. However, mixed feelings
of worthlessness and hopelessness were reported with 62.5% reporting not
feeling worthless but the same percentage (62.5%) reported feeling that their
situation was hopeless.
SOCIAL FUNCTIONING
Mixed reports of good and poor social supports from family and friends
resulted from this study. Those who lived alone tended to have less social
supports available to them in the community and were more isolated.

Overall, social supports appeared to be important in the management of
depression, although socializing outside the family was perceived as less
important to participants’ general well-being. Specifically, they noted great
joy in talking about their grandchildren.
PRACTICAL FACTORS
In general, all participants enjoyed being retired and reported high sat-
isfaction with their accommodation. They also reported frequent use of
public transport, including buses, trams, and taxis and no reported prob-
lems relating to service accessibility. However, the majority of participants
noted dissatisfaction with their financial situation; with the common com-
ments being that “it’s hard to make ends meet” and that “the pension doesn’t
go very far.” No problems in accessing health services were reported and
health care staff were generally rated as “wonderful,” although a minority
expressed a preference for the private health system over the public system.
DISCUSSION
Depression is increasingly recognized as an important issue in the elderly
who present to ED, particularly in those with complex physical health and
social problems. This study aimed to examine depression in patients aged
over 65 years presenting to the ED at St. Vincent’s Health in Melbourne; to
examine the efficacy of a screening tool for the identification of depression
and a protocol for the management of depression utilizing linkages between
primary care and community care. The objective of this research was to
contribute to the knowledge base about appropriate care of elderly patients
who present with complex needs and depression, and to improve health
outcomes for these patients. The significance of this research is supported
by Highet, Luscombe, Davenport, Burns, and Hickie (2006) who assert that
although depression is commonly recognized as a mental health problem, it
is not yet considered a major general health problem throughout Australia.
This is despite evidence to illustrate the increasing public health burden
of depression in the elderly, particularly within the context of an aging
Australian population.
The results of this study indicate that the mean scores for the brief
screening tool and GDS-15 were comparable, with no clinical depression
evident in the majority of patients but approximately one in four patients
(22.72%) experiencing mild to moderate depression. This suggests that a
brief screening for depression is appropriate in the context of ED presen-
tation within the elderly. The majority of patients, encouragingly, did not
feel worthless, but did report that their situation felt hopeless. According
to patient reports, lowered mood was most significantly attributed to the

presence of multiple medical problems and associated decreased mobility.
Althoughquantitativeresultsinthisstudyhavetobeinterpretedwithcaution
due to the relatively small sample size obtained, differences in depression
scores between recruitment and 6 months indicate relatively stable scores for
both the control and intervention groups. This may support patient reports
that depression may largely reflect factors related to medical circumstance
and functionality, an assertion that is supported by Travis, Lyness, Shields,
King,andCox(2004)whofoundthatdepressivesymptomsweresignificantly
associated with functional impairment and disability. It may therefore be
hypothesized that as, over time, functionality increases or worsens in elderly
patients, depression similarly changes. This requires further investigation in
future research.
Like previous studies, this research also showed that the elderly will
often not talk about symptoms of sadness and depression but will rather talk
about ‘feeling weak’, or ‘very bad’. These terms may often disguise depres-
sion by making feelings of sadness appear to relate to persistent physical
complaints and health issues, rather than psychological dysfunction. This
is likely to exacerbate poor recognition and management of depression in
elderly patients (Ell, 2006; Koenig et al., 1992; Raj, 2004; VanItallie, 2005)
and suggests that the use of patient education about depression, as inte-
grated into the three integrated care management approaches (ALERT, HiT,
and TRACC) at St. Vincent’s Health, is essential to engender change in the
perception and discussion of depression among the elderly to ensure early
intervention and appropriate management.
Within this study, the intervention group demonstrated the most notable
trendsinincreasedsocialsupportandfunctioningbetweenrecruitmentand6-
weekspostdischargeinareasofsocialsupportandpositivesocialinteraction

scores over time or no change. Emotional support was the only aspect of
social functioning that appeared to increase for the control group although
thisremainedstablefortheinterventiongroup.Theexperienceofaffectionate

However, within this study, the qualitative reports of patients confirmed the
significance of social support to the management of depression, particularly
in relation to support received from family members. This is supported by
Jeon (2004) who illustrates that family caregivers play an essential role in the
care of elderly patients, particularly those engaged primarily in community-
based care. The improvement trends in several areas of social support and
functioning over time for the intervention group illustrates the importance
of integrated care approaches for the management of depression not only
incorporating patient education about depression but also promoting family
and community linkages to ensure adequate social support, consistency in
care, and the promotion of positive health outcomes for these patients.

EmergencyCareforElderlyWithDepression 235
The emergency health care environment can present challenges in
responding to the elderly with depression as it is a high-stress, high-volume
environment. Yet, it provides a window of opportunity. The use of screen-
ing tools for depression in elderly patients and the provision of integrated
care teams, such at those within the ALERT, HiT, and TRACC programs at
St. Vincent’s Health, provide the opportunity for assessing and respond-
ing to patients screening positively for depression within this environment.
This facilitates appropriate follow-up medical care with the general prac-
titioner and supports the isolated elderly person with limited mobility to
access community resources and services. This is supported by research that
demonstrates that EDs in Australia are appropriate settings for the detection
of mental health problems as the prevalence is high and patients may not
presentelsewhere(Kinneretal.,2005;Scogin&Shah,2006;VanItallie,2005).
This research also stresses the importance of appropriate screening, assess-
ment, and referral processes to ensure adequate support within emergency
health to facilitate consistent patient assessment and ensure appropriate,
ongoing patient care.
Therearelimitationsinherenttothenatureofthisstudy.Theseprimarily
relate to complex factors related to the assessment of elderly patients who
presenttoED,particularlythosewithdepression.Withinthisparticularstudy,
although771patientswereinitiallyscreenedfordepressionand66werefully
assessed, the rate of consent for the participation in ongoing research was
significantly reduced with a final sample of 8 participants. As discussed, this
significantlyreducedthepowerofthisstudy,particularlyrelatedtotheuseof
quantitative measures. However, the corresponding use of both quantitative
and qualitativemeasures in this study ensured that the resultsobtained holis-
tically reflect the experience of the sample recruited, despite this reduced
power. Significant factors that contributed to the reduced number of par-
ticipants recruited for this study included previous psychiatric history and
complex medical needs. This is an area that requires future research to
ensure that the identification of depression in primary care settings for such
patients is accurate and timely.
It was anticipated that the findings of this research would contribute to
knowledge about the psychosocial and cultural factors that may contribute
to the presentation of depression in this patient cohort and about the role
and function of practitioners in the management of depression. It was also
anticipated that this research would illuminate the key outcome indicators
that are significant in directing the most appropriate management of depres-
sion in elderly patients while taking into consideration the needs of the
patient, co-morbid health conditions, and the role of community services.
Most significantly, it was hoped that this research would improve care and
health outcomes for elderly patients. Through the indication of the impor-
tanceofpatienteducationanddepression,physicalmobilityandfunctioning,
and social support, this research suggests that the use of integrated care

approaches to the management of depression in the elderly who present
to ED is essential. This is necessary to improve health outcomes within this
patient population and work to reduce the high associated public health
burden.
Stemming from this research is the recommendation of the need for a
controlled study, with adequate power, into the efficacy of integrated care
approaches to the management of depression in elderly patients presenting
to ED; especially those with multiple medical problems who are socially
isolated and, or, financially vulnerable. This intervention may involve the
four screening questions for depression and Geriatric Depression Scale as
part of routine protocols for integrated care services, in combination with an
immediate treatment response and referral to a general practitioner in the
community for further management. The importance of concurrent linkage
