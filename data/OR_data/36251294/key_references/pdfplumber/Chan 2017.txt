into tai chi qigong (n=24) and standard care control (n=24) groups. The former group under-
went a three-month program of two 60-minute sessions each week, with the socially active
volunteers paired up with them during practice. Standard care included regular home visits by
social workers. Primary outcomes were assessed by means of the Lubben social network and
De Jong Gieveld loneliness scales, and by a revised social support questionnaire. Secondary
outcomes were covered by a mental health inventory and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and
quality of life by using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Data was collected at baseline,
and at three and six months thereafter.
Results: The generalized estimating equations model revealed general improvement in out-
comes among participants on the tai chi qigong program. In particular, participants reported a
significantly greater improvement on the loneliness scale (B=−1.32, 95% confidence interval
[CI] −2.54 to −0.11, P=0.033) and the satisfaction component of the social support question-
naire (B=3.43, 95% CI 0.10–6.76, P=0.044) than the control group.
Conclusion: The pilot study confirmed that tai chi qigong with elderly neighborhood volunteers
is a safe and feasible social intervention for hidden elderly. Its potential benefits in improving
social and psychological health suggest the need for a full-scale randomized controlled trial to
reveal its empirical effects.

from the community and with a poor network of family or

friends. The study implemented a tai chi qigong program
the exercises. They mentioned that the major barriers for the

elderly in practicing tai chi qigong were their poor memory
aimed to provide social contacts for the hidden elderly and
motivate their participation. Results revealed positive effects
in social support outcomes and in the physical health of the
tai chi qigong group. The social support outcomes included
a broadened social network, reduced feelings of loneliness,
and increased satisfaction with perceived social support.
The improvement in physical health also reflects what the
literature identifies as the positive effects of tai chi qigong on
loneliness and perceived social support from friends.13,38 No
adverse effects were reported from the tai chi qigong classes
indicating it was a safe form of exercise for the elderly.
During the first three months, participants in the two study
groups did not show significant changes in the loneliness
scale and satisfaction of social support. However, decreased
feeling of loneliness and increased satisfaction in social
support were noted in the tai chi qigong group at the sixth
month’s follow-up assessment. This might be because the
tai chi qigong participants continued their daily self-practice
with peer volunteers in groups after the completion of tai
chi qigong program, and they eventually became friends,
