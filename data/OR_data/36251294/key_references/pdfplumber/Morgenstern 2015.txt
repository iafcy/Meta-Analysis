Abstract
Background—Women are more likely to live alone compared with men, and therefore have
more difficulty activating emergency medical systems for stroke. The goal of this study was to
examine the benefit of wearing medical alert devices to activate emergency medical systems for
elderly women living alone.
Methods—This was a randomized, controlled pilot trial. Women over 60 with at least 1 stroke
risk factor were recruited from Southeast Michigan. Subjects received either a medical alert device
or control. The primary outcome was change in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) from
baseline to 90 days of wearing the device or control.
Results—A planned sample size of 320 could not be reached and the trial was stopped at 265
women randomized prior to data examination. On average, the treatment group was older,
reported lower prevalence of high cholesterol, and was less likely to complete follow-up. There
was a non-significant smaller loss of healthy days in the past month in the intervention group
(0.46) compared with the control group (2.23), (p=0.213). Similarly, the secondary outcomes of
changes in anxiety, depression and changes in perceived isolation did not differ by treatment and
control groups.
Conclusions—This study did not establish improvement in HRQOL among women who wore
the device compared with those that did not, nor the feasibility of a trial to study the efficacy of
medical alert devices in elderly women. Newer devices that use cellular technology may be more
accepted than the land-line based system used in this study.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability and death throughout the world [1]. Since age
adjusted stroke incidence is higher in men than women [2] the disease is classically
considered a male illness. However, about half of stroke deaths occur in women, and since
women live longer than men they have a higher lifetime stroke risk [2]. Among those that
survive stroke, functional and neurologic outcome is worse in women compared with men
[3]. Effective acute stroke treatment exists, but it is time limited and rapid presentation to the
emergency department is crucial for consideration of acute stroke therapy. Since stroke often
renders speech and movement ineffective, it is frequently an observer who activates
emergency medical services rather than the patient herself [4]. A potential impediment for
elderly women getting to the hospital quickly is that they are more likely to live alone than
men, and therefore a call for help for stroke is less likely to happen compared with someone
who does not live alone [5]. Indeed, people who live alone get to the hospital slower, are
less likely to get the clot dissolving drug, rt-PA, and have worse stroke outcome than those
who do not live alone [5].
A potential way to help women who live alone get to the hospital quickly when they have a
stroke is to have a medical alert device on their body that can be pushed to initiate a call for
emergency medical services. We conducted a single center pilot randomized controlled trial
to determine the feasibility of women wearing such a device. The possibility of reducing
death, disability and expense in women with stroke by using these simple devices suggests
an exciting opportunity to improve public health and reduce the stroke burden in women.
METHODS
This report contains the primary results of the pre-specified analysis of the Women
Independently Living with a Medical Alert Device (WILMA) trial conducted at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, USA. Subjects were randomized to receive the device
or not, and the main outcome measure was Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL)
measured at 90 days. This study was approved by the University of Michigan IRB and all
subjects provided informed consent. This trial was not registered with clinicaltrials.gov since
it was a single center study and registration was not required at the time of study conduct.
Study Subjects
Inclusion criteria were: Women; age ≥80 or age 60–79; ≥1 stroke risk factor (hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, current smoker, prior
stroke or TIA); not currently using a medical alert device/service; has a working home
phone that is compatible with monitoring service; plans to stay in current residence in
Michigan for the duration of the study. Exclusion criteria were: cognitive impairment that
would impede informed consent; living with someone else; residing in a facility that
provided emergent care; living more than an hour by car from Ann Arbor; having an at
home caregiver that provides > 3 hours per day of help.
Subjects were recruited through direct mail, flyers and direct communication at the
University of Michigan Geriatrics and General Medicine Clinics; from the Claude B Pepper

Randomization and Intervention
Eligible subjects were randomized to either the medical assistance device or control in a
block design with block sizes of 4 and 6. Subjects randomized to receive the medical
assistance device were contacted by the local provider, Huron Valley Ambulance (HVA).
HVA is a not-for-profit organization that provides emergency response to the local
community. HVA personnel installed the speakerphone (Visonic Amber® Select) and gave
instructions for its use along with the call button device (Visonic MCT-212) per their
standard protocol. A representative from HVA contacted them to set up an appointment to
install a speakerphone to the subject’s landline phone in their home (attached like an
answering machine). The device works with a range up to 120 meters. Each person also
received a small call button of two designs, a wrist band or a necklace per their preference.
If a person pushed the call button, it would communicate a signal to HVA, who would
respond over the speakerphone device to see if the activation was on purpose. Either no
patient response or a positive response indicating assistance is needed generated immediate
emergency response. During the study those randomized to the device received the device
and monitoring service for free. At the end of 90 days subjects had the option of keeping the
monitoring service at their expense, or having the devices collected by HVA and cease
monitoring. This study was not blinded. Subjects were obviously aware of having the device
or not, and the coordinator obtaining outcome data was aware of the study purpose. Subjects
in both arms of the study were read a list of stroke symptoms after the knowledge of stroke
symptoms was queried.
Data Collected
At baseline subjects in both groups were interviewed in person or over the phone and
provided: demographics (age, race-ethnicity, marital status, socioeconomic status); contact
information (telephone number, address); social isolation/connectedness scale; quality of
life; anxiety; depression; and stroke knowledge questions. At follow-up the same
information was obtained again except for demographics, contact information and stroke
knowledge. In addition, the follow-up interview included: medical utilization
(hospitalizations, ED visits, device activation); use of medical alert devices/service; and
whether they would choose to keep this or a similar device if cost was not an issue.
The primary outcome, quality of life, was measured by the HRQOL instrument developed
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. This instrument, which is
comprised of four questions, captures an individual’s perceived physical and mental health
and has been used in elderly women to assess changes in quality of life over time [6]. The
instrument asks participants to self-report the number of days in the past month when
physical and mental health were not good. The primary outcome was assessed as the total
number of healthy days (physical plus mental). Secondary outcomes included anxiety and
depression as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS
is a short 14-item scale that takes two to five minutes to administer. The HADS has been

shown to be a valid method for assessing anxiety and depression in primary care and general
population settings and has been used in elderly female populations [7]. Items are scored
from 0–3 on a 4-point Likert-type scale, generating a range of 0 to 42 points. Higher scores
represent greater symptom severity. Social connectedness, another secondary outcome was
assessed using social isolation via the Perceived Isolation Index in an elderly population
ages 57–85 [8]. This scale contains questions related to social support and loneliness and has
been shown to have reliability in an elderly population. We modified this scale by removing
questions about spouse or partner, as our population by definition was living alone. Each
item on the scale was scored 1 to 3 and then standardized. The overall index was
summarized as an average of all seven items with higher scores indicating greater perceived
isolation. Stroke knowledge was assessed by asking participants to name stroke warning
signs. We classified stroke symptoms into 5 categories: weakness, numbness, or tingling on
one side of the body; difficulty speaking or understanding speech; headache; dizziness,
lightheadedness, or falls; and vision problems. Participations who were able to recognize 2
or more categories of stroke symptoms were considered to have adequate stroke knowledge
[9].
Statistical Analysis
Sample size was determined using standard calculations for repeated measures ANOVA.
The following assumptions were made: 5% level of significance, 80% power, detectable
difference of 4 healthy days (pre-post difference in quality of life between two treatment
groups), a constant standard deviation of 12 for both groups, and a 0.50 correlation between
pre- and post- time points. Under these assumptions, 143 subjects were needed in each
group. Assuming some loss to follow-up over the course of the study the planned
recruitment was 160 subjects in each group.
Demographic and health characteristics were summarized at baseline by treatment and
control groups. Continuous variables were summarized by means and standard deviations
and compared using t-tests. Categorical variables were summarized by frequencies and
percents and compared using chi-squared tests. Change scores were created for the
difference in number of healthy days (physical plus mental) from pre- to post-intervention
and for the secondary outcomes of anxiety and depression, using the HADS score, and
perceived isolation index. Change scores were then compared by treatment group using
simple linear regression. Among those randomized to the intervention, frequencies and
percents were used to summarize appropriate use of the device. All analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC).
RESULTS
WILMA enrolled its first subject on November 30, 2011 and last on August 5, 2014. While
the goal was to enroll 320 subjects the study was stopped after 265 were enrolled prior to
examining the data, due to slower than anticipated enrollment. Figure 1 is the CONSORT
diagram for the study. Lack of participation was most commonly due to the fact that subjects
either did not have a land-line telephone or already had a medical alert device.

There were 265 women randomized to either the treatment (n=133) or the control group
(n=132). On average, the treatment group was older, reported lower prevalence of high
cholesterol, and was less likely to complete follow-up (Table 1). Overall, women in the
study experienced a mean loss of 1.38 (SD=10.8) healthy days. Women in the treatment
group experienced a smaller loss of health days (0.46; 95% CI: −1.58, 2.50) than women in
the control group (2.23; 95% CI: 0.31, 4.15), but this difference was not significant (Table
2). Similarly, for the secondary outcomes of changes in HADS score and changes in
perceived social isolation, the treatment and control groups did not significantly differ.
Among those women that were randomized to the treatment group, only 1 purposefully used
the device during the study period, and 9 went to the ER or used EMS without the device.
There were no strokes. Half of the women reported wearing the device almost all of the time
and 12% reported never wearing the device. Sixty-nine percent of the women removed the
device for any reason. If cost was not an issue, 53% would want to keep the device.
However, only 17% planned to keep the current device service if they had to pay for it.
DISCUSSION
The WILMA pilot trial did not find a significant improvement in HRQOL in subjects
randomized to receive a medical alert device compared to control. Study recruitment was
slower than anticipated and consequently missed the planned sample size suggesting that a
large randomized trial of medical device use would likely not be feasible in its current form
at a single center. A pivotal study would need to demonstrate that wearing a device reduces
delay times to hospital arrival for stroke patients who live alone.
Due to the available technology when WILMA began, participants were required to have a
land-line telephone. This excluded a large number of potential subjects who only had a cell
phone. Newer technologies, especially those that incorporate cellular signal are likely to not
only enroll subjects more easily but also provide coverage outside of the home. This is an
excellent opportunity for biomedical engineering innovation in neuroscience. The device,
however, must be worn rather than carried like a cell phone since at the time of stroke many
subjects are unable to move, rendering a cell phone that is not physically on the patient
useless. An ideal device would be one that is unobtrusive, easy to wear, inexpensive, able to
transmit in most locations including outside the home, and one that could provide two-way
communication in case of inadvertent activation.
The problem of stroke in women is receiving much needed attention after a long history of
considering stroke a men’s disease [10]. Recent studies that suggest worse stroke outcome in
women compared with men, differential gender response to IV rt-PA, and different stroke
symptoms in men and women all point to the need for more research into stroke prevention
and treatment for women [3,11,12]. WILMA spoke to the evidence that women are less
likely to present to the hospital promptly for acute stroke therapy [13,14] which has not been
found consistently [15]. Since women are more likely to live alone than men, a solution is
needed to help women who have an acute medical emergency to call for help when the
medical emergency prevents movement and/or verbal communication. This is notably
important for diseases with time limited therapies. While stroke is the clearest example of

such a condition and very common, other conditions including myocardial infarction suggest
the public health need for interventions to help women who live alone.
This study had limitations that warrant consideration. There was a greater loss to follow-up
among the intervention compared with the control group which may have implied
dissatisfaction with the device. This was an unblinded study. Since the purpose was to
determine the feasibility of participating and wearing a device it was impossible to mask the
study subjects with a sham device. The outcome assessor was also unblinded although the
primary outcome measure was a structured questionnaire that was not subject to coordinator
interpretation. The study failed to achieve its planned sample size and as such was under
powered to detect a change in the primary outcome. WILMA was a single center study and
results may not generalize to other settings.
In summary, this study did not find improvement in HRQOL in women who received the
device compared to those that did not, perhaps due to a small sample size. The study
suggested a lack of feasibility for a larger trial since enrollment was much slower than
expected. Newer technology that utilize cellular systems, can be worn in any location and is
aesthetically pleasing to women would improve feasibility and may be a solution to
activating emergency medical systems for time-limited acute medical conditions like stroke.
