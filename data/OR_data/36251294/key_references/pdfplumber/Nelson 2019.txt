Abstract
Objective: Cancer and Aging: Reflections for Elders (CARE) is a novel, telephone-delivered
intervention designed to alleviate distress in older cancer patients. This pilot randomized
controlled trial tested the feasibility and initial efficacy of CARE, drawing from age-appropriate
developmental themes and well-established coping theory.
Method: Eligible patients were ≥70 years old; ≥6 months post-diagnosis of lung,prostate, breast,
lymphoma, or gynecological cancer; on active cancer treatment or within 6 months of ending
cancer treatment; and had elevated scores on the Distress Thermometer (≥4) or Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (≥6). Participants completed five sessions of psychotherapy over 7 weeks
with assessments at study entry, post-intervention, and 2 months post-intervention. Primary
outcomes were feasibility and initial efficacy on anxiety and depression; secondary outcomes
included demoralization, coping, loneliness, and spiritual well-being.
Results: Fifty-nine participants were randomized to either the CARE arm (n = 31) or the
enhanced Social Work Control arm (n = 28). The intervention was feasible and tolerable, meeting
a priori criteria for rates of eligibility, acceptance, retention, assessment, and treatment fidelity.
Upon completion of the intervention, participants in the CARE arm demonstrated lower mean
depression scores (d = 0.58 [CI: 0.04–1.12],P = 0.01) and trended towards increased coping-
planning (d = 0.30 [CI: −0.83 to 0.24], P = 0.18). Promising trends in anxiety (d = 0.41 [CI: −0.17
to 0.98], P = 0.10) emerged at 2 months post-intervention; effects for coping-planning dissipated.
Conclusion: These pilot data suggest the CARE intervention is feasibly delivered, potentially
impacts important psychosocial variables, and is accessible for older, frail patients with cancer.
Future research will evaluate this intervention on a larger scale.

1. INTRODUCTION
In 2016, nearly 62% of almost 16 million cancer survivors in the United States were aged 65
or older. By 2040, an estimated 73% of 26 million cancer survivors will be 65 or older.1,2
These are primarily older patients with breast, prostate, and colon cancer, for whom cancer
treatment continues for long periods, analogous to a chronic disease.1 Thus, many older
adults must cope with the demands of both aging and cancer for long periods of continuous
treatment and monitoring.
Patients of all ages struggle to cope with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In a large
study of adult cancer patients of all ages, 35% experienced a significant level of distress; the
rate was even higher for cancer sites associated with poorer prognosis.2 Older people tend to
cope better with illness and loss than younger individuals.2–6 However, the presence of
aging-related physical concerns, comorbidity, and symptom burden can overwhelm coping
abilities, leading to increased distress, anxiety, and depression.7,8 Additionally, comorbid
medical illness is often a key feature of geriatric mood disorders, and older adults with
cancer have some of the highest rates of completed suicide.9 Unfortunately, older adults with
anxiety or depression are likely to remain undiagnosed and thus often go untreated.9–11 But
even if diagnosed correctly, clinicians cannot assure that mental health intervention can or
will be feasible, effective, and safe. Thus, a compelling rationale for the current study was to
introduce and test a pilot intervention to assist older patients in coping with aging and
cancer.
Interventions for older adults with chronic illness have found that while antidepressant
pharmacotherapy is effective to address depressive symptoms, most older adults prefer
psychotherapeutic or psychoeducational interventions over medication.10–12 While there is a
growing psychotherapy evidence base for older adults broadly,13,14 we identified only two
studies focusing on older patients with cancer. In one, a multidisciplinary team offered
treatment to older adults with cancer, including physical therapy, cognitive behavioral
training, symptom education, spiritual guidance, and a 200-page manual.15 The second
study examined a subset of data from the IMPACT study.16 This study tested the use of a
depression care manager who followed patients for 12 months under the supervision of both
a primary care physician and psychiatrist; the authors reported a reduction in depressive
symptoms at 6 and 12 months.16 These are sound interventions with positive outcomes;
however, these were relatively small studies, lacked a theoretically driven intervention, and
were not specifically tailored to the developmental issues related to aging or the needs of
older adults.
The theoretical framework for the Cancer and Aging: Reflections for Elders (CARE)
intervention is based on the integration of two well-established models in the psychosocial
literature: the coping paradigm of Folkman17–19 and the developmental stages of life as
outlined by Erikson20–22 and expanded on by Vaillant.23 Folkman’s model proposes that

people deal with significant distress by using “meaning schemas” or basic beliefs about the
world as rational assumptions for what happens to them. When confronted with a life-
threatening event such as cancer, these assumptions can be shattered. An individual must
develop a new meaning schema that integrates the new catastrophic event with an acceptable
and tolerable “present.” The process of reappraisal, in which an individual revises the
meaning of events in ways that are more consistent with their new situation, is a critical
element of adaptive coping, and we identify it as a core mechanism of the CARE
intervention.17 The theoretical foundation of the CARE model integrates Folkman’s concept
of reappraisal within the context of Erikson’s theory of development in the later stages of
life. Erikson’s 8th stage of life is based on the developmental tasks of establishing comfort
with one’s lived life (i.e., ego integrity) or the alternative—unsuccessful achievements,
which result in despair (i.e., regrets and despondency). “Ego integrity” is achieved by
putting one’s life into a tolerable perspective, and by developing a sense of generativity by
giving back to younger generations. According to the theory, older adults who do not
achieve ego integrity are more likely to experience despair and disdain and have fewer
resources for coping with stressors like cancer.20–22 Thus, the CARE intervention is founded
on joining Folkman’s reappraisal to Erikson’s life stages with the goal of helping older
adults to better cope with the demands of illness and aging to achieve peace and acceptance
of their life stage. This includes helping patients problem solve ways to become more
socially connected and engage in helpful coping.
The primary aim of this pilot RCT was to test the feasibility, toler- ability, and acceptability
of CARE by examining the rates of eligibility, acceptance, and adherence. We hypothesized
that CARE would be feasible, tolerable, and acceptable. An exploratory aim was to examine
the preliminary effects of CARE on measures of psychological well-being compared with a
control group that received an enhanced social work intervention.
2. METHOD
2.1. Study design
Participants were recruited from two Northeastern Comprehensive Cancer Centers, Joan
Karnell Cancer Center at the Pennsylvania Hospital and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSK). This study was approved by the MSK (protocol # 09–116) and Joan Karnell
Cancer Center (protocol # 814950) Institutional Review Boards. This trial was registered at
the US National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) #NCT00984321.
2.2. Participants
Patients eligible for the pilot intervention were (1) 70 years of age or older; (2) ≥6 months
post-diagnosis for breast, prostate, lung, lymphoma, or gynecological cancer and on active
cancer treatment (or within 6 months of active treatment); (3) English-speaking; (4) score of
≥4 on the Distress Thermometer,24 or a score of ≥6 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS25–27); (5) ≥60 on Karnofsky Performance Rating (KPR28); and (6) ≤11 on the
Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration (BOMC29) test.

2.3. Procedure
There was a two-step screening process for this study. The first step was a review of the
medical charts of prospective participants to screen for initial eligibility (ie, age, cancer
diagnosis, and cancer treatment) and, if initial eligibility criteria were met, then these
patients were contacted by letter and follow-up phone calls. Interested participants went
through the second step of the screening process for eligibility by completing the HADS and
Distress Thermometer, KPR, and the BOMC over the phone. Patients who met the distress
criteria then provided verbal consent over the phone and were enrolled to the study. In
following the Code of Federal Regulations Title 45, Part 46, Subpart A, a signed consent
was not required for this study. This study was considered “minimal risk” by our IRB, and
written consent was not required. No participants were ruled out for KPR or BOMC.
Participants were randomized (with equal probability) to either the CARE intervention or the
Enhanced Social Work Control (ESWC). The randomization was stratified by cancer type
(breast, prostate, lung, lymphoma, and gynecological) and gender by the MSK Office of
Clinical Research Protocol Participation Registration system.
Participants were administered a battery of questionnaires at study entry (at the time of
enrollment and within 2 weeks prior to starting the intervention), post-intervention (within 1
month of completing the last intervention session), and at 4-month post-study entry. The
questionnaires were completed over the phone with a research assistant who was blinded to
group assignment. Other research assistants who were not blinded had minimal contact with
the participants and were responsible for consenting participants, screening for distress, and
coordinating the participants’ initial session.
2.3.1. Intervention—The CARE intervention integrated two theoretical models:
Folkman’s cognitive model of coping and Erikson’s developmental model of psychosocial
tasks associated with the later stages of life (Figure 1). Based on the theoretical framework
described above, CARE was developed to encompass several therapeutic approaches to help
patients reappraise their situation in the context of achieving ego integrity. Therapeutic
elements such as information-giving and information- receiving, discussion of concerns,
problem solving, coping skills training, expression of emotion, and social support, are all
structured to help patients put past regrets into a tolerable perspective, and to consider how
to give back to younger generations.
Expert panel: The structure and themes of CARE were originally presented to an expert
panel of older adults with cancer. Over the course of seven meetings, the participants gave
feedback on the relative salience and utility of intervention content. After the manual was
revised with their feedback, the intervention was tested with a second group of older patients
in a group format. They, too, provided feedback and suggestions for modification.
CARE structure: The CARE intervention consisted of five sessions* (45 min; Table 1) that
took place over approximately 7 weeks. All sessions were facilitated by a master’s or
doctoral-level trained mental health professional (four interventionists total). Each session
*The original study protocol included seven sessions; after the first 11 participants completed the interventions (CARE = 7; ESWC =
4), the number of sessions was reduced to 5. This decision was made after discussion by study investigators, as it became clear that the

followed a similar pattern: (1) reviewing the session topic; (2) defining challenges associated
with the topic; (3) exploring “guided questions” surrounding the topic; and (4) assessing
ways to reframe stressful emotions, thoughts, or behaviors; identifying past coping skills or
problem solving related to the challenges. Homework assignments were distributed at the
end of each session.
ESWC structure: The control condition (ESWC), which is currently considered standard of
care, consisted of an initial telephone session with one of several social workers specializing
in geriatrics (six interventionists total) and four subsequent phone calls (spaced at similar
time interval as the CARE arm sessions, ranging from 15 to 30 min) from the social worker
in order to control for the number of sessions held with participants in the CARE arm. Phone
session content after the initial social work assessment was focused on checking in regarding
patient progress on goals and plans set in the initial assessment and general supportive
psychotherapy. Participants in the ESWC who completed the study were given the option to
participate in the intervention arm if interested.
The CARE arm received in-depth training: (1) in-person review of the manual with study
investigators, (2) observation of several cases, and (3) conducting 1 to 2 “mock” cases with
study investigators. CARE therapists received weekly, hour-long ongoing supervision
throughout the course of the study. For ESWC, there was weekly supervision facilitated by
the primary social worker at MSK.
2.3.2. Outcomes—We adopted Leon, Davis, and Kraemer’s (2011) criteria for
demonstrating feasibility in a pilot study. As such, the primary outcome of this pilot study
was the feasibility of the CARE intervention, which was determined by rates of eligibility
(percent screened for participation who were eligible), acceptance (proportion of those who
screen eligible who enroll),† retention (attrition and number of sessions completed by study
arm), assessment process (proportion of planned assessments that are completed by
participants), and treatment fidelity (percentage of session content covered across sessions
by study therapists).
Our benchmark for retention and assessment is 80% such that if 80% of participants
complete all sessions and assessments, then study feasibility will be demonstrated.
We estimated statistical power in the following binomial hypotheses: We assumed a null
hypothesis that the population completion rate is 0.60 and an alternative hypothesis that the
population completion rate is 0.85. If we observe 48 or more completers out of 60 to be
enrolled, we will have a 92% power to reject the null hypothesis of 0.60 at a two-sided type I
error rate of approximately 0.0002.
CARE intervention and ESWC content could be consolidated into five sessions, thus minimizing participant time commitment while
still covering all content in sufficient detail.
†The acceptance rate (the percent of patients who agreed to take part in the study) can easily be calculated. However, many of those
who refused to take part in the study may not have been distressed and would not actually have qualified to take part in the study. In
order to obtain an estimate of the proportion of distressed individuals who we were able to engage in the CARE intervention study, we
implemented a brief substudy for those who refused to participate (see Figure S1).

Research assistants rated fidelity utilizing a standardized adherence checklist form to
evaluate sessions for a subset (60%) of participants in each arm (see supplemental materials
for sample checklist). Treatment fidelity scores range from 0 to 100% based on the number
of manualized session topics that were covered in the session; fidelity of 80 to 100% will be
considered high fidelity.30 The study also examined the impact of CARE on several
psychosocial variables. HADS25 was the primary outcome measure of anxiety and
depression, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.25,31,32 Secondary
outcomes included measures of demoralization (Demoralization Scale; higher scores
indicating worse symptoms33), coping (3 out of 15 subscales from the COPE; higher scores
indicating better coping34), spiritual well-being (FACIT Spiritual Well-Being Scale; higher
scores indicating better well-being35,36), and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale-Short
Form; higher scores indicating worse symptoms37).
2.3.3. Statistical analyses—Analyses were conducted to examine differences in two
primary psychosocial outcomes, depressive symptoms and anxiety, as well as the secondary
psychosocial measures over time by group membership. Given the pilot nature of the data,
the study was not powered to determine significant differences between the intervention and
control groups but was powered to determine feasibility and initial efficacy. As such, both
significance levels and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) are reported (d = 0.2, small; d = 0.5,
medium; and d = 0.8, large effect). ANCOVA was used to identify differences in the
psychosocial variables by arm with group assignment and scores at study entry predicting
the 2- and 4-month scores.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Participants
Sixty-eight participants consented to the study and of those, 59 were randomized (CARE n =
31; ESWC n = 28). Participants were recruited between September 2009 and September
2013 when target enrollment was achieved; follow-up assessments were completed in
February 2014. The sample was approximately evenly split by gender (53% female; n = 33)
with a mean age of 76 (SD = 4). Participants were primarily Caucasian (90%; n = 56) and
well-educated (81% had a college degree; n = 50). Half of the participants were married
(52%; n = 32), 18% were divorced (n = 11) or single (n = 11), and 13% were widowed (n =
8).
3.2. Primary outcomes
3.2.1. Feasibility—There were no adverse events reported throughout the course of the
trial. In total, 541 patients met initial eligibility criteria and were contacted about the study.
Of those, 118 (22%) agreed to be screened for distress and participate in the study. In total,
68 patients (13% of those who met initial eligibility criteria and 58% of those who agreed to
be screened) met distress eligibility and were offered participation in the study. All 68
individuals were consented and enrolled, reflecting a high acceptance rate among those who
met both stages of eligibility.

Ultimately, 59 participants were randomized (Figure S2). Of the 31 participants who started
the CARE intervention, three participants did not complete all sessions (89.3%). In the
ESWC arm, 28 participants initiated the treatment and 1 did not complete all sessions
(96.4%). Fifty-five participants provided follow-up data at the 2-month time point (post-
intervention) across the intervention (n = 28) and control arms (n = 27), and 48 provided
follow-up data at 4-month assessment point (n = 25, n = 23, respectively). Thus, 81.4% (48
out of 59) of participants completed the full number of sessions and the final study
assessment, indicating adequate retention and assessment per our a priori cut-off of 80% as a
benchmark for feasibility. Study attrition rate was not different by group at time 1 or time 2.
Treatment fidelity was 88.5% or higher for all sessions (88.5–94.6%), again exceeding our
threshold of 80% as an indication of high fidelity.
3.2.2. Psychosocial outcomes—At the 2-month assessment (Table 2), the CARE arm
reported lower mean total HADS scores compared with the ESWC arm (d = 0.46 [CI: –0.07
to 0.99], P = 0.02) and lower mean HADS depression scores (d = 0.58 [CI:0.04–1.12], P =
0.01), with no differences related to anxiety (d = 0.15 [CI: –0.38 to 0.68], P = 0.44). The
CARE arm, compared with ESWC, demonstrated promising trends, with small effects for
reduced loneliness (d = 0.19 [CI: –0.34 to 0.72], P = 0.21), disheartenment (d = 0.28 [CI: –
0.25 to 0.08], P = 0.12), and sense of failure (d = 0.26 [CI: –0.27 to 0.79], P = 0.19),
increased meaning (d = 0.22 [CI: –0.75 to 0.31], P = 0.27), and improved coping-planning (d
= 0.30 [CI: –0.83 to 0.24], P = 0.18), although these differences did not reach statistical
significance. Participants in the ESWC arm trended towards larger increases in active coping
(d = –0.28 [CI: –0.25 to 0.81], P = .26).
At 4 months (2 months without either intervention, Table 2), the CARE group continued to
trend towards making gains on main outcome variables. The effect on total HADS scores
remained consistent (d = 0.42 [CI: –0.16 to 0.99], P = 0.09). The CARE arm trended towards
reporting lower anxiety scores compared with ESWC (d = 0.41 [CI: –0.25 to 0.81], P =
0.10), while the observed differences in HADS depression scores lessened (d = 0.28 [CI: –
0.30 to 0.85], P = 0.20). Effect sizes (d) also increased for disheart- enment (d = 0.33 [CI: –
0.25 to 0.91], P = 0.09) and meaning (d = 0.48 [CI: –1.06 to 0.11], P = 0.04), indicating
greater improvement for participants in the CARE arm across constructs. The effects on
coping-planning did not persist (d = 0.04 [CI: –0.61 to 0.54], P = 0.88), and those in the
ESWC arm maintained their increases in active coping (d = –0.43 [CI: –0.15 to 1.01], P = .
10) relative to those in the CARE arm.
4. DISCUSSION
To date, there are no psychotherapeutic interventions specifically designed to address the
emotional distress of older cancer patients. Interventions studied thus far in this population
are designed for the general population and then retrospectively tested in the elderly with
cancer. CARE is the only telephone-facilitated psychotherapy intervention specifically
designed for older cancer patients with the input of older people with cancer. The primary
aim of this pilot study, which was to demonstrate the feasibility of the CARE intervention,
was achieved.

We calculated the acceptance rate in a number of different ways and project that 30% of
those distressed older cancer patients agreed to participate in the study. This 30% needs to
be viewed in the context that our recruitment was conducted by sending an initial invitation
letter and then following up with a phone call to invite participation in the study. We would
have expected a higher recruitment rate if this was done in person in the cancer clinics.
However, we decided to recruit by phone to demonstrate that this recruitment could be
accomplished without in-person contact. We also propose that the potential lower accrual
rate achieved via telephone recruitment may be a reasonable trade-off for this population in
terms of accessing homebound or more physically frail older adults who are not regularly
attending outpatient appointments and may otherwise be overlooked for intervention
participation. In future iterations of the study, we may test varying recruitment methods and
solicit qualitative feedback from older patients about preferences for approaches.
The feasibility of the intervention was supported by the results, which indicate that all of the
patients we contacted who we confirmed were experiencing moderate distress were
interested in the intervention. In developing this intervention, our expert panel emphasized
the importance of feasibility in a successful intervention, highlighting ease of session
scheduling (e.g., telephone sessions compared with having to travel for appointments) and
content of sessions. The pilot data demonstrate the benefits of this flexible, telephone-based
approach as evidenced by the low attrition rate in the CARE arm and the fact that most
participants completed all sessions. Our intervention also needed to be adaptable in multiple
settings where there may be no access to psychiatrists or psychologists. It was therefore
delivered by those with master’s level counseling degrees and proved possible in this pilot
study. Future larger RCTs will also include a range of clinicians. The CARE intervention is
also manualized to help deliver consistency among various therapists. These aims were
achieved as the study utilized several different therapists, all of whom achieved high levels
of treatment fidelity when rated by independent coders.
The second goal of the study was to examine the preliminary effects of the intervention. The
results of this randomized trial comparing CARE to the ESWC intervention (matched for
number of sessions) were encouraging. CARE demonstrated promising trends in
psychosocial outcomes relative to the ESWC, as CARE participants reported reduced
depression, anxiety, and demoralization. In psycho-social interventions, it is common for
effects to decrease following the end of the intervention. While this occurred with HADS
depression scores, the effect remained consistent for total HADS scores and strengthened for
HADS Anxiety, disheartenment, and meaning scores. A future, larger scale study will
potentially include booster sessions in order to enhance and maintain the skills achieved
during the intervention. Moreover, we will examine the CARE treatment content relative to
ESWC in order to try to understand why the ESWC arm reported larger improvements in
active and behavioral disengagement coping skills. It is also important to note that the
effects that were observed emerged when compared against an effective and proven control
group that was run by experienced social workers in psycho-oncology. In sum, these
preliminary results indicate that the CARE intervention has significant promise and warrants
a larger scale RCT.

4.1. Clinical implications
Cancer and Aging: Reflections for Elders is a novel intervention and hypothesized to be
effective for several key reasons. First, it involved feedback and ongoing discussion with
older patients with cancer from the very initial development phases. This iterative process of
elicitation from an expert panel of older adults with cancer speaks to the external validity of
the themes and content of the sessions. With this solid foundation, it is also the first
psychotherapy intervention to incorporate the developmental issues distinctive to older
adults and the combined issues of aging and cancer. Finally, it was developed and tested
through the telephone to reach older patients with cancer who have difficulty getting out of
the house, navigating inclement weather or transportation, or who are geographically
isolated. Thus, CARE has tremendous potential to reach those who are most in need of
intervention.
4.2. Study limitations
Despite the promising findings related to feasibility and preliminary effects on psychological
well-being identified here, as with any pilot study, there are some limitations to
interpretability. First, our sample was predominately White and college-educated. Thus, the
generaliz- ability of the effects and of patient satisfaction with the intervention may be
limited. Future larger trials will include a more racially, ethnically, and educationally diverse
sample in order to tailor the CARE intervention as necessary. Similarly, the homogeneity of
the sample suggests that there may have been a selection bias in who opted to participate in
the study, so future larger scale studies should make concerted efforts to recruit patients with
a range of functional statuses in order to demonstrate acceptability and outcomes in patients
with greater functional impairment. Additionally, we could not reliably compare those
participants who completed the original 7 session format to the later 5 session format; in the
next trial participants will all receive the standard session number. Although all participants
completed pre-randomization and all subsequent study measures over the phone, we did not
explicitly screen for hearing impairments, which will be important in future larger studies to
ensure adequate session engagement. Finally, there were several relevant variables not
captured in the data collected in this study, such as measures of successful aging and
wisdom, which would allow analyses to be conducted on the hypothesized change
mechanism of the CARE intervention; these constructs will be assessed in the next phase of
intervention testing. Further research in a larger study should potentially modify the
intervention to include brief monthly booster calls to help maintain the effects of the
intervention over time.
5. CONCLUSIONS
These pilot data suggest the CARE intervention is feasibly delivered by a range of clinicians
and provides a positive signal that the CARE intervention impacts important psychosocial
variables for older patients with cancer. This novel treatment is unique in that it draws from
age appropriate developmental themes in combination with well-established coping theory
to deliver a targeted intervention for older patients in the oncology setting. Additionally, it
has the potential to be highly accessible to frail older adults who may not be able to attend
in-person sessions with regular frequency. Thus, by developing an intervention from the

demonstrate that it is possible to better serve the needs of our older patients.
