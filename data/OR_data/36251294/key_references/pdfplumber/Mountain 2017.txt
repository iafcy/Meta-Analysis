Abstract
Objectives: to test whether an occupation-based lifestyle intervention can sustain and improve the mental well-being of
adultsaged65yearsorovercomparedtousualcare,using anindividuallyrandomisedcontrolledtrial.
Participants: 288 independently living adults aged 65 years or over, with normal cognition, were recruited from two UK
sitesbetweenDecember2011andNovember2015.
Interventions: lifestyle Matters is a National Institute for Health andCare Excellence recommended multi-component pre-
ventive intervention designed to improve the mental well-being of community living older people at risk of decline. It
involvesweeklygroupsessionsover4monthsandonetoonesessions.
Main outcome measures: the primaryoutcomewas mental well-being at 6 months (mental health (MH)dimensionof the
SF-36).Secondaryoutcomes includedphysicalhealth dimensionsof theSF-36,extent ofdepression(PHQ-9),qualityof life
(EQ-5D)andloneliness(deJongGierveldLonelinessScale),assessedat6and24months.
Results: data on 262 (intervention = 136; usual care = 126) participants were analysed using intention to treat analysis.
MeanSF-36MHscoresat6monthsdifferedby2.3points(95CI:−1.3to5.9;P=0.209)afteradjustments.
Conclusions: analysis shows little evidence of clinical or cost-effectiveness in the recruited population with analysis of the
primary outcome revealing that the study participants were mentally well at baseline. The results pose questions regarding
how preventive interventions to promote well-being in older adults can be effectively targeted in the absence of proactive
