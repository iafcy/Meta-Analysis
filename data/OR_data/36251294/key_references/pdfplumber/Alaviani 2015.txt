abstract
Background: Loneliness is one of the most significant problems during aging. This research has been
done to determine the effect of a multi-strategy program based on Pender’s Health Promotion model to
prevent loneliness of elderly women by improving social relationships.
Methods: In this quasi-experimental study done in 2013 from January to November, 150 old women
suffering medium loneliness referred to Gonabad urban Health Centers were enrolled. Data were
gathered using Russell’s UCLA loneliness questionnaire and the questionnaires based on Pender’s
Health Promotion Model about loneliness. The results were analyzed by descriptive statistics and Chi-
square, T-pair, and independent-T tests through SPSS, version 20.
Results: Loneliness decreased significantly in the interventional group compared to the control group
(P<0.00). In addition, mean scores related to variables of Health Promotion Model (received benefits
and barriers, self-efficacy, interpersonal effectives of loneliness) in both groups were significantly
different before and after the study (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Constructs of Pender’s Health Promotion Model can be used as a framework for planning
interventions in order to anticipate, improve and modify related behaviors related to loneliness in
old women.
