Abstract
Background and Objectives: To examine the primary and secondary outcomes of a theory-driven group bereavement inter-
vention for widowed older adults through a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
Research Designs and Methods: Twelve community centers providing health and social services for elderly people were
randomly assigned to the experimental condition, the dual-process bereavement group intervention-Chinese (DPBGI-C)
and to the control condition, the loss-oriented bereavement group intervention-Chinese (LOBGI-C). Both interventions
comprised weekly, 2-hr sessions for 7 weeks followed by a 4-hr outing in the eighth week. Of 215 widowed older adults
contacted and assessed, 125 eligible participants were interviewed three times—preintervention, postintervention, and at a
16-week follow-up—to assess complicated grief symptoms, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and social support.
Results: Using intention-to-treat analysis, both interventions produced improvements in grief, depression, and social sup-
port, but effect sizes were larger with the DPBGI-C. The participants in the DPBGI-C condition also reported reduced anx-
iety, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness, whereas those in the LOBGI-C condition did not. There were interactions
between intervention type and time with respect to grief, anxiety, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness.
Discussion and Implications: Although traditional LOBGI-C can help to reduce grief and depression in bereaved older
adults, the DPBGI-C was found to be superior as it had a greater and more extensive impact on outcomes. This is the first
study of the effectiveness of this evidence-based, theory-driven intervention for widowed Chinese older adults and has
implications for theory building and practice.

included in the analysis, regardless of subsequent attendance

19.2% participants had missing data, 20 imputations (and
50 iterations) were conducted (White, Royston, & Wood,
2011). Background variables (i.e., participants’ age, gender,
education level, cause of bereavement, time since bereave-
ment, and age of the deceased) and behavioral variables (i.e.,
grief, anxiety, depression, social and emotional loneliness and
perceived social support at all three time-points) were entered
into the model used to estimate the missing data. We then
