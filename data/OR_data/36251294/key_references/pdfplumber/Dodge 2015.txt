Abstract Introduction: Increasingsocialinteractioncouldbeapromisinginterventionforimprovingcogni-
tive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether
conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-
friendlyinteractiveInternetinterfacehadhighadherenceandapositiveeffectoncognitivefunction
amongolderadultswithoutdementia.
Methods: Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial
period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview.
Thecognitivestatusofnormalsubjectsandthosewithmildcognitiveimpairmentwasoperationally
defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini

ization.Thesubjectswererecruitedusingmass-mailinginvitations.Thepre-topostinterventiondif-

Results: Eighty-threesubjectsparticipated(41intheinterventiongroupand42inthecontrolgroup).

There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among
the intervention group was 89% (range 77%–100%). Among the cognitively intact participants,
the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test

Conclusion: Dailyconversationsbywayofuser-friendlyInternetcommunicationprogramsdemon-

Allparticipants completedthepre- andpost-trial neuro-

adherence was 89% (range 77%–100%). All subjects

weekfinalassessments.
3.3. Outcomemeasures
The results of the linear regression models in which the
outcome was the differences in the test scores between the
baseline and post-trial assessments (post-trial score minus
the baseline score) with the study group as the independent
variable and controlling for depressive symptoms (geriatric
depressionscale,15-itemscale),arelistedinTable4.Theco-
