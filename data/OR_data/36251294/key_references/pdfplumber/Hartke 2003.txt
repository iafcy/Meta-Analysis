Telephone Group Intervention for
Older Stroke Caregivers
Robert J. Hartke and Rosemarie B. King
Purpose: This study evaluated the effectiveness of telephone groups for older, spousal caregivers of stroke
survivors. Method: The 88 caregivers were mostly white females who were 70 years old on average and
who had been providing care for an average of 3 years. Participants were randomized to treatment or con-
trol conditions, followed for 6 months, and assessed for depression, burden, loneliness, stress, and com-
petence. Treatment participants engaged in an eight-session psychoeducational telephone group. Results:
Treatment participants showed decreased stress over time but were not significantly different from control
participants in the amount of change in stress. Control participants showed a significant increase in bur-
den during the study; treatment participants showed a significant increase in competence. Key words: care-
