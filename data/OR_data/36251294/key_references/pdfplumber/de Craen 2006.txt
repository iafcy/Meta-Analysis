help from others’’. In scoring the GARS, the use of assistive
devices is allowed. We used the sum of the five GARS
questionsfromthemobilitycategory,thefouritemsfromthe
meal preparation category, and the four items from the
personal care category as primary outcome measures. The
minimum of the sum of the included GARS items is 13,
indicating optimal performance in the three domains.
Conversely,aGARSscoreof52indicatesinabilitytoperform
any of the 13 items independently. Secondary outcome
measures included the three subcategories of the GARS, the
participant’s well-being as assessed by Cantril’s ladder [11],
and loneliness as assessed by the de Jong-Gierveld question-
naire [12]. On Cantril’s ladder, participants assess their own
well-beingbygivingamarkbetween1and10,where1isthe
worst possible well-being and 10 the best. The de Jong-
Gierveld questionnaire consists of 11 items on perceived
loneliness, wherehigher scoresindicate moreloneliness.
Sample Size
We estimated that 86 participants in each group would be
needed to detect a three-point difference (SD, 7 points) on
the GARS (a, 5%; b, 80%). At age 85, a difference of three
points in the GARS score represents a difference in
functioning of about 2 y. The group size would need to be
193 to detect a two-point difference. We considered these
calculations to be conservative since the primary analysis
would beperformedon repeatedmeasurements.
