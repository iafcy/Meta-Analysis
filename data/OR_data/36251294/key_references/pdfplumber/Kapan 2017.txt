Abstract
Background: Due to the demographic ageing process and the increasing numberof pre-frail and frail individuals,
new lifestyle interventions to enhance thequality of life (QoL) in community-dwelling older adults are necessary.
Therefore, we performed a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare effects of a lay-led home-based physical
andnutritionalinterventionprogrammewithsocialsupportaloneondifferentQoLdomainsincommunity-dwelling
pre-frailandfrailolderadults.
