Abstract
Objectives: Information and communication technology holds promise in terms of providing support and reducing isola-
tion among older adults. We evaluated the impact of a specially designed computer system for older adults, the Personal
Reminder Information and Social Management (PRISM) system.
Design, Setting, and Participants: The trial was a multisite randomized field trial conducted at 3 sites. PRISM was com-
pared to a Binder condition wherein participants received a notebook that contained paper content similar to that contained
in PRISM. The sample included 300 older adults at risk for social isolation who lived independently in the community
(M = 76.15 years). Primary outcome measures included indices of social isolation, social support, loneliness, and well-
age
being. Secondary outcome measures included indices of computer proficiency and attitudes toward technology. Data were
collected at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-randomization.
Results: The PRISM group reported significantly less loneliness and increased perceived social support and well-being at
6 months. There was a trend indicating a decline in social isolation. Group differences were not maintained at 12 months,
but those in the PRISM condition still showed improvements from baseline. There was also an increase in computer self-
efficacy, proficiency, and comfort with computers for PRISM participants at 6 and 12 months.
Discussion: The findings suggest that access to technology applications such as PRISM may enhance social connectivity and reduce
loneliness among older adults and has the potential to change attitudes toward technology and increase technology self-efficacy.

of older adults, especially those who have mobility restric-
tions, live alone, or live in rural locations. Findings from
studies that have examined the impact of ICT access on
outcomes related to quality of life and well-being in older
adult populations are mixed. Some have found that pro-
viding older adults with access to technology applications
has no impact on well-being (Dickinson & Gregor, 2006;
Slegers, van Boxtel, & Jolles, 2008; White et al., 2002),
whereas others have shown that access improves quality of
life and reduces feelings of loneliness (Choi, Kong, & Jung,
2012; Cotton, Anderson, & McCullough, 2013). These dis-
crepancies may be due to variation in study populations,
technologies examined, and outcome measures. Moreover,
only a few studies have used randomized designs with
concurrent controls, included long-term follow-up, large
diverse samples, or used systems that were designed to
accommodate older adults.
The objective of this multisite trial was to gather rigorous
evidence about the value of a specially designed computer Figure 1. PRISM home page.

Most PRISM participants found PRISM useful in their
daily life (82%), indicated that PRISM made their life
easier (80%), improved their daily life (84%), and ena-
bled them to accomplish tasks more quickly (73%).
They also found PRISM easy to use (88%) and easy
to become skilled at using PRISM (80%). In fact, 60%
indicated that they felt comfortable using PRISM within
1 week. Most found the E-mail feature valuable (85%),
using the Internet valuable (82%), the Classroom feature
valuable (80%), and the Games as valuable (77%). Only
57% found the Photo feature valuable and 51% found
the Calendar valuable. Of those who received the Binder,
89% found the information and tips valuable and 87%
found the community resource information valuable and
about half (58%) found the Calendar valuable. In con-

games were valuable.
