The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a yoga intervention
to improve the mental and physical well-being of older adults. The practice
of yoga is holistic because it can help address issues of the body, mind, and
spirit. In addition to the physical benefits of the practice of yoga, philosoph-
ical teachings, meditation, introspection, and self-study may stimulate the
mind and increase hope, thereby reducing anxiety and helping to prevent
or reduce the chance of depression. If an older adult can improve his or her
physical functioning, it may increase not only his or her mental well-being
but also his or her capacity for independent living. Regular physical activity

can postpone disability and decrease morbidity and mortality, thus poten-
tially counterbalancing some of the negative effects associated with aging
(Lautenschlager, Almeida, Flicker, & Janca, 2004).
Yoga’s self-regulatory approach (Singh, 2006) is congruent with the
strengths-based perspective in social work, which focuses on the individ-
ual’s own strengths and capacities. Yoga encourages the individual to take
responsibility for his or her own care, possibly reducing the dependence on
a physician or the use of medication (Singh, 2006). Furthermore, yoga con-
nects to and strengthens parts of the self that lead to greater contentment.
One of the principle philosophies of yoga is that everything that one needs
psychologically and spiritually comes from within. The yogic philosophies
encouragepersonstolookwithinthemselvesfortheirownhappiness,rather
than looking for external means of gratification.
Many of the studies that examine yoga as an intervention address the
physical and mental health conditions that affect the older adult population,
for example, depression, anxiety, stress, and low blood pressure; however,
only eight studies specifically targeted older adults (Brown, Koziol, & Lotz,
2008; Chen et al., 2008; Chen & Tseng, 2008; Chen, Tseng, Ting, & Huang,
2007; Haber, 1983; Krishnamurthy & Telles, 2007; Lee, 2006; Oken et al.,
2006). Of these studies, only two used a control and/or comparison group
(Krishnamurthy & Telles, 2007; Oken et al., 2006). With the exceptions of
Krishnamurthy and Telles (2007), who looked specifically at depression, and
Oken et al. (2006), who examined cognition and quality of life, there are
no studies that included a mental health–related outcome in older adults.
Although the study conducted by Krishnamurthy and Telles (2007) showed
positive results for yoga reducing depression in a controlled study, these
findings may be limited to their study population, which was older Indian
personslivinginaresidentialfacilityinIndia.Pilkington,Kirkwood,Rampes,
and Richardson (2005) found in their systematic literature review that none
of the studies examining yoga as an intervention for depression included
participants older than age 50. Thus, there are no studies looking at yoga as
an intervention for depression in older adults except for older persons living
in a residential facility in India.
METHODS
Research Design
This study followed a pretest–posttest control-group design with a random
assignment of older adults to either a yoga intervention or a socialization
comparison group. The entire intervention was conducted on three separate
occasions and occurred at a Section 202 US Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) 60-unit low-income senior housing building in

a suburban area of Philadelphia. The data were collected on-site at the
senior housing building by a nurse practitioner on three separate occasions
(October 2007, January 2008, and March 2008).
The target population was adults age 60 and older who live indepen-
dently in the community. The goal was to test yoga as an intervention in the
general older adult population, rather than in a population with a specified
illness or condition, in order to include as many participants as possible.
The study population was the residents of the low-income housing build-
ing as well as their friends and/or family. A senior housing building was
selected to minimize the difficulty of transportation and inconvenience for
the participants. Individuals were ineligible if they were bedbound, age 59
or younger, currently participating in a yoga program, or unable to follow
verbal commands in English.
Thisstudyutilizedconveniencesampling.Recruitmentbeganwithpost-
ing and distributing flyers to each resident, holding informational sessions,
and the researcher attending the building’s social and community events.
The building social worker and building manager also helped promote
awareness through word of mouth. Recruitment was considered exhausted
after each eligible resident was contacted personally either by the researcher
or the building social worker. If the resident expressed interest in participat-
ing, she or he was instructed to show up during the enrollment period.
The housing complex had 65 residents at the time of the study, 51 of
whom were eligible. Of the 51 eligible residents, 18 (33.3%) enrolled in the
study. All (100%) of the potential participants that were screened met the
eligibility criteria. The sample contained a total of 18 participants, with 8
assigned to the yoga group and 10 assigned to the social group.
Intervention
The participants assigned to the yoga group were asked to participate in
eight yoga sessions, which were held twice a week for four weeks. Each
sessionlasted1hourandconsistedof45minutesofposturingandbreathing
and 15 minutes of relaxation and teachings. The yoga intervention was held
on-site at the housing building. A treatment manual that was created for the
implementation of the intervention was developed in consultation with a
nurse practitioner, a registered yoga teacher (RYT) experienced in teaching
classes to older adults, and an exercise physiologist.
The participants who were assigned to the socialization comparison
group attended hour-long sessions twice a week for four weeks where they
were shown movies that were administered by the researcher. The partic-
ipants in the socialization group were asked to continue with their daily
routines and activities, to not participate in yoga classes, and to not discuss
any of the parts of the intervention with the experimental group.

Measures
DEPRESSION MEASURE
Depression was assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), which has been widely used in stud-
ies of depression in later life. The CES-D has a possible range of 0–10,
with a higher score indicating a higher level of depression. In older adults,
the 10-item CES-D was reported to have sensitivity at 100%, specificity at
93%, and positive predictive value at 38% (Irwin, Artin, & Oxman, 1999).
The internal consistency reliabilities for this study at pre- and posttest were
α = .80 and α = .82, respectively.
MORALE MEASURE
Morale was measured by the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale-
Revised (PGMS), a 17-item scale designed to measure psychological well-
being in older adults in three factors: agitation, attitude toward one’s own
aging,andloneliness.Thepossiblerangeis0–17,withahigherscoreindicat-
ingalowerlevelofmorale.ThePGMShasareportedreliabilityof0.81–0.85.
Grann (2000) documented an average correlation of 0.73 with nine other
measures of well-being. The internal consistency reliabilities for this study at
pre- and posttest were α = .86 and α = .86, respectively.
HOPE MEASURE
Hope was measured using the Herth Hope Index (HHI; Herth, 1992),
a 12-item index that measures areas of an individual’s inner sense of
temporality and future, inner positive readiness and expectancy, and inter-
connectedness with self and others. The possible range of scores is 12–48,
with a higher score indicating a lower level of hope. The HHI has a reported
reliability between 0.88 and 0.97 and a reported criterion validity between
0.73 and 0.92 (Grann, 2000). The internal consistency reliabilities for this
study at pre- and posttest were α = .88 and α = .84, respectively.
SOCIAL ISOLATION MEASURE
Isolation was measured by using the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. It has
a possible range of 3–9, with a higher score indicating a higher level
of loneliness. The UCLA Loneliness Scale is correlated with the 20-item
Revised–UCLA Scale at 0.82 (Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2004).
This version of the scale was developed specifically for older adults and has
a reported alpha of 0.72. The internal consistency reliabilities for this study
at pre- and posttest were α = .76 and α = .86, respectively.

BALANCE MEASURE
The one-leg stand is a test used to measure balance (Gehlsen & Whaley,
1990; Kaye et al., 1994; Oken et al., 2006). Participants are asked to stand on
onelegwiththeireyesopenforaslongastheycan.Thescoreisdetermined
by the average duration, in seconds, the participant stands on each leg. The
longer the duration, the greater the participant’s balance. For this study, the
test–retest reliability for this measure was r = .63 (p < .04).
LOWER BODY STRENGTH MEASURE
The sit-to-stand test is widely used (Guralnik et al., 1994; Oken et al., 2006)
to measure lower body strength. The seated participant is asked to stand
without the use of his or her arms. If the participant is successful, then she
or he is timed doing it five more times. The score is the total time it took to
stand from sitting. A shorter time indicates greater lower body strength. The
test–retest reliability for the lower body strength measure for this study was
r = .61 (p < .02).
FLEXIBILITY MEASURE
The sit-and-reach test (Hoeger, 1992; Hong, Li, & Robinson, 2000; Hui,
Yuen, Morrow, & Jackson, 1999; Oken et al., 2006; Shephard, Berridge, &
Montelpare, 1990) was designed to measure flexibility in the hamstrings and
lower back. The participant is asked to sit on the floor in with his or her legs
in a V shape. A ruler is placed to measure how many centimeters she or he
can reach forward. The score is the number of centimeters the participant
is able to reach, with a higher score indicating a higher level of flexibility.
Thetest–retestreliabilityfortheflexibilitymeasureforthisstudywasr = .20
(p > .05).
RESULTS
Demographic Information
Participants were primarily Caucasian (72.2%); the remainder of the partici-
pants were African American (27.8%). The majority of the participants were
female (88.9%). The mean age of the participants was 74.9 years (SD = 8.4),
with a range of 62–91 years. The mean years of education for the partici-
pants was 13.6 (SD = 2.7), with a range of 8–18 years. Sixty-one percent
of the participants were Protestant, with the remainder of the participants
self-identified as “other.” The majority (72.2%) of the participants reported
religion as “very important,” 16.7% reported religion as “somewhat impor-
tant,” and 11.1% reported religion as “not important.” The average income

was $952 per month (SD = 319.02), with a range of $561–$1,532. One par-
ticipant (5.6%) was married, seven (38.9%) were widowed, four (22.2%)
were divorced, and five (27.8%) had never married. Statistical analyses were
nonsignificant between the yoga and comparison groups with regard to
demographics (see Tables 1 and 2).
To determine if the intervention and treatment groups differed with
regard to the dependent variables, independent t tests were conducted
between group membership and the pretest scores of the CES-D, the PGMS,
the HHI, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the one-leg stand test, the sit-to-stand
test, and the sit-and-reach test. The results showed that the PGMS was

significantly different at pretest, with the yoga group showing much lower
levels of morale than the social group. No other significant differences in
pretest scores existed between the two groups.
The overall attendance rate for the entire study was 71.5%. The atten-
dance rate was higher for those who were assigned to the yoga group
(78.1%) than to the social group (66.4%), with the average number of ses-
sions attended by each participant being 6.3 for the yoga group and 5.3 for
the social group (out of 8 sessions). Attendance adherence steadily declined
by wave for the overall study and for both groups (yoga group: October
2007 = 91.7%, January 2008 = 70.8%, March 2008 = 68.8%; social group:
October 2007 = 91.7%, January 2008 = 65.6%, March 2008 = 41.6%). The
overall mean number of sessions attended was 7.3 for October 2007, 5.4 for
January 2008, and 4.2 for March 2008.
At the time of pretest, the overall the mean score for all the partici-
pants for the CES-D was 2.39 (SD = 2.5). For level of morale, the mean
score of the PGMS for all the participants at pretest was 5.72 (SD = 4.32).
The mean score for the HHI for all the participants at pretest was 17.39
(SD = 5.18). The mean score of the UCLA Loneliness Scale for all the
participants at pretest was 5.17 (SD = 1.69).
The overall mean for the participants for the one-leg stand score at
pretest was 5.45 seconds (SD = 3.29). The mean score for the sit-to-stand
test was 20.41 seconds (SD = 13.24), with a range of 38. The overall mean
score for the sit-and-reach test at the time of pretest was 24.85 centimeters
(SD = 10.01), with a range of 36.5. With the exception of the sit-and-reach
test, more variance in the scores for the yoga group existed than for the
social group, indicating a wider range of functioning for the participants in
the yoga group than in the social group.
Comparison of Group Scores at Posttest
The yoga group showed improvement from pre- to posttest in all the mea-
suresofmentalwell-being(CES-D,PGMS,HHI,andUCLALonelinessScale).
The yoga group also showed improvement in the sit-to-stand and the sit-
and-reach tests. A slight decrease was present in the score for the one-leg
test, but it was not significant. The social group also showed improvement
from pre- to posttest in all the measures of mental well-being (again, CES-D,
PGMS, HHI, and UCLA Loneliness Scale), and showed improvement in the
sit-and-reachtest.However,thesocialgroupshowedadeclineintheone-leg
and sit-to-stand tests.
Paired t tests were also conducted for each group to understand the
differences between pre- and posttest. Statistical significance existed for
improvement in the loneliness scale for the socialization group (p = .025),
and a trend toward significance for the yoga group in the measures of sit-to-
stand(p=.085)andsit-and-reach(p=.066).Noothersignificantdifferences

paired t tests by group.
Based on the results of an independent t test, no significant differences
existed in any of the dependent variables between the groups. However,
unlike at pretest, at posttest the measure of PGMS was not significantly
different between the two groups. This indicates a decreasing gap in the
scores from pre- to posttest. The mean scores for pre- and posttest by group
are presented in Table 4.
DISCUSSION
Despite the ongoing demand for evidence-based practice, intervention
research continues to have practical difficulties that were found through-
out this study. Researchers have been urged to share with their colleagues
struggles and successes in regard to recruitment and not to underestimate
the difficulty in recruiting frail older adults into research (Harris & Dyson,
2001). Although this study yielded little statistically significant results, there
is value in highlighting challenges faced by intervention researchers. This
study failed to meet its desired sample size, even though many strategies
suggested by other researchers were incorporated: providing a monetary
incentive; conducting the study at the participants’ home, which negated the
need for transportation; and using the same person to observe the pre- and
post measures in order to minimize participant confusion (Arean, Alvidrez,
Nery,Estes,&Linkins,2003).Asnotedpreviously,recruitingwasconsidered
exhausted after every eligible resident had been contacted.

In fact, some strategies for successful recruitment and retention may
negatively impact other methodological issues of the study. For example, to
avoid transportation problems, this study was conducted on-site at a senior
housing building, as suggested by past researchers (McNeely & Clements,
1994). However, this type of design also increases the threats to validity
because it increases the chance of contamination and reactivity to selection.
Perhaps one of the prices to pay for recruiting participants at the site of
their residence is the issue of contamination. When the intervention and
the comparison groups share living space, the participants will undoubtedly
see and/or talk about the elements of the study. In this study, it was com-
mon for the participants to try to attend the group to which they were not
assigned or to look into the room while the session was being conducted.
Because the members of the comparison group were aware of their sta-
tus, there was a potential for the so-called John Henry effect. Researchers
need to be aware and carefully weigh the potential ramifications of location
when considering where to recruit and conduct an intervention study. If
researchers decide to conduct an intervention study at a site that presents
these complications, they must be vigilant about minimizing possible con-
tamination. Conducting a study where participants report to a research site
at assigned times may minimize some of these risks. Another strategy to
possibly reduce contamination is to consider how the study is advertised.

In this study, it was described as a study to test yoga. As a result, being
assigned to the yoga group became the preferred group. It may have been
wiser to simply state that the study would compare two different types of
group socialization.
Many other barriers to recruiting participants are worth discussing. First,
many potential participants voiced a fear of physical strain or medical condi-
tionsasareasonfordecliningtobeinthestudy.Thus,themisunderstanding
ofthecomponentsoftheinterventionpresentedasabarriertoparticipation.
Althoughitwascontinuallystressedthatyogacanbehelpfulforchronicand
painful conditions, can be modified to meet the needs of the most severely
impaired person, and is not physically demanding and would be conducted
while seated, there was still a great deal of reluctance. Studies involving
physical activity may also pose some special challenges when recruiting par-
ticipants (Jancey et al., 2006), especially when targeting older adults. Thus,
for treatments and interventions that require physical activity, coaxing, edu-
cation, and continual explanation and/or a lengthier recruitment period may
be necessary.
It is worth noting that reluctance to engage in mental health treatment
was not given as a reason for not enrolling in the study. This could be
because of a lack of knowledge of what yoga is and what the interven-
tion entailed. Although yoga philosophy essentially mirrors many aspects of
cognitive behavioral therapy, it is a way of “hiding the peas in the mashed
potatoes,” so to speak. If activities that promote self-awareness can be con-
tinued to be validated for the improvement of mental well-being, then yoga
could be an ideal alternative and an adjunct treatment for those opposed to
conventional mental health treatment.
Although the dropout rate for this study was only one 1 of 18 (5.6%),
recruitment and retention of participants became increasingly difficult as the
study progressed. Recruitment in the first wave required only flyers and
informational sessions. The participants were eager to learn more about
the study and sought out the researcher. However, for the third wave, per-
sonal invitations and continual follow up were necessary for enrollment
and retention, which required that the researcher seek out the participants.
Although the third wave required a more aggressive recruitment strategy,
it still yielded a lower enrollment rate than the previous waves. This trend
may be something that other researchers conducting intervention studies in
similar populations may want to closely monitor. It may be related to the
notion that health affects retention. Other research findings have suggested
that intervention adherence was significantly correlated with baseline mea-
sures of depression, fatigue, and the physical components of health-related
quality (Flegal, Kishiyama, Zajdel, Haas, & Oken, 2007). Other researchers
may want to ensure that the data collection period is sufficient for the
researchers to recruit adequate numbers depending on the self-rated health
of the population, and if the study involves physical exercise.

Itisalsothepossiblethatthelackofstatisticallysignificantfindingsfrom
this study may be attributed to the length of the intervention. It is possible
that the intervention was not long enough to engender change in older
adults, and that a more sustained intervention is needed to make an impact
on mental and physical health. Given the initial improvements and some of
the trends toward significance for some of the measures, it is possible that
that a more sustained intervention would have produced significant results.
In addition to the implications of sample size, several other limitations
to this study are worth noting. The treatment integrity of the intervention
was compromised because the sessions needed to be modified according
to the participants’ abilities and comfort level. For example, the intervention
included standing poses to increase balance. However, some of the partici-
pants were hesitant to stand, so the entire sessions were conducted seated.
Given this, it is no surprise that there was no improvement in the balance
scores. In addition, this might mean that there was insufficient stimulation
for the higher-functioning participants. It will be necessary to modify prac-
tices in order to simulate similar effects in participants to meet the needs of
a wide range when there are no cutoff scores at pretest.
One limitation to the external validity of this study is that the sample
was self-selected. Because the study utilized convenience sampling, all the
participants showed interest in the study. Thus, the findings of the study
may not be generalized to all older adults who might not be as willing to
engage in such a study. In this study, for example, those who were severely
depressed, isolated, or physically disabled may have not been eligible or
interested and/or the adherence and retention rates could have differed.
Althoughthisstudyproducedlittlestatisticallysignificantresults,thereis
valueinit.Thisstudycanalsoserveasapilotforotherstudies.First,ittested
the feasibility of the treatment manual. Given that the intervention could not
be carried out in the way it was originally designed because of the partic-
ipants’ comfort level, the treatment manual can be adapted for persons with
specific conditions. The target population in this study (older adults living in
the community) may have been too broad to test for efficacy. Modifications
for specific conditions, both mental and physical, can be developed and
tested.Becausea4-weekperiodmaynothavebeenlongenoughtoproduce
significant results, the intervention can also be tested for dosage to ascertain
how much of an intervention is needed to achieve the desired outcomes.
Second, the study addresses the needs of older adults in a holistic manner,
acknowledging the mind-body-spirit connection. Interventions focusing on
strengths of individuals may have some impact on overall well-being.
Lastly, much of the merit of this study stems from the lessons learned
concerning what was done well and what could have been improved to
increase recruitment and retention for studies targeting older populations.
Special efforts for recruitment as well as the location of the study need to
be carefully considered when designing studies. Another possibility is to

reconsider the design of the study if such a small sample size is attained.
Although we attempted to carry out a methodologically rigorous study, the
reality is that the state of knowledge at that time in this area could have
merited a more exploratory and uncontrolled design, or even a series of
single system designs. Although these designs produce concerns of validity,
some data would be better than no data when a sample size precludes any
meaningful statistical analysis.
It is hoped that offering the lessons learned in this study to other
researchers will add to the knowledge base of conducting more effective
intervention studies. In order to conduct intervention studies for community
samples, realistic and practical feedback is essential to continually increase
and develop trustworthy knowledge in what is effective in serving older
adults.
