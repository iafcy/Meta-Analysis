1.Introduction
Between2010and2030thenumberofolderadultsintheUnitedStatesisprojectedto
morethandouble,withtheoverallfastestgrowingsegmentbeingthoseage85andolder
(DHHS, 1991). This shift in US demographics towards an older society has motivated a
growing body of research in human–computer interaction for older adults over the last
decade.Whilesomestudieshavefoundthatolderadultsembracenewtechnology,others
haveconcludedthatmanyolderadultshavesignificantproblemsusingstandardcomputer
interfaces. The burden of physical and cognitive impairments in this age group may
explainsomeofthedifficultiesolderadultshaveusingcomputers.Computeranxietymay
also be one of many factors that have led to a low adoption rate of computers by older
adults.Asagroup,adultsage55andoverownfewercomputersthananyotheradultage
group. Only 25.8% of senior households have a computer compared to 46.0–54.9% for
adultsaged25–54.AccesstotheInternetlagsaswell:14.6%ofallseniorhouseholdshave
Internet access compared to30.1–35.0% for adults aged 25–54(NTIA, 1999).
Embodiedconversationalagents(ECAs)—animatedcomputercharactersthatsimulate
face-to-face conversation with users (Cassell et al., 2000)—may constitute an especially
effective form of human–computer interface for older adults. One skill that many older
adultsretain,evenwithsignificantcognitiveimpairment,istheabilitytoengageinface-
to-face conversation. This primal form of interaction is learned in infancy and early
childhood and comprises tacit, crystallized knowledge in older adulthood. The ability to
engage others is thus available even when individuals have difficulty learning new
interfacesthatrequiremoreadaptive,‘fluid’intelligence(Horn,1982).Face-to-facedialog
ismulti-modal.Itincorporatesawiderangeofnon-verbalandparaverbalbehaviortocarry
semanticcontentredundantlywithspeech,enablingindividualswithimpairmentsinsome
channels (e.g. hearing) to compensate by attending to redundant information in other
channels (e.g. hand gesture). Face-to-face dialog also has well-established repair
mechanisms that enable listeners to request repetition or clarification by a speaker (e.g.
communicatedbytheabsenceofgroundingbehaviorsuchasaheadnod;ClarkandKrych,
2004).Finally,thisformofinteractionhasmechanismsforconstrainingtheinteractants’

Suchinterfacesmovebeyondtheparadigmofcomputerastool,tomakesystemsthat
are delightful andengaging sothatuserswant touse them over and overagain,andthat
they will trust and really care about, as well as feel cared for by them (Cassell and
Bickmore, 2003; Bickmore and Picard, 2004). Although many studies of social and
embodiedagentshaveshowntheseeffectsinbriefinteractions(DehnandMulken,2000),
an important question raised by this research is whether these results are durable or not;
that is, they may simplybe the resultof anoveltyeffect that quickly wears off.
In our work, we have developed a relational agent that plays the role of an exercise
advisor, designed to be used by older adults in their homes on a daily basis over an
extendedperiodoftime.Onereasonweselectedthisapplicationdomainisthatthedaily
protocol—driven by the current government recommendations for daily physical
activity—provides ample contact time to establish a social relationship with users over
the duration of the study. In addition, older adults are in particular in need of physical
activity interventions: only 12% of adults over 75 get the minimum level of physical
activity currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
65% report no leisure time physical activity (DHHS,2000).

humanoid animated agents—as developed in this work—but they can also be non-
humanoid or embodied in various physical forms including robots, wearables and hand-
held computers. Central to the notion of relationship is that it is a persistent construct,
spanningmultipleinteractions;thus,relationalagentsareexplicitlydesignedtoremember
past history and manage future expectations in their interactions with users. Finally,
relationships are fundamentally social and emotional, and detailed knowledge of human
social psychology must be incorporated into these agents if they are to effectively build
relationships with usersin the most natural manner possible.

Although some forms of relationship can be constructed without language (e.g.
‘relationships’ with pets) language is crucial for the development and management of
human relationships (Duck, 1994). Given this, our agent uses natural language and
synchronizednon-verbalconversationalbehaviortocommunicatewithusers.Userinput,
however,ismoreproblematic.Whilewewouldliketouseunconstrainedspeechinput,we
find the state of the art in speech recognition (especially for older adults) and natural
languageunderstanding(especiallyforunconstrainedsocialdialog)doesnotsupportthis.
Consequently, we offer users on-screen, multiple-choice inputs, dynamically updated

3.1. Dialog systems for healthcommunication with olderadults
A number of dialog systems have been developed for older adults, particularly in the
area ofhealth communication.

output and touch-tone input to promote exercise adoption (Jarvis et al., 1997). Weekly

medical care’ control group received printed information on the benefits of walking.
Subjects in the intervention group who walked 15min or less at baseline significantly
increased the number of minutes walked at the end of the intervention compared to
controls.Inaddition,subjectswereverysatisfiedwiththesystem,givingitascoreof8.6

rated their satisfaction as10 of10.
A number of automated reminder systems have been developed for older adults with
mildtomoderatecognitiveimpairment.Perhaps,themostsophisticatedsystemdeveloped
in this area is Autominder, which incorporates sensing, planning and scheduling
capabilities to adapt to the activities of the older adult user (Pollack et al., 2003).
Autominder also communicates to its users in natural language, and uses a custom text
generation algorithm to generate reminders that are as effective and non-repetitive as
possible. However, it does not engage users in an interactive dialog or have any social
aspects to itsplannedcommunication.

system used user posture and speech intonation to provide continuation prompts at
appropriateintervals(‘tellmemore’).Inastudyinvolving15grandmothers(aged55–65)
the agent was found to elicit significantly more and longer stories than a text-prompt
control condition. Fourteen of the 15 users enjoyed the experience, and all users
automatically adopted achild-directed speakingstyle appropriate for a 6-year-oldchild.

for older adults in order to achieve the same beneficial effects found in animal-assisted

3.4. MIT FitTrack
The FitTrack system was developed to investigate the ability of relational agents to
establish and maintain long-term, social–emotional relationships with users, and to
determine if these relationships could be used to increase the efficacy of health
communicationandhealthbehaviorchangeprogramsdeliveredbytheagent(Bickmoreet
al.,toappear;BickmoreandPicard,toappear).Thesystemwasdesignedusingaclient–
server architecture, with the client application running on users’ home computers. The
client bundledan ECA, web browser, input screens, andspeech synthesizer (see Fig.2),
while the server maintained the relational database, web server (for forms, educational
content,and self-monitoring graphs)and dialog engine.
In FitTrack, interaction dialogs are scripted using a custom scripting language that
compiles into Augmented Transition Networks (ATNs; Woods, 1986) so that common
sub-dialogs could be factored out and re-used across interactions. Each state in the
network generally specifies: (1) an output utterance for the agent that can be tailored at
runtime using template-filling (agent non-verbal behavior is automatically generated at
system compile time using BEAT; Cassell et al., 2001); (2) a set of allowable user
utterances thatwillbepresentedtotheuserasamultiplechoiceselectionmenu;and(3)
next state specification and actions toperform for each user utterance.
An evaluation of the physical activity advisor agent was conducted in a longitudinal,
between-subjectsdesignstudy,involving101MITstudentsandstaffinteractingwiththe
agent daily for 30 days. The user–agent relationship was evaluated using the Working
AllianceInventory,whichisastandardizedmeasureusedinpsychotherapytoevaluatethe

4.1.1. Model ofuser–agent relationship
If the user–agent relationship is expected to change over the projected period of use,
thenakeyelementofthesystemisamodelofthisrelationship,methodsforupdatingit,
and its use in planning dialog and other interaction behaviors. There are many kinds of
relational models (see Bickmore and Picard, to appear for a summary), but perhaps the
simplestisonethatvariesalongafixedtrajectorybasedonnumberofinteractionsortotal
contact time with the user. For example, an agent might be designed so that initial
interactions with it by a particular user will be relationally distant and professional, but
graduallybecomemorepersonalandsocialovertime,asreflectedbyincreasingturnsof
social dialog and increasing frequency of other kinds of relational behavior. This is the
relational model used in the FitTrack system (for a more sophisticated example, see
Cassell and Bickmore, 2003).
4.1.2. Use ofrelational behavior
Thereisawiderangeofrelationalbehavioranagentcanuseinattemptstomanipulate

theuser’sbehavior toinfertheir relational stance. These include social dialog, empathy,
meta-relational communication (talk about the relationship), humor, and self-disclosure;
seeBickmoreandPicard,toappearforanextendeddiscussion).Empathy,inparticular,is
frequentlymentionedinthehelpingliteratureasthemostimportantfactorinestablishinga

1991).
4.1.3. Persistent memory
Acrucialelementinarelationalagentsystemisamemoryofpastinteractionswitha
user. While this is theoretically not a necessary element of the relational model
(relationships can be characterized categorically or via specific expectations about the
future; Bickmore, 2003), it is necessary for the proper use of many relational behaviors,
such as talking about the past and future together (Planalp and Benson, 1992; Planalp,
1993) andcontinuity behaviors (talk about the time spent apart; Gilbertsonet al., 1998).

whetherthe user has notbeen feeling well for the last four interactions.
4.1.4. Variability in agent behavior
People continuously vary their language in subtle ways in response to changes in
context,mood,interactionhistory,and,ofcourse,relationshipwiththeirlistener.Imagine
howstrangeitwouldbeifeverytimeyouranintoanacquaintancetheyusedexactlythe

toestablishasocialbondwiththeuserandtomaintaintheirengagementoverlongperiods
of time, some variability in a relational agent’s verbal and non-verbal behavior is
important.IntheMITFitTrackstudy,manysubjectsfeltthattheagentwasrepetitiveafter
the first week or two. This was not just an annoyance; several subjects said that it had a
significantnegativeimpactontheirengagementwiththesystemandontheirmotivationto
exercise.
Determining appropriate types and amounts of behavior variability to maintain
engagement remains an important area of research. There are several approaches to
providingvariability,however,thatareusedinFitTrackandarerelativelystraightforward
toimplement.First,ateachstateinthedialog,multipleagentutterancesarespecifiedand
randomly selected from at runtime, providing some variability in the agent’s verbal and
non-verbalbehaviorforeverypossibleutteranceitmightmake.Second,theuseofitems
from persistent memory to both condition logical branches in the dialog and to fill in
utterance template slots provides variability over time. Overall dialog structure is also
varied, asdescribed inSection 4.1.5.
4.1.5. Dialogstructure
Somevariabilityinoveralldialogstructureisimportantaswell.However,iftheATN-
scripting approach to dialog is used, this can be an imposing task, especially if each
interaction is scripted as a separate dialog and every dialog has a significant amount of
branching.ThiswastheapproachtakenintheMITFitTracksystem,anditclearlyisnot
scalable.Inthesystemforolderadults,weuseafixedtop-leveldialogstructure,butwith
‘hooks’ at each location at which dialog variants can be inserted (e.g. for social dialog).

fragments can be inserted between any of the steps in the above structure, based on the
number of interactions the agent has had with the user. In addition, many of these
fragments are written so that they could be re-used, such as talking to users about the
weather,their weekendplans,orwhetherthey were enjoying their exerciseornot.

The FitTrack architecture was redesigned to run stand-alone on one computer to

5.Evaluation ofFitTrack for older adults
Toevaluatetheacceptanceandefficacyoftheexerciseadvisoragentbyolderadultswe
conductedarandomizedtrialcomparingparticipantswhointeractedwiththeagentdaily
in their homes for 2 months (RELATIONAL) with a standard of care control group
(CONTROL).TheCONTROLgroupusedaphysicalactivityinterventionthathadalready
been designed and planned for use in the GAP clinic, and involved giving subjects
pedometers andprinted materials on the benefits ofwalking for exercise.
Theprimary hypothesesevaluated inthe studywere:
H1. Subjects in the RELATIONAL group would enjoy using the relational agent on a
regular basis.
H2. Subjects in the RELATIONAL group would perform more physical activity than
subjectsin the CONTROLgroup.
Wewerealsointerestedinwhethertheuseofarelationalagentbyolderadultswould
lead to increases in well-being and, more specifically, decreases in loneliness. This was
motivatedbythegeneralassociationfoundbetweensocialsupportandwell-being inthe

ofall actions RELATIONAL participants took with their system.
StepsWalkedwasmeasuredbyapedometer.Participantswereinstructedtowritetheir
stepsdown each day onalogsheet, andsubjectsinthe RELATIONALgroup werealso
promptedtoenterthese into the computerduringconversations with the agent.
Satisfactionwith,Repetitiveness,Friendliness,Informativeness,Interestingness,Liking
of, and Trust in the agent (for subjects in the RELATIONAL group) were measured by
single itemson seven-point semantic differentialscales at the endof the intervention, as
wereEaseofUseofthesystem,DesiretoContinueusingthesystem,andRelationshipto
the agent.
Well-being was measured using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985)
andthe UCLALonelinessscale(Russell et al., 1980),administeredto allsubjectsat the
start and endof the intervention.
Overall health was measured using the 12 Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12),
with subscales for physical health (PCS-12) and mental health (MCS-12) (Ware et al.,
1996).
In addition, semi-structured interviews were held with each participant during the
follow-up meeting at the end ofthe intervention.
5.4. Results
5.4.1. Usage
Two participants in the RELATIONAL group and two in the CONTROL group
withdrewfromthestudybeforetheendofthe2-monthintervention,allreportedlydueto
health problems with themselves or a family member. In addition, one participant was
foundtohavenotturnedthesystemononcefollowingtheintakemeeting,eventhoughshe
claimed to have used it. Following an intent-to-treat protocol, data from all subjects are
includedin the quantitative results.
For subjects in the RELATIONAL group, actual use during the 60-day intervention
rangedfrom0to54interactions,with90%ofsubjectsaveragingatleastonecontactper
week, 40% averaging at least two contacts per week and 30% averaging at least three
contactsperweek.Atypicalusagepatternwasdailyduringthefirstweek,taperingoffto
onceortwiceaweekbytheendofthestudyperiod.Whenaskediftheylookedforwardto
the interactions with the agent, subjects gave a range of responses, with most (75% of
those who commented) responding positively:

RELATIONAL participants also indicated that they would like to continue using the
system,givingthis an average rating of6.4 (range: 1Z‘not at all’ to7Z‘verymuch’).

completely using the constrained, multiple-choiceinteraction:

Whenasked,participantsuniversallysaidtheywouldhavepreferredspeakingtoLaura,
rather than using a touch screen. However, they preferred the touch screen over typing,
even though it meant havinga muchmorerestrictive conversation:
The only difference is that even if you wanted to say more it was, you know, you
couldjusttouch,youcouldn’ttype,tosaysomething.Thatwasthedifference.But,I
believe that I would have handled this better. I’m rarely typing in my words.
BecauseI’m nottoofamiliarwith computers.
Several participants mentioned that they enjoyed the social dialog with Laura and
would have liked the opportunityto chat more with her:
728 T.W.Bickmoreetal./InteractingwithComputers17(2005)711–735
Shesays‘GoodMorningCamille’[laughs].Yeah,it’snice.Ilikedthat.Youknowa

I wanted to have moreconversation with her.
Participantsalsomentionedthattheywouldhavelikedtotalkmoreabouttheirhealth
problems with Laura, especiallyas they relatedtotheir ability to do morewalking:
There was a couple of times when I wasn’t feeling good I didn’t go walking, you
know.AndIfeltthat.So,Iwouldhavelovedtosaytoher,‘wellLauraIthink.’
andshesaytome‘Ihopeyoufeelbetter.’Ithinkthatcameup.Isaid‘I’mgettingthe

5.4.3. Physical activity
Comparisons between the RELATIONAL and CONTROL groups on daily recorded
pedometerstepswerebasedongeneralizedestimatingequations(GEE)regressionmodels
for longitudinal data. GEE regression accounts for the repeated-measures nature of the
data by modeling the correlation between repeated observations from the same subject,
and adjusting both parameter estimates and standard errors for this correlation. GEE
regression has several advantages over traditional repeated-measures ANOVA, in that it

I enjoyed her, I enjoyed Laura, and I’m quite sure somebody elsewould.
Eight of the 10 subjects in RELATIONAL anthropomorphized the agent to some
degree, putting Laura inacategory somewhere between acomputerand a person:

questionnaire] were inappropriate.
Two subjects compared talking to Laura to talking to a character on TV, or having
people on TV tell them what todo:
It was like talkingto the TV. I talkto the TV, too. [laughs]
There were many comments about the agent–subject relationship and relational
dynamics. The general relational trajectory seemed to be that the relationship and
interaction seemed strange at first, became more familiar over time, with liking and
trusting of and even caring for the agent common by the end of the 2 months. Several
participants said they also felt that Laura liked and cared about them:
Um, she took getting used to. But, um, by maybe the third or the fourth night she
appeared to befamiliar, you know.
By the way that she sound, she sound like she like me.
IrememberoneweekendIwenttoWareham.Youknow,Ibegantofeelbadabout

Rather than serve to further isolate older adult subjects, two subjects mentioned that

6. Discussion
Overall, the study was successful in demonstrating the acceptance and usability of a
relationalagentbyolderadults—eventhoughmostofthesubjectsintheRELATIONAL
group had little or no computer experience—and in demonstrating the efficacy of this
agent in motivating them to walk more. We conclude that our first two hypotheses
regardingenjoyment ofthe system andhealthbehavior change efficacy were confirmed.
Satisfaction with the overall intervention was very high, with most participants
acknowledging that it was for their benefit:

Both survey results and interview responses indicated that most participants in the
RELATIONAL group felt that they had established some kind of social bond with the
systemoverthedurationoftheinterventionandthatthisbond,ataminimum,servedasa
motivatorfor them to continue interacting with the agent.
Our third hypothesis, regarding the impact of the relational agent on well-being and
loneliness,wasnotconfirmed.Thismaybeduetotheshortinterventioninterval,thesmall

7. Future work
There are a number of important and interesting directions for future research on
relational agents for older adults. First is that more sophisticated models of dialogue
planning should be developed, so that users can engage in richer conversations and can
more freely express themselves. Doing this while maintaining the ease of use of the
multiple-choice selection input modality will be a very challenging undertaking.
Replacing the touch screen with automated speech recognition would have been
welcomed by all participants in this study, but commercial systems would need to be
732 T.W.Bickmoreetal./InteractingwithComputers17(2005)711–735
thoroughly evaluated to ensure that they could provide high enough reliability given the
variability and differencesin voice quality inolderadults compared tothe voice models
they were developed for.
Many participants indicated that interactions with Laura became somewhat repetitive
over the course of the 2 months, and the solution to this problem remains an interesting
area of research. In addition to the techniques described in Section 4.1.4, other possible
solutions include: providing a wider range of dialog scripts; more variability in agent
utterances for any given dialog state; and the incorporation of external data that is
dynamicallyupdated(e.g.weatherreports).OnesubjectsuggestedthatjusthavingLaura
change her clothing occasionally would have helped break the monotony. Ultimately,
whatisneededistheuseofdialogplanningandtextgenerationtechniquestodynamically
synthesizetheagent’sbehavioranddialogsothatitcanbesubtlyvariedeveryinteraction,
for example,based onsimulated agent mood or the user’s affectivestate.
Thegeneralrelationshipbetweenuser–agentsocialbond,systemusageandbehavioral
outcomes needs to be more thoroughly explored. Certainly social bond and engagement
influences usage and there is some dose–response association between usage and
outcomes,but the details need tobe teased outina much larger study.
Future systems like FitTrack that rely on sensor readings (such as pedometer step
counts)shouldbedesignedtoautomatethetransferofdatafromthesensingdevicestothe
computertoeliminate user data entryerrors.
Therearealsosomeissuesinvolvedwithjustinstallingcomputersinthehomesofolder
adults,especiallythosewithminimalcomputerexpertise.First,manyolderadultslivein
very small homes filled with possessions accumulated over a lifetime. Just finding an
appropriate space for a desktop computer system can be very challenging. Two subjects
had to put the computer on part of their dining room table. Second, multi-generational
households with small children can be problematic when installing fragile electronic
equipment such as a home computer. One woman dealt with this by including her
granddaughter in all of her conversations with Laura. Finally, one participant was
concernedthatthecomputer,whichwasinstalledasastand-alonesystem,wassomehow
collecting information about her and broadcasting itback tothe hospital.
8.Conclusion
In this article, we have examined the use of a new kind of computer interface—
relational agents—for older adult users, specifically in the context of a health education
and behavior change application. Based on this experience, we believe that the caring,
social,anthropomorphicinterfaceenabledthesystemtobereadilyaccepted,usablewith
minimaltraining,andefficaciousinachievingadesiredbehavioraloutcomewiththisuser
population.
Relationalagentsmayprovetobeanespeciallyeffectivemodalityfordeliveringhealth
communication toolderadultswithlowfunctionalhealth,reading, orcomputerliteracy,
problems that are especially acute in underserved populations. In a 1995 study of 2659
predominately indigent and minority patients at two urban public hospitals it was found
that 86% of the English speaking elderly had inadequate or marginal functional health

literacy,defined astheabilitytoreadandfollowbasic medical instructions(Williamset
al., 1995). A relational agent that uses the universally understood and non-threatening
format offace-to-face conversation, relying minimally on text comprehension and using
multi-modal cues to maximize comprehension, may be an ideal platform to provide an
effective automated health educator with unbounded patience and empathy for these
patients.

qualityoflife.Inaddition,becauseresidentsspendsuchalargeportionoftheirdaysitting

While social and relational interaction is certainly not appropriate for all kinds of
computer interfaces, we feel that health communication with older adults is one area in
which these interface features are not only efficacious but are sincerely appreciated by
users.
