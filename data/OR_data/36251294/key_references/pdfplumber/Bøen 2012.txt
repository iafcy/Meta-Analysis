and preventing depression in elderly people

Abstract
Background: Late-life depressionis a common condition and a challenging public health problem. A lack of social
support is strongly associated with psychologicaldistress. Senior centres seem to be suitable arenas for
community-based health promotion interventions, although few studies have addressed this subject. The objectives
were to examinetheeffectof a preventive senior centre group programme consisting of weekly meetings, on
social support, depressionand quality of life.
Methods: A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of4,000persons over 65 in Oslo,and a total of 2,387
completed questionnaires were obtained.These subjects served as a basis for recruitmentof participants for a trial,
withscores on HSCL-10 being used as a main inclusion criterion.A total of 138 persons were randomizedinto an
intervention group (N=77) and control group (N=61). Final analyses included 92 persons. Social support (OSS-3),
depression (BDI), life satisfaction and health were measuredin interviews at baseline and after 12 months (at the
end ofthe interventionprogramme).Perceptionsof benefits from the intervention were also measured. Mean
scores, SD, SE and CI were used to describe thechanges inoutcomes.Effect sizes were calculated based on the
original scales and as Cohen’sd. Paired sample tests and ANOVA were used to testgroup differences.
Results: There was an increase insocialsupport inboth groups, but greatest intheinterventiongroup. The level of
depression increased for both groups, but more so in thecontrol thantheinterventiongroup. There was a
decrease in life satisfaction, although the decrease was largest among controls.There were almost nodifferencesin
reported health betweengroups. However, effect sizes were small and differences were notstatistically significant.
Incontrast,most oftheparticipants saidtheinterventionmeant much to them and led to increased use ofthe
centre.
Conclusions: In allprobability, theinterventionfailedto meet optimistic targets, but possibly met quite modest
ones. Since intention-to-treat analysis was not possible, wedo not know the effect on the intervention group as a
whole. A further evaluation ofthese programmes is necessary to expand thegroup programme. For thedepressed,
more specialized programmesto cope with depressionmay be a more appropriate intervention.
