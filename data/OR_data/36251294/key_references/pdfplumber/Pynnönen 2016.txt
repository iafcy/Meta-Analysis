Results: Number of depressive symptoms remained unchanged, while loneliness and melancholy
decreasedinboththeinterventionandcontrolgroupsduringthestudy(p<0.001).Socialintegration
increased in the intervention group but not in controls (p D 0.041). Attachment and guidance
increasedinbothgroups(p<0.001).
Conclusion: The intervention did not alleviate depressed mood. Positive changes over time were
observed in loneliness, feelings of melancholy, attachment, and guidance but these occurred
independently of the intervention. Our secondary analysis suggests that the intervention increased
