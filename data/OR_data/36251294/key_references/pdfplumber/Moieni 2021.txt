Abstract
Objectives: Beliefs about aging can contribute to health and well-being in older adults. Feeling generative, or that one is
caring for and contributing to the well-being of others, can also impact health and well-being. In this study, we hypothe-
sized that those with more positive expectations regarding aging (ERA) in the mental health domain would report greater
levels of perceived social support (PSS) and lower levels of loneliness in response to a generativity intervention (vs control
condition).
Method: Participants in this study (n = 73, 100% female) were randomly assigned to a 6-week generativity condition,
which involved writing about life experiences and sharing advice with others, or to a control condition, which involved
writing about neutral topics. Pre- and postintervention, PSS, and feelings of loneliness were measured.
Results: Those in the generativity condition with more positive ERA in the mental health domain reported greater PSS and
lower loneliness postintervention.
Discussion: These results highlight the importance of psychological factors, such as ERA, in moderating the efficacy of
interventions to promote social well-being in older adults.

The Social Provisions Scale, measured pre- and postintervention,
is a valid, reliable (α = .90) scale to assess multiple domains
of PSS, such as feelings of attachment and social integration
(Cutrona, 1984; Cutrona & Russell, 1987; e.g., “I feel a strong
emotional bond with at least one other person”).
UCLA Loneliness Scale
The UCLA Loneliness Scale, measured pre- and
postintervention, is a valid, reliable (α = .92) scale to as-
sess loneliness (Russell, 1996) (e.g., “how often do you feel
alone?”). Loneliness and perceptions of social support were
significantly correlated with each other (at preintervention,
r = −.71, p < .001) but represent distinct constructs with
separate, rich literatures and thus were both examined as
social well-being outcomes.
General Analytic Strategy
In order to test the moderating effect of ERA on PSS and lone-
liness, the PROCESS macro for SPSS was used (Hayes, 2012).
To examine whether ERA moderated the effect of the inter-
vention on PSS and loneliness, we tested the interaction of
condition (generativity vs control) and ERA on PSS and lone-
liness postintervention, controlling for preintervention values.
Results Analysis of conditional effects revealed that higher ERA

1 Due to technical issues, one of the items in the mental health
domain of the ERA Survey was from the 38-item version of the scale
(Sarkisian, Hays, Berry, & Mangione, 2002) rather than the intended
12-item version. The item in the 12-item scale that reads “as people
get older they worry more” (Item 7) instead read “quality of life
declines as people age.” Removing this item from the scale does
not change the results of the analyses.
