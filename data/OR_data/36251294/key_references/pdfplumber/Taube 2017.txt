prised aspects regarding psychosocial health, there was
no standardised or explicit strategy when intervening
against loneliness. Instead, it was individually tailored
and this could be reflected in the lack of effectiveness.
However, identifying the frail older person’s own barri-
ers for overcoming loneliness has been suggested as a
strategy in previous research (54). Considering the
trend for prevalence of loneliness over time in the
intervention group, along with the significant effect of
the complete case analysis, it appears that the interven-
tion may have had an effect on loneliness at 6 months
from baseline. This could indicate that the support in
terms of alleviating loneliness provided by the CM was
sufficient initially, but not over a longer period of time.
The content of the case management intervention may
cover some dimensions of loneliness related to social
aspects, which resulted in an initial favourable effect,
but the strategy failed to accomplish a sustainable
effect. Sandberg et al. (55) found that the participants
in the case management study experienced the CM as

could have benefitted from the intervention. Integrated
care, as well as collaborative interventions, has been
shown as preferred and successful when caring for older
people with depression (57). In addition, changing
thoughts, behaviours, skills and associated feelings
through CBT have shown to be effective in reducing
depressive symptoms among older people (58). This is in
line with suggested strategies in combating loneliness
(17).Giventhereciprocalrelationshipbetweenloneliness
and depression (4, 6, 19, 20), it would be of further
interest to elaborate and investigate the possibilities of
providing support beyond social dimensions. Neverthe-
less, early recognition of depressive symptoms has shown

The final primary outcome of this study was related to

sive symptoms experienced by individuals since it refers
to the positive aspect of the psychological well-being,
including maintaining happy and optimistic (23). The
mean scores of the LSIZ, in the total sample as well as in
both groups, respectively, are in line with previous
reported scores for similar samples in Sweden as well as
in other European countries (59). However, among older
(60+ years) Swedes in general, a mean score of 18
(SD = 4.8) has been reported (60) and supports that frail
older people appear to have a lower life satisfaction com-
pared to older people in general. Moreover, being less
satisfied with life is associated by deficits in social con-
tacts, feeling hindered by health problems and low self-
esteem (24). The components of the intervention were
intended to cover the mentioned factors as well as
enhancingoverallpsychologicalwell-beingofindividuals.
Previous research on case management for frail older
people has shown favourable effects in regard to aspects
