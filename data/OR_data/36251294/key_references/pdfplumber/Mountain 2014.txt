Abstract
Background: Loneliness in older people is associated with poor health-relatedquality oflife (HRQoL). We
undertook a parallel-group randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectivenessand cost-effectiveness of
telephone befriending for the maintenance of HRQoL in older people. An internal pilot tested thefeasibility
ofthe trial and intervention.
Methods: Participants aged>74 years, withgood cognitive function, living independently inone UKcity were
recruited through generalpractices and othersources, then randomised to:(1)6 weeks of shortone-to-one
telephone calls, followed by 12 weeks of group telephonecalls with up to sixparticipants,led by a trained
volunteer facilitator; or (2) a control group. The main trial required therecruitment of 248 participants ina 1-year
accrual window, ofwhom 124 were to receive telephone befriending. The pilot specified threesuccess criteria
which had to be met inorder to progress themain trial to completion: recruitment of 68 participants in95 days;
retentionof80%participants at6months; successful delivery oftelephone befriending bylocal franchiseofnational
charity. The primary clinical outcome was the Short Form (36) HealthInstrument(SF-36) Mental Health (MH)
dimension score collected by telephone 6months following randomisation.
Results: We informed 9,579 older people about thestudy. Seventy consenting participants were randomised to
thepilot in95 days, with 56 (80%)providing valid primary outcomedata (26 intervention, 30 control). Twenty-four
