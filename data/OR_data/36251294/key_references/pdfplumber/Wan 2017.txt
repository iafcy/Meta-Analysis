Abstract
Rationale—Low physical activity is highly prevalent among COPD patients and is associated
with increased healthcare utilization and mortality and reduced HRQL. The addition of a website
to pedometer use is effective at increasing physical activity; however, the timeline of change and
impact of environmental factors on efficacy is unknown.
Methods—U.S. Veterans with COPD were randomized (1:1) to receive either (1) a pedometer
and website which provided goal-setting, feedback, disease-specific education, and an online
community forum or (2) pedometer alone for 3 months. Primary outcome was change in daily step
count. Secondary outcomes included 6MWT distance, HRQL, dyspnea, depression, COPD
knowledge, exercise self-efficacy, social support, motivation, and confidence to exercise.
Generalized linear mixed-effects models evaluated the effect of the pedometer plus website
compared to pedometer alone.

Results—Data from 109 subjects (98.5% male, mean age 68.6±8.3 years) were analyzed. At 13
weeks, subjects in the pedometer plus website group had significant increases daily step count
from baseline relative to the pedometer alone group (804±356.5 steps per day, p=0.02). The
pedometer plus website group had significant improvements in daily step count from baseline
beginning in week 3 which were sustained until week 13. In subgroup analyses, the pedometer
plus website attenuated declines in daily step count during the transition from summer to fall. No
significant differences in secondary outcomes were noted between groups.
Conclusions—A website added to pedometer use improves daily step counts, sustains walking
over 3 months, and attenuates declines in physical activity due to season.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the third leading cause of death
in the United States [1] and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [2]. Low
levels of physical activity (PA) in COPD patients are often present early in the disease
course [3] and are associated with poor outcomes, including worse health-related quality of
life (HRQL) [4], increased risk of acute exacerbations and higher rates of healthcare
utilization [5–9], and increased mortality [10–12], independent of lung function. Despite the
strong evidence linking low PA with greater morbidity and mortality, effective interventions
to promote PA in individuals with COPD remain limited.
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines endorse
pulmonary rehabilitation as an integral, non-pharmacological component in disease
management [13]. However, while supervised pulmonary rehabilitation programs improve
exercise capacity and HRQL in persons with COPD, the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation
on daily PA is unclear [14, 15]. Data support that a range of types and intensities of PA
beyond aerobic exercise, which is emphasized in pulmonary rehabilitation, may be
beneficial in COPD [16]. Increased low-intensity PA was significantly associated with a
decreased risk of COPD-related hospitalizations, whereas increased high-intensity PA
demonstrated no benefit [17].
Intervention programs which combine the use of wearable monitors (i.e. pedometers,
accelerometers) with goal-setting can increase daily PA in COPD patients [15]. Many types
of goal-setting, including in-person counseling, daily diary use [18, 19], and messaging
through smartphone applications[20, 21], have demonstrated short-term efficacy in
increasing daily PA among COPD patients. In our previous Taking Healthy Steps (THS)
study[22], goal-setting was mediated through the use of a pedometer (Omron HJ-720 ITC,
Omron Healthcare, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) plus a website based on the Theory of Self-
Regulation which provided individualized step-count goals, iterative step-count feedback,
education on disease self-management and motivation, and an online community of social
support. Subjects in the intervention group demonstrated increased daily step count and
improved HRQL at four months[23].

While many wearable monitor-based PA coaching interventions have demonstrated short-
term efficacy in both increasing PA and improving secondary outcomes such as exercise
capacity and HRQL, detailed investigations into the physiological, psychosocial, and
environmental factors which may influence efficacy remain scarce. In most studies,
objective measurements of PA are taken at only 2 time points (baseline and end-of-study)
through the use of 7–14 day sampling periods[18–21], precluding the ability to assess
exactly when increases in PA occur after initiation of an intervention. Although PA data
from intermediate time points from subjects in the intervention arm are available in a subset
of studies[19], continuous daily PA monitoring in control subjects is not routinely collected
or reported. Lastly, there is emerging evidence linking environmental factors such as
temperature and weather to daily PA[24–26]; to date the impact of temperature patterns on
PA interventions has not been reported.
In the current study, Every Step Counts (ESC), we extend the use of a pedometer plus the
website first described in the THS study in an independent and well-characterized cohort. In
the THS study, COPD subjects were identified through ICD-9 codes (without spirometric
validation), enrollment was automated, and the primary outcomes (change in daily step
count and HRQL) were assessed online[22]. In ESC, daily objective PA monitoring in both
groups, as well as in-person assessments of physiological and psychosocial variables, were
obtained, providing a unique opportunity to examine (1) the effect of combining the
pedometer plus website on daily step count as well as a comprehensive set of secondary
physiological and psychosocial variables, (2) the timeline of change in daily step count
following initiation of the intervention, (3) the effect of season on daily PA and the response
to the intervention, and (4) detailed subject feedback on engagement with the intervention to
guide the design and implementation of future interventions.
METHODS (See also Methods section of the online data supplement)
Participants and Trial Registration
Participants were recruited from the general pulmonary clinics at VA Boston. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1.
Subjects were at their baseline clinical status, received medical clearance from a healthcare
provider to participate, and were not involved in another exercise program. The protocol
(#2328) was approved by the VA Boston Healthcare System Committee on Human
Research, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. The trial was registered
as a randomized clinical trial on ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number NCT01772082).
Randomization Groups
Baseline daily step count was collected in all subjects using an Omron HJ-720 ITC
pedometer for 7 days prior to randomization. Subjects received no step-count feedback since
an opaque sticker was placed on the pedometer display. Subjects were then randomized (1:1)
by a computer algorithm [23] with blocking stratified on season and baseline 6-minute walk
test (6MWT) distance (dichotomized by ≥ 1190 feet or < 1190) to either pedometer plus
website (intervention) or pedometer alone (control) groups (Figure 1). Randomization

assignments were generated with random block sizes which were not disclosed to study
staff. Assignments were communicated to study staff through the ESC website, and subjects
were notified by telephone of their assignment groups. Due to the nature of the intervention,
participant blinding was not possible; however the research assistant conducting assessments
at the study conclusion (3 months) was blinded to group assignment.
Subjects in the pedometer plus website group were instructed to wear the pedometer daily
during all waking hours, to upload step counts weekly, and were given access to a website
which provided the four key components of individualized goal-setting, iterative step-count
feedback for self-monitoring, educational and motivational content to enhance disease self-
management and self-efficacy, and an online community forum for social support. Subjects
received step-count goals every week based on their current recorded step count or
previously set goal. The goals were the minimum value of three possible numbers: 1) the
previous goal + 400 steps, 2) the average of the most recently uploaded seven days of step
counts + 400 steps, or 3) 10,000 steps.
Subjects randomized to the pedometer alone group were given a pedometer and written
materials about exercise at study entry, but were not assigned step-count goals. They were
instructed to wear the pedometer daily while awake and to upload step counts at least
monthly via the website; the website had no content except a display of the study week.
Both groups uploaded step-count data to the same study server via the website.
Outcome Assessments
Daily step count, the primary outcome, was assessed objectively using the Omron
pedometer. To identify days when the device was not worn by the subject, a wear day was
defined by wear time ≥ 8 hours and ≥ 100 steps [22, 23]. Baseline daily step count was the
average of all wear days assessed during the 7 days prior to randomization [27, 28].
Following randomization, daily step counts were averaged each week if the subject had ≥ 3
wear days for that week[29]. The difference between average daily step count and baseline
step count was determined for weeks 1 through 13. The definition of a wear day and
calculation of baseline and follow-up daily step counts were similarly applied to both
groups.
In-person evaluation of secondary outcomes. including 6MWT distance, exercise adherence,
HRQL, dyspnea, depression, COPD knowledge, exercise self-efficacy, social support, and
motivation and confidence to exercise daily, were performed at baseline and end of study (3
months). Spirometry[30] was performed using an Eaglet spirometer (nSpire Health, Inc.), a
6MWT[31] was conducted according to ATS guidelines without a practice walk, and
standardized questionnaires were administered, including the St. George’s Respiratory
Questionnaire (SGRQ) [32], modified Medical Research Council [33] (MMRC), Beck
Depression Inventory-II [34], Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire [35], Exercise Self-
Regulatory Efficacy Scale [36], and Medical Outcome Study Social Support survey [37]. For
additional details please see the online supplement. Season was ascertained for each week of
the study in which subject participated, including the time of enrollment (week 1), based
upon whether ≥ 4 days that week fell into the calendar month groupings as follows: winter
(December, January, February), spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, August),

and fall (September, October, November). The number of wear days and the hours of wear
time during wear days were examined as surrogates of exercise adherence in both groups,
and the number of website logins was a measure of adherence to website use in the
pedometer plus website group. At the end of the study, participants in both groups
completed a feedback survey about use of the pedometer and website.
Significant adverse events and pulmonary events were tracked during the study. Significant
adverse events were defined as deaths and/or hospitalizations for any cause and were
reportable to the Internal Review Board. Pulmonary events were self-reported at monthly
telephone interviews during the study and were confirmed by medical record review
whenever possible. Pulmonary events included confirmed diagnoses of pneumonia and acute
exacerbations of COPD, defined as worsening symptoms which resulted in an unplanned
visit to a healthcare provider or hospitalization associated with a new prescription for
antibiotics and/or systemic steroids.
Statistics
Power Calculation—Based on pilot data from a cohort of subjects with moderate COPD
[38], to have adequate power (β=80%) to detect a difference of at least 1000 steps per
day[39] at an α=0.05, an estimated enrollment of 100 subjects (50 in each arm) was
required.
Analysis—Univariate comparisons were made using a Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for
discrete data and either a Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous data. To
evaluate the effect of the intervention and the impact of season on change in daily step
count, generalized linear mixed effects models (PROC MIXED, SAS v9.4, Cary, NC) for
repeated measures employing a first order auto-regressive covariance matrix were
constructed with change in daily step count from baseline as the dependent variable and
randomization group, FEV % predicted (included a priori), and season of study week as the
1
independent variables. Secondary subgroup analyses of subjects enrolled in each season
were conducted using an identical model. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Additional details are available in the online supplement.
RESULTS
Between April 2012 and August 2015, 114 participants were enrolled and randomized
(Figure 1). Enrollment was concluded after achieving target enrollment. Data from 109
Veterans (52 control, 57 intervention) who had 1) baseline step-count data, i.e. ≥ 5 wear days
at baseline[27], 2) follow-up step-count data, i.e. ≥ 1 week with step-count data after
randomization, and 3) completed the baseline and end-of-study in-person visits were
analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Nine participants in the pedometer alone group and
two participants in the pedometer plus website group met the inclusion criterion of COPD
based solely on the finding of emphysema on CT scan; all others had a FEV /FVC ratio <
1
0.70. Although there were significantly more subjects in the pedometer alone group whose
COPD was diagnosed on the basis of chest CT, there were no significant differences in age,
BMI, pack-years, SGRQ Total Score (SGRQ-TS), MMRC dyspnea score, or baseline daily
step count in subjects diagnosed on the basis of CT compared to subjects diagnosed using

spirometry data. Subjects in the pedometer plus website group had higher rates of inhaled
long-acting muscarinic antagonist use compared to the pedometer alone group, p=0.01.
There were no other differences in baseline characteristics by randomization group (Table
2).
In generalized linear mixed effects models for repeated measures, randomization group was
a significant predictor of change in daily step count (p = 0.03). Figure 2 illustrates the
change in daily step count from baseline for weeks 1 through week 13, by treatment group.
At week 13, subjects in the pedometer plus website group had an average change from
baseline that was 804 steps per day (SE ±356.5) greater than the change observed in the
pedometer alone group (between-group difference p = 0.02). Subjects in the pedometer plus
website group demonstrated a significant (p<0.05) increase in daily step count from baseline
(within-group change in step count) starting in week 3, which was sustained until the end of
the study (week 13 – Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Subjects in the pedometer alone
group had daily step counts that did not differ significantly from baseline for the duration of
the study.
These findings were unchanged when we excluded COPD subjects (n = 11) diagnosed by
CT scan alone and had a FEV /FVC ratio > 0.7. Findings were similar in models which
1
included adjustment for baseline daily step count as well as in models where FEV %
1
predicted was removed as a covariate. When we included adjustment for dichotomized
baseline 6MWT distance (dichotomized ≥1190 feet or <1190 feet), the between-group
difference at week 13 was attenuated (612.7 ± 339.9 steps/day higher in the pedometer plus
website group, p = 0.07).
There were no significant differences by randomization group in the secondary outcomes
(Table 3) or in absolute daily step counts at 3 months. Subjects in the pedometer plus
website group had an average absolute daily step count of 3,589 (±2423) at 3 months while
subjects in the pedometer alone group averaged 3,664 (±2507) steps per day (p-value 0.95).
There were no significant between-group differences with respect to change in 6MWT
distance, SGRQ-TS, MMRC dyspnea score, Beck’s depression score, Bristol COPD
knowledge score, exercise regulatory self-efficacy, social support, and motivation or
confidence to exercise at 3 months. However, significant within-group changes were
observed. In the pedometer plus website group, motivation to exercise daily increased (1.1
± 2.4, one sample Student’s t-test p = 5 × 10−3). In the pedometer alone group, the Bristol’s
COPD knowledge score increased (5.8 ± 12.6, p =1.6 × 10−3), dyspnea increased (MMRC,
0.3 ± 1.1, p-value=0.03), and exercise self-regulatory efficacy decreased (−5.9 ± 21.1, p
=0.05).
Season of the study week was a significant predictor of change in daily step count in the
primary model (p= 0.02). Because our study was conducted over the course of 3 months,
most subjects experienced a change of season during the study. Subgroup analysis of
subjects enrolled during the summer (n = 28) showed a significant overall difference in
change in daily step count by randomization group (p=0.01). At week 13, subjects in the
pedometer plus website group (n = 13) had an average change in daily step count from
baseline that was 1983 steps higher than subjects in the pedometer alone group (n = 15)

(between-group p=0.0076). During weeks 11–13, concurrent with the transition from
summer to fall, subjects in the pedometer alone group had a significant decline in daily step
count from baseline (from −1057 steps in week 11 to −1750 steps in week 13, within-group
p-values from 0.05 to 0.0017) whereas subjects in the pedometer plus website group
demonstrated sustained to slightly improved daily step counts from baseline (Figure 3).
When we examined the data using calendar month (rather than intervention week) as the
abscissa, the decline in step count in the pedometer alone group coincides with decreasing
average daily temperatures recorded during the study period (Supplementary Figure E1).
There were no significant differences in the number of pulmonary events in the fall/winter
(defined as events occurring after September 1st) by randomization group among subjects
enrolled in the summer (see Supplementary Results).
For subjects enrolled in other seasons (winter, spring, fall), no statistically significant
between-group differences in change in step count were identified in the primary model (see
Supplementary Table 2) or in subgroup analyses (using separate models). When we
constructed a model examining the interaction between randomization group and season of
enrollment (in all subjects simultaneously), between-group differences were again noted
only among subjects enrolled during the summer, with the pedometer plus website group
demonstrating an average 860.6 ± 416.8 (p = 0.04) more steps per day over the entire study.
In this model, subjects in both the pedometer plus website and pedometer alone groups
enrolled in spring had significant within-group improvements from baseline, consistent with
known improvements in daily PA with increasing temperatures characteristic of the
transition from spring to summer[24, 25]. Although participants enrolled in spring in the
intervention group had higher mean improvements, because both groups improved, the
between-group differences in spring were not statistically significant.
We examined the impact of comorbid medical conditions on daily physical activity levels.
Although there were no significant differences in the frequency of self-reported
comorbidities by randomization group, within-group differences in both baseline and change
in daily step count by self-reported comorbid conditions were observed. In the pedometer
alone group, subjects who reported a history of arthritis had a significantly lower baseline
daily step count relative to pedometer-alone subjects without arthritis (2819.6 ± 1844.7
versus 4466.1 ± 2522.7, p=0.01). Interestingly, subjects in the pedometer alone group with
arthritis had significantly higher changes in step count at 3 months relative to pedometer-
alone subjects without arthritis (934.3 ± 1498.7 versus −756.4 ± 2177.7, p = 0.02). There
were no differences in baseline daily step count by self-reported comorbidities in the
pedometer plus website group, however, subjects in the intervention group with depression
had significantly less improvement in their daily step count at 3 months (−276.6 ± 973.4
versus 1000.2 ± 2123.8, p = 0.01).
Compliance with pedometer use, a surrogate for exercise adherence, was high, with an
overall percentage of pedometer wear days of 86 % for the cohort over the study period
(87% in the pedometer alone group and 85.8 % in the pedometer plus website group).
Although there was a decrease in percent of wear days by month 3, there were no
differences between randomization groups (Table 4). There were no significant differences

in average wear time by randomization group, 16.1± 6.3 hours/day in the pedometer alone
group versus 15.2 ± 2.4 hours/day in the pedometer plus website group, (p = 0.84).
A similar trend was noted for adherence to website use as evidenced by the website logins in
the pedometer plus website group; average monthly logins remained > 4 per month which
suggests good adherence to the requested weekly logins (data not shown). While 74% of our
subjects rated their ability to use the internet as “basic” or “moderate”, two-thirds of subjects
reported using the internet on a daily basis at baseline. There were no differences in the self-
reported ability or frequency of internet use by randomization group.
In both groups, the most commonly reported technical problems included the pedometer
“popping off” the waistband (72%) and difficulty uploading the step-count data to the
website on the first attempt that required assistance from study staff (27%); these difficulties
were minor and did not impact the collection of data during the study. There were no
differences in technical difficulties with the pedometer or website by randomization group
(Supplementary Figure E2). Overall, 94% of subjects enrolled in both groups stated the
website was easy to understand while 85% reported it was easy to find time to log in.
Overall satisfaction with the program was high in both randomization groups, with 95% of
subjects reporting that they would recommend the program to another patient with COPD,
and 93% reporting that they planned to continue to walk for exercise after the study ended.
Among all randomized subjects (n = 114), 17 individuals (8 in pedometer-alone, 9 in
pedometer + website) reported 24 serious adverse events (10 in pedometer-alone, 14 in
pedometer + website) during the study. Events included abdominal pain, anxiety, mental
health crisis, headache, congestion, ear pain, rash, skin abscess, kidney problems, a broken
toe, and a car accident; none of the events were study-related. There were no differences in
incidence rates of serious adverse events by randomization group (2 tailed mid-P exact value
= 0.54). When we included covariate adjustment for whether a subject experienced a
significant adverse event in our primary model, the between-group difference in change in
daily step count remained significant at week 13 (830.5 ± 347 steps higher in the pedometer
plus website group, p = 0.02).
Twenty-four pulmonary events (9 in pedometer alone, 15 in pedometer + website) were
reported by 21 individuals (8 pedometer alone, 13 pedometer + website subjects) during the
study period. There were no differences in the incidence rates of pulmonary events by
randomization group (2 tailed mid-P exact = 0.29). When we included covariate adjustment
for whether a subject experienced a pulmonary event during the study into our primary
model, the between-group difference in change in daily step count at week 13 remained
significant (864.3 ± 355.1 higher in the pedometer plus website group, p=0.02). When we
included covariate adjustment for whether a subject experienced either a significant adverse
event or a pulmonary event, the between-group difference in change in step count at week 13
remained significant (883.3 ±348.4 higher in the pedometer plus website group, p=0.01).

DISCUSSION
Low PA is highly prevalent among patients with COPD and has been definitively associated
with reduced HRQL, and increased risk for acute exacerbations and death[5]. Importantly,
sedentary behavior and low PA represent potentially modifiable risk factors in COPD
patients. Recently, a number of interventions which combine the use of wearable monitors in
conjunction with goal-setting have been shown to increase daily PA in COPD patients[18–
20]. Our results show that the combination of a pedometer and a website based on the
Theory of Self-Regulation improves and maintains daily step count over 3 months among
ambulatory COPD patients compared to a pedometer alone. The 4 main components of the
intervention–goal-setting, feedback, education and motivation, and social support—appears
together to have been efficacious in promoting and sustaining walking. These results in a
cohort of patients with COPD referred to a pulmonary clinic not only confirm our previous
findings in a cohort of individuals with COPD identified using an administrative
database[22, 23], but also extends our understanding of the mechanisms of benefit.
Our step-count data, which were collected daily over 3 months, provides exceptional
granularity compared to published studies which assess PA at only a limited number of
discrete time points. Significant increases in daily step count were observed approximately 3
weeks after initiating our pedometer plus website program. These data are consistent with
results reported in Mendoza et al., where the greatest improvement in step count in the
intervention arm (which consisted of goal-setting through the use of daily diaries and in-
person counseling) was observed during the first month of the intervention[19]. We
speculate that 3-4 weeks may be required to effect initial changes in behavior. Therefore,
targeted efforts and counseling to keep patients engaged at the initiation of a program to
promote PA are warranted.
The availability of daily step counts for the entirety of the study and in both arms of our
cohort also allowed us to examine the impact of changes in season and temperature on daily
PA. The efficacy of the pedometer plus website intervention to attenuate the decline
associated with the onset of cold temperatures suggests a mechanism which may contribute
to the overall efficacy of our intervention. Observational studies have consistently reported
declines in daily PA associated with decreasing temperatures in COPD patients[24–26]; the
decline in daily step count observed in the pedometer alone group during the transition from
warm to cold weather is consistent with these reports. The converse was also observed –
increases in daily PA in both groups were observed during the transition from colder to
warmer temperatures. Thus, timing the initiation of a PA intervention (for example, >3
weeks prior to the transition to colder weather in temperate climates) may be particularly
efficacious in COPD populations. To our knowledge, this is the first study which examines
the effect of temperature and season in a PA intervention trial.
The lack of changes in secondary outcomes, such as 6MWT distance and HRQL, in our
study warrants discussion. Changes in exercise capacity in PA-focused intervention trials are
inconsistent, with some trials demonstrating concurrent improvements[19, 20], while other
studies do not[21]. Some of the heterogeneity in response in exercise capacity may be due to
the fact that daily PA and exercise capacity are distinct, independent entities with

multivariable determinants. Similarly, differences in PA-intervention protocols may also
contribute to variability in improvement between studies. It is possible that our intervention
yields isolated gains in daily PA; unfortunately, because 6MWT distance was not assessed in
the THS study, we are not able to provide evidence to confirm this hypothesis. Interestingly,
the lack of improvement in HRQL in our cohort differs from the results reported in the THS
study[23]. Differences in study populations between ESC and THS, such as increased
baseline variability in daily step counts as well as a sicker and more sedentary cohort in
ESC, may also contribute to these findings.
Although our website specifically provided motivation and education to promote disease
knowledge, confidence, and exercise self-efficacy, we did not see significant between-group
differences in improvements in these domains when directly assessed with questionnaires.
Efficacy to increase the primary endpoint of change in daily step count without measurable
differences in self-reported questionnaire items may also reflect a limitation of the
questionnaire tools used. Alternatively, a period longer than 3 months may be needed for
changes in these domains to occur.
Our study provides unique insight into patient perceptions and attitudes along with protocol-
specific feedback which will help in the design of future pedometer- and web-based
interventions to promote PA. Both objective data and subject self-report demonstrate high
acceptance and compliance with our pedometer and website, supporting the feasibility of
employing similar programs in rural areas where access to in-person counseling and
conventional pulmonary rehabilitation programs is limited. Mechanical modifications to
prevent pedometer detachment and simplifying step-count data upload represent easily
implemented changes which can improve future PA interventions.
The strengths of our study include the randomized design, highly granular, objective PA
data, and rich demographic, physiological and psychosocial data. Potential limitations
include the paucity of women and that our study was conducted at a single center, both of
which limit the generalizability of our findings. Nevertheless, the single center in one
geographic region can be viewed as a strength as it allows for uniformity in variables that are
difficult to assess that may impact PA such as weather, the built environment of sidewalks
and green space, and the general culture of how PA (such as biking to work) is integrated in
daily routines. Due to the voluntary nature of the study, it is possible that self-selection for
highly motivated or more computer literate populations occurred. This would not be
expected to contribute to between-group differences observed in our study given our
randomized study design. Due to the nature of the intervention, participant blinding was not
possible. However, the impact of the lack of blinding was mitigated by 1) research staff
performing the end-of-study visits were blinded to subject group assignment and 2) the use
of objectively-assessed endpoints. Finally, a “placebo effect” arising from awareness of PA
monitoring may have impacted participant behavior during the study, particularly in the
control arm. Wearable monitors have been shown to positively impact daily PA levels in
both the general and COPD population [19, 20, 40], even in the absence of a structured goal-
setting program. This would, however, be expected to cause a bias towards the null and
arguably strengthens the significance of the difference between groups due to the addition of
the website to pedometer use in our study.

We acknowledge that the short duration of our study provides helpful but limited
information. Observational studies have consistently described a natural history of decline in
PA among COPD patients[41], although the rate and pattern of decline following an
intervention may vary by patient type and severity[18]. Although gains in daily PA in THS
appeared to wane over time [42], our cohort is distinct and extended follow up, including
monitoring of acute exacerbations following the intervention period, is currently ongoing.
In conclusion, a website added to a pedometer improves step counts and sustains walking
over 3 months, possibly by attenuating declines in PA due to season changes. These novel
data contribute significant insights to exercise counseling by healthcare providers and the
development of future interventions to promote PA among COPD patients. Overall, our
results provide additional evidence to support the use of structured interventions which
include goal-setting in combination with monitoring devices to promote PA in COPD.
Future studies to identify subpopulations who benefit the most, as well as assessing the long-
term efficacy of our protocol, are warranted.
