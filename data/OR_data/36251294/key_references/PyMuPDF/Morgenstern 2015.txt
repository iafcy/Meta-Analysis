Abstract
Background—Women are more likely to live alone compared with men, and therefore have 
more difficulty activating emergency medical systems for stroke. The goal of this study was to 
examine the benefit of wearing medical alert devices to activate emergency medical systems for 
elderly women living alone.
Methods—This was a randomized, controlled pilot trial. Women over 60 with at least 1 stroke 
risk factor were recruited from Southeast Michigan. Subjects received either a medical alert device 
or control. The primary outcome was change in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) from 
baseline to 90 days of wearing the device or control.
Results—A planned sample size of 320 could not be reached and the trial was stopped at 265 
women randomized prior to data examination. On average, the treatment group was older, 
reported lower prevalence of high cholesterol, and was less likely to complete follow-up. There 
was a non-significant smaller loss of healthy days in the past month in the intervention group 
(0.46) compared with the control group (2.23), (p=0.213). Similarly, the secondary outcomes of 
changes in anxiety, depression and changes in perceived isolation did not differ by treatment and 
control groups.
Conclusions—This study did not establish improvement in HRQOL among women who wore 
the device compared with those that did not, nor the feasibility of a trial to study the efficacy of 
medical alert devices in elderly women. Newer devices that use cellular technology may be more 
accepted than the land-line based system used in this study.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability and death throughout the world [1]. Since age 
adjusted stroke incidence is higher in men than women [2] the disease is classically 
considered a male illness. However, about half of stroke deaths occur in women, and since 
women live longer than men they have a higher lifetime stroke risk [2]. Among those that 
survive stroke, functional and neurologic outcome is worse in women compared with men 
[3]. Effective acute stroke treatment exists, but it is time limited and rapid presentation to the 
emergency department is crucial for consideration of acute stroke therapy. Since stroke often 
renders speech and movement ineffective, it is frequently an observer who activates 
emergency medical services rather than the patient herself [4]. A potential impediment for 
elderly women getting to the hospital quickly is that they are more likely to live alone than 
men, and therefore a call for help for stroke is less likely to happen compared with someone 
who does not live alone [5]. Indeed, people who live alone get to the hospital slower, are 
less likely to get the clot dissolving drug, rt-PA, and have worse stroke outcome than those 
who do not live alone [5].
A potential way to help women who live alone get to the hospital quickly when they have a 
stroke is to have a medical alert device on their body that can be pushed to initiate a call for 
emergency medical services. We conducted a single center pilot randomized controlled trial 
to determine the feasibility of women wearing such a device. The possibility of reducing 
death, disability and expense in women with stroke by using these simple devices suggests 
an exciting opportunity to improve public health and reduce the stroke burden in women.
METHODS
This report contains the primary results of the pre-specified analysis of the Women 
Independently Living with a Medical Alert Device (WILMA) trial conducted at the 
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, USA. Subjects were randomized to receive the device 
or not, and the main outcome measure was Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) 
measured at 90 days. This study was approved by the University of Michigan IRB and all 
subjects provided informed consent. This trial was not registered with clinicaltrials.gov since 
it was a single center study and registration was not required at the time of study conduct.
Study Subjects
Inclusion criteria were: Women; age ≥80 or age 60–79; ≥1 stroke risk factor (hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, current smoker, prior 
stroke or TIA); not currently using a medical alert device/service; has a working home 
phone that is compatible with monitoring service; plans to stay in current residence in 
Michigan for the duration of the study. Exclusion criteria were: cognitive impairment that 
would impede informed consent; living with someone else; residing in a facility that 
provided emergent care; living more than an hour by car from Ann Arbor; having an at 
home caregiver that provides > 3 hours per day of help.
Subjects were recruited through direct mail, flyers and direct communication at the 
University of Michigan Geriatrics and General Medicine Clinics; from the Claude B Pepper

Senior Resource Center; local senior centers; from local independent senior living centers; 
churches and other civic centers.
Randomization and Intervention
Eligible subjects were randomized to either the medical assistance device or control in a 
block design with block sizes of 4 and 6. Subjects randomized to receive the medical 
assistance device were contacted by the local provider, Huron Valley Ambulance (HVA). 
HVA is a not-for-profit organization that provides emergency response to the local 
community. HVA personnel installed the speakerphone (Visonic Amber® Select) and gave 
instructions for its use along with the call button device (Visonic MCT-212) per their 
standard protocol. A representative from HVA contacted them to set up an appointment to 
install a speakerphone to the subject’s landline phone in their home (attached like an 
answering machine). The device works with a range up to 120 meters. Each person also 
received a small call button of two designs, a wrist band or a necklace per their preference. 
If a person pushed the call button, it would communicate a signal to HVA, who would 
respond over the speakerphone device to see if the activation was on purpose. Either no 
patient response or a positive response indicating assistance is needed generated immediate 
emergency response. During the study those randomized to the device received the device 
and monitoring service for free. At the end of 90 days subjects had the option of keeping the 
monitoring service at their expense, or having the devices collected by HVA and cease 
monitoring. This study was not blinded. Subjects were obviously aware of having the device 
or not, and the coordinator obtaining outcome data was aware of the study purpose. Subjects 
in both arms of the study were read a list of stroke symptoms after the knowledge of stroke 
symptoms was queried.
Data Collected
At baseline subjects in both groups were interviewed in person or over the phone and 
provided: demographics (age, race-ethnicity, marital status, socioeconomic status); contact 
information (telephone number, address); social isolation/connectedness scale; quality of 
life; anxiety; depression; and stroke knowledge questions. At follow-up the same 
information was obtained again except for demographics, contact information and stroke 
knowledge. In addition, the follow-up interview included: medical utilization 
(hospitalizations, ED visits, device activation); use of medical alert devices/service; and 
whether they would choose to keep this or a similar device if cost was not an issue.
The primary outcome, quality of life, was measured by the HRQOL instrument developed 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. This instrument, which is 
comprised of four questions, captures an individual’s perceived physical and mental health 
and has been used in elderly women to assess changes in quality of life over time [6]. The 
instrument asks participants to self-report the number of days in the past month when 
physical and mental health were not good. The primary outcome was assessed as the total 
number of healthy days (physical plus mental). Secondary outcomes included anxiety and 
depression as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS 
is a short 14-item scale that takes two to five minutes to administer. The HADS has been

shown to be a valid method for assessing anxiety and depression in primary care and general 
population settings and has been used in elderly female populations [7]. Items are scored 
from 0–3 on a 4-point Likert-type scale, generating a range of 0 to 42 points. Higher scores 
represent greater symptom severity. Social connectedness, another secondary outcome was 
assessed using social isolation via the Perceived Isolation Index in an elderly population 
ages 57–85 [8]. This scale contains questions related to social support and loneliness and has 
been shown to have reliability in an elderly population. We modified this scale by removing 
questions about spouse or partner, as our population by definition was living alone. Each 
item on the scale was scored 1 to 3 and then standardized. The overall index was 
summarized as an average of all seven items with higher scores indicating greater perceived 
isolation. Stroke knowledge was assessed by asking participants to name stroke warning 
signs. We classified stroke symptoms into 5 categories: weakness, numbness, or tingling on 
one side of the body; difficulty speaking or understanding speech; headache; dizziness, 
lightheadedness, or falls; and vision problems. Participations who were able to recognize 2 
or more categories of stroke symptoms were considered to have adequate stroke knowledge 
[9].
Statistical Analysis
Sample size was determined using standard calculations for repeated measures ANOVA. 
The following assumptions were made: 5% level of significance, 80% power, detectable 
difference of 4 healthy days (pre-post difference in quality of life between two treatment 
groups), a constant standard deviation of 12 for both groups, and a 0.50 correlation between 
pre- and post- time points. Under these assumptions, 143 subjects were needed in each 
group. Assuming some loss to follow-up over the course of the study the planned 
recruitment was 160 subjects in each group.
Demographic and health characteristics were summarized at baseline by treatment and 
control groups. Continuous variables were summarized by means and standard deviations 
and compared using t-tests. Categorical variables were summarized by frequencies and 
percents and compared using chi-squared tests. Change scores were created for the 
difference in number of healthy days (physical plus mental) from pre- to post-intervention 
and for the secondary outcomes of anxiety and depression, using the HADS score, and 
perceived isolation index. Change scores were then compared by treatment group using 
simple linear regression. Among those randomized to the intervention, frequencies and 
percents were used to summarize appropriate use of the device. All analyses were performed 
using SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC).
RESULTS
WILMA enrolled its first subject on November 30, 2011 and last on August 5, 2014. While 
the goal was to enroll 320 subjects the study was stopped after 265 were enrolled prior to 
examining the data, due to slower than anticipated enrollment. Figure 1 is the CONSORT 
diagram for the study. Lack of participation was most commonly due to the fact that subjects 
either did not have a land-line telephone or already had a medical alert device.

There were 265 women randomized to either the treatment (n=133) or the control group 
(n=132). On average, the treatment group was older, reported lower prevalence of high 
cholesterol, and was less likely to complete follow-up (Table 1). Overall, women in the 
study experienced a mean loss of 1.38 (SD=10.8) healthy days. Women in the treatment 
group experienced a smaller loss of health days (0.46; 95% CI: −1.58, 2.50) than women in 
the control group (2.23; 95% CI: 0.31, 4.15), but this difference was not significant (Table 
2). Similarly, for the secondary outcomes of changes in HADS score and changes in 
perceived social isolation, the treatment and control groups did not significantly differ.
Among those women that were randomized to the treatment group, only 1 purposefully used 
the device during the study period, and 9 went to the ER or used EMS without the device. 
There were no strokes. Half of the women reported wearing the device almost all of the time 
and 12% reported never wearing the device. Sixty-nine percent of the women removed the 
device for any reason. If cost was not an issue, 53% would want to keep the device. 
However, only 17% planned to keep the current device service if they had to pay for it.
DISCUSSION
The WILMA pilot trial did not find a significant improvement in HRQOL in subjects 
randomized to receive a medical alert device compared to control. Study recruitment was 
slower than anticipated and consequently missed the planned sample size suggesting that a 
large randomized trial of medical device use would likely not be feasible in its current form 
at a single center. A pivotal study would need to demonstrate that wearing a device reduces 
delay times to hospital arrival for stroke patients who live alone.
Due to the available technology when WILMA began, participants were required to have a 
land-line telephone. This excluded a large number of potential subjects who only had a cell 
phone. Newer technologies, especially those that incorporate cellular signal are likely to not 
only enroll subjects more easily but also provide coverage outside of the home. This is an 
excellent opportunity for biomedical engineering innovation in neuroscience. The device, 
however, must be worn rather than carried like a cell phone since at the time of stroke many 
subjects are unable to move, rendering a cell phone that is not physically on the patient 
useless. An ideal device would be one that is unobtrusive, easy to wear, inexpensive, able to 
transmit in most locations including outside the home, and one that could provide two-way 
communication in case of inadvertent activation.
The problem of stroke in women is receiving much needed attention after a long history of 
considering stroke a men’s disease [10]. Recent studies that suggest worse stroke outcome in 
women compared with men, differential gender response to IV rt-PA, and different stroke 
symptoms in men and women all point to the need for more research into stroke prevention 
and treatment for women [3,11,12]. WILMA spoke to the evidence that women are less 
likely to present to the hospital promptly for acute stroke therapy [13,14] which has not been 
found consistently [15]. Since women are more likely to live alone than men, a solution is 
needed to help women who have an acute medical emergency to call for help when the 
medical emergency prevents movement and/or verbal communication. This is notably 
important for diseases with time limited therapies. While stroke is the clearest example of

such a condition and very common, other conditions including myocardial infarction suggest 
the public health need for interventions to help women who live alone.
This study had limitations that warrant consideration. There was a greater loss to follow-up 
among the intervention compared with the control group which may have implied 
dissatisfaction with the device. This was an unblinded study. Since the purpose was to 
determine the feasibility of participating and wearing a device it was impossible to mask the 
study subjects with a sham device. The outcome assessor was also unblinded although the 
primary outcome measure was a structured questionnaire that was not subject to coordinator 
interpretation. The study failed to achieve its planned sample size and as such was under 
powered to detect a change in the primary outcome. WILMA was a single center study and 
results may not generalize to other settings.
In summary, this study did not find improvement in HRQOL in women who received the 
device compared to those that did not, perhaps due to a small sample size. The study 
suggested a lack of feasibility for a larger trial since enrollment was much slower than 
expected. Newer technology that utilize cellular systems, can be worn in any location and is 
aesthetically pleasing to women would improve feasibility and may be a solution to 
activating emergency medical systems for time-limited acute medical conditions like stroke.
