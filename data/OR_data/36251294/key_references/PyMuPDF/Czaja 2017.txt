Abstract
Objectives:  Information and communication technology holds promise in terms of providing support and reducing isola-
tion among older adults. We evaluated the impact of a specially designed computer system for older adults, the Personal 
Reminder Information and Social Management (PRISM) system.
Design, Setting, and Participants:  The trial was a multisite randomized field trial conducted at 3 sites. PRISM was com-
pared to a Binder condition wherein participants received a notebook that contained paper content similar to that contained 
in PRISM. The sample included 300 older adults at risk for social isolation who lived independently in the community 
(Mage = 76.15 years). Primary outcome measures included indices of social isolation, social support, loneliness, and well-
being. Secondary outcome measures included indices of computer proficiency and attitudes toward technology. Data were 
collected at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-randomization.
Results:  The PRISM group reported significantly less loneliness and increased perceived social support and well-being at 
6 months. There was a trend indicating a decline in social isolation. Group differences were not maintained at 12 months, 
but those in the PRISM condition still showed improvements from baseline. There was also an increase in computer self-
efficacy, proficiency, and comfort with computers for PRISM participants at 6 and 12 months.
Discussion:  The findings suggest that access to technology applications such as PRISM may enhance social connectivity and reduce 
loneliness among older adults and has the potential to change attitudes toward technology and increase technology self-efficacy.

By 2050, people aged 65 and older are projected to repre-
sent 21% of the U.S. population, and those aged 85 and 
older will represent 5% (Ortman, Velkoff, & Hogan, 2014). 
Population aging, especially the increase in the “oldest old,” 
presents opportunities and challenges for economic, social 
support, and health care systems.

due to death, social isolation is a problem for many older 
adults. Social isolation may be especially prevalent among 
older people who live alone. Currently about 28% of non-
institutionalized older adults aged 65 and older live alone 
and about half of women aged 75 and older live alone 
(Administration on Aging, 2016).
Maintaining social relationships and remaining socially 
connected is critically important to health, quality of life, and 
well-being. According to Rowe and Kahn’s model (Rowe & 
Kahn, 1998) and the Proactivity Model of Successful Aging 
(E. Kahana & B. Kahana, 1996, 2001), engaging in social 
activities and using social resources are important to “suc-
cessful aging” and maintaining quality of life in older age. 
Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, Rose, and Cartwright (2010) 
also found that having adequate social support is a com-
ponent of successful aging. Social engagement may also be 
a protective factor against cognitive decline at older ages 
(Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, & Berkman, 2001).
In contrast, social isolation is associated with lower qual-
ity of life and life satisfaction, poorer mental and physical 
health outcomes, and cognitive decline (Aylaz, Artürk, Erci, 
Ӧztürk, & Aslan, 2012; Ellis & Hickie, 2001; Fratiglioni, 
Wang, Ericsson, Maytan, & Winblad, 2002). Data from 
recent longitudinal studies (Steptoe, Shankar, Demakakos, 
& Wardle, 2013) and meta-analyses (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, 
& Layton, 2013) indicate that irrespective of demographic 
characteristics and health problems, social isolation is signif-
icantly associated with mortality. Perceived social isolation, 
often referred to as loneliness, is also linked to impaired cog-
nitive functioning and poorer mental and physical health (J. 
T. Cacioppo & S. Cacioppo, 2014).
The abundance of evidence linking social isolation and 
loneliness to adverse impacts on health and quality of life 
points to the need to develop interventions to prevent or 
remediate social isolation in older people. Information and 
communication technologies (ICTs) such as the Internet or 
E-mail have potential for enhancing the social connectivity 
of older adults, especially those who have mobility restric-
tions, live alone, or live in rural locations. Findings from 
studies that have examined the impact of ICT access on 
outcomes related to quality of life and well-being in older 
adult populations are mixed. Some have found that pro-
viding older adults with access to technology applications 
has no impact on well-being (Dickinson & Gregor, 2006; 
Slegers, van Boxtel, & Jolles, 2008; White et  al., 2002), 
whereas others have shown that access improves quality of 
life and reduces feelings of loneliness (Choi, Kong, & Jung, 
2012; Cotton, Anderson, & McCullough, 2013). These dis-
crepancies may be due to variation in study populations, 
technologies examined, and outcome measures. Moreover, 
only a few studies have used randomized designs with 
concurrent controls, included long-term follow-up, large 
diverse samples, or used systems that were designed to 
accommodate older adults.
The objective of this multisite trial was to gather rigorous 
evidence about the value of a specially designed computer 
system for older adults, the Personal Reminder Information 
and Social Management (PRISM) system, which included 
a software application and a robust support system with 
training and instructional support. The PRISM system 
was compared to a Binder condition wherein participants 
received a notebook with printed content similar to that 
contained in PRISM. We also gathered longitudinal data on 
the impact of access to the PRISM system.
PRISM included features that provided easy access to 
resources and information sources, and opportunities for 
engagement and communication. The features were prese-
lected in terms of their potential relevance to older adults, 
especially those at risk for social isolation, and integrated 
such that it was easy to find and shift between features 
(e.g., E-mail, games). PRISM also included vetted links 
to additional sources of information topics thus facilitat-
ing information search. Older adults were involved in the 
development of the software, training, and instructional 
materials using a user-centered interactive design approach, 
which is not typical for most ICT systems.
We hypothesized that participants receiving PRISM 
would demonstrate greater improvements in social sup-
port and well-being and reduced feelings of loneliness as 
compared to those receiving the Binder. The trial was con-
ducted to adhere, as far as possible, to Consort Standards 
for Randomized Clinical Trials. In this paper, we report the 
6- and 12-month primary and secondary outcomes.
Methods
Study Design
The trial was a multisite randomized controlled trial con-
ducted in: Miami, Florida, Tallahassee, Florida, and Atlanta, 
Georgia. The trial duration was 12  months. Assessments 
occurred at baseline and 6 and 12 months post-randomi-
zation. The Institutional Review Boards at the three sites 
approved the study protocol.

Participants
The sample included individuals aged 65 or older living 
alone in independent housing, who spoke English, had at 
least 20/60 vision with or without correction, and could 
read at the 6th grade level. They had minimal computer/
Internet use, were not employed or volunteering more than 
5 hr/week, or spending more than 10 hr/week at a senior 
center or formal organization. We chose these criteria to 
identify older adults at risk for social isolation. Participants 
were excluded if they were blind or deaf, had a terminal 
illness, or severe motor impairment. During the telephone 
screen, participants were asked about hearing, visual, or 
motor impairments. If they reported that they had a visual 
or hearing impairment that could not be corrected (e.g., 
with glasses or a hearing aid) or a motor impairment that 
would interfere with their ability to use a keyboard, they 
were deemed ineligible for the study. Individuals were also 
excluded if they were cognitively impaired (initially flagged 
as a Mungus corrected score of <26 on the Mini-Mental 
State Examination [MMSE; M. F. Folstein, S. E. Folstein, &  
McHugh, 1975]; the MMSE was administered during the 
initial home visit). A few participants (n =11) scored less 
than 26 on the MMSE. However, these participants did 
not report any memory complaints and met all other study 
criteria. For these participants, we administered the Fuld 
Object Memory Evaluation (FULD), which is culturally and 
educationally fair and has proven sensitivity and specific-
ity in distinguishing between cognitively impaired and non-
impaired older adults (e.g., Wall, Deshpande, MacNeill, & 
Lichtenberg, 1998). On the basis of the results of the FULD 
and a review by a board-certified clinical neuropsychologist, 
these individuals were permitted into the study; six were 
randomized to the PRISM condition and five were rand-
omized to the Binder condition. All participants provided 
written informed consent.
Recruitment strategies included: advertisement in local 
media, interactions with agencies serving older adults (e.g., 
meals on wheels), posting flyers (e.g., senior housing), and 
participant registries.
The PRISM Condition
PRISM participants received a Lenovo “Mini Desktop” PC 
with a keyboard, mouse (or trackball for those who were 
unable to control a mouse), a 19″ LCD monitor, the PRISM 
software application, and a printer. Computers were linked 
to a secure server at the host site and free Internet access 
was provided through a wireless card. Participants were 
unable to add other applications to the system. There were 
no login requirements to access PRISM (Czaja et al., 2015).
PRISM included: Internet access (with vetted links 
to sites such as NIHSeniorHealth.Gov), an annotated 
resource guide, a dynamic classroom feature, a calendar, 
a photo feature, E-mail, games, and online help (Figure 1). 
The resource guide include information on: local and 
national organizations such as the local area agencies on 
aging, senior centers, the Administration on Aging; services 
such as transportation, meal and emergency services; cul-
tural and educational offerings; community-based fitness 
programs; and events such as health fairs. Where possible 
links were included to facilitate access to the resources. The 
E-mail feature included a “buddy tab” intended to foster 
social connectivity. During the initial training session, par-
ticipants were asked if they would like to be listed as a 
“PRISM Buddy.” They were informed that it would be a 
way for them to have contact with new people who had 
similar interests. The classroom feature was dynamic and 
updated monthly with a information on a new topic (e.g., 
hobbies) and included three tabs: general text that we pre-
pared, vetted links, and videos.
PRISM was built using an iterative user-centered design 
approach. Older adults were actively involved in the pro-
cess via a survey study, focus groups, and pilot testing 
(Czaja et al., 2015). Information gleaned from these activi-
ties was incorporated into the design of PRISM. The inves-
tigators also conducted a heuristic analysis using current 
usability guidelines (e.g., Fisk, Rogers, Charness, Czaja, & 
Sharit, 2009).
Binder Condition
Binder participants received a notebook with printed con-
tent similar to that within PRISM: a calendar, resource 
guide, games (e.g., word games), community information, 
and information/tip sheets on the same topics as the “class-
room feature” of PRISM, which were updated monthly 
via mail. Participants were also provided with a sheet for 
listing contacts such as family/friends and were given the 
opportunity to be a “buddy,” which meant sharing their 
phone number and interests with other participants in this 
condition. Participants were informed that this would be a 
venue to have contact with new people with similar inter-
ests. They received the same number of planned contacts as 
those in PRISM.
Protocol and Contact Schedule
Interested participants contacted the site study coordinator 
and completed a telephone screening that assessed eligibil-
ity. For those eligible and interested in participation, a home 
baseline assessment was scheduled. During this assessment, 
participants provided informed consent, completed the 
measurement battery, and were then randomly assigned to 
study condition. Randomization occurred within each site.
All participants received three additional home visits for 
training and “check-in” calls 1 week following the third 
home visit to determine if they had any difficulty using the 
PRISM system or the notebook and at 3 and 9 months. 
PRISM participants were also provided with a user man-
ual, a “help” card, and had access to a technical help line. 
The Gerontologist, 2018, Vol. 58, No. 3

Participants completed follow-up assessment at 6 and 
12 months.
PRISM Participants were compensated $25 per assess-
ment. They were allowed to keep the computer following 
the intervention period; however, PRISM was no longer 
available and free Internet service was no longer provided. 
They were given the opportunity to switch to a commercial 
Internet service provider and offered help to procure and 
install the service.
Binder participants were compensated $25 for the base-
line and 6-month assessments and $100 for the 12-month 
assessment, as they did not receive a computer. They were 
given an opportunity to receive basic computer training fol-
lowing the 12-month assessment.
An assessor blinded to treatment condition, adminis-
tered the primary outcome measures of the assessment 
battery at 6 and 12 months via a telephone interview. The 
same assessor mailed the secondary outcome measures 
(e.g., computer attitudes) and other instruments that were 
self-administered (e.g., demographics) and administered 
the remainder of the follow-up assessment that needed to 
be completed in the home.
Measures
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measures included changes, at 6 
and 12  months, in: social isolation (Friendship Scale—
Hawthorne, 2006), loneliness (Loneliness Scale—Russell, 
1996), perceived social support (Interpersonal Support 
Evaluation List—Cohen, Mermelstein, Kamarack, & 
Hoberman, 1985), Social Network Size (Lubben Social 
Network Index—Lubben, 1988), perceptions of quality of 
life (Quality of Life Scale—Logsdon, Gibbons, McCurry, &  
Teri, 2002), and perceived vulnerability (Perceived 
Vulnerability Scale—Myall, Hine, Marks, & Thorsteinsson, 
2009). Changes in health-related quality of life and well-
being (The MOS 36-item Short-Form Health Survey 
[SF-36—Ware & Sherbourne, 1992]) were also examined 
(Table 1).
Secondary outcome measures included changes in atti-
tudes toward technology (Jay & Willis, 1992) and computer 
proficiency (Boot et al., 2015). We also developed a 12-item 
measure that assessed perceptions of the usefulness and 
usability of PRISM (Technology Acceptance Questionnaire, 
Center for Research and Education on Aging and 
Technology Experience, for this trial, adapted from Davis, 
1989). Responses were given on a 7-point Likert type scale 
ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
Additional Measures
Participants completed a demographic background ques-
tionnaire, a Life Space Questionnaire (Stalvey, Owsley, 
Sloane, & Ball, 1999), the Test of Functional Health 
Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA—Baker, Williams, Parker, 
Gazmararian, & Nurss, 1999), the WRAT (Wilkinson, 
1993) as a measure of general reading ability, and measures 
of cognitive abilities such as working memory and process-
ing speed (Czaja et al., 2015).
All participants completed a System Evaluation ques-
tionnaire at 12  months, which assessed their opinions 
about the system they used. Responses were given on a 
7-point Likert type scale ranging from strongly disagree to 
strongly agree.
Real-time data of PRISM usage included the number 
of days a participant accessed the system and accessed a 
feature. Time spent using the system and each feature was 
recorded but not included in the analyses as a feature may 
have been accessed but the participant could have per-
formed other activities while leaving the feature active. 
Thus, time could reflect an inflated indicator of use.
Treatment Fidelity
All sites used a detailed manual of operations (MOP) and 
applied equivalent procedures and standardized protocols. 
Assessors and interventionists were trained using standard-
ized protocols and there were cross-site monthly conference 
calls. Training included webinar training on the administra-
tion of the assessment battery, the protocols for both study 
conditions, conducting research with older adults, and 
familiarization with the MOP. Data were maintained at a 
secure server at the Miami site.
Sample
Five hundred and thirty-four individuals received the tel-
ephone screening. Of these, 192 people were excluded due 
to ineligibility (N = 117), lack of interest in participating 
(N = 62), or because they could not be reached to schedule 
a baseline assessment (N  =  13). Of the 342 people who 
received the baseline assessment, 42 were excluded due to 
failure to meet the cognitive criteria (31%), significant com-
puter/Internet experience (30%), intensity of work/volun-
teer activities (8%), or living arrangements (8%) (Figure 2).
Three hundred participants were enrolled in the trial, 150 
in each condition. The sample was primarily female (78%), 
ranged in age from 65 to 98 years (M = 76.15, SD = 7.4); 
33% of the sample was 80 years and older and 15% was 
85 and older. Participants were ethnically diverse (46% 
non-White) and most were of lower socioeconomic status 
(89% had annual household incomes <$30,000) and 39% 
had had a high school or less (Czaja et al., 2015).
Analyses
Primary and secondary outcomes were tested based on 
an intention-to-treat approach using a two-tailed level 
of significance set at alpha  =  .05. We employed a series 
of linear mixed-effects models in STATA (v. 11; xtmixed) 
to estimate the between-subject (PRISM vs. Binder) 
The Gerontologist, 2018, Vol. 58, No. 3
470

and the within-subject effects (Baseline vs. 6  months vs. 
12 months). This approach is more tolerant of missing data 
and not subject to stringent assumptions of sphericity that 
cannot be addressed by traditional corrections associated 
with repeated measures analysis of variance. The models 
included main effects of treatment condition and time of 
assessment and their interactions. Control variables were 
baseline age (in years), baseline MMSE score, and Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977).  
We included a variable to control for site baseline differences 
in primary outcomes (e.g., social isolation). Baseline dif-
ferences in reported social isolation, lower quality of life, 
and life engagement disappeared when CES-D depression 
score was included as a covariate. We included baseline 
MMSE as a control variable for baseline differences as the 
range of MMSE was large (23–30). The sample size for the 
Tallahassee site was too small (n =44) to support clustering 
approaches.
Effect sizes for the outcome measures were calculated 
using Cohen’s (Cohen, 1992) formula for calculating d

(i.e., Estimated Mean of Group  1  − Estimated Mean of 
Group 2)/Outcome SD). Prior to the study, we determined 
that a sample size of 150 participants per group with an 
attrition rate of 20% (thus 120/cell) would result in power 
exceeding 85% with an effect size for the interaction term 
of .15. Based on this N, all effect sizes exceeded this mini-
mal threshold. Missing data were handled using restricted 
maximum likelihood.
Results
Despite randomization, at baseline, participants in the 
Binder condition tended to report more symptoms of 
depression [F(1,298)  =  7.50; p < .008], increased social 
isolation [F(1,297)  =  4.59; p < .04], a lower quality of 
life [F(1,298)  =  4.12; p < .05], and less life engagement 
[F(1,297) = 4.57; p < .04] (Table 1). On average, most par-
ticipants did not meet the cutoff on the CES-D for symptoms 
of depression. With respect to loneliness, on average, a score 
of 21 on the or higher on the Loneliness Scale indicates some 
or high levels of loneliness; thus, on average, our partici-
pants experienced some degree of loneliness (Russell, 1996). 
With respect to social isolation, a score of 18 or below on 
Friendship Scale indicates moderate to high levels of social 
isolation and on average our participants expressed feelings 
of isolation. For social support, a higher score on the ISEL 
indicates more perceived support. Although, there are no 
established cutoffs for this scale, on average our participants 
perceived that they had fairly low levels of support. There are 
also no established cutoffs for our measure of Quality of Life 
but a higher score indicates higher ratings of quality of life 
(range = 13–52), thus on average our participants perceived 
that they had moderate quality of life (M = 39.0, SD = 5.6).
Completers versus Dropouts
Attrition at the 12-months was 19%. Forty-five partici-
pants were lost to follow-up at 6 months; of these, 38 quit 
or could not be contacted and 7 were disqualified because 
they left the geographic area (n = 5); or there was a study 
protocol violation (n = 2). An additional 11 participants 
quit or were lost to follow-up at the 12-month follow-up 
(Figure 1). Noncompleters reported lower baseline health 
on the SF-36. There were no other differences between 
completers and drop outs on our primary or secondary 
outcome measures or demographic characteristics.
Primary Outcomes
We first examined the main effects of time for the primary 
outcome measures. Across the study groups, at 6 months, 
there were decreases in perceived vulnerability (b = −0.48; 
p < .001; effect size = 0.45; 95% CI = −0.64 to −0.32); 
social isolation (b = 0.79; p < .01; effect size = 0.20; 95% 
CI  =  0.24–1.35); loneliness (b  =  −1.68; p < .01; effect 
size = 0.17; 95% CI = −2.73 to −0.63); and quality of life 
(b = −1.08; p < .01; effect size = 0.19; 95% CI = −1.78 
to −0.38). At 12 months, there were also decreases in per-
ceived vulnerability (b = −0.41; p < .001; effect size = 0.38; 
95% CI = −0.57 to −0.24); social isolation (b = 0.84; p < 
.01; effect size = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.27–1.41); and loneliness 
(b = −2.50; p < .001; effect size = 0.25; 95% CI = −3.59 to

−1.41). There were also decreases in the SF-36 ratings of 
physical functioning (b = −3.91; p < .05; effect size = 0.14; 
95% CI = −6.99 to −0.83), and limitations in emotional 
functioning (b = −6.89; p < .05; effect size = 0.19; 95% 
CI  =  −13.68 to −0.11) and increases in social support 
(b = 1.33; p < .01; effect size = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.42–2.24) 
at 12 months but not 6 months.
To examine the differential effect of treatment over 
time, the interaction terms for the Group × Time effects 
at 6 and 12 months were examined employing the covari-
ates listed above. At 6  months, in comparison to Binder 
participants, PRISM participants had a significantly greater 
decline in loneliness (b = 1.72; p < .04; effect size = 0.17; 
95% CI  =  0.16–3.28) and greater increase in perceived 
social support (b = −1.96; p < .004; effect size = 0.28; 95% 
CI  =  −3.26 to −0.66). There was also a trend indicating 
that they experienced a greater decline in social isolation 
(b = −0.66; p < .11; effect size = 0.17; 95% CI = −1.47 to 
0.16) at 6 months.
Group differences were not maintained at 12 months; 
however, those in the PRISM condition maintained gains 
beyond baseline values on loneliness and social support 
outcomes (Figure  3). Those in the Binder condition also 
showed a decrease in loneliness and increase in perceived 
social support at 12 months. Those assigned to the PRISM 
condition also reported a greater increase in ratings on the 
SF-36 in Energy (b = −4.65; p < .05, effect size = 0.22; 95% 
CI = −9.22 to −0.08) and Well-Being (b = −4.86; p < .02, 
effect size = 0.27; 95% CI = −8.95 to −0.77).
Secondary Outcomes Variables
Relative to those in the Binder condition, PRISM partici-
pants reported greater increases in computer comfort at 
6  months (b  =  −1.68; p < .001; effect size  =  0.39; 95% 
CI = −2.57 to −0.78) and 12 months (b = −2.32; p < .001; 
effect size  =  0.53; 95% CI  =  −3.22 to −1.41); greater 
increases in computer interest at 6 months (b = −1.52; p 
< .001; effect size = 0.46; 95% CI = −2.26 to −0.79) and 
12  months (b  =  −0.99, p < .01, effect size  =  0.30; 95% 
CI = −1.74 to −0.25); and had greater increases in computer 
efficacy at 6 months (b = −1.29; p < .001; effect size = 0.41; 
95% CI = −2.01 to −0.57) and 12 months (b = −0.94; p < 
.02; effect size = 0.30; 95% CI = −1.67 to −0.22). Those 
assigned to PRISM also demonstrated a greater increase in 
computer proficiency at 6  months (b  =  −6.37, p < .001; 
effect size = 1.11; 95% CI = −7.39 to −5.35) and 12 months 
(b = −7.06, p < .001; effect size = 1.23; 95% CI = −8.08 to 
−6.03).
Technology Acceptance Questionnaire and 
System Evaluation
Most PRISM participants found PRISM useful in their 
daily life (82%), indicated that PRISM made their life 
easier (80%), improved their daily life (84%), and ena-
bled them to accomplish tasks more quickly (73%). 
They also found PRISM easy to use (88%) and easy 
to become skilled at using PRISM (80%). In fact, 60% 
indicated that they felt comfortable using PRISM within 
1 week. Most found the E-mail feature valuable (85%), 
using the Internet valuable (82%), the Classroom feature 
valuable (80%), and the Games as valuable (77%). Only 
57% found the Photo feature valuable and 51% found 
the Calendar valuable. Of those who received the Binder, 
89% found the information and tips valuable and 87% 
found the community resource information valuable and 
about half (58%) found the Calendar valuable. In con-
trast to those who received PRISM, only 61% thought the 
games were valuable.
PRISM participants found it easier to communicate with 
family and friends relative to those who received the Binder 
(82% vs. 47%) and engage in hobbies and play games 
(82% vs. 52%). Participants in both conditions reported 
that it was easier to look up community information (78% 
vs. 73%) and health information (82% vs. 80%). Almost 
all of the PRISM participants (93%) found PRISM enjoy-
able to use and 88% of those receiving the Binder found it 
enjoyable to use. However, those in the Binder condition 
were more satisfied with the in-home training they received 
(90% vs. 82%).

System Usage
We examined overall use of PRISM and each feature in 
terms of number of days accessing PRISM or a feature over 
time. On average, participants used PRISM about 4 days 
a week (M  =  3.85, SD  =  2.07). The most used features 
were E-mail (M = 3.0, SD = 2.14), the Internet (M = 2.55, 
SD = 1.87), and Games (M = 2.55, 1.86). They used the 
other features—Classroom, Community, Photos, and the 
Calendar—less than once a day (Figure 4). Importantly, the 
help feature was used very infrequently. We examined cor-
relations between days using PRISM and changes in our 
outcomes measures and did not find any significant associa-
tions. However, as noted we used a relatively gross measure 
of use that simply calculated overall use of PRISM and use 
of each feature and did not include assessment of subfea-
tures (e.g., use of the “buddy list” in E-mail).
Discussion
Social isolation and loneliness are problems confronting 
many older adults, which is consequential for their mental 
and physical well-being. This trial examined the value of a 
simple-to-use computer system, which provided access to a 
broad array of features, on outcomes related to isolation, 
perceived loneliness, and social support among a sample 
of older adults. Although other studies have examined the 
impact of ICT access on outcomes related to quality of life 
and well-being in older adults, and some have shown that 
going online can be beneficial in terms of social connec-
tivity (e.g., Cotten, Anderson, & McCullough, 2013), our 
study is unique in several respects.
Our study represents the first large-scale randomized 
trial to examine the benefits of access to an ICT system 
with a large ethnically diverse older adult population from 
three cities in the United States who were at risk for social 
isolation, of lower socioeconomic status, and many of 
whom had relatively low education. Also, a large portion 
of our sample was 80  years and older and had minimal 
or no prior computer experience. These cohorts of older 
people are the least likely to adopt technology and use the 
Internet and remain on the other side of the digital divide. 
Although access to ICTs is increasing, recent data from 
the Pew Internet and American Life Report (Rainie, 2016;  
Smith, 2014) indicates that only 45% adults in the United 
States who have household incomes less than $30K (the 
majority of our sample) and only 47% of those aged 65 
and older and 34% of those aged 75 and older have home 
broadband access. Similar trends exist for other newer 
forms of technology such as mobile devices. Thus, the 
findings from this study have implications with respect to 
fostering technology adoption in these populations. Not 
having access to current and emerging technologies puts 
the “have nots” at a great disadvantage given the increased 
reliance on these technologies for access to services, health 
applications, and the performance of everyday activities.
PRISM, unlike systems examined in previous stud-
ies, provided participants with access to a broad array of 
features beyond the Internet such as E-mail, games, and 
a dynamic classroom feature, which provided additional 
opportunities for social interaction and engagement. The 
content of PRISM features was chosen in terms of potential 
relevance to older adults, the features were easy to access 
(only requiring one “click” on the feature name on the 
homepage sidebar menu), and it was easy to shift among 
features. The system was also dynamic in the sense that 
participants had easy access to other information (e.g., 
through vetted links and videos) and the classroom was 
updated monthly. The system also provided opportuni-
ties to make new acquaintances with individuals who had 
similar interests. We also gathered feature usage data over 
a 12-month period. This data coupled with the subjective 
evaluation data can be used to guide the developments of 
future systems.
Overall, our results suggest that ICTs hold potential 
value with respect to reducing problems with social isola-
tion, fostering connectivity and decreasing feelings of lone-
liness among older adults who live alone and have limited 
engagement in work and social activities. Our findings 
showed that at 6 months, participants who received PRISM 
reported greater perceived social support, decreased feel-
ings of loneliness, and increased well-being.
Our data support the value of PRISM with respect to 
communication and engagement. The most used features 
of the system were E-mail, the Internet, and Games. PRISM 
participants also indicated that use of the system made it 
easier to communicate with family and friends; engage in 
hobbies and games; and find information. They also indi-
cated the E-mail, Internet, and Game features were highly 
valuable. These findings indicate that features that facilitate 
communication and engagement should be incorporated in 
ICT technologies. Further, where possible these systems 
should provide opportunities for older adults to expand 
their social network.
Although improvements from baseline in loneliness, 
well-being, and social support were still evident for those 
receiving PRISM at 12 months, group differences were not 
maintained at 12 months. In fact those in the Binder con-
dition showed some improvements on these measures but 
Figure 4.  Average number of days per week participants used PRISM 
and PRISM features for participants who completed the trial. Note that 
we include only up to week 48; near the end of the trial some partici-
pants transitioned from PRISM to a Windows platform.

not to the same level as those receiving PRISM (Figure 3). It 
may be that over time the novelty of having access to E-mail 
and the Internet lessens and the immediate perceived ben-
efits of access do not increase over time, especially because 
the features of PRISM were static and our participants did 
not have an opportunity to learn new applications. This 
suggests that for the benefits of systems like PRISM to be 
enhanced, these systems should provide users with oppor-
tunities engage in new learning and advance their skills. 
Findings from a recent study (Chan, Haber, Drew, & Park, 
2016) indicated that training a sample of older adults to 
use an iPad resulted in improvements in aspects of cogni-
tion (processing speed and episodic memory). The training 
required sustained mental effort and productive engage-
ment in new learning. The study participants not only 
acquired skills to improve their daily lives but also expe-
rienced cognitive benefits from the cognitive engagement 
stimulated by the training. Thus, in addition to providing 
opportunities for social interaction, ICT systems should 
also include dynamic features to promote continued oppor-
tunities for cognitive engagement.
The Binder condition provided a strong test of the ben-
efits of PRISM as it provided participants with a large 
amount of valuable information. Participants who received 
the Binder appreciated the utility of the materials in the 
notebook, indicated that they enjoyed using it, found the 
information valuable, and that use of the notebook helped 
them find community and health care information. These 
findings suggest that for our participants simply having 
access to information in an easy to use form is helpful. 
Clearly though, PRISM offered several advantages over the 
notebook as it was a dynamic system that provided easy 
access to a broad array of features and information and a 
convenient way to communicate.
It may also be that simply being part of a study and hav-
ing contact with our study personnel decreased loneliness 
and increased feelings of social support among participants 
receiving the Binder. All participants had the same amount 
of planned contract, which included four initial home ses-
sions, telephone check-ins, and home and telephone follow-
up assessments. Studies have shown that simply having 
telephone contact decreases feelings of loneliness among 
older adults (e.g., Fees, Martin, & Poon, 1999).
Participants who received PRISM also reported that it 
improved their daily life, made their life easier, allowed 
them to accomplish tasks more efficiently and enhanced 
their effectiveness in their day-to- day life. They also had a 
general increase in positive attitudes toward computers and 
demonstrated substantial gains in computer proficiency. 
These findings are important given the ubiquitous nature 
of technology in our society as comfort with computers and 
computer self-efficacy are important to general technology 
adoption (e.g., Czaja et al., 2006).
All of the PRISM participants were able to learn to use 
the system. The majority of users indicated that PRISM 
was easy to use, that it was easy to become skilled at using 
PRISM, and that they felt comfortable using PRISM within 
a short amount of time. These results are particularly strik-
ing given that many of our participants were aged 80 years 
and older and had no or very limited prior computer expe-
rience. These findings support the cognitive aging literature 
(e.g., Charness, Kelley, Bosman, & Mottram, 2001) which 
indicates that older adults are capable of learning new skills 
and dispel existing myths that older adults are technopho-
bic. Our data also show that if users are provided with 
training and an easy to use system, they will be willing and 
able to use it. Difficulty learning to use new technologies is 
a common barrier to technology adoption and most older 
adults indicate that they need assistance learning new tech-
nologies (Smith, 2014).
Our findings also point to the value of a user-centered 
design approach. The design process for PRISM involved 
older adults, which is unique as it is not typical to involve 
older people in the design of ICTs. Even though future cohorts 
of older adults will have had greater exposure to technology, 
training and system design will continue to be important issues 
as technology is constantly evolving and thus future genera-
tions will confront the need to learn and interact with new 
systems. Recent data indicate (Pew Internet and American Life 
project, Rainie, 2016) that older adults perceive that they need 
assistance when using new devices and do not feel comfort-
able learning to use a new device on their own.
Limitations of the study should be noted. Although 
we pilot tested the training program and trained our 
participants gradually over 3 days, they might have ben-
efited from additional booster training; 16% of those who 
received PRISM indicated they would have liked more 
training. Also, our sample was limited to those with no or 
very little computer experience. It would be important to 
evaluate PRISM with more experienced computer users to 
determine whether the benefits associated with PRISM are 
evident for this user group. It may also have been benefi-
cial to have expanded the features of PRISM and include 
applications such as word processing or two-player games 
as well as to make the system more dynamic and include 
opportunities for continued new learning. It would also be 
interesting to examine if new forms of communication such 
as videoconferencing result in added benefits. Also, PRISM 
was only available in English, which restricted enrollment 
of older Hispanic adults.
Careful consideration also needs to be given to choice 
of outcome measures for these types of trials. For exam-
ple, there was no impact on our measure of depression, 
but few participants in our trial manifested symptoms of 
depression. More thought also needs to be given to how to 
best capture system usage. As discussed, time on a system is 
problematic as time on a feature does not necessarily imply 
active use of a feature and as such would inflate system 
usage data. Developing a sampling plan for the measure-
ment of usage also needs careful consideration as capturing 
continuous usage data may create challenges with respect 
to data reduction and analysis.

In summary, access to technology and the Internet 
may provide opportunities to reduce risks of social isola-
tion and loneliness among older adults especially those 
who live in rural locations or have mobility restrictions. 
However, this is not to suggest that technology can replace 
human contact but rather that it can augment opportuni-
ties to remain connected. A cautionary note is that having 
access to technology is not sufficient. Systems must be use-
ful and useable and training and technical support must 
be available. As we move to a more technologically ori-
ented future, not having meaningful access to technology 
applications will likely contribute to enhanced disparities. 
This project illustrates how to successfully reduce such 
disparities through user-centered design and instructional 
support.
