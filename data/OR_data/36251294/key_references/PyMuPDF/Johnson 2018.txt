Abstract
Objectives:  To test effects of the Community of Voices choir intervention on the health, well-being, and health care costs of 
racial/ethnically diverse older adults.
Method:  Twelve Administration-on-Aging-supported senior centers were cluster randomized into two groups: the inter-
vention group started the choir immediately and a wait-list control group began the choir 6 months later. The  choir 
program was designed for community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. The multimodal intervention comprises 
activities that engage participants cognitively, physically, and socially. Outcome measures assessed these three domains as 
well as health care utilization and costs. The intention-to-treat comparison was at 6 months.
Results:  The sample (N = 390) had a mean age of 71.3 years (SD = 7.2); 65% were nonwhite. Six-month retention was 
92%. Compared to controls, intervention group members experienced significantly greater improvements in loneliness 
(p = .02; standardized effect size [ES = 0.34] and interest in life (p = .008, ES = 0.39). No significant group differences were 
observed for cognitive or physical outcomes or for health care costs.
Discussion:  Findings support adoption of community choirs for reducing loneliness and increasing interest in life among 
diverse older adults. Further efforts need to examine the mechanisms by which engagement in choirs improves aspects of 
well-being and reduces health disparities among older adults, including potential longer-term effects.

The United States’ population of adults aged 65 years and 
older is increasingly diverse, with nearly 22% being from 
racial/ethnic minority backgrounds (U.S. Census Bureau, 
2017); by 2030, this percent will increase to almost one 
third (Vincent & Velkoff, 2010). In addition, many older 
adults face socioeconomic challenges, for example , more 
than 4.2 million were below the poverty level in 2015 
(Administration on Aging, 2016). Among older adults, the

poverty rate is higher for blacks (18.4%), Latinos (17.5%), 
and Asians (11.8%) compared to non-Latino whites 
(6.6%). Minority and lower socioeconomic status (SES) 
older adults are at greater risk for poor health outcomes 
(Louie & Ward, 2011).
Engagement in the arts is one novel approach to im-
prove the health of diverse older adults. Arts-based inter-
ventions can be offered in the community, are relatively 
low cost to deliver, are engaging, and can be culturally tai-
lored (Macdonald, Kreutz, & Mitchell, 2012; Noice, Noice, 
& Kramer, 2014; Castora-Binkley, Noelker, Prohaska, & 
Satariano, 2010). Because music is integral to most cultures, 
music interventions may provide opportunities for diverse 
older adults to remain active and engaged (Johnson et al., 
2015). Community choirs are popular, with approximately 
32.5 million adults singing regularly in choirs in the United 
States. (Chorus America, 2009). Community choirs also 
have few requirements in terms of musical ability because 
basic singing abilities develop spontaneously during child-
hood (Trainor & Hannon, 2013). Choirs are multimodal, 
defined as having cognitive, physical, and psychosocial en-
gagement components. Participating in activities that involve 
multiple engagement components in later life and that occur 
in groups may confer more health benefits than activities 
with only one component or done alone (Karp et al., 2006; 
Menec, 2003).
There is a need to understand the potential health ben-
efits of participating in community choirs in later life. Several 
cross-sectional studies found that older adults who participate 
in choirs report greater well-being (Clift et al., 2010; Gick, 
2011; Johnson, Louhivuori, & Siljander, 2017). However, 
these studies involved older adults who were predominantly 
white and from relatively high SES backgrounds. The first 
longitudinal study was nonrandomized and compared older 
adults who participated in a 12-month choir to a usual ac-
tivity group (Cohen et al., 2006). Participants who sang in 
the choir reported better self-rated health, fewer doctor visits, 
use of fewer over-the-counter medications, fewer falls, and 
less decline in morale compared to the usual activity control 
group. However, the groups were self-selected, bias due to 
attrition was not considered, and the sample was predomin-
antly white women. Recently, a randomized controlled trial 
of a choir program for community-dwelling older adults was 
conducted in England (Coulton, Clift, Skingley, & Rodriguez, 
2015). The program involved singing 90 min a week for 14 
weeks, and health and economic outcomes were evaluated at 
the end of the intervention. At 3 months, the choir group had 
significantly higher scores on a mental health-related quality 
of life measure and lower depression and anxiety compared 
with a usual activity control group. No differences were 
observed on a physical health-related quality of life measure. 
Participants were predominantly white women with high edu-
cational backgrounds. Although none of the studies reviewed 
earlier examined cognitive outcomes, studies of piano train-
ing found improvements in cognition for older adults (Bugos, 
Perlstein, McCrae, Brophy, & Bedenbaugh, 2007), and one 
recent qualitative study reported improvements in cogni-
tive function as a perceived benefit of choir singing (Fu, Lin, 
Belza, & Unite, 2015). Additional review of choir studies are 
in a prior article (Johnson et al., 2015). Thus, well-designed 
studies are needed to determine whether choir singing might 
have effects on multiple aspects of health and well-being for 
more diverse samples.
This article reports the effects of a community choir 
intervention designed to promote the health and well-being 
of diverse older adults. The study used community-engaged 
research methods (Napoles, Santoyo-Olsson, & Stewart, 
2013) to design and implement a community choir interven-
tion. To evaluate the choir intervention, we incorporated an 
array of outcomes measuring physical, cognitive, and psy-
chosocial aspects of health. Here, we report the main rand-
omized intention-to-treat group comparisons at 6 months. 
Compared to delayed intervention controls, we hypoth-
esized that participation in a community choir program will 
be associated with improvements/maintenance on the pri-
mary outcomes of executive function, depressive symptoms, 
and lower body strength at 6 months. We also hypothesized 
that, compared to delayed intervention controls, participa-
tion in a community choir program will be associated with 
improvements/maintenance in the secondary outcomes of 
cognition (attention and inhibitory control, memory), psy-
chosocial well-being (sadness, positive affect, fear/affect, 
loneliness, interest in life), physical (balance, gait speed), 
and health care utilization and costs at 6 months.
Methods
The Community of Voices (COV; Comunidad de Voces 
in Spanish) study was a multisite, cluster-randomized 
trial conducted at 12 Administration-on-Aging-supported 
senior centers serving racial/ethnically diverse communities 
throughout San Francisco, CA (study enrollment February 
2012–August 2015). Details about the study design, senior 
centers, and recruitment methods are published elsewhere 
(Johnson et  al., 2015, 2017). Twelve Administration-on-
Aging-supported senior centers were randomized to receive 
the choir intervention immediately (intervention group) or 
after a 6-month delay (wait-list control group). Although 
each choir spanned 1  year (44 sessions), the main rand-
omized intention-to-treat group comparison reported here 
was at 6 months (after 23 sessions) because this coincided 
with the start of the choir intervention for the control group.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion criteria were being aged 60  years and older, 
having sufficient visual and hearing acuity (with assistive 
devices), and being fluent in English or Spanish (bilingual 
and monolingual speakers). Inclusion criteria were inten-
tionally broad because this was a community-based effect-
iveness trial. Exclusion criteria included having cognitive 
impairment (Mini-Cog score <3 of 5; Borson, Scanlan, 
550
Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2020, Vol. 75, No. 3

Brush, Vitaliano, & Dokmak, 2000), self-reported diag-
nosis of dementia, a serious medical condition, or plans to 
move out of the area. Persons who were regularly singing 
in a choir during the past 6  months (e.g., weekly) were 
excluded. The study was approved by the University of 
California, San Francisco’s Institutional Review Board 
protocol number 12-09005, and written consent was 
obtained.
Randomization Procedures
We used a two-arm cluster randomized trial design with the 
12 senior centers serving as clusters. A restricted randomiza-
tion procedure (Hayes & Moulton, 2009) allocated the 12 
centers into 2 sets of 6 centers to optimize cross-set balance 
of 78 center characteristics: 10 indicators of services/activi-
ties provided (e.g., meal service, transportation), 16 demo-
graphic indicators (e.g., proportional representation of age 
strata, racial/ethnic groups, sex, functionally impaired), and 
center readiness to implement the intervention. Afterward, 
one set of six centers was randomly assigned to the inter-
vention group (began choir immediately) and the other set 
to the wait-list control group (waited 6 months to begin 
the choir). Recruitment occurred in phases, one pair of 
senior centers at a time, where each pair consisted of one 
intervention and one wait-list control center. Once baseline 
assessments were completed at a pair of sites, randomiza-
tion assignment was revealed to study and senior center 
staff, music professionals, and participants.
Intervention: COV Choir Program
The choir program was designed in collaboration with a 
community music partner and the senior centers with the 
goal of promoting the health and well-being of diverse, com-
munity-dwelling older adults. The theoretical framework 
and rationale for the program content are published else-
where (Johnson et al., 2015). Each choir session included 
activities targeting three hypothesized pathways by which 
a choir could promote health and well-being: cognitive, 
physical, and psychosocial engagement. The approach to 
the choir intervention across sites was standardized around 
these components and documented in a manual (https://
cov.ucsf.edu/). The choirs were led by professional choir 
directors and accompanists from local communities who 
completed training on the intervention components prior 
to starting the choir with one refresher training midway. 
Choir directors identified music repertoire that could be cul-
turally tailored for each site and was appropriate for older 
adults with a range of singing abilities and experience and 
challenging enough to facilitate growth and mastery over 
time. The 90-min choir sessions took place at the senior 
centers, and each choir met weekly for 44 weeks, including 
3–4 informal public performances. Additional details about 
the intervention are found in the online manual.
Fidelity for Delivery of Intervention
The music partner’s program manager helped supervise 
delivery of the choir intervention. The principal investiga-
tor completed fidelity checks using a 23-item survey that 
assessed three areas: implementation of the three choir 
components (i.e., cognitive, physical, and psychosocial 
engagement), leadership skills, and musicianship. Each item 
was rated on a 4-point scale assessing the extent to which 
the director met expectations (3 exceeded expectations, 2 
met expectations, 1 below expectations, and 0 well below 
expectations). Fidelity checks were completed 3 weeks after 
the choir started, at 3 months, and at 6 months. If ratings 
on any item were below expectations (0 or 1), feedback 
was provided and a follow-up fidelity visit was completed 
within 2 weeks. We report the percentage of items that were 
rated as having met expectations (a rating of 2 or 3) for 
each of the fidelity areas at all three time points.
Participant Adherence to Intervention
To assess participant adherence, attendance at each choir 
session was recorded by the choir directors. Attendance 
was calculated as the total number (and percent) of the 23 
sessions attended and percent of participants who com-
pleted at least 50% and at least 75% of the sessions.
Assessments
In-person assessments were conducted at each of the senior 
centers. We used the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
Assessment Center computer-based platform to collect 
and manage all data and added several project-specific 
instruments.
Sample characteristics
Demographic variables included age (years), sex (male/
female), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino or not), race (American 
Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, black/African American, 
Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, white, and other), 
educational level, marital status, language of screening 
interview (Spanish/English), and nativity. We assessed 
financial hardship in terms of difficulty paying for food, 
monthly bills, medical visits, or prescribed medications in 
the past 12 months. We assessed health insurance (none, 
public only, or any private), whether they previously sang 
in a choir as an adult, and their overall music ability (poor, 
fair, good, very good, or excellent).
Self-rated health was assessed using a standard item 
with five response choices (excellent, very good, good, 
fair, poor). We asked whether a health professional had 
told them they had any of 11 chronic health conditions, 
which were categorized into eight physical conditions (dia-
betes, hypertension, stroke, cancer, arthritis, and emphy-
sema/bronchitis/asthma) and one mental health condition 
(depression or anxiety).

Outcome measures
As detailed elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2015), outcome meas-
ures were selected based on the hypothesized mechanisms 
of action of the intervention by engagement domain: psy-
chosocial, cognitive, and physical. We included measures 
from the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological 
and Behavioral Function (NIH Toolbox; Hodes, Insel, & 
Landis, 2013) as well as several commonly used legacy 
measures. For each engagement domain, we selected one 
measure a priori as the primary outcome; other measures 
of that category were secondary outcomes. Here, we briefly 
describe each measure in terms of its content; details about 
the response choices, scoring, and reliability are reported 
elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2015, 2017).
Psychosocial outcomes
We assessed six psychosocial outcomes: depressive symp-
toms, sadness, anxiety, loneliness, positive affect, and inter-
est in daily life. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009) assessing depressive symp-
toms was the primary psychosocial outcome and ranges 
from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating more depres-
sion. The other five measures were drawn from the NIH 
Toolbox. Three assessed psychological distress: Sadness, 
Fear/Affect (symptoms of anxiety), and Loneliness. Two 
measures assessed psychological well-being: Positive Affect 
and Apathy (Interest in Life). We reversed and renamed 
“Apathy” as “Interest in Life” because all items pertain to 
interest in life (e.g., interested in things, got things done, did 
interesting things, and was motivated). For NIH Toolbox 
measures, we used T-scores scaled so that the means equaled 
50 and the standard deviations equaled 10.
Cognitive outcomes
Three tests assessed memory and executive function. The 
Trail Making Test (TMT) was the primary cognitive out-
come. The TMT (Reitan, 1958; Strauss, Sherman, & 
Spreen, 2006) parts A and B were used to assess the set-
shifting component of executive function. We allowed a 
maximum time of 180 s to complete each part to reduce 
participant burden (Tombaugh, 2004). The variable of 
interest is time (seconds) to complete TMT-B minus time to 
complete TMT-A, which is an index of executive function 
that isolates the executive control component (Sanchez-
Cubillo et al., 2009). The NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory 
Control and Attention Test was used as a test of attention 
and inhibitory control. Participants completed 20 trials; the 
final computed score reflects a combination of accuracy and 
reaction time. A modified version of the NIH Toolbox Rey 
Auditory Verbal Learning Test was used as a measure of 
episodic memory. Fifteen unrelated words were presented 
orally (via audio recording) over three consecutive trials. 
After each presentation, participants were asked to recall 
as many words as possible and again after a distractor trial, 
which included 15 new words. Immediately after recall of 
the distractor list, participants were asked to recall as many 
of the original 15 words as possible (delayed recall, pos-
sible score 0–15), which was the variable of interest.
Physical outcomes
Three performance-based measures were used to assess 
lower body strength, balance, and walking speed. Chair 
stands from the short physical performance battery 
(Guralnik et al., 1994) assessed the primary physical out-
come of lower body strength. We recorded the time in sec-
onds to complete five chair stands, allowing a maximum of 
60 s. The NIH Toolbox Standing Balance measure (Reuben 
et al., 2013) assessed static standing balance. Participants 
were asked to maintain five poses ranging from stand-
ing with feet side by side to a tandem pose. Originally 
we planned to use the ratio of poses 4:1, but laptop con-
nectivity problems (i.e., transmission errors between the 
accelerometer and the computer accessing the assessment 
center) resulted in a large amount of missing data. Here, we 
report results for the ratio of poses 2:1. The NIH Toolbox 
performance measure of gait speed (Reuben et al., 2013), 
which requires participants to walk 4 m at their usual pace, 
was used as a measure of walking pace. The faster of two 
trials was the variable of interest.
Health care utilization and costs
At baseline and 6 months, we collected self-reported health 
care utilization over the prior 3 months, in person or by 
phone using a modified measure from the Chronic Disease 
Self-Management study (Lorig et  al., 1996). We assessed 
number of visits to a doctor, mental health provider (e.g., 
counselor, psychologist), and other health providers (e.g., 
home health nurse, physical therapist); number of emer-
gency room visits and hospitalizations (number of nights 
hospitalized); and number of outpatient surgeries over the 
past 3 months. The mean cost per unit of utilization (e.g., 
doctor visit, hospital night) was obtained from an analysis 
of the 2014 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey for adults 
aged 65 years and older and multiplied by the number of 
units used to obtain health care costs. By converting health 
care utilization to costs, more weight is given to more costly 
services (e.g., hospitalizations and outpatient surgeries) and 
the substitution of cheaper services for more expensive ser-
vices is taken into account.
Power Analysis
Original assumptions included intention-to-treat analyses, 
80% power, two-tailed alpha of 0.05, N  =  450 enrolled 
patients across 12 senior centers, 80% retention at 
6 months (n = 360), casewise deletion of missing data (for 
power analysis, only), and linear mixed models of group 
differences at 6 months. On the basis of our preliminary 
data on choral groups, the largest intracluster correlation 
(ICC) for any outcome equaled 0.015. Accounting for ICC, 
cluster size, and attrition, the minimum detectable 6-month 
standardized group difference, d, equaled 0.35, which 
552
Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2020, Vol. 75, No. 3

compared favorably to effect sizes based upon the results 
reported by Cohen and colleagues (2006) for overall health 
rating (0.41) and depression (0.38) outcomes. We did not 
make alpha adjustments for testing the set of clinically dis-
tinct outcomes pertinent to the hypothesized mechanisms 
of this multimodal experimental intervention. Such adjust-
ments presume a universal null hypothesis that holds for all 
outcomes simultaneously but, because we cannot prespec-
ify which outcome or outcomes may most influence subse-
quent COV-related policy decisions, the universal null is not 
of primary interest (Cook & Farewell, 1996; Cox, 1965; 
Perneger, 1998; Rothman, 1990). Instead, we specified a 
test-wise error rate to allow marginal inferences. This, in 
combination with the reported effect size estimates, should 
allow readers to draw conclusions about the impacts of the 
COV intervention on the modeled outcomes.
Data Analyses
The longitudinal data had a three-level nested structure: 
senior centers, participants, and repeated assessments. 
Linear mixed models with random intercepts of the cogni-
tive, psychosocial, and most physical functioning outcomes 
were fit to the baseline and 6-month outcome assessments 
and tested intention-to-treat group, time, and group-by-
time effects. The group-by-time interaction was the pri-
mary intervention effect test. Model-predicted means are 
reported for the cognitive, psychosocial, and most physical 
functioning outcomes. Total costs were modeled using a 
generalized estimating equation negative binomial model 
testing group-by-time interaction effects as the primary 
intervention effect test.
Results
Recruitment and Retention
During the study design phase, 12 senior center clusters 
were identified; all 12 clusters were eligible, agreed to par-
ticipant, were randomized, and completed the study. Study 
recruitment took place over 29  months, and details are 
reported elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2017). Figure 1 shows 
the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram 
for participant flow. Briefly, six senior centers were rand-
omized to the choir intervention group and six to the wait-
list control group. Within those 12 centers, 636 individuals 
began the screening process, and 390 (61%) enrolled in the 
study (n = 208 in the choir intervention group and n = 182 
in the wait-list control group). The study retention rate at 
6 months was 90% for the intervention group and 93% for 
the control group (91.5% overall).
Sample Characteristics
Baseline demographic characteristics are summarized by 
group in Table  1 and in Supplementary Tables  1 and 2. 
Overall, the mean age was 71.3 (SD = 7.2) years; 76% were 
female, and 65% reported being from nonwhite (minority) 
racial/ethnic backgrounds. Forty-one percent of the sample 
was born outside the United States. Approximately one 
third was married or living with a partner. A range of edu-
cation was represented. Financial hardship was reported 
by 20%. Approximately 25% reported fair or poor health, 
and 60% reported two or more chronic medical condi-
tions. More than half (55%) reported that they had not 
previously sung in a choir as an adult, and over half (56%) 
rated their musical ability as poor or fair. Demographic 
indicators were generally well balanced between groups.
Adherence to Intervention and Fidelity
During the first 6 months, participants in the choir inter-
vention group attended an average of 15.4 (SD = 7.5) and 
a median of 19 of 23 sessions. Seventy-three percent of par-
ticipants attended half or more of the sessions, and 58% 
attended three quarters or more of the sessions.
Fidelity checks found that the interventionists (direc-
tors) met expectations for 99% of musicianship items, 98% 
of leadership/communication items, and 83% of interven-
tion program components. Of these, ratings on the physical 
engagement domain were lower than for psychosocial and 
cognitive components.
Intention-to-Treat Results
Table 2 summarizes the intention-to-treat results for base-
line and 6-month outcomes. There were no significant 
group-by-time differences at 6  months on the three pri-
mary outcome measures: PHQ-8, TMT, or chair stands

(ps > .05). However, significant group differences were 
found for two of six psychosocial outcomes. There were 
significant group-by-time interaction effects for Loneliness 
(p = .02; ES = 0.34 and Interest in Life (p = .008, ES = 0.39). 
There was a decrease in Loneliness in the intervention group 
from baseline to 6 months, whereas the control group did 
not differentially change. Interest in Life increased in the 
intervention group but not the control group. No signifi-
cant group differences were observed for cognitive or phys-
ical outcomes (ps > .05).
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 show the health care util-
ization and cost measures for the two groups at baseline 
and 6  months. Although total costs were similar for the 
two groups at baseline ($1,317 for the intervention group 
vs $1,300 for the control group), the costs for most services 
increased for both groups between baseline and 6 months. 
Whereas health care costs for the control group nearly tri-
pled and costs for the intervention group doubled over the 
6 month period, the group-by-time interaction effect was 
not statistically significant (p = .440).
Discussion
The COV trial represents the largest prospective rand-
omized trial to date, testing the effects of a community 
choir intervention on multiple domains of health and 
well-being of diverse older adults. The choir intervention 
improved two important factors affecting older adults’ 
well-being: It reduced subjective feelings of loneliness and 
increased interest in life. However, cognitive and physical 
outcomes and three other psychosocial outcomes (depres-
sive symptoms, anxiety, and positive affect) did not dif-
ferentially change. Although the control group had nearly 
a 50% larger increase in health care costs than the inter-
vention group, the difference was not statistically signifi-
cant. A hallmark of the study was our ability to enroll and 
retain a large sample of diverse racial/ethnic and low-SES 
older adults who are typically underrepresented in health 
research. Another defining feature of the study was the use 
of community-engaged research methods whereby commu-
nity partners were involved in intervention development 
and delivery.
The fact that participation in a choir reduced feelings 
of loneliness addresses a serious condition for older adults. 
Loneliness, defined as subjective and distressing feelings of 
isolation, less than desired amounts of companionship, and 
not belonging (Peplau, 1985) is common in older adults 
(Mezuk et al., 2016). It is well documented that older adults 
who experience feelings of loneliness are at increased risk 
for poor psychological well-being, cognitive decline, func-
tional and motor decline, and death (Perissinotto, Cenzer, 
& Covinsky, 2012). In our conceptual framework (Johnson 
et al., 2015), we hypothesized that participation in a choir 
could help reduce loneliness by providing a meaningful and 
regular opportunity to meet new people, build social sup-
port, and increase one’s sense of belonging. Our findings are 
consistent with recent reviews suggesting that opportunities 
for building social networks and/or support in a group for-
mat, including the arts, could help reduce loneliness among 
older adults (Cohen-Mansfield & Perach, 2015). What 
remains unclear is whether group singing facilitates social 
bonding above and beyond that conferred by other group 
activities (e.g., yoga, dancing; Pearce, Launay, Machin, & 
Dunbar, 2016). Future research should examine bonding in 
group singing and its effects on feelings of loneliness and 
isolation in older adults, particularly those from diverse 
backgrounds who may have different social networks and 
support systems (Smyth, Siriwardhana, Hotopf, & Hatch, 
2015).
The COV intervention also increased interest in life 
(or reduced apathy). In healthy, nonclinical populations, 
apathy has been conceptualized as a reduction in goal-
directed behaviors and loss of motivation (Bonnelle, 
Manohar, Behrens, & Husain, 2016). This is relatively 
common 
among 
community-dwelling 
older 
adults 
(Brodaty, Altendorf, Withall, & Sachdev, 2010) and is 
associated with incident cardiovascular disease, executive 
dysfunction, and changes in frontal lobe brain connectivity 
(Eurelings et al., 2014; Kawagoe, Onoda, & Yamaguchi, 
2017). In our conceptual framework, we hypothesized that 
singing in a choir could increase interest in life by having 
a regular activity (Johnson et al., 2015). The fact that the 
choir met weekly provided the structure and opportunity

for a regular activity. Several studies have found that par-
ticipation in regular, structured activities as an older adult 
is associated with a reduced risk for cognitive decline, 
dementia, and functional decline (Stern & Munn, 2010; 
Verghese et al., 2003), but only a few studies involve di-
verse older adults (Wilson et al., 2003). Several studies sug-
gest that older Latinos and blacks engage less frequently 
in activities than non-Latino whites (Herrera et al., 2011; 
Marquine, Segawa, Wilson, Bennett, & Barnes, 2012). In 
low-resourced communities, access to regular activities is 
important for older adults to remain active and engaged in 
their community, and participation in a choir could offer 
such opportunities.
We did not find significant group differences on physical 
or cognitive outcomes and discuss three possible explana-
tions. First, it is possible that the physical and cognitive 
outcome measures selected for the study were not sensitive 
enough to detect change within the study follow-up interval 
or were not measuring the types of physical or cognitive 
changes that may have occurred as a result of the interven-
tion. The outcome measures in the current trial were mod-
eled after other behavioral trials for older adults, including 
choirs. Second, participating in weekly 90-min sessions 
may not be a strong enough “dose” to affect cognitive and 
physical function of older adults, or it may take longer time 
periods for choir participation to affect physical and cogni-
tive domains. Although we designed the COV intervention 
to be more engaging than typical choirs for older adults 
(e.g., sing-alongs) by requiring activities that involved in-
creasingly challenging engagement, it is possible that the 
physical and cognitive engagement was not intense enough 
to produce changes in these domains. Perhaps offering a 
choir more than once a week along with daily singing tasks 
would be sufficient to achieve cognitive and physical main-
tenance or improvement. Further, the prevention of cogni-
tive and physical decline has been difficult to document, for 
example, such as in studies of late-life engagement in other 
activities (e.g., cognitive training, physical activity, piano

playing; de Souto Barreto, Demougeot, Vellas, & Rolland, 
2018; Butler et al., 2018; Schneider, Hunter, & Bardach, 
2018). A third possible explanation is that the physical en-
gagement activities, which were less familiar to music pro-
fessionals, were the most inconsistently applied. Although 
choir directors completed training on each of the choir 
intervention components, more intensive training may be 
needed on physical engagement components.
Other multimodal interventions have also been evalu-
ated. The Experience Corps intervention was similar to 
our choir intervention in that it aimed to simultaneously 
increase the social, physical, and cognitive engagement of 
the diverse older adults who volunteered in schools (Fried 
et  al., 2013). Compared to low-intensity volunteering, 
older adults who were randomized to the intensive inter-
generational volunteering intervention over two academic 
years experienced short-term improvements in executive 
function, increased walking activity, and enhancements in 
perceptions of generative desire and achievement (Carlson 
et al., 2009; Gruenewald et al., 2016; Varma et al., 2016) 
Importantly, the intervention required 15  hr/week of 
involvement over 2 years, which was more intense than our 
choir intervention. Interventions combining components 
such as physical activity, diet, and cognitive training have 
also been examined, but a recent report concluded that 
the evidence was insufficient to conclude that they benefit 
cognition (Kane et al., 2017). However, a large, long-term 
randomized multimodal intervention of diet, exercise, cog-
nitive training, and vascular risk monitoring documented 
cognitive improvements after 2 years in at-risk older adults 
(Ngandu et al., 2015). It is possible that interventions aimed 
at improving cognition require sustained training periods.
Regarding costs, similar to the study by Coulton and 
colleagues (2015), we observed increased health care costs 
over time in both the choir intervention and control groups. 
It is difficult to know if rising costs reflect appropriate util-
ization (e.g., increased use and more intensive care because 
of chronic disease progression) or more care regardless of 
the need for care. Coulton and colleagues combined health 
and social care costs and did not find group differences in 
costs 3 months after their 14-week choir program ended.
There are some limitations of our study. Although the 
randomization assignment was kept confidential until all 
baseline assessments were completed at each pair of sites, 
intervention group assignment was known once the inter-
vention began. Similar to most other choir studies, our 
study had a predominance of women. Further, our study 
was one of the early adopters of the NIH Toolbox in both 
Spanish and English, and we encountered some technical 
challenges in collecting data at senior centers. Nonetheless, 
its use resulted in more efficient administration because of 
computer-assisted testing and item response theory meth-
ods and reduced time for data entry.
In addition to being one of the first arts-based rand-
omized trials for older adults, our pragmatic trial repre-
sents a new direction in translational research designed 
to address health disparities in which interventions are 
designed and evaluated in community settings from the out-
set (Napoles et al., 2013). First, the intervention was deliv-
ered in the community (at senior centers) by community 
music professionals. This approach optimizes the cultural 
relevance of the choir at each site and increases the likeli-
hood of sustainability given that the choir was embedded 
in the community from the start. Second, study recruitment 
was conducted entirely in the community at senior centers, 
an approach that facilitated recruitment of an underrepre-
sented population (Johnson et al., 2017), similar to other 
studies (Napoles & Chadiha, 2011; Santoyo-Olsson et al., 
2011). Third, all study assessments were conducted at the 
senior centers, making participation in the research con-
venient for participants and likely contributing to the excel-
lent retention rate. These study methods can be a model 
for future trials to engage and retain diverse older adults in 
research. Conducting this trial in existing community set-
tings moves the program further along on the translation 
continuum.
Our findings that singing in a choir can reduce feelings 
of loneliness and increase interest in life among diverse 
older adults have important public health implications. 
Community choirs are typically affordable, sustainable, 
and accessible, and can be culturally tailored, making them 
relevant and useful for helping to reduce health disparities 
among diverse older adults who are more likely to experi-
ence financial hardship and live in low-resourced commu-
nities compared with white older adults. Future research 
can focus on identifying novel mechanisms and measures to 
assess more nuanced impacts of community choirs on older 
adults’ well-being.
