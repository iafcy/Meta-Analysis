Purpose: To test the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a tai chi qigong program 
with the assistance of elderly neighborhood volunteers in strengthening social networks and 
enhancing the psychosocial well-being of hidden elderly.
Patients and methods: “Hidden elderly” is a term used to describe older adults who are 
socially isolated and refuse social participation. This pilot randomized controlled trial recruited 
48 older adults aged 60 or above who did not engage in any social activity. They were randomized 
into tai chi qigong (n=24) and standard care control (n=24) groups. The former group under­
went a three-month program of two 60-minute sessions each week, with the socially active 
volunteers paired up with them during practice. Standard care included regular home visits by 
social workers. Primary outcomes were assessed by means of the Lubben social network and 
De Jong Gieveld loneliness scales, and by a revised social support questionnaire. Secondary 
outcomes were covered by a mental health inventory and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and 
quality of life by using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Data was collected at baseline, 
and at three and six months thereafter.
Results: The generalized estimating equations model revealed general improvement in out­
comes among participants on the tai chi qigong program. In particular, participants reported a 
significantly greater improvement on the loneliness scale (B=−1.32, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] −2.54 to −0.11, P=0.033) and the satisfaction component of the social support question­
naire (B=3.43, 95% CI 0.10–6.76, P=0.044) than the control group.
Conclusion: The pilot study confirmed that tai chi qigong with elderly neighborhood volunteers 
is a safe and feasible social intervention for hidden elderly. Its potential benefits in improving 
social and psychological health suggest the need for a full-scale randomized controlled trial to 
reveal its empirical effects.

Introduction
With the life expectancy of older people rising, the world population aged 60 and older 
is expected to increase from 900 million in 2015 to 2 billion by 2050, with 400 million 
aged 80 and over.1 Projections indicate that nearly one-third of the local population will

be 65 or above by 2040.2 More than 400,000 elderly people 
live alone or only with a spouse, and this number accounts for 
37.4% of the elderly population in Hong Kong. Older people 
often have fewer social contacts and feel lonely because they 
have a poor network of family or friends.3 Some older adults 
are disengaged or “hidden” from the community. “Hidden” 
has no strict definition, but the term generally refers to older 
people who are disengaged from society, do not know how 
to seek help or support, and are not known to the existing 
community support network.4 The exact number of such 
hidden elderly people in the community is not known, but 
research conducted in 2009 estimated 70,000–90,000 “hidden 
elderly” in Hong Kong.5 Most of these older people have a 
feeling of being discriminated against by neighbors, and are 
reluctant to establish contact with outsiders. Consequently, 
they become the hidden elderly.6
The local literature reports that the hidden elderly 
have weak family and friends network support.6 They feel 
isolated, lonely, and neglected. The factors contributing to 
their hidden life are associated with the aging process, such 
as retirement, declining health condition, widowhood, and 
conflict with their family.6 The hidden elderly are lacking in 
financial resources and knowledge of how to seek outside 
help. In Hong Kong, outreach social services have been set 
up to identify such older people in the community, provide 
home-based counseling, and connect them to center-based 
elderly services. However, there is little evidence of the 
impact of such services on the social health and service 
utilization of the hidden elderly.
Social isolation is an important health concern for such 
people, as they usually live alone and enjoy little social 
participation.7 There is evidence that socially isolated 
individuals have two to four times greater risk of all-cause 
mortality than elderly people who have more friends, 
relatives, and neighbors.8 Engaging the hidden elderly in 
meaningful social life and health promotion activities is 
therefore seen as an agenda to be highly prioritized in elderly 
services.9,10 Group-based physical activity may be an effec­
tive intervention, and the literature indeed reveals that such 
activity is more effective than one-to-one interventions in 
preventing social isolation and depression by improving 
social networking with other participants.11,12 Studies have 
also indicated that when physical activity is performed 
in a group, social reinforcement from participation can 
have social benefits to counter social isolation and create 
friendships.13 Tai chi qigong exercise is a popular physical 
activity intervention among older adults, with a high level 
of perceived benefit.14–16 It is usually performed in groups, 
and has a high acceptability rating among frailer elderly.17 
All these characteristics suggest the potential value of tai 
chi qigong in improving the social health and quality of life 
of hidden elderly in the community.
Tai chi qigong
The foundation of tai chi qigong is a combination of exer­
cise and meditation. Qigong is an ancient Chinese system 
of gentle self-healing exercises, while tai chi is a martial 
art that can be viewed as a therapeutic exercise based on 
traditional Chinese medicine theory. Tai chi and qigong 
can be combined to enhance the training effect, and form an 
activity that engages the mind and the body, the engagement 
of the mind particularly leading to meditative quality and 
preventing boredom.18 Research has demonstrated that tai 
chi and qigong have beneficial effects on patients with 
respiratory disease,13,19 heart disease,20,21 metabolic control 
in type-2 diabetes,22 high blood pressure,23 emotional stress,24 
and sleep disturbances in older adults.25 With the favorable 
results of previous studies, the applicably of tai chi qigong 
to the hidden elderly deserves special attention.
Elderly neighborhood volunteers
The major challenge in planning an intervention program 
for the hidden elderly is how to motivate them to partici­
pate. Although they are a socially isolated group, a previous 
study found that 75% of the hidden elderly welcomed being 
contacted, helped out, and cared for.5 Aside from household 
members, neighbors are their most proximate social contacts. 
Mobilizing elderly neighborhood volunteers to motivate and 
strengthen the social networks of the hidden elderly can 
be a useful strategy. Neighborhood volunteering in the US 
has shown itself able to strengthen the community through 
enhancement of neighborliness and volunteerism.26,27 Having 
strong ties to neighbors facilitates access to immediate and 
informal aid as well as reducing the sense of isolation.27
The present study aims to test the feasibility and pre­
liminary effectiveness of a peer neighborhood-assisted tai 
chi qigong program in strengthening social networks and 
enhancing the psychosocial well-being of hidden elderly.
Materials and methods
Study design
The study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). 
Participants were allocated to the tai chi qigong group or a 
standard care control group.
Subjects and venues
The study was conducted in a district elderly community 
center (DECC) operated by a nongovernment organization

Tai chi qigong improves psychosocial health of hidden elderly
from January 2016 to August 2016. Subjects were included 
if they (1) were aged 60 or above, and (2) did not engage in 
any social activities. They were excluded if they had (1) some 
cognitive impairment (abbreviated mental test score ,7) or 
(2) musculoskeletal disorders or other disabling diseases that 
might limit the practice of tai chi qigong.
Sample size and randomization
Considering the general rule of thumb covering sample 
size requirements for a pilot study,28 a total of 48 subjects 
were recruited. They were randomly allocated to either the 
intervention (n=24) or the control group (n=24) in a 1:1 ratio 
according to a computer-generated random sequence list pre­
pared by an independent statistician. The grouping sequence 
list was password-protected and stored on a computer. 
Only authorized staff responsible for group allocation were 
allowed access to the list. Group allocation of each recruited 
participant was assigned in accordance with his/her sequence 
of enrollment and the corresponding group identifier in the 
previously prepared random grouping list.
Subject recruitment procedure and 
randomization methods
The nurse and social worker in the study setting helped to 
identify potential subjects, and their eligibility was screened 
by the research assistant (RA). The subjects were clearly 
informed about the purpose and procedures of the study, 
and each one was given an opportunity to ask questions. 
A written informed consent was obtained from each eligible 
person agreeing to join the study.
Elderly volunteers
A total of eight active senior volunteers were invited by the 
social worker in the DECC to join the program. Volunteers 
were included if they were aged 55 or above, cognitively 
intact, active in social activities, and willing to help others. 
They were excluded if they were physically unstable or suf­
fered from impaired mobility.
Intervention protocol
Training of the elderly volunteers
The volunteers received training from an experienced nurse 
and a social worker from the DECC. The training focused 
on (1) issues of social isolation, (2) building up trust and 
bonding with others, (3) interpersonal skills in interacting 
with the hidden elderly, and (4) safety issues and general 
care of such people. Four weekly training sessions were 
conducted, each consisting of two-hour training in the form 
of seminar, workshop, and Q & A period. After completing 
the training sessions, the volunteers were recognized as 
“health ambassadors” for this project. The ambassadors 
were neighbors or those who lived in the same building as 
the hidden elderly. The proximity of the matched ambas­
sadors and hidden elderly helped the latter to develop a 
sense of neighborhood, build up peer relationships, and 
be aware that immediate help was available whenever 
necessary.27
Tai chi qigong group
Participants in the tai chi qigong group attended a 60-minute 
exercise class twice a week for three months. The intervention 
program included 18 forms of tai chi qigong (Table S1). The 
18 forms were chosen to emphasize elements of breathing, 
range of motion on limbs, and mind–body coordination. 
Participants were required to coordinate their breathing with 
the slow and graceful movement motions. The classes were 
held in a DECC activity room. The participants were led by 
an experienced tai chi qigong instructor, whose motions, 
postures, and speed of movement they had to copy. Any 
incorrect performance was rectified by the instructor in the 
class. The number of participants in each session was lim­
ited to fewer than 15, which was considered manageable for 
teaching and learning. An RA was present at each session 
to monitor the consistency of the exercise practice, using a 
skill competence checklist.
Participants were encouraged to self-practice tai chi 
qigong for 30 minutes every day. Pictures of the 18 forms 
of the exercise, printed on A3 paper, were provided to each 
participant to help his/her self-practice, and served as an 
important reminder.
The main role of the health ambassadors was to act 
as facilitators for the tai chi qigong group. As they were 
neighbors of the hidden elderly, it was convenient for them to 
remind the participants to attend classes and accompany them 
there. They would then form a self-practice group with three 
participants, each ambassador acting as the group leader. The 
ambassadors were expected to influence the participants to 
join the self-practice group and accompany them to exercise 
in the park every day. They also recorded the frequency of 
the participants’ daily self-practice – a more objective and 
reliable system than the self-recorded logbook for monitoring 
subject compliance.
For ethical reasons, the ambassadors were instructed not 
to coerce the subjects into participating, but to use a friendly 
and caring approach to encouraging them to attend the tai chi 
qigong classes and self-practice groups. They were reminded 
that participation was voluntary and that subjects should not 
be forced into it in any way.

Control group
The subjects in the control group received usual care, which 
included irregular home visits conducted by social workers 
ranging from monthly to quarterly. They also received 
regular information of community services mailed to them 
monthly. No additional activity was recommended to the 
control group.
Outcome measurement
Primary outcomes: social support outcomes
Social network measurement – the Lubben social network 
scale (LSNS-6)
The six-item LSNS-6 assesses the size of the active social net­
work among community-dwelling older adults on a six-point 
Likert scale. Total scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores 
indicating larger social networks. The validated LSNS-6 has 
established a cut-off point of 12 for best overall sensitivity.29,30 
The scale has been widely used in elderly populations.31
Feelings of loneliness – the De Jong Gieveld 
loneliness scale
The six-item scale is widely used to measure loneliness. 
Cronbach’s α on the scale is 0.76. Intraclass correlation coef­
ficients range from 0.98 to 1.00.32 The scale has proved to be 
a reliable and valid instrument to measure overall, emotional, 
and social loneliness.
Revised social support questionnaire (RSSQ)
The RSSQ is a six-item questionnaire designed to measure 
social support. Each item includes a question with two parts, 
assessing the number of people in contact and the level of 
satisfaction with these people perceived by the subject. The 
intraclass correlations for parts 1 and 2 are 0.90 and 0.93 
respectively.33
Secondary outcomes: psychosocial outcomes
Mental health status – the mental health 
inventory (MHI-18)
The MHI-18 assesses several domains of the subject’s mental 
health status, such as anxiety, depression, behavioral control, 
positive affect, and general distress. The reliability estimates 
range from 0.83 to 0.91 for scales based on five lower-order 
factors, and from 0.92 to 0.96 for those based on two higher-
order factors.34
Rosenberg self-esteem scale
This scale, measuring self-esteem, is a ten-item Likert type, 
with items answered on a four-point scale where higher levels 
of self-esteem are indicated by higher scores. Cronbach’s α 
is 0.79.35
Quality of life – 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)
The SF-12 is a popular generic measure of health-related 
quality of life. The 12-item questionnaire measures func­
tional health and well-being from the client’s perspective. 
The survey has favorable internal consistency and test–retest 
reliability (from 0.67 to 0.82).36
Data processing and analysis
To minimize data collection bias, the RAs responsible for 
data collection were blinded to the subject group alloca­
tion. They attended a briefing session where data collection 
procedures were explained. Demographic data and baseline 
measurements for both groups were collected at the beginning 
of the study (T0). Post-intervention and follow-up data was 
collected at three months (T1) and six months (T2).
Process evaluation
A self-developed survey was used with the tai chi qigong 
group at the three-month mark to evaluate subjects’ percep­
tions of and satisfaction with the program.
Data analysis
IBM SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used 
for statistical analysis. Appropriate descriptive statistics were 
used to present the characteristics of the subjects. Baseline 
background characteristics of the two groups were compared 
by independent t, chi-square, or Fisher’s exact tests, as appro­
priate. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models with 
appropriate link functions were used to compare the repeated 
measures of primary and secondary outcomes in the inter­
vention and control groups across the time points. Statisti­
cal analyses were conducted based on the intention-to-treat 
principle. The GEE model could account for intra-correlated 
repeated measures data and accommodate missing data 
caused by incomplete visits or dropout in RCT.37 A dummy 
variable (group) was assigned to represent the intervention 
group, with the control group as reference. Other dummy 
variables, namely T1 and T2, were used to represent time 
differences corresponding to T1 and T2, with the baseline 
T0 as reference. The interaction terms of the time-point and 
group dummy variables (group*T1 and group*T2) were 
included in the GEE model to assess the differential changes 
in the outcomes of intervention and control groups at T1 and 
T2 relative to T0. All statistical tests were two-sided, with 
the significance level set at 0.05.

Tai chi qigong improves psychosocial health of hidden elderly
Ethical considerations
Ethical approval was obtained from the Joint Clinical 
Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of 
Hong Kong and New Territory East Cluster. Permission to 
conduct the study in the selected community center was also 
obtained. The subjects participated voluntarily in the study, 
and were informed of its purposes. A written informed con­
sent was obtained from every eligible subject.
Results
To complete the enrollment process for the study, a total of 
57 people were screened. Seven did not fulfill the inclusion 
criteria, and two declined to participate. A total of 48 were 
recruited and randomly assigned to the tai chi qigong (n=24) 
or control group (n=24). Two subjects in the control group 
did not complete the baseline assessment, and were therefore 
excluded from the analysis. The age of subjects ranged from 
66 to 103 years, with a mean of 77.3 years (standard devia­
tion [SD] =7.4). Of the 46, 35 (76%) were female, and 11 
(24%) male. The first and second follow-up assessments were 
completed by 41 and 35 subjects, respectively (Figure 1).
The baseline characteristics of the subjects in both groups 
are listed in Table 1. The groups were essentially comparable, 
and no statistically significant differences were observed. 
The average age of the tai chi qigong group was 75.4 years 
(SD =5.9), and of the control 79.4 years (SD =8.5).
The primary and secondary outcomes across the study 
time points (T0 or baseline, T1, and T2) of the two groups 
are given in Table 2. The GEE model was used to compare 
the differential changes from T0 of each of the outcomes 
at T1 and T2 (Table 3). The GEE analysis showed that the 
tai chi qigong group had more improvement at both T1 and

T2 with respect to T0 in all four social support outcomes. 
Statistically significant improvement was found on the De 
Jong Gieveld loneliness scale at T2 (B=−1.32, 95% con­
fidence interval [CI] −2.54 to −0.11, P=0.033; Cohen’s d 
effect size 0.60) (Figure 2), and in the total satisfaction score 
at T2 on the RSSQ (B=3.43, 95% CI 0.10–6.76, P=0.044; 
Cohen’s d effect size 0.76) (Figure 3). In the mental health 
inventory (MHI-18) outcomes, no significant improvement 
of the tai chi qigong group over the control group was noted, 
although there was more improvement in the total MHI-18 
score. Regarding self-esteem and health-related quality-of-
life outcomes, significant group-by-time interaction was only 
observed at T1 in the physical component score on SF-12 
(B=7.69, 95% CI 2.54–12.83, P=0.003; Cohen’s d effect 
size 0.87) (Figure 4).
The average attendance rate at the tai chi qigong classes 
was 71% (range 66%–100%). Reasons for absence included 
medical follow-ups, forgetfulness, or illness. Most of the tai 
chi qigong participants (83%) had managed to master the 
skills by the end of the program.
During the program evaluation, the participants said 
they had enjoyed the tai chi qigong classes, and 82% 
would continue the exercises. No injury or discomfort was 
reported from the tai chi qigong sessions. Nine people said 
their social network had broadened after joining the classes 
and that they had made more friends.

Chan et al
A total of eight health ambassadors (three male and five 
female) were recruited. Their age ranged from 65 to 81 years 
with an average of 73.5 years. Their feedback on participat­
ing in the study was very positive, and they had enjoyed 
practicing tai chi qigong with the hidden elderly. They said 
that the study was not only beneficial to the hidden elderly 
in other ways, but also enhanced their health through doing 
the exercises. They mentioned that the major barriers for the 
elderly in practicing tai chi qigong were their poor memory 
and muscle weakness, and suggested that daily practice could 
help to overcome such barriers.
Discussion
The hidden elderly form a group of older adults disengaged 
from the community and with a poor network of family or 
friends. The study implemented a tai chi qigong program 
using an elderly neighborhood volunteer approach that 
aimed to provide social contacts for the hidden elderly and 
motivate their participation. Results revealed positive effects 
in social support outcomes and in the physical health of the 
tai chi qigong group. The social support outcomes included 
a broadened social network, reduced feelings of loneliness, 
and increased satisfaction with perceived social support. 
The improvement in physical health also reflects what the 
literature identifies as the positive effects of tai chi qigong on 
loneliness and perceived social support from friends.13,38 No 
adverse effects were reported from the tai chi qigong classes 
indicating it was a safe form of exercise for the elderly.
During the first three months, participants in the two study 
groups did not show significant changes in the loneliness 
scale and satisfaction of social support. However, decreased 
feeling of loneliness and increased satisfaction in social 
support were noted in the tai chi qigong group at the sixth 
month’s follow-up assessment. This might be because the 
tai chi qigong participants continued their daily self-practice 
with peer volunteers in groups after the completion of tai 
chi qigong program, and they eventually became friends,

Tai chi qigong improves psychosocial health of hidden elderly
and thus, they felt less lonely and perceived supports from 
peer volunteers after six months. This result matched with a 
previous study which showed that time was needed build up 
rapport with friends.13 On the other hand, these three outcome 
variables in the control group showed reverse trends between 
the first and second three-month period. Indeed, these were 
results of a relatively small-scale study; a large-scale study 
would be needed to confirm their trends.
Age has been found to be negatively related to network 
size,3 but most public policies are concerned only with the 
physical issues of aging. However, social issues, such as iso­
lation, are important because they are linked to poor physical 
and mental health.39 The concept of social isolation refers to 
a lack of social integration.40 Both morbidity and mortality 
are higher among more socially isolated and lonelier older 
people.41 The consequences of such include poor health, 
depression, personal disorders, and suicide.42 Given the 
association between aging and loss of social contacts, these 
negative consequences make the prevention and treatment of 
social isolation an important priority in aging populations.43 
In the present pilot study, practicing tai chi qigong in a 
group provided social contacts for the hidden elderly, and 
its positive effects were reflected in the significantly reduced 
feelings of loneliness and increased satisfaction with social 
support the group showed. A well-received physical activity 
intervention of this kind also added physical health benefits 
to those of the social intervention.
Social integration is essential to successful aging.3 
Previous studies have indicated that older people find social 
connectedness and activity are strongly associated with 
overall health.44 Older people who maintain outgoing leisure 
behavior have higher rates of well-being, and remaining 
socially active is likely to alleviate loneliness.43 The tai chi 
qigong program in this study aimed specifically to increase 
social integration for older people and to facilitate their con­
nection with other people in the community, a strategy that 
can help to reduce the loss of physical and mental health 
associated with social isolation.42 This pilot study provided 
evidence that tai chi qigong was an effective intervention, 
offering social activity in a group format. Dickens et al 
also claimed that activities offered at the group level are 
more likely to be beneficial than one-to-one interventions.11 
Participatory interventions combining social activity and 
support are likely to be beneficial as well.11
When planning an intervention for hidden elderly, it was 
found that the major challenge was a lack of motivation to 
participate in the program. The literature suggests that social 
support for older adults, having active friends or being 
encouraged by at least one person, is the most influential 
stimulus to take part in activities.45 Stimulating participa­
tion in social activities may therefore be an effective tool to 
reduce social isolation and loneliness among older adults. 
Utilizing elderly neighborhood volunteers to mobilize hid­
den elderly people and strengthen their social networks was 
an effective solution. The health ambassadors appeared to 
have motivated the hidden elderly to participate in this study. 
The dropout rate was much lower in the tai chi qigong group 
than in the control (4.2% vs 18.2% at three months and 
16.7% vs 31.8% at six months), and this could have been 
due to the ambassadors, who were considered as facilitators 
in motivating the hidden elderly to take part in the program. 
According to Cheung and Ngan, the contribution of volunteer 
networking greatly helps the social integration of isolated 
and frail elderly, whose social networks are empowered in 
this way.46 The role of volunteers as a source of informal 
support is remarkable, and the assistance of well-trained 
elderly neighborhood volunteers is likely to have enhanced 
the motivation of hidden elderly people to participate in the 
present study.
Volunteering provides a socially rewarding 
and physically active environment that greatly benefits 
seniors.47 Most elderly people who volunteer invest more 
hours than younger people because they have more uncom­
mitted time,48 and their participation is a vehicle by which 
residents can increase individual and collective capacities 
as well as connections with their neighbourhood.49 This is 
an effective strategy that engages older adults in neighbor­
hood improvement, and volunteers provide immediacy and 
personal affirmation of informal social support. Volunteers 
of this kind are widely available and easily accessible in 
the community, having a strong psychological sense of 
neighborliness and commitment to their communities, 
and also expressing a high level of integration into the 
community.
In summary, social isolation is modifiable through social 
connections, which reduce loneliness. Innovative interven­
tions to deal with social isolation and loneliness should be 
conducted and evaluated because of the magnitude of the 
health risk among the hidden elderly.50 By understanding 
causal mechanisms, policymakers and researchers will 
be able to develop specific and appropriate strategies for 
such people.
Limitations
This pilot study has several limitations. First, the tai chi 
qigong program used neighborhood volunteer support, and

Chan et al
it is unclear whether the positive results were due to this 
support or to the tai chi qigong practice itself. Future studies 
may consider adding a tai chi qigong only group, without 
the volunteer support. Second, the recruitment process relied 
heavily on social workers to identify the hidden elderly, so 
only those recognized by the social workers were recruited. 
Selection bias can be reduced by recruiting hidden elderly 
openly from the community, with the support of neighbor­
hood volunteers and the community outreach team. Third, 
the small sample size in this pilot study may decrease 
its statistical power and reduce the chances of detecting 
true effects. Therefore, these findings must be interpreted 
with caution as they may not be generalizable to a larger 
population. Finally, all the outcome variables were obtained 
via questionnaires, which are subjective measures. Future 
studies may consider adding objective measures, such as 
social network size or physical fitness, to increase the variety 
of outcome measures.
Conclusion
With the life expectancy of older people rising, the aging 
population is an issue of some alarm, and has important impli­
cations for the provision of health services. Social isolation 
is the most typical situation of the hidden elderly, but when 
tai chi qigong exercises are performed in a group, the rein­
forcement that participation brings can have social benefits 
to counter isolation and create friendships. This pilot study 
confirms that tai chi qigong, with the help of elderly neighbor­
hood volunteers, can be a feasible social intervention for hid­
den elderly. Its potential benefits in improving such people’s 
social and psychological health suggest there is a need for a 
full-scale RCT to reveal the full empirical effects.
