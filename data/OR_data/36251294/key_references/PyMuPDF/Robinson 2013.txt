Objectives: To investigate the psychosocial effects of the companion robot, Paro, in a rest home/hospital
setting in comparison to a control group.
Design: Randomized controlled trial. Residents were randomized to the robot intervention group or
a control group that attended normal activities instead of Paro sessions. Sessions took place twice a week
for an hour over 12 weeks. Over the trial period, observations were conducted of residents’ social
behavior when interacting as a group with the robot. As a comparison, observations were also conducted
of all the residents during general activities when the resident dog was or was not present.
Setting: A residential care facility in Auckland, New Zealand.
Participants: Forty residents in hospital and rest home care.
Measurements: Residents completed a baseline measure assessing cognitive status, loneliness, depres-
sion, and quality of life. At follow-up, residents completed a questionnaire assessing loneliness,
depression, and quality of life. During observations, behavior was noted and collated for instances of
talking and stroking the dog/robot.
Results: In comparison with the control group, residents who interacted with the robot had signiﬁcant
decreases in loneliness over the period of the trial. Both the resident dog and the seal robot made an impact
on the social environment in comparison to when neither was present. Residents talked to and touched the
robot signiﬁcantly more than the resident dog. A greater number of residents were involved in discussion
about the robot in comparison with the resident dog and conversation about the robot occurred more.
Conclusion: Paro is a positive addition to this environment and has beneﬁts for older people in nursing
home care. Paro may be able to address some of the unmet needs of older people that a resident animal
may not, particularly relating to loneliness.

The growing aging population is a major concern for the future.1
An increasing number of older people will require formal long term
care as their health deteriorates and they cannot source as much
human care and support in the community.2,3 For an older person,
admission to an elder care facility is rarely easy and is not a highly
anticipated milestone in a person’s life.4 Moving to a nursing home is
often precipitated by the loss of a loved one, an inability to look after
oneself, declining health, and a lack of control over one’s life.5 These
factors, combined with the institutional environment of elder care
facilities, means that older people lose aspects of their lives that
constitute high life satisfaction.6 Older people in nursing homes often
report feelings of helplessness, boredom, and isolation,7 increasing
their risk of depression8e11 and loneliness,12,13 and in general they
report a lower quality of life than those residing in the community.14
Older people may experience problems in nursing homes upon
shifting, because residents may ﬁnd they have fewer of the social
connections that previously gave their life meaning. Even when older
people have become used to their new living environment, often the
feeling of loneliness and isolation does not abate over time as they
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to form new relationships with the people around
them.8 Research has found that there are negative effects on health
for older people after entering formal care. Some early studies have
reported that there is a high mortality rate among the aged due to
institutionalization,15 whereas other research has found that moving
frail elderly from one setting to another results in mental and physical
deterioration.16,17
Many nursing homes now incorporate animal visitations and
interactions into care models. Animals help fulﬁll criteria aimed at
promoting better quality of life by increasing social interactions,
decreasing
loneliness, countering
boredom,
and
helping foster

a sense of purpose. Furthermore, almost anyone can interact with an
animal regardless of physical and cognitive impairment, as any
person can communicate nonverbally with an animal by touching
and stroking.18 Over the past few decades, the health beneﬁts of both
pet ownership and animal activities in hospitals and elder care
settings have been widely reported in the literature.19 Research has
found that interactions with pets or animals have 3 effects: (1)
physiological effect (eg, improvement of vital signs), (2) psychological
effect (eg, relaxation, reduction of distress, and improvements in
mood and depression); and (3) social effect (eg, facilitate commu-
nication).20e22 Research has found that animals have many positive
beneﬁts for people, particularly older people, and in a nursing home
setting animals can be a social icebreaker, and can provide compan-
ionship, meaning and comfort to a person.23,24
Because animal therapy has been so successful with older people,
research has turned to creating companion robots that may offer the
same beneﬁts as live animals but require less care and are more
hygienic. Animals can cause problems in an elder care setting; they
may be a trip hazard, may scratch or bite, may introduce parasites
and infectious diseases to the environment, and require extra care
considerations on top of daily staff duties.25 A robot animal that does
not have to be fed, cleaned, or cared for and that cannot cause harm,
may be an adequate substitute for a live animal. Research with
companion robots in nursing homes has been conducted predomi-
nately with the companion robot AIBO (a metallic doglike robot) and
Paro (a white ﬂuffy seal robot). This work has found that these
companion robots can have a physiological effects by reducing stress
hormones26,27 and can improve brain functioning.28 Research has also
found that companion robots have a positive psychological effect and
can help forge social relationships.29 For example, in a 5-year longi-
tudinal study30 conducted in an elder care facility in Japan with 14
residents who suffered from mild to moderate dementia, Paro
improved mood and depression and decreased stress levels. The
nursing staff commented that Paro is a “necessity” for the facility, as
Paro made people laugh and more active. In a different study con-
ducted in Japan over 2 months31 in a care home with 12 residents,
Paro was given a home on a table in a public space for residents to
play with for the duration of the day and returned to the ofﬁce at
night. The results
showed that
Paro encouraged
residents to
communicate with each other and strengthened their social ties.
Overall, the current research suggests that companion robots have
positive social, psychological, and physical effects in elder care
settings.26 However, much of the research that has been conducted
does not have robust study designs, as control or comparison
conditions are not used and studies generally take place with small
sample sizes and over a short period of time.32,33 No previous work
has been published that has conducted a randomized controlled trial
speciﬁcally with Paro in a rest home setting, although some have
been conducted with AIBO.34 Most of the research is exploratory,
reﬂecting that this area is relatively new. Additionally, much of the
research with Paro has been done in Japan, with less research per-
formed in other cultures. Overall, more research is needed to see if
implementation of robotic therapy with Paro has beneﬁts over a long
period of time in different settings and with different cultures. The
aim of this research was to address some of the shortcomings of the
previous research with Paro by using a randomized controlled trial,
and in a Western country. This study aimed to explore how the
psychosocial effects of Paro could be compared with a control group.
This research also evaluated the impact Paro had on the social envi-
ronment by observing how residents interacted with the robot and
with each other when the robot was present in comparison to when
the resident dog was present. Although research with the companion
robot AIBO has looked at the difference between interactions with
a robotic dog and a live dog in children,35,36 and one study has looked
at the effect of a live dog or AIBO on loneliness,34 the effects of Paro
have not been compared with a live animal.
Methods
Setting
The study was conducted at the Selwyn Heights retirement home,
in Hillsborough, Auckland, New Zealand, in the hospital and rest
home areas, which provide 24-hour support 7 days a week. In both
areas there are a wide range of activities for residents to enjoy,
organized by the same activities coordinator. Additionally, the activ-
ities coordinator brings her Jack Russell terrier to work each day and
the dog is free to visit residents in the hospital and often goes over to
the rest home. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of
Auckland

and
written
informed consent obtained for all participants. In cases where
participants were unable to provide informed consent, enduring
power of attorney (EPOA) representatives were contacted asking
permission for the resident to participate in the study and written
informed consent was obtained.
Participants
Participants were 40 residents (13 men, age range 55e100 years).
Twenty residents were randomly assigned to the control group (rest
home 11, hospital 9) and 20 were assigned to the Paro group (rest
home 7, hospital 13) using a random list generator. Nineteen partic-
ipants (48%) scored 6 or lower on the Abbreviated Mental Test, which
is suggestive of cognitive impairment. There were no signiﬁcant
differences between the intervention and control groups in cognitive
impairment.
Procedure
Residents in both groups completed baseline measures assessing
loneliness, depression, and quality of life. Loneliness was assessed
using the UCLA Loneliness scale (Version 3)37 that has been used in
previous research to assess loneliness in older people before and after
interacting with AIBO.34 Depression was measured using the Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS).38 This is a short questionnaire composed of
15 yes or no questions pertaining to depressive symptoms experi-
enced over the past week. This questionnaire has been used exten-
sively in older populations and is highly validated.39 Quality of life
was measured using the Quality of Life for Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-
AD).40 This questionnaire has 13 questions that asked participants to
rate various aspects of their lives on 4-point scale. Staff also
completed proxy ratings of residents. Again, this measure is highly
validated in older populations.41
Paro sessions were scheduled to take place on 2 weekday after-
noons for 12 weeks, which was incorporated into the activities
schedule. Residents in the control group went on bus trips around the
city during this time or an alternative activity, such as crafts, movies,
or bingo, was organized. During sessions with the robot, discussion
groups were held and all residents had a chance to interact with the
robot. If the resident was unable to attend the session because of ill
health, the resident had the opportunity to interact with the robot
after the session individually. Observations were conducted over the
course of the trial to assess residents’ social behaviors when the robot
was present, compared with when the resident dog was present or
when neither were present. After the 12-week trial, follow-up
measures were administered to participants. Figure 1 summarizes
the design of the study and number of participants. Analyses of
covariance (ANCOVAs) were performed to compare changes between

baseline and follow-up measures of each of the primary outcome
measures (quality-of-life ratings, depression and loneliness scores)
with corresponding baseline scores entered as covariates. This method
was chosen because it takes into account each individual’s baseline
score and helps to control for any differences between groups at
baseline and regression to the mean.42 To assess how much residents
interacted with the robot and the resident dog, t-tests or nonpara-
metric equivalents were used. When social interactions with the dog
and the seal robot were compared with normal activities Kruskal-
Wallis tests and 1-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conduct-
ed. For all analyses, a 2-tailed alpha level of less than 0.05 was used.
Paro
Paro is an advanced interactive robot developed by the Intelligent
Systems Research Institute (ISRI),43 a leading Japanese industrial
automation pioneer (Figure 2). Paro is modeled after a baby Canadian
harp seal and is covered in white artiﬁcial fur. It weighs approxi-
mately 2.7 kg. Paro has 4 senses: sight, sound, balance, and touch,
meaning that Paro responds to contact, as well as to other stimuli in
its environment by moving or imitating the noises of a baby harp seal.
Paro operates by using the 3 elements: its internal states, sensory
information from its sensors, and its own diurnal rhythm to carry out
various activities during its interaction with people.
Results
Table 1 shows the main results of this study. After adjusting for
baseline self-rated quality of life scores and staff-rated quality-of-life
scores, respectively, ANCOVAs found there were no main effects of
group on changes in self-rated quality of life or staff-rated quality of
life between baseline and follow-up. Depressive scores slightly
decreased in the Paro group from baseline to follow-up, but increased
in the control group; however, after adjusting for baseline depression
scores, there were no main effects of group on changes in depression
between baseline and follow-up. The results show that loneliness
decreased in the Paro group but increased in the control group. After
adjusting for baseline loneliness scores, there was a signiﬁcant
difference between groups in loneliness change over time (P ¼ .033).

Those in the intervention group decreased in loneliness over time,
whereas those in the control group increased in loneliness from
baseline to follow-up.
Figure 3 shows residents interacting with the robot in one of the
Paro sessions. Table 2 reports how residents interacted with the
resident dog in comparison with the seal robot. This shows that
residents touched and talked to the robot signiﬁcantly more than
they touched the resident dog, and the number of residents who
stroked the seal was higher when taking into account the number of
people present. Residents also talked to each other signiﬁcantly
more about the robot compared with the dog. Finally, staff did start
conversation signiﬁcantly more about the robot than the resident
dog, but they did not talk to the robot signiﬁcantly more than they
talked to the dog. During normal activities, it was noted how often
residents talked to each other and how the presence of the seal
robot or the resident dog altered the social atmosphere. Table 3
reports these results.
Overall, there was a signiﬁcant difference in the number of times
residents talked to each other. Mann-Whitney U tests found that
residents talked more to each other overall in Paro sessions in
comparison with normal activities, U ¼ 21.00, z ¼ 2.35, P ¼ .02,
r ¼ 0.51. Residents talked more to each other when the dog was
present compared with normal activities, but this was not signiﬁcant,
U ¼ 43.50, z ¼ 1.78, P ¼ .08, r ¼ 0.35. Mann-Whitney U tests found
that a higher percentage of residents talked to each other in the Paro
group than in normal activities, U ¼ 3.00, z ¼ 3.67, P < .001, r ¼ 0.80,
and also compared with activities when the resident dog was present,
U ¼ 5.50, z ¼ 4.29, P < .001, r ¼ 0.80. When looking at the number of
times staff made conversation with residents, it was found that there
were no overall differences between conditions. Similarly, there were
no differences in the number of times residents talked to staff.
Discussion
This study investigated the effects of an intervention program
incorporating the use of a seal robot primarily as a way to improve
quality of life, mood, and loneliness for older residents in a nursing
home facility. This research found that after a 12-week intervention,
in which residents interacted with a seal robot twice a week, resi-
dents had decreases in loneliness scores from baseline to follow-up,
in comparison with a control group. This is an important ﬁnding, as
although other research with Paro has documented the positive
effects the robot has on mood and the effect the robot has on the
social atmosphere, loneliness has not been measured with this robot.
With the robot dog, AIBO, research in the United States has found that
loneliness decreased in older people who received 30-minute weekly
visits from a living dog or from AIBO over 8 weeks in comparison with
a control group.34 Similarly, another study conducted in Japan44
found that after 20 activity sessions with AIBO older people in
a nursing home had improved loneliness scores compared with
baseline scores. Improvements in loneliness may mean improve-
ments in other areas of life, as a person feels less socially isolated in
his or her current living situation. This ﬁnding further supports
ﬁndings that animals do help to reduce loneliness and indicates that
a companion robot is an adequate substitute for live animals in
nursing home facilities. For example, it has been reported that resi-
dents in a nursing home who had greater levels of interaction with
a pet experienced less loneliness than those who had lower levels of
interaction.45,46 Overall, loneliness in rest home settings has been
related to a number of other issues, including depression and
mortality.47,48 If the presence of a companion robot can help decrease
loneliness, keep older people company, and comfort people when
they feel ill or unhappy, then the robot would be useful in elderly care
to help older people adapt to their environment and age successfully.
Some older people in this study commented that the robot made
them feel better when they were sick, feeling down, or feeling lonely
and care staff also noted the effect the robot had on residents.
Interestingly, there is a great deal of research looking at how
companion robots and animals impact the social environment. From
the research conducted with Paro previously, it has been found that
Paro is capable of stimulating conversation between residents,49,50
strengthening social ties between residents,31 and providing an
“icebreaker” topic for staff and visitors to use when talking to older
people.51 In this research, it was found that in comparison with the
resident dog, residents touched and talked to the robot, and talked to
each other more about the robot, showing how the robot is just as
easy to interact with as a live animal and in some instances had an

advantage over the dog. Often residents were unable to talk to or
touch the dog because the dog could choose who it interacted with,
whereas the robot could be put on the lap of all residents and would
respond to them. This research also found that Paro was able to
impact the social environment. Furthermore, no research to date has
compared how older people socialize in the presence Paro or a live
animal, although observations have been conducted of children with
AIBO35 and one study has looked at how AIBO and a live dog affect
loneliness in older people in a rest home.34 Analyses found that
a higher percentage of residents talked to each other speciﬁcally
about the robot compared with instances when the dog was present
and residents talked to each other speciﬁcally about the dog. Overall
this shows that the robot has beneﬁts over and above a live dog and
by impacting the social environment and providing a conversation
topic for residents and staff. This research found that residents
socialized just as much when the resident dog was present as during
activity sessions with the robot when general conversation was taken
into account. Furthermore, when the dog and the robot were not
present, the residents were less social, as indicated by the amount
they talked to each other. The results of this study also show that staff
make more conversation with residents during normal activities than
Paro activities. Although this was not signiﬁcant, a reason for these
results could be that staff ﬁnd it difﬁcult to keep residents engaged in
conversation and activities and have to make more conversation with
residents to keep them entertained. In the Paro condition and when
the dog was present during activities, conversation was easier for
staff. Of note, the dog was not always in the room for the whole
duration of activities. Although previous research has not looked at
how much a robot affects socialization in comparison with other
activities, research has found that the presence of animals did affect
the amount residents socialized in comparison with activities, such as
bingo and crafts.52 Although that study did not use a control group,
their ﬁndings are similar to the current research, which compared
social behaviors when the robot and dog were present with activities,
including bingo, discussions, and crafts.
This study has a number of strengths in comparison with previous
research with Paro and other companion robots. This is the ﬁrst
published randomized controlled trial conducted with Paro. Although
other research has been conducted in Japan with Paro in quasi-
experimental settings, no published studies have compared the
robot activities with a control group. This research is important
because it means the efﬁcacy of the intervention can be assessed,
particularly in terms of loneliness, which has not been assessed with
Paro. This research also aimed to conduct a study with a greater
number of participants than previous research over a longer period of
time. Other research has used Paro in short-term studies ranging
from 4 to 8 weeks, with the exception of one ongoing study that has
been conducted for 5 years in Japan. These studies have used only
small sample sizes, ranging from 5 to 26 participants.32
Like other studies conducted with companion robots and animals,
this research has a number of limitations. Because of the population
chosen and the environment, obtaining a large sample is difﬁcult, as
health problems limit the ability for older people to complete a study
of this nature and assess the primary outcomes. In this research,

a number of residents were not identiﬁed as being appropriate for
this study because of physical and or mental disabilities. Of those who
did participate, sickness and disabilities greatly limited participants in
their attendance of sessions and ability to interact with the robot.
Some of the residents identiﬁed were not able to complete the entire
baseline
questionnaire
because
of
communication
difﬁculties.
Although the research calls for larger sample sizes, realistically large
samples are difﬁcult to attain because of attrition and declining
health. To ﬁnd the robot had a positive effect on loneliness in this
small sample is very encouraging. Future research should strive to
recruit a greater number of participants to attain greater power.
Another limitation of this research was the lack of comparison
groups to control for extraneous variables. For example, research has
compared Paro in the “on” setting or the “off” setting to when the
researcher only was present.50 The researchers found that there was
just as much social activity when the observer was present alone to
when the robot was on. They concluded that learning about the
observer was just as interesting as learning about Paro. Although in
the current trial the robot was left with the activities staff to do what
they wished in sessions, for the trial to run smoothly, the researcher
was present to help get residents to the sessions and run the sessions
when a staff member was sick or unavailable. Hence, the presence of
the researcher as a visitor may have had an effect on the social
setting. However, the researcher was also present to conduct obser-
vations in the control group activity sessions. Another limitation to
this research is that the robot and the resident dog were not intro-
duced at the same time. The resident dog had been at the facility
approximately 3 months before this trial began and residents may
have been more familiar with the dog, affecting how they interacted
and discussed it. In this study, it should be noted that activities did
not center around the dog in a structured manner, like the Paro
sessions. This structuring may be a critical component to the seal’s
therapeutic effect.
Conclusion
Overall, future work needs to address the identiﬁed problems in
the current research with companion robots. Randomized controlled
studies with larger sample sizes, with different populations in
different living situations, and with different cognitive capabilities
should be conducted to further determine for whom the robot is best
suited. Overall, this research found that loneliness can be improved
using companion robots and the robot has an affect comparable to
a live animal on the social environment. Paro is capable of improving
loneliness in older people in elder care facilities and should be
considered in future care plans.
