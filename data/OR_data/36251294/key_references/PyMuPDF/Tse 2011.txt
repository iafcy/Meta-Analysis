1. Introduction
The increase in the aging population is accompanied by greater
demand for long-term healthcare services. It is estimated that
more than 40% of older adults aged 65 or above will spend time in a
nursing home (Sandberg et al., 2001). Pain is commonly found
among older persons, particularly those living in nursing homes
(Ferrell et al., 1990; Hollenack and Zarowitz, 2006). Most aged-
related diseases, such as arthritis, rheumatism and neuropathy,
cause chronic pain and functional disability (Ferrell et al., 1990;
Hurley et al., 2003; Chung and Wong, 2007). Without proper pain
management, nursing home residents will suffer from many
aspects of disabilities, resulting in deterioration in their health
condition and quality of life.
Pain is a multidimensional phenomenon with biological,
psychological, social and spiritual issues needing to be considered
(Clark, 1999). Besides the pain itself, older persons suffer from
functional disability. Consequently, they may become more
dependent and inactive. With a lack of understanding of their
pain, they become anxious, depressed and hopeless, which further
compromises their quality of life. A common concept among older
persons is that oral analgesics are harmful, even though they are
prescribed by physicians. They refuse to take drugs, or take them
only once they cannot tolerate the pain any longer. However, oral
analgesics usually need time to be effective in the body; older
persons thus have to suffer pain for several hours. On the social
aspect, older persons living in nursing homes may not see their
family and friends frequently. As a result, they feel lonely and
unhappy, which probably makes them dwell more on their pain
and health problems (Weiner et al., 1999). In general, life in a
nursing home is relatively boring compared with that in the
community. Even though a variety of activities are organized by
the staff in nursing homes, it seems that only the more active and
physically independent residents like to participate.
In order to break down the negative consequences of pain and
environmental insufﬁciency in the nursing home, an effective,
feasible and multidimensional pain management program should
be promoted. The multidisciplinary approach to pain management
has been highly recommended in recent decades (Lorig et al., 1999;
Becker et al., 2000; Corran et al., 2001; Dysvik et al., 2004;
Gallagher, 2005). It consists of an approach to address different
aspects of pain and works as an integrated model aiming to
encourage active participation and enhance self-coping capacity
for controlling pain.

This study examined the effects of an 8-week integrated pain management program (IPMP) on
enhancing the knowledge and attitude toward pain management among staff; and improving the pain,
quality of life, physical and psychosocial functions, and use of non-drug therapies for the elderly in
nursing homes. Nursing home staff (N = 147) and residents (N = 535) were recruited from ten nursing
homes. Nursing homes were randomly assigned into an experimental group (N = 296) with IPMP or
control group (N = 239) without IPMP. The IPMP consisted of pain education for staff and physical
exercise and multisensory stimulation art and craft therapy for residents. Data were collected before and
after the IPMP. The staff demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in knowledge and attitude to pain
management, with the survey score increasing from 8.46  3.74 to 19.43  4.07 (p < 0.001). Among the
residents, 74% had experienced pain within the previous 6 months, with pain intensity of 4.10  2.20. Those
in the experimental group showed a signiﬁcantly better reduction in pain scores than the control group, from
4.19  2.25 to 2.67  2.08 (p < 0.001). Group differences were also found in psychological well-being,
including happiness, loneliness, life satisfaction and depression (p < 0.05), and the use of non-drug methods
(p < 0.05). These results suggested that IPMP is beneﬁcial for staff, and is effective in reducing geriatric pain
and negative impacts. Management support and staff involvement in the program are important for its long-
term continuation.

Physical exercise is an effective pain management approach in
reducing pain, increasing physical mobility or preventing physical
decline, and improving psychosocial well-being and quality of life
(Blackham et al., 2008; Callahan, 2009; Yumin et al., 2010; Kim
et al., 2011; Tse et al., 2011). Physical exercise can be regarded as a
self-management skill that people can perform in their own time
without using healthcare resources in the longer run. For some
elderly people, their condition is too difﬁcult to perform general
exercises, thus easy and tailor-made exercises are needed (Hurley
et al., 2003; Neame and Doherty, 2005).
The use of multisensory elements for the management of
dementia and chronic pain is called ‘Snoezelen’, a term combining
two Dutch words meaning ‘to sniff’ and ‘to doze’ (Schoﬁeld, 1996).
The concept of Snoezelen was to stimulate all of the primary
senses: vision, hearing, touching, taste, and smell simultaneously.
It aimed at facilitating rest and helping to overcome fatigue. It
creates a peaceful environment and sense of safety for the elderly
(Kewin, 1991). Multisensory therapy has been used in relaxation,
pain reduction, and improving quality of life (Schoﬁeld and
Hutchinson, 2002), and it is inexpensive (Keefe et al., 1992).
Likewise, the use of art and craft therapy taps into the creative
process, which allows individuals to express their deepest
emotions (Malchiodi, 1999; Johnson and Sullivan-Marx, 2006)
and improves psychological well-being, quality of life and physical
symptoms including pain (Favara-Scacco et al., 2001; Nainis et al.,
2006; McCaffrey, 2007). Tse and Ho (2010) showed that a
multisensory stimulation art and craft program were effective in
reducing pain, enhancing psychological well-being, and increasing
the use of non-drug therapies for the elderly.
Although pain is common among nursing home residents, they
are at risk of not having appropriate assessment and treatment
(Achterberg et al., 2010). The professional staff such as nurses and
social workers may have learnt pain management, yet, their heavy
workloads easily make them underestimate the number and
severity of geriatric pain problems. Western and local nurses are
found to have inadequate knowledge and negative attitudes
toward pain management (Brown et al., 1999; Tse and Chan, 2004;
Carr, 2007). Also, front-line healthcare professionals, including
health workers and personal care workers, provide direct care to
nursing home residents and spend more time with them. However,
they may only receive basic education and not have adequate
knowledge and training on pain management (Allcock et al., 2002;
Jones et al., 2004). In addition, the majority of older persons prefer
not to use oral drugs for pain relief (Tse et al., 2010), thus the use of
both drug and non-drug strategies is promoted among staff and
residents. The nursing home staff plays an important role in pain
management care. It is important for them to understand pain and
how to manage it.
Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to provide
an integrated pain management program (IPMP) to nursing home
staff and residents, consisting of pain education training for staff
and a physical exercise program and multisensory stimulation art
and craft therapy for elderly residents. We investigated the effect
of the IPMP on increasing the knowledge and attitude to pain
management among staff, and examined it effects on reducing
pain, improving physical and psychological functions, enhancing
quality of life and the use of non-pharmacological methods among
nursing home residents.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
Staff and older persons from 10 local nursing homes were
recruited. The staff included healthcare professionals of various
ranks, including registered nurses, enrolled nurses and healthcare
assistants. Older persons that ﬁt the inclusion criteria of being aged
60 or above, having experienced pain in the previous 6 months,
being able to communicate in Chinese, and being oriented to time
and place were invited to join the study. Those with cognitive
impairment, a history of mental disorders, physically too weak to
perform exercise, and bed-bound were excluded. Fig. 1 shows the
CONSORT ﬂow diagram of the study. Written informed consent
was given to each staff member and older person before the study
commenced. The study was approved by the ethics committee of
the local university.
2.2. Randomization
The nursing homes were randomly allocated to the experimen-
tal group or the control group by a computerized randomization
table. Staff and residents in the experimental group received the
IPMP, while those in control group received regular care without
IPMP.
2.3. The IPMP
The IPMP consisted of an 8-week program conducted with two
target groups, staff and residents. Details of the IPMP are shown in
Table 1. For the staff training, the research team (including
registered nurses and physiotherapists) conducted a one-hour
session of pain education each week for 8 weeks. Two identical
sessions were conducted within the same week to attract and cater
for the maximum attendance of staff on shift duty. Attendance was
recorded in each session, and make-up classes were provided for
staff who could not attend the pain education program due to
vacation leave. The pain education program included mechanisms
of pain and its impacts on the staff and the elderly in the home.
There were also demonstrations of various pain assessment
strategies and the use of oral analgesics, including their effects
and side-effects, as well as the use of various non-drug strategies in
pain management, including deep breathing and relaxation
techniques. In order to prevent injury in patient care and patient

transfers, as well as strengthening the physical function of the staff,
our physiotherapist shared and practiced muscle strengthening
and stretching techniques for staff during the pain education
program.
For residents, the IPMP included a one-hour physical training
session (PEP) and one hour of either multisensory stimulation
therapy or art and craft activity per week. The PEP included muscle
strengthening, stretching and balance, and was conducted in small
groups of 10–15 elderly residents. Speciﬁc exercises were taught
by the physiotherapist according to the functional level and
abilities of these residents. Exercise pamphlets were given after
each lesson so as to encourage the older people to practice in their
own time. They were also taught to use non-drug methods such as
heat, cold, deep breathing, relaxation and acupressure therapy to
relieve pain. The staff was encouraged to attend. Regarding the
multisensory stimulation art and craft therapy approach (MSSAC),
the research team conducted an alternative of 1-h multisensory
therapy or art and craft therapy once a week. In the multisensory
session, the elderly participants were instructed to control pain
through relaxation techniques and use of the 5 primary senses:
touch, smell, taste, hearing and vision. Fragrant essential lotion
was given to them to apply on their neck and hands. They were also
instructed to close their eyes and take deep breaths while listening
to the relaxing music, look at attractive pictures and imagine the
environments, and smell the essential oil that was distributed by a
diffuser. Hot herbal tea was provided to stimulate the taste buds. In
the art and craft session, older persons made artwork such as photo
albums, paper ﬂowers, and paper fans using scissors, glue, origami
paper and colorful art materials to facilitate ﬁne motor activities
and
multisensory
stimulation.
They
designed
the
artworks
themselves in a creative manner, and discuss the process of the
art and craft session with each other to enhance the social
connection. Upon completion of the art and craft sessions, they
could bring their ﬁnished products back and show them to their
family members and friends during their visits.
2.4. Outcome measures
2.4.1. Demographic data
The demographic data of the staff were collected, including age,
gender, position, education level, experience since training,
experience of working in nursing homes, whether attending a
pain course or not, the frequency with which they met elderly
persons with pain during their daily care, and nursing specialty (for
nurses). They then completed a survey about their knowledge and
attitude to pain management (see Section 2.4.2). Older persons
were invited to attend an interview before the study to share their
demographic characteristics, including age, gender, marital status,
education level, previous occupation, personal health condition,
and pain in the previous 6 months. The use of oral analgesic drug
and non-drug methods for pain control was also recorded.
Afterwards, they were asked to complete several questionnaires
as below (see Sections 2.4.3–2.4.6). All data were collected by the
blinded research assistant.
2.4.2. Staff knowledge and attitude survey regarding pain
Before and after the IPMP education sessions, each member of
staff was asked to ﬁnish the Nurses’ Knowledge and Attitude
Survey Regarding Pain (NKASRP), which was originally developed
by Ferrell and McCaffery (1987) and then translated in Chinese
(NKASPR-C) by Tse and Chan (2004). The NKASPR-C consists of 25
items about pain assessment, the use of analgesics and general
pain management. Items 1–16 are ‘‘true or false’’ questions
assessing the general knowledge, symptoms and treatment of pain.
Items 17–25 are multiple-choice questions that deal primarily
with pharmacotherapeutics. One mark is given for each correct
answer, thus the maximum total score of the NKASPR-C is 25.
Higher marks indicate better knowledge and attitude to pain
management. The test–retest reliability was 0.81, and the content
validity was 0.87.
2.4.3. Pain intensity
The
self-reported
pain
intensity
was
measured
by
the
Cantonese Verbal Rating Scales (VRS) and marked on a body
chart (Fig. 2). The VRS consists of a series of words commonly used
to describe pain: 0 = no pain, 1 = very mild pain, 2 = uncomfort-
ably painful, 3 = tolerable pain, 4 = distressingly painful, 5 = very
distressingly painful, 6 = intense pain, 7 = very intense pain,
8 = utterly horrible pain, 9 = excruciatingly unbearable pain,
and 10 = unimaginably unspeakable pain (Chung et al., 1999).
The older persons read the options and chose the one that best
described
their
pain.
The
reliability
and
validity
of
the
Cantonese VRS has been established previously (Chung et al.,
2002; Liu et al., 2003).

2.4.4. Physical functions
Barthel Index was used to evaluate the self-care functional
ability for the activities of daily living among the older persons. It
consists of 10 items including presence or absence of fecal and
urinary incontinence, and independence in grooming, toileting,
feeding, personal hygiene, transfers, walking, dressing, climbing
stairs and bathing (Mahoney and Barthel, 1965). The score varies
from item to item and the maximum total score is 20, indicating
total independence (Shyu et al., 2008). The Elderly Mobility Scale
(EMS) assessed the older persons’ mobility, and consists of 7
questions focusing on mobility independence in position changes
and in walking mobility (Smith, 1994). The score varies from item
to item and the maximum total score is 20, indicating total
independence (Proser, 1997; Ng et al., 2008). The joint ranges of
motion (ROM) were obtained in the older persons in the
experimental group. This focused on the degree of movement of
neck rotation, shoulder ﬂexion and abduction, hip ﬂexion, knee
ﬂexion, and lumbar rotation measured by a goniometer. The
physiotherapist taught the research assistant how to measure the
range of motion for each target joint, and required them to practice
before the study to minimize the measurement error.
2.4.5. Quality of life
Health Survey Short Form questionnaire (SF-12), which consists
of 12 questions to generate physical and mental component
subscale scores (Ware et al., 1996), measured the quality of life of
the older persons. Each score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher
scores indicating better health status. A Chinese version of the SF-
12 was used, which has been found to be valid and equivalent for
the Hong Kong Chinese population (Lam et al., 2005).
2.4.6. Psychosocial well-being
The Chinese version of the subjective happiness scale (Lyubo-
mirsky and Lepper, 1999) was used to assess the older persons’
happiness level. It consists of 4 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale.
The total scores range from 4 to 28, with higher scores signifying
higher subjective happiness. The Cronbach’s alpha is 0.79–0.94. The
test–retest reliability ranges from 0.55 to 0.90. The revised UCLA
Loneliness Scale was used to measure people’s loneliness (Russell,
1996). The scale consists of 20 items to measure participants’
feelings of loneliness and social isolation using a 4-point Likert scale
with a rating 1 = never, 2 = seldom, 3 = sometimes, 4 = always. The
total range of possible scores is 20–80, with higher scores indicating
greater loneliness. The Chinese version was used, with a Cronbach’s
alpha of 0.90 (Chou et al., 2005). The Chinese version of the Life
Satisfaction Index-A (Chi and Boey, 1992) form scale consists of 18
questions related to ﬁve different components: zest, resolution and
fortitude, congruence between desired and achieved goals, positive
self-concept, and mood tone. Items score 1 = agree and 0 = disagree.
Higher scores indicate greater life satisfaction. The Cronbach’s alpha
is 0.7 and internal consistency is 0.62. The Chinese version of the
Geriatric Depression Scale was used to measure depression
(Yesavage et al., 1983; Mui, 1996). The scale consists of 15 questions
with a rating 1 = yes, 0 = no, with higher scores indicating more
depression. Cronbach’s alpha of internal consistency is 0.89, and the
test–retest reliability is 0.85.
2.5. Data analyses
Demographic data was collected before the study. Scores of
NKASPR-C, pain intensity, physical functions, psychosocial well-
being, quality of life, and the use of drug and non-drug therapies
were collected before and after the 8-week IPMP program. The
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (PASW, version 17) for
Windows was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics
calculated the means and standard deviations. The Chi-square test
analyzed the difference in the demographic data between the
experimental and control groups. The pair-test and independent t-
test analyzed the within- and between-group differences of the
outcome variables, respectively.
3. Results
A total of 147 staff and 535 older persons participated in the
study. The demographic data are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The
participating staff included nurses and workers, most of whom
were middle-aged. Surprisingly, 75% of them had not attended a
pain course before but were frequently encountering elderly in
[()TD$FIG]

pain in their duties. Most of the older persons were widowed and
had not received formal education. Around 40% of them had been
living in nursing homes for 1–3 years, while another 28% of them
had been living in homes for 10 years or more. There were 396
older persons (74%) who had suffered from pain in the previous 6
months. Among them, 46.5% had used oral analgesic drugs and
57.6% had used non-drug methods.
No signiﬁcant differences were found in the use of drug and
non-drug therapy, pain intensity, quality of life, psychological
wellbeing and pain belief between the experimental and control
groups at the baseline (Tables 4–6). The physical functions
measured by EMS and the Barthel ADL index were signiﬁcantly
higher in the experimental group, therefore the baseline measures
were treated as covariates when calculating the post-treatment
effect for these two variables.
The staff demonstrated signiﬁcantly better knowledge and
attitudes toward the pain management after the pain education
training, with the NKASRP-C score increasing from 8.46  3.74 at
the baseline to 19.43  4.07 after the 8-week training (p < 0.001).
The baseline pain intensity among the older persons with pain
was 4.10  2.20. After completing the program, the pain intensity in
both groups decreased signiﬁcantly (both p < 0.05); the VRS score in
the experimental group was signiﬁcantly lower than in the control
group (experimental group 2.67  2.08 vs control group 3.29  2.24,
p = 0.008) and the change of VRS score was also different between the
two groups (experimental group 1.70  2.53 vs control group
0.69  2.45, p < 0.001) (Table 4). The VRS scores for each painful site
are shown in Fig. 2.
After justifying the baseline measures of the Barthel index and
EMS by entering them as covariates in the analyses, the post-
treatment Barthel index and EMS showed no signiﬁcant within- or
between-group differences (all p > 0.05). For the ROMs measured
in the experimental group, all ROMs of the neck, shoulders, back,
hips and knee joints had increased signiﬁcantly by the end of the
program (all p < 0.001) (Table 5).
The SF-12 showed that the quality of life in both physical and
mental scores in the experimental group was not signiﬁcantly
improved.
However,
the
scores
in
the
control
group
had
signiﬁcantly worsened after the program (p < 0.05). No be-
tween-group difference was found (Table 5).
The experimental group showed signiﬁcantly higher self-
perception in happiness and life satisfaction, and lower perception
in
loneliness
and
depression
after
the
IPMP
program
(all
p  0.001). The control group did not reveal any signiﬁcant
difference
(Table
5).
There
were
signiﬁcant
between-group
differences in the changes in these variable scores (all p < 0.05).
Table 6 showed the number of subjects using the non-drug
therapies before and after the program among the older persons
with pain. The experimental group had a signiﬁcant increase in the
number of subjects using massage, resting, hot pad, cold pad,
listening to music and deep breathing methods (all p < 0.05). By
contrast, the control group experienced no signiﬁcant increase or
even a decrease in the number of subjects using those methods. As
a result, signiﬁcant group differences were demonstrated in the
use of massage, resting, watching TV, listening to music and deep
breathing.
4. Discussion
The present study recruited 535 older persons and 147 staff in
local nursing homes to provide an IPMP. The IPMP skills taught,
including physical exercise training, multisensory stimulation and
art and crafts therapy, were largely inexpensive and would be easy
to implement in nursing home settings for older persons. They can
also be regarded as self-treatment skills on relieving pain and
improving the negative impacts of pain.
The staff receiving pain management training signiﬁcantly
improved their knowledge and attitude toward pain management.
The IPMP program aimed at providing knowledge of pain and its
management methods such as analgesic drugs and their effects,
and exercises for particular pain. The staff can apply the knowledge
to avoid work injuries, and strengthen and relax themselves to
reduce their pain and disabilities. Their active participation and
positive experience of the program also enabled them to manage
pain problems in older persons during their work duties. Strong
participation and management support are critical components for
conducting a successful program. The continued implementation
of the pain management program in nursing homes is suggested.
After obtaining the appropriate training, the staff are able to share
their knowledge with their colleagues and teach the older persons.
They can help with the long-term carrying out of pain management
in the nursing home as a daily routine, which is beneﬁcial for both
the elderly and the staff.
In this study, more than 70% of older persons had experienced
pain in the previous 6 months, with a moderate level of pain, i.e.

4.10  2.20, which conﬁrms the high prevalence of pain in older
persons living in nursing homes (Ferrell, 1991; Chung and Wong,
2007). The demographic data show that 25% of the elderly
participants were aged between 60 and 80, which was below the
mean age of the study. The pain prevalence among this group is also
high, i.e. 20.5%. They have probably spent more than 10 years in
nursing homes during the last period of their lives. The multidisci-
plinary pain management program and self-management techniques
are therefore very important to them in reducing pain and its related
problems.
By participating in the IPMP, the residents experienced
signiﬁcant reduction in their pain intensity, with scores reduced
from 4.19  2.25 to 2.67  2.08 (p < 0.001). The change in the pain
score in the experimental group was also signiﬁcantly larger than that
in the control group, which did not receive the IPMP. Besides pain
reduction, there were also positive results in psychological well-
being. Exercises strengthen the muscle weakness and stretch the
tightened soft tissues, and are thus effective in improving pain
symptoms and psychosocial functions (Ettinger and Afable, 1994;
Hurley et al., 2003; Liddle et al., 2004; Long et al., 2004; Roddy et al.,
2005); acupressure and non-drug pain relief methods such as
relaxation, deep breathing, and hot and cold introduced in the
exercise program may also have contributed to the pain reduction
(Hsieh et al., 2004, 2006; NIH Technology Assessment Conference
Statement, 1995). The multisensory stimulation art and craft therapy
enabled the elderly to relax and be distracted from their pain. Their
ability to perform exercise and use multisensory art and craft
treatment can motivate them to control or manage pain when it
occurs, which may reduce their perceived pain intensity, improve
their psychological status, and increase their conﬁdence in exercising
by themselves (Bandura, 1977; Hurley et al., 2003; Vong et al., 2011).
In addition, we conducted IPMP as a group therapy, so that they could
discuss the program with their fellow residents, share with friends
and enhance the social relationship and cognitive function, reducing
the sense of boredom and loneliness in the nursing home.
The ﬁndings showed that 47% of older persons used oral
analgesics and 58% used non-drug methods to control pain. These
results were comparable to those of a previous study (Tse et al.,
2010). Furthermore, that study surprisingly found that 14.5% of
elderly in pain had not received any form of pain control. This
suggests that older persons in the Chinese population prefer not to
take analgesics unless they cannot tolerate their pain. Therefore,
non-pharmacological methods should be the mainstay of pain
management for them. The present study showed that after
receiving IPMP, a signiﬁcantly greater number of older persons
used non-drug therapy methods, especially massage, listening to
music and deep breathing, which were the IPMP components we
had taught in the sessions. The elderly were encouraged to use
these methods and practice in their spare time. We believe that the
continued use of these methods can relieve their pain effectively.
We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant improvement in quality of life
measured by SF-12 in the experimental group. By contrast, the SF-
12 scores in the control group were signiﬁcantly decreased, which
implies that the IPMP contributed to preventing deterioration in
the quality of life of the nursing home residents.
Due to concerns regarding homogeneity and safety, we only
recruited subjects who were physically able to tolerate exercise.
Also, because of the use of self-reported outcome measures, we
recruited older persons who were verbally communicate and
cognitively intact. Other older persons who could not express
themselves verbally and were bed-bound were excluded from the
present study. We acknowledge that pain in that group of older
persons
is
also
common.
Future
study
can
adopt
speciﬁc
assessment and management for them. On the other hand, since
pain is also common in the young elderly population, future study
can focus on a young elderly group to provide pain self-
management, which may highly reduce the health and social
burden at an earlier stage of life. Our physical outcomes in terms of
EMS and Barthel index did not reveal any signiﬁcant improvement.
This may be due to the high functional capacity among the subjects
at the baseline, especially the experimental group. In addition, the
use of non-parametric measures may not be sufﬁciently sensitive
to detect a short-term improvement in physical function. Measures
using parametric scales such as the Timed Up and Go test and the
Timed Chair Stand test (Csuka and McCarty, 1985; Shumway-Cook
et al., 2000) may be more sensitive to detect the short-term effect
and can be used for future study. Since we were limited by time
and nursing home policy, we could only conduct assessments at
the baseline and after the 8-week program. A longer follow-up is
suggested to examine the continuity of the use of pain manage-
ment methods and the effects of the program for both nursing
home residents and staff.
5. Conclusions
Chronic pain is common among older persons in nursing
homes. Nursing homes are probably the place in which they will
spend the rest of their lives, thus it is important for healthcare
workers to provide a painless and comfortable environment for
their elderly residents. The integrated pain management program
included a pain education program that enhanced the staff’s
knowledge and attitude toward pain management. Integrated
physical exercise and multisensory stimulation art and craft
