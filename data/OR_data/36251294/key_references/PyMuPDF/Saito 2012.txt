1. Introduction
Elderly people who are socially isolated from their family
members or community are a concern in western countries
(Findlay, 2003; Grenade & Boldy, 2008; Sabir et al., 2009).
Previous studies showed that 5–20% of aged people are at risk of
social isolation (Findlay, 2003; Lubben et al., 2006), caused by
decline in health (Grenade & Boldy, 2008) and life events such as
the death of a spouse or relocation (Grenade & Boldy, 2008; Saito,
Lee, & Kai, 2007; Saito, Sugisawa, Sugihara, Okabayashi, &
Shibata, 2000). Although there is no consensus on the deﬁnition
of social isolation, it is generally agreed to be a state with little
contact with family members, friends, or neighbors who form
supportive networks for the individual (Lubben et al., 2006).
Social isolation is sometimes confounded with loneliness, which
is a subjective feeling of distress caused by the discrepancy
between the quantitative and qualitative interpersonal relation-
ships a person has and desires to have (McWhirter, 1990;
Pinquart & Sorensen, 2001).
Social isolation and loneliness are distinct but interrelated
concepts (Grenade & Boldy, 2008). The lack of social support and
involvement in community activities are also closely related to
social isolation. Berkman, Glass, Brissette, and Seeman (2000)
proposed a conceptual framework in which social networks
generate social support and social engagement. This framework
was supported by Blozik et al. (2009) using data from a cross-
national survey. Thus, social isolation should not be considered a
simple state of scarcity in social contact but quantitative and
qualitative imperfections in social connectivity.
Many studies indicate relationships between social connectivity
and mortality (Berkman & Syme, 1979; Iwasaki et al., 2002; Lund,
Modvig, Due, & Holstein, 2000), disability (Avlund, Lund, Holstein, &
Due, 2004; Unger, Johnson, & Marks, 1997), cognitive ability
(Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, & Berkman, 2001; Zunzunegui, Alvarado,
Del Ser, & Otero, 2003), depression (Jang, Haley, Small, & Mortimer,
2002; Prince, Harwood, Thomas, & Mann, 1998), and subjective
well-being (McAuley et al., 2000; Pinquart & Sorensen, 2000) in the
elderly. Since these variables can be modiﬁed by relevant inter-
ventions (Stevens, Martina, & Westerhof, 2006), they are thought to
represent promising avenues for health-promotion programs
(Cattan, White, Bond, & Learmouth, 2005; McAuley et al., 2000).
Cattan et al. (2005) reviewed 30 intervention studies of social
isolation and/or loneliness among older people. They concluded

Social isolation among the elderly is a concern in developed countries. Using a randomized trial, this
study examined the effect of a social isolation prevention program on loneliness, depression, and
subjective well-being of the elderly in Japan. Among the elderly people who relocated to suburban Tokyo,
63 who responded to a pre-test were randomized and assessed 1 and 6 months after the program. Four
sessions of a group-based program were designed to prevent social isolation by improving community
knowledge and networking with other participants and community ‘‘gatekeepers.’’ The Life Satisfaction
Index A (LSI-A), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Ando-Osada-Kodama (AOK) loneliness scale, social
support, and other variables were used as outcomes of this study. A linear mixed model was used to
compare 20 of the 21 people in the intervention group to 40 of the 42 in the control group, and showed
that the intervention program had a signiﬁcant positive effect on LSI-A, social support, and familiarity
with services scores and a signiﬁcant negative effect on AOK over the study period. The program had no
signiﬁcant effect on depression. The ﬁndings of this study suggest that programs aimed at preventing
social isolation are effective when they utilize existing community resources, are tailor-made based on
the speciﬁc needs of the individual, and target people who can share similar experiences.

that group-oriented educational and/or social support programs
targeting speciﬁc groups such as women or caregivers, promoting
involvement 
from 
the 
older 
people, 
and 
utilizing 
existing
community resources were effective in reducing social isolation.
Findlay (2003) also suggested that gatekeeper programs that
utilize gatekeepers to identify people at risk for social isolation and
connect them to the community services are effective.
However, these reviews showed that the design of previous
intervention studies was problematic, such as having no compari-
son group or no randomized design, and that more studies using
randomized controlled designs are needed to provide stronger
evidence. Moreover, all these studies were conducted in Western
countries such as the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom,
and other European countries. Therefore, the effectiveness of the
programs on social isolation or loneliness in other countries is
unclear.
A recent systematic review by Dickens, Richards, Greaves, and
Campbell (2011) showed that 16 studies used randomized
controlled trials and provided a group-based program targeting
socially isolated people. Among them, four studies primarily aimed
to prevent social isolation. A Finnish study group examined the
effectiveness of a group-based psychosocial program for prevent-
ing social isolation and loneliness for elderly people who suffered
from loneliness (Pitkala, Routasalo, Kautiainen, Sintonen, & Tilvis,
2011; Pitkala, Routasalo, Kautiainen, & Tilvis, 2009; Routasalo,
Tilvis, Kautiainen, & Pitkala, 2009). They showed that programs
that enhanced relationships between group members had a
positive effect on mortality, subjective health (Pitkala et al.,
2009), and cognitive health (Pitkala et al., 2011), but no signiﬁcant
effect on loneliness. Moreover, these studies did not aim to
enhance networking with people other than group members such
as ‘‘gatekeepers’’ or other community resources.
In Japan, people are generally thought to have abundant and
close personal networks of kinship or community members, and
this is believed to be one of the reasons that Japanese people have
the highest longevity in the world (Marmot & Smith, 1989; Takao,
2009). However, the proportion of non-married people in Japan has
increased rapidly (National Institute of Population and Social
Security Research, 2010), while community ties have remained
weak in the last few decades (Cabinet Ofﬁce, 2011), which may
cause a decrease in the quantity and quality of social relationships.
Several studies have shown that 10.4–28.7% of elderly Japanese
people are socially isolated (Saito, Shimizu, Yamaguchi, & Takei,
2009; Saito et al., 2010). Yabe, Nishimura, Asakawa, Ando, and
Koyano (2002) showed that the majority of elderly people made
friends at schools or workplaces, which suggests that it might be
difﬁcult for elderly Japanese people to make friends with others as
they become older. In addition, a cross-national survey showed
that the proportion of elderly people who have no close friends is
higher in Japan than in the United States, France, and Germany
(Cabinet Ofﬁce, 2011). Thus, it is possible that the Japanese elderly
are vulnerable to a loss of social relationships since the community
resources to form new social networks in old age are limited.
Recently, 
prevention 
of 
social 
isolation 
has 
become 
an
important issue in Japan (Cabinet Ofﬁce, 2011). A variety of
programs aimed at preventing social isolation has recently been
developed by local governments, NPOs, and other local organiza-
tions. However, most of the programs were not developed based on
the scientiﬁc evidence but on the practical experiences of the staff,
and the effects of these programs are seldom evaluated. Moreover,
a majority of the programs are limited in targeting only elderly
people who live alone or who are frail. Our previous study (Saito
et al., 2007) showed that elderly people who experienced a recent
relocation had a higher risk of social isolation. Consequently, we
should recognize that social isolation is not only a problem for
people living alone. However, there are very few previous
intervention studies to prevent social isolation or improve social
integration for elderly people in Japan, and to the best of our
knowledge, none of these study has employed randomized trials.
We developed an intervention program that aimed to prevent
social isolation by improving community knowledge and net-
working with other participants and community ‘‘gatekeepers’’,
and as a result, lead to well-being among older Japanese migrants.
In evaluating the effect of the program, we used a randomized
controlled design and followed up 6 months after the end of the
intervention program.
2. Methods
2.1. Study site
City A is located in the suburbs of Tokyo, the capital of Japan.
The city was selected as the study site because, according to the
national census conducted in 2000, it has a high proportion of
people aged 65 years and above who moved to the city in the last 5
years. This proportion in City A is 11.2%, which is more than twice
the national average of 4.7% (Saito et al., 2007).
2.2. Procedure
The procedure for this study is shown in Fig. 1. Based on a
previous study (Saito et al., 2007), we assumed that the elderly
people who experienced relocation within 2 years tended to be
socially isolated. A total of 999 senior citizens aged 65 years or over
who had moved into City A within the last 2 years were selected
from the Basic Resident Registration Cards. Among them, 290 older
persons who had moved to residential facilities (i.e., a special care
or home-care facility for the frail elderly) in City A were excluded
from the recruiting list because the facilities provide speciﬁc
services. In July 2006, a recruiting letter and a consent form were
sent to the 709 senior residents.
The recruitment letter contained an outline of the intervention
program and requirements for participation, such as cooperation
for three evaluation questionnaires during the study period. It also
explained that participants were randomly assigned to two groups
and that people in the control group had to wait for 7 months
before participating in the program. People in the control group
were sent several newsletters or written information about group
activities in City A during the intervention period. The participants
were told that there was no compulsion to participate, that they
could choose to discontinue at any point during the study
procedure, and that their data would be kept conﬁdential
throughout.
A total of 76 senior residents returned the signed consent form
for participation in the study within 3 weeks of the date of
recruitment. We could not determine why the remaining 633
people did not send back the form, although our previous study
(Saito, Lee, & Kai, 2006) showed that common reasons for non-
participation included ill health, being too busy, and having no
interest. Among the 76 respondents, 63 completed a self-
administered mail questionnaire pre-test (T1) survey and were
assigned sequential numbers in the order of their response. In the
group allocation, the sequential numbers were randomly assigned
to two groups with an allocation ratio of 1:2 for the intervention
and control groups, respectively, according to simple randomiza-
tion. As a result, 21 people were allocated to the intervention group
and 42 to the control group; this allocation was carried out by the
authors, who developed and implemented the program and
analyzed the data. Thus, this trial was randomized but was not
blinded. In addition, sample size was not determined by a sample
size calculation based on the estimated mean difference between
the two groups but by the feasibility of implementing the program
T. Saito et al. / Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics 55 (2012) 539–547
540

effectively and by the number of senior citizens who applied for the
program.
The intervention program was conducted during September
and October 2006. Twenty of 21 intervention group members and
38 of 42 control group members responded to the ﬁrst follow-up
self-administered mail survey (T2), which was conducted 1 month
after the intervention program ended. Six months after the
intervention program ended, the second follow-up survey (T3)
was conducted with the same method as T2 survey, and 20 people
in the intervention group and 37 out of 42 people in the control
group responded. We compared the results for those participants
who completed at least one follow-up survey (T2 and/or T3).
Among 21 people in the intervention group, 20 completed both
follow-up surveys and one person dropped out before the ﬁrst
follow up survey was conducted. As for the control group, 35 of 42
people completed both follow-up surveys, ﬁve people completed
either the T2 or the T3 survey, and two people withdrew from the
program. The study protocol was approved by the IRB committee
in the University of Tokyo, Japan.
2.3. Intervention
The purpose of the intervention was to improve the health and
well-being of the elderly participants by preventing social
isolation. Based on previous studies (Cattan et al., 2005; Findlay,
2003), we developed a group-based educational, cognitive, and
social support program designed to prevent social isolation by
improving community knowledge and networking with other
participants and various community ‘‘gatekeepers,’’ who could
make connections between the study participants and community
services.
In developing this intervention, we conducted a telephone
survey for elderly migrants to get a grasp of their needs, demands,
and preferences, and we reviewed previous programs for elderly
migrants. We utilized existing community resources in City A
(Saito et al., 2006). A department in City A provided us with
information on activities and support systems for elderly people
and communicated with other departments and community
leaders in City A who might be helpful to elderly migrants. In

addition, a member of the community who was experienced in
leading group activities for the elderly and four elderly migrants
who participated in our previous pilot program participated in this
intervention program as volunteer supporters. More detailed
information on the program’s development is provided in Saito
et al. (2006).
The program contained four 2-h sessions. Sessions were
conducted once every 2 weeks at a public facility in City A. The
ﬁrst session introduced the content of the intervention programs,
provided an opportunity for participants to acquaint themselves
with other older migrants and staff who were participating in the
program, and to learn general information about City A.
The second session was used for a focus group discussion about
the effects of participants’ relocation experiences on their lives.
This activity aimed at making the participants aware of their own
needs and, by sharing personal relocation experiences, to promote
the formation of networks among the participants. We asked three
experienced colleagues to facilitate the discussion.
The third session was conducted to ﬁnd out what information
each participant was interested in and for meetings with
gatekeepers who could support each participant based on their
interests. We prepared seven small booths where participants
could make face-to-face contact with each gatekeeper specializing
in speciﬁc themes such as health and welfare issues, volunteering,
and leisure activities for seniors in City A; history or historical
places in City A; transportation and commercial facilities in City A;
or the department in City A that provides information on activities
and support for the frail elderly.
In the ﬁnal session, we conducted a sightseeing tour of City A to
show the participants public facilities and historical places. This
was aimed at increasing opportunities for going out or utilizing
public services.
2.4. Measurement
2.4.1. Indicators of subjective well-being, depression, and loneliness
We measured subjective well-being with the LSI-A (Neugarten,
Havighurst, & Tobin, 1961), which is one of the most well-known
and validated scales. It gages the long-term cognitive evaluation of
a person’s life as well as transient affective feelings (Lawrence &
Liang, 1988). We used a 10-item Japanese version of the LSI-A scale
(Kim, Sugisawa, Okabayashi, Fukaya, & Shibata, 1999) that has the
same structure as Liang’s (1984) (Saito et al., 2000). Scores ranged
from 10 to 30, and internal consistency (alpha coefﬁcient) was
0.72, 0.80, and 0.80 at pre-test, 1-month follow-up, and 6-month
follow-up, respectively.
The GDS was developed to measure the affective dimension of
depressive status in older populations (Yesavage et al., 1983). We
used a Japanese version of the scale with 15 items, which has high
construct validity and internal consistency (Niino, Imaizumi, &
Kawakami, 1991). Its internal consistency (alpha coefﬁcient) in
this study was 0.78, 0.78, and 0.77, at pre-test, 1-month follow-up,
and 6-month follow-up, respectively.
We measured loneliness using the AOK loneliness scale, which
was developed as a revised version of the revised UCLA (University
of California, Los Angeles) loneliness scale (Russell, Peplau, &
Cutrona, 1980) and showed internal consistency and concurrent
validity (Ando, Osada, & Kodama, 2000). The internal consistency
(alpha coefﬁcient) in this study was 0.87, 0.86, and 0.90, at pre-test,
1-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up, respectively.
2.4.2. Indicators of social support, network, and activity
We measured social support with four items related to
emotional support and four items related to instrumental support
provided by the participants’ informal networks, such as family
members, children who live apart from the participant, relatives,
friends, or neighbors. The responses were scored one for each item
if they received support from any informal networks, and zero if
they received no support. We summed all the social support items,
as the results of a principal component analysis showed that all the
social support items had a factor loading score higher than 0.4 on
the primary factor.
Social network was assessed with one item that evaluated the
frequency of face-to-face contact with friends or neighbors on a
scale from 1 (no contact) to 6 (contact more than twice per week).
This item was treated as a continuous variable.
In addition to the social support and network indicators,
frequency of participation in group activities such as neighborhood
organization, commercial organization, hobby group, or religious
group was assessed with one item that ranged from 1 (not
participating) to 6 (participating more than twice per week).
2.4.3. Familiarity with the formal services provided by City A
Utilization of services provided by the community was an
important issue in previous studies on social connectivity (Kouzis
& Eaton, 1998; Russell & Schoﬁeld, 1999). We used familiarity with
formal services for the elderly as a proxy measure for service
utilization. This was assessed by asking participants if they knew
about the existence of two services for frail elderly citizens covered
by Long-term Care Insurance System, and seven other services for
elderly people provided by NGOs and local government. We
summed the number of known items, resulting in a score that
ranged from 0 to 8.
2.4.4. Other participant characteristics
Information about basic and instrumental activities of daily
living, marital status, living arrangement, educational attainment,
gender, and age was collected at the pre-test for participants in
both the intervention and control groups.
2.5. Analysis
All the analyses were conducted using the principles of
intention-to-treat analysis, which was deﬁned as all participants
who are randomly assigned to either intervention group or control
group and responded to the evaluation questionnaires at least once
(T2 and/or T3) after the intervention.
To examine the differences in the characteristics of the
intervention and control groups at pre-test, we conducted t-tests
for continuous variables, or Fisher’s exact tests for dichotomous
variables. A linear mixed-model analysis on each dependent
variable was used to assess the effect of the intervention program
on elderly migrants. The participants were modeled as a random
effect since we assumed a within-subject correlation between
measures. The intervention (group), time, the interaction between
group and time, and intercept were modeled as ﬁxed effects. A pre-
test score of each dependent variable was entered into the model
as a covariate. All the analyses were estimated using a restricted
maximum likelihood method. Additionally, subgroup analyses by
severity-of-loneliness level were conducted to determine whether
the effect of the intervention program was different on people with
different risk levels. Since the cutoff scores of the AOK loneliness
scale and the UCLA loneliness scale were unknown, we regarded
people who responded to all ten AOK items with ‘‘not lonely’’—
those who scored 10 points—as members of the low-risk group,
while those who scored 11 points or more were considered
members of the high-risk group. The subgroup analyses were
conducted with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing the pre-
test (T1) and the post-test 1 month after the intervention (T2), T1
and the post-test 6 months after the intervention (T3), and T2 and
T3 among four different groups (two different risk levels for each of
the intervention and control groups). The subgroup analyses were
T. Saito et al. / Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics 55 (2012) 539–547
542

conducted only on the variables that showed statistical signiﬁ-
cance in the main analyses.
In this study, p values of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) were
interpreted as statistically signiﬁcant, and the analyses were
conducted using the Japanese version of SPSS 18.0.
3. Results
3.1. Participant characteristics at pre-test
The characteristics of the intervention and control group
participants are shown in Table 1. There were no statistical
differences between the intervention and control groups in terms
of participant characteristics at pre-test other than familiarity with
services, which was signiﬁcantly higher in the control group
(p = 0.041). The average age of participants in the intervention
group was 72.6, and eight of those participants were male (40.0%).
Nine of the intervention group participants were married (45.0%)
and seven lived alone (35.0%). Seven participants in the interven-
tion group had higher education (35.0%). Regarding health status at
pre-test, all participants in the intervention group were assessed,
and 18 of them were found to be independent with instrumental
activities of daily living. GDS score was divided into two groups
with the clinical cutoff score point of 5/6. Five cases (25.0%) from
the intervention group and 20 (50.0%) from the control group were
categorized as having at least mild depressive status. Although the
percentage of the control group was double that of the intervention
group, no statistical difference was detected. As for the AOK
loneliness scale, eight (42.1%) cases from the intervention group
and 18 (45.0%) from the control group were shown as feeling at
least mild loneliness.
3.2. Frequency of participation in the program
Thirteen of the twenty participants in the intervention group
participated in the program for all four sessions. Seven people did
not attend the program at least once. This was partly due to a
tropical typhoon that hit Tokyo on the day of the second session.
3.3. Effects of the intervention program
The intervention program had a signiﬁcant positive effect on
subjective well-being measured by the LSI-A (p = 0.039), social
support (p = 0.013), and familiarity with services scores (p = 0.008),
and it had a signiﬁcant negative effect on the AOK loneliness scale
(p = 0.011) over the 6 months of the study period. Fig. 2 shows the
effects of the intervention, the adjusted mean, and 95% conﬁdence
interval scores of these variables in the intervention and control
groups. The AOK scores in the intervention group decreased about
0.9 point at T2 and 1.0 point at T3, whereas the scores of the control
group increased about 0.6 point at T2 and 0.4 point at T3. As for the
LSI-A, scores increased about 1.0 point at T2 and 1.9 points at T3 in
the intervention group, while those of the control group decreased
0.7 point at T2 and increased 0.2 point at T3. The social support
scores in the intervention group increased about 0.6 point at T3,
whereas scores in the control group decreased 0.8 point at T3. The
familiarity with services scores in the intervention group contin-
ued to increase after the intervention program. The scores
increased about 1.6 points at T2 and 2.0 points at T3, whereas
the scores in the control group increased only 0.3 point 6 months
after the program.
Statistical differences were not observed for GDS, social
network, and social activity scores (not shown in the paper).
The adjusted mean score of the GDS in the intervention group
decreased 1.1 points at T2 but decreased only 0.4 point at T3. As for
the social network, scores in the intervention group increased
about 0.3 point at T2 and 0.6 point at T3, although it did not reach a
signiﬁcant level.
The results of the additional subgroup analyses are shown in
Table 2. In the high-risk group with AOK scores of 11 or above, the
LSI-A score of the intervention group at T1 increased signiﬁcantly
at the post-test 6 months after the intervention (T3); similarly, the
score at the post-test 1 month after the intervention (T2) increased
at T3. As for the AOK loneliness scale, the score of the intervention
group at T1 signiﬁcantly decreased at T2. No signiﬁcant effect was
found in the high-risk control group. In the low-risk group with no
loneliness, no signiﬁcant effect other than increased familiarity
with services was found in the intervention group. In contrast, the
AOK score at T1 signiﬁcantly increased at T2, and the social support
score at T1 and T2 signiﬁcantly decreased at T3 in the control
group.
4. Discussion
This study showed that our intervention program, aimed at
preventing social isolation, was effective for improving subjective

well-being, informal social support, and familiarity with services in
the community and for reducing loneliness among elderly people
who experienced a recent residential relocation.
The loneliness scale score for the intervention group decreased
after the program and was maintained for 6 months after the
program. Previous studies indicated that receiving support from
peers was effective at alleviating loneliness (Dennis et al., 2009;
Ernst & Cacippo, 1999). The participants in this study shared their
common experiences of residential relocation and feelings of
loneliness, and that led to support among peers and feelings of
togetherness (Savikko, Routasalo, Tilvis, & Pitkala, 2010). This
study showed an ameliorative effect on loneliness, in contrast to
Routasalo et al. (2009), who found no signiﬁcant effect. The reason
for this difference was not clear since both studies used the UCLA
loneliness scale or its revised version, but it might be because of
differences in the study populations—ours may have been less
lonely than that of Routasalo et al. (2009)—or program content, as
our study considered not only networking between participants
but also community gatekeepers.
The score for familiarity with the services in the community for
the intervention group continued to increase 1 month and 6 months
after the program. One reason for this continuing improvement
might be that people in the intervention group continued to be
motivated to collect the information they needed or would need in
the future, and the skills and resources they acquired during the
program enabled them to collect this information.
The intervention program in this study had a signiﬁcant effect
on the informal social support score, but the effect on the
frequency of social network and social activity scores did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance, although the scores on these variables
continued to increase during the follow-up period for the
intervention group. The difference in the effect among these
variables might be partly due to measurement itself. Each social
network and social activity score was measured with only one
item, which possibly had a larger measurement error than the
social support score that was measured by summing eight different
but highly correlated items. On the other hand, it is possible that
the follow-up period and sample size were not enough to detect
signiﬁcant effects of the intervention on social support and social
activity.
The mean subjective well-being scores for the intervention
group were signiﬁcantly higher than those for the control group.
There are two possible explanations for the ameliorative effect of
the intervention program on subjective well-being. The ﬁrst is that
improvement in the qualitative dimension of social connectivity,
such as a decrease in loneliness and increase in social support,
makes a difference. Previous studies indicated that loneliness and
social support is a factor that contributes to subjective well-being
in later life (McAuley et al., 2000; Neto, 1995; Windle & Woods,
2004). Although not shown in the results section, the correlation
between loneliness and subjective well-being in this study was
moderate 
and 
was 
stronger 
than 
the 
correlation 
between
subjective well-being and the social networks or social activity
variables.
On the other hand, it is also possible that the intervention
program had a direct effect on the cognitive aspects of subjective
well-being among the program participants. We assessed subjec-
tive well-being with the LSI-A, which contains a cognitive
evaluation of both the past and present (Lawrence & Liang,
1988). The participants had plenty of opportunities to evaluate
their 
relocation 
experiences 
by 
communicating 
with 
other
participants during the program in a supportive atmosphere. It
is possible that some participants began to accept their experience
as a preferable one and evaluated the cognitive aspects of
subjective well-being more positively. This might explain the lack
of signiﬁcant effect on GDS scores in this study, as this score solely
evaluates short-term affective aspects of depression.
Additional subgroup analyses showed that this study’s inter-
vention program had an ameliorative effect on subjective well-
being or loneliness among people who felt at least mild loneliness.

had no signiﬁcant effect other than on familiarity with services.
However, it is possible that the program helped people maintain
high levels for each outcome since the loneliness level and social
support level of the control group had signiﬁcantly deteriorated.
Thus, it is suggested that the intervention program of this study
had a positive effect on the older people regardless of their level of
loneliness.
Using data from elderly Japanese migrants, this study supports
the results of previous reviews by Cattan et al. (2005) and Findlay
(2003) that report the scarcity of studies in non-western countries.
Moreover, our study was designed as a randomized controlled trial,
so the results can be considered more reliable than previous
intervention studies that used other designs. However, this study
has several limitations, which should be addressed in future
research.
The sample size in this study was not large enough, as there were
ultimately less than 60 participants. Therefore, we should be
cautious of type II errors in the results of the statistical analyses.
Jane´-Llopis, Hosman, Jenkins, and Anderson (2003) showed that the
mean effect size of intervention studies aimed at preventing
depression in people in general was around 0.3. If we hypothesize
that the effect size of this study was as large as previous studies’, our
study would need 302 people to detect statistical signiﬁcance; this is
much larger than the number of participants in this study. Moreover,
the sample was selected based on spontaneous application to the
intervention program. It is possible that the characteristics of the
study participants, particularly their health status, differed from
those of other elderly migrants who chose not to participate. The
majority of our study participants was independent and did not
suffer from severe depression or loneliness; this might have enabled
them to attend the program at the community facility. It is important
to develop a program that ﬁts more frail and severely isolated elderly
people who have difﬁculties in going out. All our participants were
elderly migrants who lived in City A in a suburb of Tokyo, which also
limits the generalizability of the results.
The other limitation relates to study blindness. Double-blinding
in a randomized controlled trial is important because knowledge of
the intervention will inﬂuence the evaluation of the outcome
(Rothman, 2002). However, it is not possible for social intervention
studies to be blinded like a study with a medication and a placebo.
In our study, we do not think the bias was large because we used
measurement scales as outcomes that were not explained to the
participants as study outcomes, and all of the outcomes were
scored by the participants, not by the researcher who conducted
the analyses. Still, the group allocation and analyses were not
blinded for the authors, which might be a limitation of this study.
With these limitations, this study still has important program
and policy implications. First, targeting a speciﬁc population
might be effective, as indicated in previous studies (Cattan et al.,
2005). The program participants in this study could share their
common experiences of residential relocation, which helped
reduce loneliness and/or improve subjective well-being. There-
fore, we can consider a targeted population approach in
community settings as a promising option, although it has
not typically been part of community services in Japan as in
England (Cattan et al., 2005) except with respect to health status
or living arrangement. Japan experienced a recent disastrous
earthquake that caused many people to be evacuated and
relocated to temporary housing where social support systems
for elderly people were underdeveloped. We should consider
utilizing the concept of the intervention program of this study
for the people who are suffering social isolation caused by the
earthquake.
Second, our study demonstrated the effectiveness of a program
aimed at improving social integration in the community by
utilizing existing community resources, particularly community
volunteering organizations. The results of this study showed the
ameliorative effect of the program on loneliness, subjective well-
being, social support, and familiarity with the services provided by
the community, which suggests that preventive programs can be
effectively implemented without speciﬁc professional skills or
considerable expense when the program aims to improve social
integration for people without severe risk. The intervention
program in this study was implemented by collaboration among
local government, NPOs, community volunteers, and researchers.
This collaboration enables the program to recruit all the elderly
people who experienced a recent relocation, to gather various
gatekeepers who are suitable for the needs of the elderly migrants,
and to evaluate its effect with an adequate study design, as this
study did.
Third, the processes that lead to loneliness or disruption of
social networks are diverse (Ernst & Cacippo, 1999; Grenade &
Boldy, 2008), which suggests that effective intervention may need
to be tailor-made for each person. The program assessed in this
study enabled participants to collect information and to connect
with gatekeepers based on their diverse needs, which may have led
to increased familiarity with services.
Thus, it should be important to develop a variety of group-based
programs that target speciﬁc people, utilize existing resources
such as community volunteer organizations, and provide a tailor-
made service for individuals needing more social integration in the
community setting.

5. Conclusion
Using a randomized design, this study evaluated the effects of
an intervention program aimed at preventing social isolation on
loneliness, depression, and subjective well-being among elderly
Japanese migrants. Our program had an ameliorative effect on
loneliness, subjective well-being, informal social support, and
familiarity with the services provided by the community until 6
months after the program. The results of this study suggest that
programs aimed at preventing social isolation may be effective
when they are tailor-made based on the speciﬁc needs of the
individual, utilize existing community resources, and target people
who can share similar experiences.
