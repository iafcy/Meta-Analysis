Abstract
Objectives:  Beliefs about aging can contribute to health and well-being in older adults. Feeling generative, or that one is 
caring for and contributing to the well-being of others, can also impact health and well-being. In this study, we hypothe-
sized that those with more positive expectations regarding aging (ERA) in the mental health domain would report greater 
levels of perceived social support (PSS) and lower levels of loneliness in response to a generativity intervention (vs control 
condition).
Method:  Participants in this study (n = 73, 100% female) were randomly assigned to a 6-week generativity condition, 
which involved writing about life experiences and sharing advice with others, or to a control condition, which involved 
writing about neutral topics. Pre- and postintervention, PSS, and feelings of loneliness were measured.
Results:  Those in the generativity condition with more positive ERA in the mental health domain reported greater PSS and 
lower loneliness postintervention.
Discussion:  These results highlight the importance of psychological factors, such as ERA, in moderating the efficacy of 
interventions to promote social well-being in older adults.

Beliefs about aging are an important contributor to behav-
ioral and health outcomes in older adults. For example, 
more positive beliefs about aging are linked with better 
health and well-being, including increased longevity (Levy, 
Slade, Kunkel, & Kasl, 2002; Warmoth, Tarrant, Abraham, 
& Lang, 2016). Beliefs about aging can also impact social 
well-being. Expecting to be lonelier as a function of age 
and stereotyping old age as a time of loneliness is associ-
ated with feeling lonelier almost a decade later (Pikhartova, 
Bowling, & Victor, 2016). Older adults with more positive 
expectations regarding aging (ERA) are also more likely to 
increase social engagement in the future (Menkin, Robles, 
Gruenewald, Tanner, & Seeman, 2016). Together, these 
findings suggest that having more positive ERA may play an 

important role in shaping older adults’ social well-being. In 
this study, we examined whether ERA influenced the effects 
of an intervention aimed at increasing social well-being.
In addition to beliefs about aging, another psychosocial 
factor that may influence social well-being in older adults 
is generativity, or the feeling that one is contributing to 
others, particularly younger generations. Indeed, genera-
tivity, which involves the “need to be needed” (McAdams & 
De St Aubin, 1992) through a desire to be useful to others, 
has been associated with greater psychological and social 
well-being (Keyes & Ryff, 1998), social support (Hart, 
McAdams, Hirsch, & Bauer, 2001), and prosocial behavior 
(Cox, Wilt, Olson, & McAdams, 2010). Furthermore, 
many older adults experience loneliness due to a loss of 
meaningful social engagement (Smith, 2012), suggesting 
low levels of generativity and social usefulness may con-
tribute to subjective feelings of social isolation in this pop-
ulation. Importantly, providing opportunities to participate 
in generative activity may reduce social isolation in older 
adults (Carlson, Seeman, & Fried, 2000). Improving such 
social outcomes in older adults is a public health priority, 
given that greater loneliness and decreased social support 
are associated with greater morbidity and mortality (Blazer, 
1982; Perissinotto, Stijacic Cenzer, & Covinsky, 2012).
Thus, increasing generativity via an intervention may im-
prove older adults’ social well-being, suggesting that genera-
tivity interventions may be an effective tool for improving 
loneliness and perceived social support (PSS) in older adults. 
Specifically, previous work has found that a volunteering in-
tervention involving intergenerational contact can increase 
generativity (Gruenewald et  al., 2016) and improve PSS 
(Fried et al., 2004) in older adults. However, this type of 
“high intensity” intervention may not be a proper fit for all 
older adults, particularly ones with limitations preventing 
them from participating in intensive volunteering. As such, 
there is a need to develop generativity interventions which 
may impact social well-being but may also be more acces-
sible, such as a writing-based intervention.
Furthermore, given the influence of beliefs about aging 
on social outcomes, it is possible that positive views about 
aging may also influence how older adults respond to psy-
chological interventions. Thus, it is possible that a genera-
tivity intervention may have its most salutary effects on 
social well-being in older individuals with positive ERA. 
In support of this notion, psychological interventions are 
more effective for those who are motivated to and ex-
pect to benefit from the activity (Lyubomirsky & Layous, 
2013). Furthermore, stereotype embodiment theory (Levy, 
2009) suggests that stereotypes and beliefs about aging 
can lead to differential outcomes via self-fulfilling proph-
ecies (e.g., engagement with the generativity intervention) 
and behaviors (e.g., self-efficacy regarding the generativity 
intervention).
As such, the goal of this study was to test whether ERA, 
specifically in the mental health domain, moderated the 
effect of a generativity intervention on social well-being, 
as a secondary analysis on a previous data set. We hy-
pothesized that the generativity intervention would 
lead to greater social well-being for those with more 
positive ERA.
Method
Participants and Procedures
Detailed information about participants and procedures are 
described elsewhere (reporting the primary outcomes of the 
study; Moieni et al., 2020), as well as in the Supplementary 
Material, but are also summarized here. In brief, partici-
pants were healthy women aged 60 and older screened for 
feeling low in current generative achievement relative to 
their generative desire (Gruenewald et al., 2016).
All participants (n = 78 females) were randomized into 
either a 6-week generativity or control writing condition and 
were told that the study was investigating the relationship 
between writing about experiences and health. As described 
previously (Moieni et  al., 2020) and the Supplementary 
Material, 5 participants did not complete the study, leaving a 
total final sample of 73 female participants (mean age 70.9 ± 
6.5 years; 80.8% white; 35 in the control condition, 38 in 
the generativity condition). The sample size was determined 
for the primary aims of the study (Moieni et al., 2020); fur-
ther details are available in the Supplementary Material.
Participants in the generativity condition wrote weekly 
about their life experiences and shared their wisdom and 
advice (for middle-aged adults) in response to topics such 
as: “What are some of the most important lessons you feel 
you have learned over the course of your life? If a mid-
dle-aged person asked you “what have you learned in your 
____ years in this world,” what would you tell him or 
her?....” In order to provide an audience for participants’ 
generative action, participants in the generativity condi-
tion were informed that their responses would be collected, 
made anonymous, and published into a book or website 
intended to help middle-aged adults. For the full listing of 
the prompts, see Supplementary Material.
Participants in the control condition were not told 
that their writings would be shared and wrote about neu-
tral topics such as: “In the space provided below, please 
describe what you had for lunch today—what it looked 
like, how it tasted…. In your writing, please try to focus 
on the details of what you ate, how it looked, and how it 
tasted, rather than on who you were with or what you were 
thinking about during this time….”
All participants provided written consent. All pro-
cedures were approved by the UCLA Human Subjects 
Protection Committee (IRB#14-000811). The general de-
sign, as well as the primary outcomes, of the study (Moieni 
et  al., 2020), was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT02472379). The secondary analyses presented here 
were not preregistered.

Self-report Measures
ERA Survey
The ERA Survey (Mental Health Domain), measured at 
preintervention, is a valid, reliable (α  =  .64) scale to as-
sess participants’ beliefs about mental health as a func-
tion of age (Sarkisian, Steers, Hays, & Mangione, 2005).1 
Participants were presented with four statements regarding 
beliefs about aging and mental health, including two items 
relevant to the social domain (e.g., “being lonely is just 
something that happens when people get old”; all four 
items in Supplementary Material).
Social Provisions Scale
The Social Provisions Scale, measured pre- and postintervention, 
is a valid, reliable (α = .90) scale to assess multiple domains 
of PSS, such as feelings of attachment and social integration 
(Cutrona, 1984; Cutrona & Russell, 1987; e.g., “I feel a strong 
emotional bond with at least one other person”).
UCLA Loneliness Scale
The 
UCLA 
Loneliness 
Scale, 
measured 
pre- 
and 
postintervention, is a valid, reliable (α = .92) scale to as-
sess loneliness (Russell, 1996) (e.g., “how often do you feel 
alone?”). Loneliness and perceptions of social support were 
significantly correlated with each other (at preintervention, 
r = −.71, p < .001) but represent distinct constructs with 
separate, rich literatures and thus were both examined as 
social well-being outcomes.
General Analytic Strategy
In order to test the moderating effect of ERA on PSS and lone-
liness, the PROCESS macro for SPSS was used (Hayes, 2012). 
To examine whether ERA moderated the effect of the inter-
vention on PSS and loneliness, we tested the interaction of 
condition (generativity vs control) and ERA on PSS and lone-
liness postintervention, controlling for preintervention values.
Results
At baseline, the two groups were not different in ERA, 
loneliness, or PSS (ps > .2). As hypothesized, there was a 
significant interaction between condition (generativity vs 
control) and ERA, such that more positive ERA predicted 
greater PSS postintervention for those in the generativity 
condition (vs control; Figure 1; B = .174, SE = .070, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = [.034, .313], t = 2.48, p < .05). 
Analysis of conditional effects revealed that higher ERA 
predicted improvements in PSS within the generativity 
condition (B = .172, SE = .052, 95% CI = [.068, .276], t = 
3.30, p < .01), but not in the control condition (B = −.002, 
SE = .048, 95% CI = [−.097, .093], t = −.042, p > .9).
This same pattern of results held true for feelings of 
loneliness. As hypothesized, there was a significant interac-
tion between condition (generativity vs control) and ERA, 
such that more positive ERA predicted lower feelings of 
loneliness postintervention for those in the generativity 
condition (vs control; Figure 2; B = −.164, SE = .055, 95% 
CI = [−.274, −.055], t = −3.00, p < .01). Analysis of condi-
tional effects revealed that higher ERA predicted improve-
ments in loneliness within the generativity condition (B = 
−.115, SE = .042, 95% CI = [−.198, −.031], t = −2.74, p < 
.01), but not in the control condition (B = .050, SE = .039, 
95% CI = [−.027, .127], t = 1.29, p > .2).

1  Due to technical issues, one of the items in the mental health 
domain of the ERA Survey was from the 38-item version of the scale 
(Sarkisian, Hays, Berry, & Mangione, 2002) rather than the intended 
12-item version. The item in the 12-item scale that reads “as people 
get older they worry more” (Item 7)  instead read “quality of life 
declines as people age.” Removing this item from the scale does 
not change the results of the analyses.

Discussion
Here, we tested whether ERA moderated the effect of a 
novel writing-based generativity intervention on social 
well-being. Indeed, there was a significant moderation ef-
fect of ERA on PSS and loneliness. Those in the generativity 
condition with more positive ERA in the mental health do-
main showed greater PSS and lower feelings of loneliness 
after the intervention.
This study provides insight into an important question 
in intervention development: for whom is the intervention 
most beneficial? In regards to the effects of a writing-based 
generativity intervention on social well-being, ERA appear 
to play a role in deriving benefit. While no work has exam-
ined this question directly, related prior work supports this 
finding. For example, participants with greater motivation 
to become happier—who expect a positive psychology in-
tervention may lead to benefits—show greater increases in 
well-being (Lyubomirsky, Dickerhoof, Boehm, & Sheldon, 
2011). Although participants in this study were not in-
formed that the intervention was a well-being–enhancing 
intervention and thus could not explicitly expect benefits, 
their preexisting ERA may have played a similar role.
There are several pathways through which these be-
liefs about aging may impact social well-being in a genera-
tivity intervention. As suggested by stereotype embodiment 
theory, one way in which stereotypes of aging can lead to 
negative outcomes is by creating expectations that act as 
self-fulfilling prophecies (Levy, 2009). Thus, participants in 
the generativity intervention with more negative ERA may 
not engage as much in an intervention aiming to increase 
feelings of social usefulness due to their preexisting expec-
tations. As a result of this, these participants may not derive 
as much benefit, leading to less favorable social well-being 
as a result of the intervention.
Stereotype embodiment theory also suggests that be-
havior may be another pathway through which beliefs and 
stereotypes about aging may impact outcomes (Levy, 2009). 
For example, priming negative age stereotypes can impair 
self-efficacy (Levy, Hausdorff, Hencke, & Wei, 2000). In 
the context of this study, impairments in self-efficacy as a 
result of more negative ERA may be another pathway for 
the moderating effects. Those in the generativity condition 
with lower ERA may feel that they are less effective at pro-
viding advice to others, and this lower self-efficacy may 
also inhibit feelings of social usefulness and generativity, 
driving the moderating effects.
A few limitations should be considered. First, this study 
was conducted in a very selective sample, exclusively female 
and mostly white, as well as one limited to older women 
who had access to the Internet and a computer. This sug-
gests that future studies should examine these effects in 
more representative samples. Future studies should also 
directly examine the proposed mechanisms for the effects, 
such as examining whether participants’ self-efficacy with 
regards to the generativity writing task is affected as a func-
tion of ERA. Additionally, the experimental component of 
this study was the generativity intervention; beliefs about 
aging were not directly manipulated and thus causal influ-
ences of ERA on social well-being cannot be determined.
The study also had several strengths, including the de-
velopment of a novel generativity intervention for older 
adults. Furthermore, this is a low-cost, low-effort interven-
tion and thus potentially accessible to large segments of 
the older adult population. The intervention also included 
measures of both PSS and loneliness, allowing effects to be 
examined across multiple social outcomes, which are both 
significant contributors to health outcomes in older adults 
(Blazer, 1982; Perissinotto et  al., 2012). Furthermore, 
examining moderators of interventions is an important 
area of investigation, allowing us to understand who may 
benefit the most from future interventions (Lyubomirsky 
& Layous, 2013). Finally, these findings may ultimately 
have large-scale public health impacts, as they suggest that 
altering personal and societal views of aging may interact 
with other processes to impact social well-being. However, 
altering negative views of aging is complex, with few effec-
tive interventions supported by evidence thus far (Kotter-
Grühn, 2015). Thus, while these results theoretically may 
have broad clinical implications, further research is needed 
to identify effective, long-lasting interventions to alter neg-
ative views of aging.
In conclusion, this study provides valuable information 
about the effect of a novel writing-based intervention on 
social well-being in older adults. Those with more positive 
ERA, specifically in the mental health domain, may derive 
the most benefit from such an intervention. Thus, interven-
tions aiming to improve social well-being through genera-
tivity may also need to alter ERA in order to maximize 
impact.
