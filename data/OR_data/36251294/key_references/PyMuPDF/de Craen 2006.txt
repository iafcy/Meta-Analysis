ABSTRACT
Objective: The objective of this trial, the Leiden 85-Plus Occupational Therapy Intervention
Study (LOTIS), was to assess whether unsolicited occupational therapy, as compared to no
therapy, can decelerate the increase in disability in high-risk elderly people.
Design: This was a randomised controlled trial with 2-y follow-up.
Setting: The study took place in the municipality of Leiden in the Netherlands.
Participants: The participants were 402 community-dwelling 85-y-old people, with a Mini-
Mental State Examination score of .18 points at baseline.
Interventions: Participants in the intervention group were visited by an occupational
therapist who provided training and education about assistive devices that were already
present and who gave recommendations and information about procedures, possibilities, and
costs of assistive devices and community-based services. Control participants were not visited
by an occupational therapist.
Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the score achieved on the
Groningen Activity Restriction Scale. Secondary outcome measures included self-evaluations of
well-being and feelings of loneliness.
Results: The participants were evenly divided between the two groups: 202 participants were
allocated to the intervention group and 200 participants to the control group. Of the 202
participants randomised to occupational therapy, 55 participants declined the proposed
intervention. An occupational therapist indicated that of the remaining 147 participants, 66
(45%) needed an occupational therapy intervention. A total of 44 new assistive devices and five
community-based services were implemented. During follow-up there was a progressive
increase in disability in the intervention group (mean annual increase, 2.0 points; SE 0.2; p ,
0.001) and control group (mean annual increase, 2.1 points; SE 0.2; p , 0.001). The increase in
disability was not significantly different between study groups (0.08 points; 95% CI, 1.1–1.2; p
¼ 0.75). There was also no difference between study groups for any of the secondary outcome
measures.
Conclusion: Unsolicited occupational therapy in high-risk elderly participants does not
decelerate the increase in disability over time.

INTRODUCTION
Community-dwelling elderly people, and particularly the
oldest old, are generally viewed as highly susceptible to the
‘‘inverse care law’’ [1]. That is, those in greatest need for
preventive assessment and surveillance have the highest
potential beneﬁts, but are also the most likely to be missed.
Hence, active case-ﬁnding and close follow-up might be an
important strategy for maintaining the health, independence,
and well-being of very elderly people, who are at a
particularly high risk.
Assistive devices and community-based services are im-
portant tools in maintaining independence at old age. A
recent systematic review on the efﬁcacy of occupational
therapy for community-dwelling elderly people found that
occupational therapy in this age group has beneﬁcial effects
[2]. Apart from studies in younger elderly people, this
carefully conducted review included only one small study in
85-y-olds who already had one or more disabilities in
activities in daily living [3]. Hence, little is known about the
possible beneﬁts of occupational therapy in 85-y-olds.
We conducted a randomised controlled trial to assess
whether unsolicited occupational therapy, compared to no
therapy, can decelerate the increase in disability in a group of
high-risk community-dwelling elderly people.
METHODS
Participants
We included 85-y-old participants using the infrastructure of
the Leiden 85-Plus Study [4]. Participants who reached the
age of 85 between March 2000 and May 2002, who were living
in their own home, and who had a Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) [5] score above 18 points were eligible
for inclusion in the study. First, a research nurse visited all
possible participants in their own homes, explained that we
were conducting a study on daily functioning and independ-
ence in old age, asked for informed consent, and performed
all baseline measurements in consenting participants. Then,
at the end of the visit, all participating individuals were
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to the intervention
group or to the control group. The control group received
standard support, as routinely supplied by the social service
system. Those assigned to the intervention group were asked
for informed consent for the experimental part of the study.
Participants in the control group were not informed about
the experimental arm of the study. All participants in both
the intervention group and the control group were revisited
by the research nurse 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo after the baseline
measurement. The whole study, including the informed
consent procedure, was approved by the Medical Ethics
Committee of the Leiden University Medical Centre.
Interventions
Participants randomised to the intervention group were
visited by an occupational therapist within 4 wk of random-
isation. The methods by which the occupational therapists
assessed the indication for intervention and implemented the
assistive devices and community-based services have been
described elsewhere [6]. In short, in their contact with the
elderly people, the occupational therapists used the person–
environment–occupation model as proposed by Law et al.
[7,8]. This model uses a client-centred approach in which the
occupational therapist clearly involves the client in the
decision-making process. This approach was chosen since in
this study participants did not consult the occupational
therapist for an existing problem, but instead the elderly
people were approached by the occupational therapist. The
occupational therapist provided training and education
about assistive devices that were already present. When
indicated, participants received recommendations and in-
formation about procedures, possibilities, and costs of
assistive devices and community-based services that might
be beneﬁcial for them. In cases in which participants decided
to apply for the device or service, the occupational therapist
provided assistance in ﬁlling out application forms or helped
with purchasing. The occupational therapist focussed on
assistive devices and community-based services in three main
categories: mobility, meal preparation, and personal care.
Text S1 includes a description of the most common items in
each category.
Measurements
Demographic details were collected for all participants.
Income was categorised as low for participants who received
a state pension only. Cognitive functioning was assessed with
the MMSE [5].
The primary outcome measure was the score on the
Groningen Activities Restriction Scale (GARS) [9,10]. The
GARS is a unidimensional questionnaire that assesses
restrictions in competence in activities of daily living. For
example, questions are phrased as ‘‘Can you, fully independ-
ently, walk the stairs?’’ The score on each question has four
categories, 1 being ‘‘yes, without difﬁculty’’; 2, ‘‘yes, with some
difﬁculty’’; 3, ‘‘yes, with great difﬁculty’’; and 4, ‘‘no, only with

Occupational Therapy in Elderly People
Editorial Commentary
Background: Community-based services, such as occupational therapy,
are widely used for elderly people to help them maintain independence.
However, few studies have examined whether unsolicited offering of
such services are effective in reducing disability, especially in the ‘‘oldest
old’’, that is, people 85 y or older.
What this trial shows: In this population of 85-y-olds, the effect of
unsolicited occupational therapy was studied. The study consisted of
therapists proactively making visits to elderly people in the trial, in order
to provide additional services in addition to routine care. The researchers
found no change in the reduction in disability over time in participants
receiving unsolicited occupational therapy.
Strengths and limitations: The study is notable in that it provides good
evidence, previously lacking, on the effects of unsolicited occupational
therapy. The design was appropriate and randomisation was done
correctly. Limitations include the fact that take-up of occupational
therapy in the trial was not uniformly high.
Contribution to the evidence: Other evidence has shown that
occupational therapy has beneficial effects in elderly people living at
home. However, there has been little evidence about the effects of
unsolicited occupational therapy in very elderly people, who are at
particularly high risk of disability. This trial adds information from such a
population and also indicates that making unsolicited visits, with the aim
of finding people who have not already been provided with the services
they need, is not likely to be of overall benefit.

help from others’’. In scoring the GARS, the use of assistive
devices is allowed. We used the sum of the ﬁve GARS
questions from the mobility category, the four items from the
meal preparation category, and the four items from the
personal care category as primary outcome measures. The
minimum of the sum of the included GARS items is 13,
indicating optimal performance in the three domains.
Conversely, a GARS score of 52 indicates inability to perform
any of the 13 items independently. Secondary outcome
measures included the three subcategories of the GARS, the
participant’s well-being as assessed by Cantril’s ladder [11],
and loneliness as assessed by the de Jong-Gierveld question-
naire [12]. On Cantril’s ladder, participants assess their own
well-being by giving a mark between 1 and 10, where 1 is the
worst possible well-being and 10 the best. The de Jong-
Gierveld questionnaire consists of 11 items on perceived
loneliness, where higher scores indicate more loneliness.
Sample Size
We estimated that 86 participants in each group would be
needed to detect a three-point difference (SD, 7 points) on
the GARS (a, 5%; b, 80%). At age 85, a difference of three
points in the GARS score represents a difference in
functioning of about 2 y. The group size would need to be
193 to detect a two-point difference. We considered these
calculations to be conservative since the primary analysis
would be performed on repeated measurements.
Randomisation Procedures
The randomisation sequence was generated with a compu-
terised pseudorandom number generator and consisted of
balanced blocks of size six. For each possible participant, the
treatment allocation was inserted in a sealed envelope by
administrative study personnel otherwise not involved in the
trial. For participating individuals, the envelope was opened
at the end of the baseline visit. For nonparticipating
individuals, the envelope remained closed, something that
was checked by the administrative study personnel after the
return of the research nurse to the study centre. This
procedure ensured concealed treatment allocation.
Statistical Analysis
All cross-sectional association were assessed by cross-tabu-
lation of dichotomous variables and by t-tests or the Mann–
Whitney U test for continuous variables. Effects of the
intervention at a single time point relative to control were
assessed with a t-test on the difference between the outcome
measure at that time point and the baseline measurement.
The difference between intervention and control at all time
points was assessed with linear mixed models. All analyses
were performed using the intention-to-treat principle. p-
Values of ,0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Participant Flow
Figure 1 shows the ﬂow of the 633 participants who were
assessed for trial eligibility. A total number of 231 individuals
could not be randomised into the trial. The most frequent
reason for nonparticipation pertained to the individuals’ not
meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the 402 participants who
were randomised, 105 participants did not complete the trial,
death being the main reason for not completing. Dropout was
well balanced between the two study groups. Patients who did
not complete the trial were similar to completers in terms of
sex, income, and feelings of loneliness, but they were
signiﬁcantly more often living in a single household (74 of
105 versus 177 of 297; p ¼ 0.048) and had worse functional
performance (GARS scores of 20.1 versus 18.0; p ¼ 0.003).
These differences disappeared when we excluded the
deceased participants from this analysis.

were not statistically different on any of the baseline
characteristics. In both groups, about two thirds were female,
while about 60% were living in a single household.
Description of Occupational Therapy Intervention
Of the 202 participants randomised to occupational therapy,
55 participants declined the proposed intervention. This
means they turned down the visit of the occupational
therapist, although they agreed to stay in the study to
perform the follow-up measurements. A description of all
interventions that were provided to the 147 participants who
were visited by the occupational therapist has been published
elsewhere [13]. In short, 138 of the 147 participants (94%)
already owned at least one assistive device in one or more
domains. The total number of assistive devices was 591, of
which 344 related to mobility, two related to meal prepara-
tion, and 245 related to personal care. The 147 participants
used a total of 125 community-based services in the three
domains (n¼52, 32, and 41, respectively). Moreover, as judged
by the occupational therapist, 66 of the 147 participants
(45%) needed an intervention in one or more domains: 50
participants needed one or more mobility-related interven-
tions, six participants needed one or more interventions
related to the preparation of meals, and 34 participants
needed one or more interventions related to personal care.
At the end of the study, the 66 participants who needed an
intervention had obtained 44 new assistive devices and ﬁve
community-based services.
Study Outcome
Table 2 lists the increase in various outcome measures of
study participants between baseline and 6 mo and between
baseline and 24 mo. There was a decrease in performance
after 6 mo, as indicated by an increase in GARS score, in both
the intervention group (2.1 points; SE 0.4; p , 0.001) and the
control group (1.8 points; SE 0.4; p , 0.001). The 0.3-point
difference between the two groups was not statistically
signiﬁcant (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.40; p ¼ 0.56). There was also
no difference between study groups for any of the secondary
outcome measures. Moreover, all differences between study
groups at 24 mo were also not signiﬁcant (Table 2).
Figure 2 shows the estimated increase in the GARS score
over the whole study period using linear mixed models.
Again, GARS scores increased progressively in both study
groups, with no difference between intervention and control
group. During follow-up, there was a progressive increase in
disability in the intervention group (mean annual increase,
2.0 points; SE 0.2; p , 0.001) and control group (mean annual
increase, 2.1 points; SE 0.2; p , 0.001). The increase in
disability was not signiﬁcantly different between study groups
(0.08 points; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.2; p ¼ 0.75).
DISCUSSION
We performed a large randomised controlled trial to assess
whether unsolicited occupational therapy in high-risk com-
munity-dwelling elderly people can decelerate the increase in
disability. Although a substantial number of assistive devices
and community-based services were implemented, the inter-
vention did not reduce the decrease in functional perform-
ance.

Occupational Therapy in Elderly People

........................................................................................
Interpretation
There may be a number of reasons why we found no
beneﬁcial effect of our intervention. First, of the 202
participants randomised to occupational therapy only, 147
participants agreed to receive the intervention. This means
that 55 participants declined the intervention. Because we
analysed our results on an intention-to-treat basis, these 55
participants might actually have diluted a possible beneﬁcial
treatment effect. However, excluding them from the analysis
would have introduced bias because it is unlikely that the
group of participants who declined the intervention is a
random sample of the total group. Second, of the 147
participants who were visited by an occupational therapist,
less than half actually had an indication for an intervention.
This means that this group of 85-y-olds can be considered
well equipped, although there is room for further improve-
ment. Third, not all participants for whom an intervention
was indicated complied with the proposed intervention. In
most cases, those who did not comply either felt they were
confronted with a problem for which they did not experience
having a problem or felt it was not necessary to solve the
problem. In either of these cases, no action was taken by the
participants.
We have previously reported the results of an unsolicited
auditory rehabilitation programme for 85-y-old community-
dwelling elderly people with untreated severe hearing loss
[14]. In that study, the majority of participants declined
auditory rehabilitation because they did not perceive the use
of a hearing aid as necessary in order to function on a daily
basis. Those who expected beneﬁts from a hearing aid had
already obtained one. A similar reasoning probably holds for
the present study, in which occupational therapy was offered
to the same age group. Those elderly people who expected to
beneﬁt from a certain assistive device or community-based
services probably had already obtained them. This became
apparent in the distribution of assistive device and commun-
ity-based services that were already present (591 and 125,
respectively) versus the assistive device and community-based
services that were obtained (44 and ﬁve, respectively).
During the study, 52 participants died. Based on the 2001
mortality ﬁgures of the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics
(http://www.cbs.nl), we computed that 82 deaths were ex-
pected in this age group during the 2 y of follow-up.
Therefore, the total number of deaths during our study
should be interpreted as low. This lower mortality was
probably caused by our inclusion criteria of participants
with good cognitive function who were living independently.
Since death was equally distributed over the study groups,
this is unlikely to have inﬂuenced our result. Moreover, we
accounted for study dropouts, including deaths, by analysing
our data with a linear mixed model.
Generalisability
We think that the population included in our study is a good
representation of the population that would have beneﬁted
from the intervention, had it been efﬁcacious. This is clear
from the inclusion criteria for the trial: participants reaching
the age of 85, living in their own home, and with an MMSE
score above 18 points. Moreover, of the 633 participants who
were approached, 402 (64%) participated. For the 231
participants who did not participate in the trial, the reason
given by the majority (n ¼ 130) pertained to not meeting the
inclusion criteria.
Overall Evidence
A recent systematic review of the efﬁcacy of occupational
therapy for community-dwelling elderly people found that
occupational therapy is beneﬁcial [2]. However, this system-
atic review included only one small study in 85-y-olds who
already had one or more disabilities in activities in daily
living [3]. To our knowledge, we here report the ﬁrst
randomised trial assessing the possible beneﬁt of unsolicited
occupational therapy in 85-y-olds.
CONCLUSION
Traditionally, very elderly people who do not have the
optimal number of assistive devices and community-based
services to maintain their functional ability are considered
exempliﬁcations of the ‘‘inverse care law’’. However, condi-
tional on a well-organised healthcare system, very elderly
people apparently do not solely depend on active case-
ﬁnding and close surveillance. Instead, they seem to carefully
plan the timing of their adaptations to maintain their
functional abilities. We think that future elderly people will
probably exhibit more of the phenomenon of making
independent decisions on the use of assistive devices and
community-based services. Therefore, we conclude that
unsolicited offering of assistive devices and community-based
services to high-risk 85-y-old participants does not decelerate
the increase in disability over time.
