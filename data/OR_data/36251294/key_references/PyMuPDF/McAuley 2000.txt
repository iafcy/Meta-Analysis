An additional important implication of these findings
concerns issues of adherence to physical activity regi-
gains. The research on such issues has been sparse,
with few studies concentrating on nonaerobic forms of
mens. The stretching and toning condition, as well as
having positive effects on SWB, may also prove to be

the effects of such activities as tai chi on elements of

It was of further interest in this study to determine
quency. In the case of satisfaction with life, we see that
the extent to which social relations developed within
both frequency of physical activity and changes in social
support play a role in changes over the 6-month inter-
vention and the 6-month follow-up periods. That is,
individuals who exercised more frequently during the
exercise intervention, regardless of mode of activity,
and who realized greater improvements in social sup-
port over the intervention period had significantly
greater improvements in satisfaction with life. It is im-
portant to note that satisfaction with life remains rela-
tively stable across age despite changes in physical and
material resources [45]. That physical activity partici-
pation might enhance what is considered to be a rela-
tively stable, but important element of overall health-
related quality of life is underscored when we examine
the pattern of relationships postintervention. As noted
earlier, satisfaction with life declined at follow-up, as
did the other elements of SWB. However, these declines
appear to be attenuated by having been more active
and having improved social support during the exercise
program. What is interesting about these findings is
that the shape and form of the SWB growth pattern
are, as one would expect, curvilinear. That declines in
SWB are attenuated by physical activity participation
