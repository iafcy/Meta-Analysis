ABSTRACT. Background and aims: According to the
concepts of ‘use it or lose it’ and cognitive reserve,
cognitively challenging activities may boost cognitive abil-
ities in older adults. Using computers and the internet
provides divergent cognitive challenges to older per-
sons, and the positive effects of computers and internet
use on the quality of life have been found in earlier stud-
ies. Methods: We investigated whether prolonged guid-
ed computer use by healthy older adults (64-75) may be
beneficial to cognitive ability in a randomized con-
trolled study. The intervention consisted of brief train-
ing and subsequent use of a personal computer with an
internet connection at home for a 12-month period. 191
participants were randomly assigned to three groups: In-
tervention, Training/No intervention, or No training/No
intervention. A fourth group consisted of 45 participants
with no interest in computer use. The effect of the in-
tervention was assessed by a range of well-established
cognitive instruments that probed verbal memory, in-
formation processing speed, and cognitive flexibility. Da-
ta were collected at baseline and after four and twelve
months. Results: Intensive interaction with a personal
computer with standard software applications had no ef-
fect on cognitive measures; no differences in changes in
cognitive parameters over time were found between
groups. Conclusion: Learning to use a computer and
the internet does not benefit healthy, community-
dwelling older adults with respect to many domains
of cognitive functions. The implications of these findings
for future studies that use cognitive challenge to coun-
teract usual cognitive aging are discussed.

ences between several age groups, ranging from young
adulthood to old age, in inductive reasoning, spatial ori-
entation, perceptual speed and verbal memory, but not in
numeric and verbal abilities. An important question, how-
ever, is whether this decline in many cognitive abilities is
reversible when potential causative factors are manipu-
lated. Several studies have suggested that engagement in
cognitively challenging activities is associated with main-
tenance or even improvement of cognitive skills and
seems to protect against age-related cognitive decline. For
instance, Hultsch et al. (3) found a positive relationship be-
tween changes in participation in intellectually engaging
activities and changes in cognitive functioning in middle-
aged and older adults who were tested three times in six
years. Comparable observations were made by Wilson et
al. (4), who found that the rate of cognitive decline of peo-
ple aged 65 and older in 4.5 years decreased for each ad-
ditional cognitive activity they reported to be engaged in
(defined as activities requiring ‘information processing
capacity’). Also, participants in the Bronx Aging Study,
aged 75 and older, who engaged more often in activities
such as reading and playing games, demonstrated a low-
er risk of developing dementia (5). In other studies, more
general measures of activity, such as participation in ev-
eryday mental, social or physical activities, were found to
be associated with protection from cognitive decline
(e.g., 6, 7). These studies all suggest that intellectual and
cognitively challenging activities are related to the preser-
vation of cognitive capacity.
Results such as those described above suggest that
cognitive functioning can be improved by promoting the
participation of older persons in cognitively challenging ac-
tivities. This idea is in line with Swaab’s ‘use it or lose it’
principle (8), which is based on neurobiological findings in
animals that the use of neurons and neuronal networks
prolongs the efficiency of central nervous system (CNS) ac-
tivity during life. According to Swaab, candidate factors to

stimulate the CNS may originate from within the organ-
ism, but also from the environment. When the notion of
‘use it or lose it’ is translated to a functional level, this
would imply that mental stimulation can counteract the re-
duced efficiency of higher brain functions that come with
age. This has actually been found in several animal stud-
ies in which enriched or challenging environments proved
to be beneficial to cognitive functioning in aged laboratory
animals (e.g., 9, 10). Such findings are not only consistent
with the ‘use it or lose it’ notion, but also to the concept
of cognitive reserve, which assumes that individuals with
more elaborate cognitive strategies are better protected
against symptom onset following brain damage (11).
Several examples of interventions that specifically tar-
get cognitive capacities of older adults have been de-
scribed in the literature. Such studies involved memory
training (e.g., 12, 13) or mnemonic techniques (14, 15),
all of which had positive effects on memory performance
to a variable extent. Apart from memory, other cognitive
abilities, such as reasoning, spatial orientation and speed
of processing (15, 16) have been taught successfully and
shown to improve in older adults.
The studies cited above suggest that cognitive functions
in older adults can be improved with specific, dedicated in-
terventions. However, in order to function independent-
ly in everyday life, multiple cognitive functions are drawn
upon. For instance, a daily activity such as grocery shop-
ping involves planning (how to get to the grocery store),
memory (which items to buy), information processing
(e.g., recognition: “identifying products in the store”,
selective attention: “which of the items in the store shelve
are relevant”, decision-making: “which of the items to
choose to buy”), etc. Therefore, to stimulate cognitive abil-
ities known to deteriorate with age in a more general fash-
ion, interventions that target multiple cognitive domains
simultaneously may be called for (12).
The use of the internet may qualify as a candidate ac-
tivity in a multifactorial intervention. It provides an intel-
lectually challenging activity which is intrinsically re-
warding, because internet-based services may have par-
ticular benefits for older persons (e.g., 17, 18). In order to
use internet services such as web surfing or e-mail, many
of the cognitive abilities that are drawn upon for everyday
functioning are recruited. Therefore, through the internet,
one may use the same cognitive functions that are re-
quired to execute everyday tasks (such as memory for re-
membering errands, attention to focus on a particular task,
etc.). In terms of “use it or lose it”, by using cognitive func-
tions during computer and internet use, deterioration of
cognitive functions that are essential to everyday tasks due
to age-related decline may be prevented. For instance,
long-term or procedural memory is required to repro-
duce the routines needed to use a computer program, e.g.,
to launch a web browser, and to execute specific com-
mands in that browser. Short-term memory, or working
memory, is activated to keep track of information al-
ready attended or to decide on the next action to take. Ex-
ecutive functions come into play in order to sort necessary
actions into the correct order. Visual search, information
processing and attentional processes are recruited in order
to find relevant cues, to evaluate which information on a
web page is relevant within a given context, and to focus
on those cues while ignoring or inhibiting irrelevant cues.
Furthermore, Stronge et al. (19) mention the importance
of problem-solving ability and concept formation, which is
essential for building a mental framework of computer-re-
lated knowledge representations. Spatial orientation is
also considered an important ability for web surfing, in or-
der to keep track of one’s location in cyberspace (20).
Very few attempts have actually been made to study
the impact of computer and internet use on the cognitive
abilities of older adults. Several broader studies show
that psychosocial measures, such as self-confidence,
loneliness, social interaction, satisfaction with life and
depression, could improve as a result of learning to use
computers and the internet (e.g., 17, 18). A limited
number of studies have actually focused on the impact of
computer and internet use on cognitive functioning as the
primary outcome. McConatha et al. (21) showed that, in
a small sample (n=14) of long-term care residents aged be-
tween 59 and 89, the score on the Mini-Mental State Ex-
amination (MMSE; a broad omnibus test of cognitive
function) and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and de-
pression scores improved after using an on-line com-
puter service for six months. This service consisted of e-
mail, access to a digital encyclopedia, bulletin boards,
games, and other educational and recreational applica-
tions. Comparable results were found in a subsequent
study, in which 29 nursing home residents aged 50 and
older were divided into a computer training group and a
control group (matched in terms of ability to take care of
daily needs, cognitive functioning and depression level)
(22). Participants in the training group used the same on-
line computer service as had been used in the previous
study, and those in the control group participated in
regular nursing home recreational and educational activ-
ities. After six months of using the computer service,
participants in the computer training group had im-
proved in MMSE, ADL and depression scores, whereas
the control group remained unchanged. In sum, circum-
stantial evidence indicates that learning to use a computer
and the internet in later life may have beneficial effects on
the cognitive ability of older individuals. However, a
number of factors may affect the results of internet-
based intervention studies such as described above. For in-
stance, as participation in such an intervention is on a vol-
untary basis, selection bias may have occurred, i.e., the
fact that individuals are interested in information tech-
nology may affect the outcome variables of the study
for example, as a result of differences in motivation with

respect to task performance. There may also have been
an effect of computer training apart from the actual sub-
sequent period of computer use. Therefore, one should
account for both the effect of initial computer training and
participants’ interest in learning to use these facilities in or-
der to be able to study exclusively the effect of using
computers and the internet for a period of time. To
date, systematic studies on this topic are not available.
Because many of the above-mentioned cognitive abil-
ities needed to use the internet decline with advancing age
(for an extensive overview, see ref. 1) and as information
technologies are often unfamiliar to older adults, it is to be
expected that using the internet provides a cognitive
challenge to older people. We hypothesize that engaging
in such a cognitively challenging activity will stimulate old-
er adults to develop more efficient cognitive skills and (al-
ternate) strategies for daily life task requirements. If
proven successful, this study may support the notion
that age-related cognitive decline can be counteracted by
aspecific mobilization of cognitive resources.
We conducted a randomized controlled intervention
study to test the above-mentioned hypothesis. A large
group of participants with interest in computer usage
was recruited from the general population and randomly
assigned to three conditions in which a cognitive challenge
(an intervention consisting of computer and internet use
for twelve months) was present or not present. In addition,
a fourth group with no interest in computers or the in-
ternet was recruited, to check for several sources of po-
tential confusion. A comprehensive test battery consisting
of standard tests of several domains of cognitive func-
tioning was administered at baseline and after four and
twelve months. This design enables a systematic ap-
proach to the question whether complex cognitive activ-
ity that is practised on a regular basis in daily life can be
beneficial to the cognitive function of older persons.
METHODS
Participants
For the present study, we aimed at recruiting 240 par-
ticipants in four separate groups. Invitation flyers were
randomly sent to older adults from the Maastricht city
register. Participants were included in the study if they
were aged between 64 and 75, considered themselves to be
healthy, and were sufficiently mobile to travel indepen-
dently to the research center. Exclusion criteria were prior
experience with any of the neuropsychological tests used in
this study and general mental functioning in a range sug-
gesting possible cognitive disorder (score below 24 on the
MMSE) (23). Also, participants were to have no prior active
computer experience and be willing to refrain from com-
puter use or computer lessons for the duration of this
study (i.e., twelve months). Both participants with and
without interest in learning to use computers and the in-
ternet were asked to respond to the flyer by returning an ap-
plication card for more detailed information. On this card
they could indicate by ticking one of two options whether
they were interested in learning to use the internet or not
(but were willing to participate). All participants signed a
form stating that they would refrain from any self-initiated
computer use during the study, and signed an informed con-
sent form. The Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht Uni-
versity Hospital approved the study.
It was decided that exposure to the intervention was to
be compared with three control groups. Two groups
consisted of individuals with interest in learning to use the
internet, as was the case with individuals in the inter-
vention group. One of these two groups received the
same training as those in the intervention group. The oth-
er group was not trained in computer or internet skills.
These two control groups made it possible to control for
training effects. The third control group consisted of in-
dividuals without any interest in computers or internet use,
but who were willing to participate in the study. Partici-
pants who were interested were randomly assigned to the
Intervention, Training/No Intervention or No Train-
ing/No Intervention Groups.
Procedure
A total of 6054 individuals received the flyer, and
1016 (16.8%) persons applied for more detailed infor-
mation. After reading it, 366 (36.0%) individuals who
were interested in participation called the research center
for a screening interview by telephone. Two hundred
and forty individuals (65.6%) were eligible for the study and
were scheduled for two baseline administrations of a cog-
nitive test battery. This dual baseline administration (with
one to two weeks in between) was applied to minimize pro-
cedural learning of the tests during the intervention period.
Cognitive data from the first baseline measurement were
discarded. One hundred and twenty-six people (34.4%)
were excluded from the study because of: computer ex-
perience, n=54; health-related problems, n=14; experience
with tests from the test battery, n=11; they were not will-
ing to refrain from computer use during the study, n=4; no
cable TV connection at home (required for the internet con-
nection) or lack of space for a personal computer, n=2; or
no specific reason, n=41. After the first baseline adminis-
tration, four participants dropped out of the study due to
health problems, being ‘too busy’, put off by the test pro-
cedure, or a score of below 24 on the MMSE. The test bat-
tery was administered again after four and twelve months,
with parallel test versions. A questionnaire was also ad-
ministered on all three test occasions.
Initial recruitment did not yield sufficient participants for
the control group, so again an invitation was sent to
585 new people from the municipal registry to recruit on-
ly additional participants who were not interested in
computers and the internet. After these two recruitment
procedures, the number of participants in the control

group after baseline was kept at 45.
Participants who were interested in learning to use
computers and the internet (n=191) were randomly as-
signed to one of two conditions: two-thirds of the par-
ticipants (n=123, 64.4%) received brief training; and
one-third (n=68, 35.6%) did not receive this training
and were assigned to the No training/No intervention
Group.
Participants in the training condition were scheduled for
three four-hour training sessions over a period of two
weeks. In these sessions, a maximum of six participants
were introduced to and could practice with, a personal
computer (Apple) and its operating system, customary
software applications (e.g., a word processor), and several
internet applications (e.g., an internet browser and e-mail).
The training sessions were supervised by two teachers with
high levels of proficiency in internet applications, the
system software, and providing technical support. Each
teacher hosted one specific session for each training
group (either focusing on the computer operating system
and software skills or on internet applications). The
teachers alternately supervised the final practice session.
Participants received general information and were in-
structed on how to perform basic computer and internet
assignments from a custom-made course book. Ample
time was available at each meeting to practise with several
applications according to participants’ own aspirations. Af-
ter this training, participants were randomly assigned to
one of two conditions: half (n=62) were assigned to the In-
tervention Group and the other half (n=61) to the Train-
ing/No intervention Group. No data were collected with
respect to training activities.
After training, individuals in the Intervention Group re-
ceived a personal computer with a broadband internet
connection in their homes. They were instructed to use it
according to their personal needs. These needs were
not specified or assessed. In training, participants re-
ceived demonstrations of several purposes for which the
internet could be used (e.g., e-mail contact with family and
friends, finding hobby-related information, finding open-
ing hours, public transport time schedules, phone num-
bers, etc.). Internet-related assignments (once every two
weeks in the first four months; once every month in the
remaining period of the study) and a helpdesk were
used to motivate participants and to stimulate computer
use. Table 1 shows the 16 assignments participants re-
ceived by e-mail. They were asked to respond to them by
replying to the e-mail. These assignments were thus
useful in monitoring the progress of participants with re-
spect to their computer abilities. When no response
was received, participants were contacted, to encourage
them to keep checking their mailbox and to complete
each assignment. At the same time, participants were giv-
en suggestions of potentially interesting purposes of the
internet.
In short, the procedure was identical for participants in
the various groups from several viewpoints: all participants
were administered the same test battery and question-
naires at baseline, and after both 4 and 12 months. Also,
participants in all three No-Intervention Groups had to re-

containing one red button and five white buttons, laid out
in a semicircle around the red button. Participants were
asked to hold down the red button with the index finger
of the preferred hand as long as no white button was lit.
As soon as one of the white buttons lit up, participants
were to release the red button and then press the lit
button (or a button adjacent to it) as quickly as possible. Af-
ter this, the red button had to be held down again. The
MCRT involved three conditions. In the first (simple re-
action time), only the upper white button was lit. In the
second condition (choice reaction time), one of the three
upper buttons was lit. In the third condition (incompatible
choice reaction time), one of the three upper buttons was
lit, but the button immediately to the right of the lit button
was to be pressed. Two variables were of interest for the
frain from using computers during the twelve months
of the study.
Nineteen participants (8.1%) dropped out before the 4-
month follow-up, and six participants (2.5%) were not
available for the 4-month follow-up measurements (one
participant was absent for a long time; one did not like the
tests and questionnaires, one was disappointed by the ran-
domization result; one was too worried about personal
memory performance; one could not be reached; and one
gave no reason). Another thirteen participants (6.0%)
dropped out before the 12-month follow-up measure-
ments. Participants gave various reasons for dropping out
[time constraints (n=7), health problems (n=5), disap-
pointed about randomization (n=5), partner’s health
problems (n=2), partner died (n=2), bought/received
computer (n=2), private/family problems (n=2), being
absent for a long time (n=1), died (n=1), moved away
(n=1), computer training was too much (n=1), and other
reasons (n=3)].
Thus, baseline tests were administered to 236 partic-
ipants and complete follow-up data were available for 204
participants. A few participants did not complete all
questionnaires, which resulted in Cognitive Failure Ques-
tionnaire (CFQ) data of 231 participants at baseline and
complete follow-up data for 196 participants. Post hoc
power analyses on the available number of participants
with complete follow-up data, with a medium critical ef-
fect size of 0.15 and an alpha level of 0.05, resulted in a
power of 0.99 for this study (24). The participant flow
chart of the study is shown in Figure 1.
Outcome measures
To study several dimensions of cognitive functions, we
chose to include a broad array of well-established cogni-
tive tests that were derived from several large-scale lon-
gitudinal studies (25, 26).
Verbal memory. The Visual Verbal Learning Test
(VVLT) (27) was used to measure verbal memory and
learning. In this test, 15 monosyllabic low-associative
words are presented one after another on a computer
screen. After the presentation, participants are asked to re-
call as many words as possible without any time or order
constraint (immediate recall). This procedure was repeat-
ed five times with the same list of words. Twenty minutes
after the recall of the fifth trial, participants are again
asked to recall as many words as possible (delayed recall).
The score in the first trial of the immediate recall,
sum of the scores in the first three trials and delayed re-
call scores were used in this study. In addition, the dif-
ference between the maximum scores in any of the five
trials and the scores in the first trial was used as an indi-
cation of verbal learning capacity.
Psychomotor speed. To measure psychomotor speed,
the Motor Choice Reaction Time test (MCRT) (28) was
added. This test is administered with a six-button panel,

purposes of this study. First, the difference between the
median response times of the second and first conditions
was used as an indication of response selection. Sec-
ondly, a measure of inhibition of a prepotent response
(29) was provided by the difference between the third and
second conditions.
General cognitive speed. The Letter-Digit Substitu-
tion Test (LDST) (30) was used to measure the speed of
processing general information. This test is a modification
of the Symbol-Digits Modalities Test (31). A code is pro-
vided at the top of a sheet of paper that couples the num-
bers 1 to 9 with random letters. Participants were asked
to fill in on the rest of the sheet as many corresponding
numbers as possible in boxes that contained only letters
in 90 seconds.
Cognitive flexibility. The Concept Shifting Test (CST)
(32) was used to measure cognitive flexibility. This test
consists of three sheets of paper with 16 small circles that
are grouped within a larger circle. On the first sheet, num-
bers appear in the small circles in a fixed random order.
Participants are asked to cross out these numbers in the
right order as fast as possible. Instructions for the second
sheet were identical to those for the first, except that now
letters appear in the circles. On the third sheet, partici-
pants had to alternate between numbers and letters. The
time needed to complete each of the sheets was record-
ed. The mean of the scores for the first and second
sheets was used as a measure of simple speed, and the dif-
ference between the score for the third sheet and the
mean of the scores for the first and second sheets was
used as an estimate of the slowing due to the shifting be-
tween two concepts (numbers and letters), i.e., cognitive
flexibility.
Attention. The Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT) (33)
was used as a measure of selective attention and sus-
ceptibility to interference. The test contains three cards.
On the first card, color names are printed in four lines of
ten words each. Participants are asked to read the names
aloud as fast as possible. On the second card, colored
patches are printed in the same layout as the words on the
first card. Here, participants are asked to name the color
of each of the patches as fast as possible. On the third
card, color names are printed in incongruously colored
ink. Participants have to name the color of the ink the
words were printed in as fast as possible. The time need-
ed to complete each of the cards was recorded. Two vari-
ables were computed: the mean of the scores for the first
two cards as an indication of simple speed, and the dif-
ference between the score for the third card and the
mean of the scores for the first and second cards (inter-
ference score) was used as a measure of the capacity to in-
hibit a habitual response (reading the word), which reflects
selective attention.
Cognitive failures. The Cognitive Failure Question-
naire (CFQ) (34) was included to measure subjective cog-
nitive functioning. It has been validated and adapted for
the use in a Dutch population (35). This questionnaire
consists of 25 items that measure the frequency of failures
within several cognitive domains (e.g., attention, memo-
ry and planning) rated on a five-point scale. The sum of
the scores for these items was used as the dependent vari-
able, a higher score indicating more cognitive failures.
Measures of computer use. To measure the actual
involvement of individuals in the Intervention Group in
computer-related activities at both the 4-month and 12-
month follow-up moments, participants were asked to in-
dicate how many hours per week they had used the
computer and the internet. These questions were asked
retrospectively at the end of the follow-up tests. That is,
participants were not asked to keep a continuous record
of their computer use because this might have intruded
with their experience of normal computer use. We chose
to rely on self-report data instead of logging participants’
computer use for two reasons. First, without asking par-
ticipants for log-in names or passwords, it was not possible
to separate their computer use from the use of potential
other users, such as spouses or visiting grandchildren. Sec-
ond, when logging computer use, we would have had to
inform participants of this, which may have affected the
way the computer was used during the study.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version
11 for Apple Macintosh. ANOVAs and Chi-square tests
were conducted for baseline comparisons of all dependent
variables, the MMSE score and demographic variables
(age, sex, education and income as a measure of socio-
economic status) in order to study differences between the
four groups. General Linear Model (GLM) with repeated
measures analysis of variance was used to study the effect
of the intervention. Analyses were conducted with group
as between-subject variable (four levels: Intervention,
Training/No intervention, No training/No intervention,
Control Group) and time as a within-subject variable
(three levels: second baseline, 4-month follow-up, and 12-
month follow-up). Contrasts were defined to compare
changes in performance over time (between the three
measurements) of the four groups. Age, level of education,
sex, and monthly income were used as covariates. We
were especially interested in the interaction of time and
group, as this interaction shows whether the groups dif-
fered from one another with respect to changes in the de-
pendent variables, for example, as a result of the inter-
vention. The data of participants who completed all
measurements of the particular test were included in the
analyses. Therefore, the number of complete cases is not
exactly identical for all measures. All analyses were re-
peated with only the individuals in the Intervention Group,
to account for the extent of computer use. In these anal-
yses, the between-subject variable ‘extent of computer use’

had two levels: light and heavy. This variable was calcu-
lated by a median split method on the number of hours
per week participants said they used their computers at
the 12-month follow-up. In this case, the median was 7.5
hours, so that participants who reported using their com-
puters 7 hours per week or less were labeled ‘light users’
and those who reported using them 8 hours per week or
more were ‘heavy users’. All variables included in the anal-
yses were first checked for normal distributions, missing
values and outliers. Distributions were considered suitable

for the analyses. All analyses were carried out with and
without extreme values and also with replacement of
extreme values by the highest value in the normal range.
All statistical analyses were performed with p=0.05 as sig-
nificance level.
RESULTS
Baseline comparisons
At baseline, the four groups did not differ with respect
to age, sex, level of education, monthly income or MMSE
score. When participants who were interested in the in-
tervention were compared with participants who were not
interested, differences were found with respect to the
MMSE scores (F(1,231)=4.321, p=0.04) and the CFQ
(F(1,226)=4.118, p=0.04): interested participants had
lower MMSE scores but reported fewer cognitive fail-
ures. These differences were not found in analyses in
which participants who dropped out had been removed
from the sample.
Baseline comparisons of participants who dropped
out of the study at some point with participants who
completed all test administrations showed differences in
level of education (F(1,229)=4.129, p=0.04) and the
MMSE score (F(1,234)=4.097, p=0.04) Participants
who dropped out had lower levels of education and a low-
er MMSE score.
Computer use
At the 4-month follow-up measurement, on average
participants reported using their computers 8.7 hours per
week (SD=5.8). At the 12-month follow-up, this average
was 8.3 (SD=6.2) hours per week. The difference be-
tween 4 and 12 months was not statistically significant.
Of the time participants used their computers, they
spent 7.0 (SD=5.6) hours per week on the internet at the
4-month follow-up, and 6.5 (SD=5.6) hours per week at
the 12-month follow-up. Again, the difference between
the two moments of measurement was not statistically
significant.
Effects of intervention
Table 2 gives an overview of the main effects of group
on the three measurements and of the interaction between
group and time. The main effects of group were found for
the summed score on the first three trials of the VVLT,
the flexibility score of the CST, and the simple speed mea-
sure of the SCWT. Pairwise comparisons revealed that
participants in the Intervention Group showed higher
total scores in the VVLT (p<0.01) over time than those in
the Training/No intervention Group. Also, participants in
the Intervention Group showed better flexibility scores in
the CST compared with the Training/No intervention
Group (p<0.01). Lastly, participants in the Training/No
intervention Group were faster in terms of the simple
speed measure of the SCWT compared with the Inter-
vention (p<0.01), the No training/No intervention
(p<0.01) and Control Groups (p=0.01). A group x time
interaction was only found for the verbal learning variable
of the VVLT (F(6,178)=2.196, p=0.04). Post-hoc anal-
yses showed that both Training Groups showed an in-
crease in the verbal learning variable from baseline to 4-
month follow-up measurements, whereas neither No
training Groups showed a decrease (see Fig. 2). The dif-
ference between the Intervention and the No training/No
intervention Groups was significant (p=0.04). No statis-
tically significant main effects of group or significant
group x time interactions were found on any of the oth-
er cognitive measures, nor on the CFQ.
Repeating all analyses with exclusion or replacement of
extreme values did yield comparable results. Also, all
analyses were repeated with only baseline measurements
and 12-month follow-up measurements, as six participants
were not available for the 4-month follow-up (and there-
fore not included in the original analyses). These analyses
again yielded comparable results.
As regards the extent to which participants in the In-
tervention Group used their computers, a significant dif-
ference between light and heavy use at baseline was on-
ly found for the interference variable of the SCWT
(F(1,50)=4.607, p=0.04). Participants who used their
computers 8 hours or more per week had lower inter-
ference scores than participants who used their com-
puters less often. Repeated-measures analyses revealed
main effects of extent of computer use on the first trial of
the VVLT (F(1,41)=10.125, p<0.01), summed score
on the first three trials of the VVLT (F(1,41)=7.578,
p<0.01), verbal learning capacity score of the VVLT
(F(1,41)=5.425, p=0.03) and interference score on the
SCWT (F(1,40)=6.617, p=0.01). Participants who used
their computers more often remembered more words
on the first trial and on the summed score of the first three
trials of the VVLT, and needed less time to inhibit a ha-
bitual response in the SCWT. Instead, participants who
used their computers less often showed higher verbal
learning capacity in the VVLT. In other words, the dif-
ference between the maximum number of immediately re-
called words and the number of recalled words in the first
trial of this group was higher than this difference in the
group of heavy computer users in the Intervention Group.
An interaction effect between the extent of computer
use and time was found for the summed scores of the first
three trials of the VVLT (F(2,46)=3.533, p=0.03), show-
ing that, in the first four months of the intervention, the
summed score of heavy computer users decreased, where-
as that of light users increased (p=0.02). The same was
found for the delayed recall score in the VVLT
(F(2,46)=4.885, p=0.01). Here, the difference in change
between light and heavy users was significant, both be-
tween the 4-month follow-up and baseline measurements
(p=0.02) and also for the period between the 12-month

interaction effect was found in the LDST (F(2,46)=4.300,
p=0.02). Between the 4-month follow-up and baseline

in the number of correctly substituted digits, whereas light

after, between the 4-month and 12-month follow-ups,

DISCUSSION
The main question addressed in this study was whether
an intervention for older adults - in which learning to use
a personal computer and several internet services followed
by the subsequent use of these applications for one year
- has an impact on our measures of cognitive abilities. No
effect of intervention was found on almost all these mea-
sures. A difference in change over time between the
groups was actually found on only one cognitive measure,
i.e., the learning variable of the VVLT. However, this in-
teraction effect between group and time was quite random
and did not appear to be caused by the intervention.
There were also some main effects of group membership
over time but, since no interactions with time were
found, these effects cannot be attributed to the inter-
vention.
We did find some interaction effects when the Inter-
vention group was split into light and heavy computer
users. Again, these effects appeared to be quite random
and could not be attributed to the extent of computer use.
The main effects of group (light vs heavy computer
users) over time indicated that participants who used their
computers 8 hours or more per week had better scores
in trial one of the VVLT, summed score of the VVLT,
and interference score of the SCWT. In other words, par-
ticipants with better verbal memory and better capacities
to inhibit a habitual response (which is an attentional pro-
cess) used their computers more extensively. Instead, par-
ticipants who used their computers less than 8 hours per
week showed better verbal learning scores. This was
probably a result of the fact that these participants re-
membered fewer words in the first trial of the VVLT and
could thus improve more in the following trials, compared
with heavy computer users. These results suggest that
there is a relationship between computer use and cog-
nitive abilities in older adults. However, as the differences
between light and heavy computer users did not change
over time, the intervention did not have an impact on
these cognitive abilities. Rather, it seems that older
adults with better cognitive abilities tend to use a com-
puter more extensively. This relationship between com-
puter use and cognitive abilities was also reflected in the
baseline comparison between participants who were in-
terested in learning to use a personal computer and the
internet and participants with no such interest. Interest-
ed participants reported significantly fewer cognitive
failures in the CFQ compared with participants who
were not interested.
Besides the theoretical background of ‘use it or lose it’
and cognitive reserve, our hypothesis was based on earli-
er studies targeting cognitive functions in older adults,
which showed that these functions improve as a result of
training or intervention (12, 15, 16, 36). One major dif-
ference between these studies and our study which may
have caused differences in findings concerns method-
ological issues. Many studies on cognitive training or in-
terventions have methodological limitations, such as ab-
sence of control groups, small sample sizes and thus low
power, or flaws in the design or psychometric instru-
ments (37). We tried to overcome these flaws by using a
large sample size and a randomized design. Such a design
has major advantages. For example, by including three
control groups, it was possible to study not just the effect
of the intervention. We were also, at least theoretically, able
to distinguish this effect from the effects of training and of
participants’ interest in computers and the internet. It is
possible that individuals who enrolled for the intervention
differ from those who were not interested in the inter-
vention with respect to uncontrolled characteristics that
may also have had an effect on the outcome of this study
(e.g., eagerness to learn, need for social contacts). Our de-
sign made it possible to conclude that finding no effect of
the intervention was unrelated to potential confounders
such as computer training or interest. Also, because of our
design, we were able to control for the social attention to
which the participants of intervention studies are ex-
posed. Since social interactions during training sessions

may have had an effect that is not related to the actual in-
tervention, we included a control group that received the
same training as the Intervention Group.
Our findings do not differ only from findings in studies
targeting specific cognitive functions. There are also a few
earlier studies showing that computer-based interven-
tions similar to ours to some extent did yield positive ef-
fects on several psychosocial (17, 18, 21, 22, 38, 39) and
cognitive measures (21, 22).
There are a number of differences between our study
and the limited number of studies that found effects of an
intervention on cognitive ability measures. The first ma-
jor difference is the study population. Both of the above-
mentioned studies included residents of care facilities,
i.e., not older adults living independently, whereas the par-
ticipants in the present study were. It may be that our
community-dwelling participants had less to gain from the
intervention. Since similar interventions do yield im-
provements of the cognitive abilities of care facility resi-
dents, it is possible that individuals who have functional
limitations may improve as a result of learning to use com-
puters and the internet. Older adults with such limitations,
that is, individuals with a reduction in reserves and an in-
creasing number of losses amongst others within the
cognitive domain, may have more potential to improve
with respect to these losses. For instance, older adults with
memory deficits may improve more as a result of training
memory functions than older adults with normal or high
memory functioning. This is a research topic that could be
explored in future studies, including participants with
fewer optimal cognitive abilities in intervention studies.
However, it should be borne in mind that teaching com-
plex skills, such as operating computers, to older indi-
viduals with cognitive limitations is probably very hard to
accomplish.
A second major difference between our study and
earlier studies using computer-based interventions con-
cerns the measures of cognitive ability. Both of the
above-mentioned studies (21, 22) used a rather general
measure of cognitive ability, the MMSE. In our study,
more specific measures of cognitive functions that tend to
decline with age were included. Because of this, we were
able to study the impact of our intervention on many more
aspects of cognitive functioning compared with the gen-
eral measures used in previous research. Not only did
these objective measures of cognitive abilities not change
as a result of the intervention used in this study, but we did
not find any effect of intervention on reported cognitive
failures, which is a more subjective measure of cognitive
functioning.
Apart from the advantages of the design and method-
ology described above, there are also some limitations to
this study. One explanation for the lack of an effect of our
intervention on cognitive ability is that the intervention did
not challenge the cognitive capacity of our participants suf-
ficiently. This explanation seems less plausible though. The
participants in this intervention study had no prior ex-
perience with using computers and the internet. Ac-
cording to the literature and the self-reports of our par-
ticipants, older adults experience quite some difficulty
in mastering computer skills and using computers and soft-
ware applications. They are slower, make more errors,
and need more steps to reach their goals than individuals
who are younger (e.g., 40). Thus, learning to use com-
puters and the internet requires considerable cognitive ef-
fort from older adults. Another reason why it is not very
plausible to assume that our intervention did not change
the level of cognitive activity of the participants is the fact
that the participants in the Intervention Group used their
computers quite frequently, with an average of more
than 8 hours per week at the end of the intervention pe-
riod. Also, they were encouraged to use the internet by
regular e-mail assignments of increasing difficulty through-
out the study period. Overall, we do not believe that the
intervention was insufficient in providing a true cognitive
challenge for participants.
Also, based on the present study, we are able to con-
clude that using computer and the internet has no effect
on the measures of cognitive functioning used in this
study. However, we cannot rule out that such an inter-
vention has no effect on other aspects of human cognitive
functioning. That is, using computers may be beneficial for
functions such as spatial abilities, visual search, etc. How-
ever, within the scope of the present study, most of the
cognitive functions essential to everyday autonomous
performance were represented in the test battery, for none
of which we did find an effect of the intervention.
Lastly, despite a very strict study design, we were not
able to account for some aspects that might have influ-
enced results. For instance, we cannot rule out the pos-
sibility that the follow-up period of our study was too short
to detect differential changes in cognitive measures over
time. A period of one year may be insufficient to detect
differences in aging patterns, although it does seem to be
long enough to detect differential improvement, as sup-
ported by other cognitive intervention studies with similar
or shorter follow-up durations (e.g., 12, 15, 16, 36).
Another related issue which we are not able to resolve
here, but which may be very relevant for the independent
functioning of older adults, is that older individuals who
have learned to use a computer and the internet have bet-
ter strategies to cope with (cognitive) limitations they
may encounter in later life. As personal computers and the
internet have several promising functions in this respect
(e.g., providing reminders for people with memory prob-
lems, easy contact with health care providers, ordering
groceries for people with mobility restrictions, providing
day schedules, including reminders, for people with de-
clined executive functions, etc.), it is perfectly possible that
older adults who master computer skills have more op-

feasible because of problems such as high expenses and
attrition.
CONCLUSIONS
We did not find any influence of learning to use com-
puters and the internet on a broad range of cognitive abil-
ity measures in a healthy group of independently living
older adults with no prior computer experience. The re-
sults of this study do not support the notion that stimu-
lating the cognitive skills of older community-dwelling
adults actually increases their cognitive abilities. How-
ever, the question whether persons with more evident cog-
nitive impairments have more to gain from such inter-
ventions, if they are able to master the routines that are
necessary for successful computer use, remains unre-
solved. Lastly, another question that remains interest-
ing for future research is whether older adults who have
received timely training in using computers and internet
services remain independent longer when functional lim-
itations start to emerge.
