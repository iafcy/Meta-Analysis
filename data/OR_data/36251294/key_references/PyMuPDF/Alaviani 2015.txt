Abstract
Background: Loneliness is one of the most significant problems during aging. This research has been 
done to determine the effect of a multi-strategy program based on Pender’s Health Promotion model to 
prevent loneliness of elderly women by improving social relationships. 
Methods: In this quasi-experimental study done in 2013 from January to November, 150 old women 
suffering medium loneliness referred to Gonabad urban Health Centers were enrolled. Data were 
gathered using Russell’s UCLA loneliness questionnaire and the questionnaires based on Pender’s 
Health Promotion Model about loneliness. The results were analyzed by descriptive statistics and Chi-
square, T-pair, and independent-T tests through SPSS, version 20. 
Results: Loneliness decreased significantly in the interventional group compared to the control group 
(P<0.00). In addition, mean scores related to variables of Health Promotion Model (received benefits 
and barriers, self-efficacy, interpersonal effectives of loneliness) in both groups were significantly 
different before and after the study (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Constructs of Pender’s Health Promotion Model can be used as a framework for planning 
interventions in order to anticipate, improve and modify related behaviors related to loneliness in 
old women.

Prevention of loneliness in old women
IJCBNM January 2015; Vol 3, No 2
Introduction
According to World Health Organization 
definitions, aging occurs after 60 and causes 
physiological, mental and social changes.1 
During recent years, the number of elderly 
people with increasing life expectancy has 
increased, so that one out of 10 people is more 
than 65 years old.2 According to a census which 
was conducted in 2011, 5.7% of Iran population 
are elderly and this rate is expected to increase to 
19% in 2020.3 Therefore, we can say Iran in the 
current conditions is passing through young to 
elderly people and soon it will join to countries 
with the aging demographics.4 At the beginning 
of oldness, gradually people not only lose 
their physiologic performances but also their 
mental and socials ones, so suffering numerous 
problems such as loneliness.4, 5 Loneliness does 
not mean living lonely; rather, it is felt when 
social interactions got damaged quantitatively 
or qualitatively.6 Since the elderly are faced 
with problems related to social interactions and 
interpersonal relations, many of them define 
aging period as a loneliness period and look at 
it as an unpleasant experience.4 Loneliness is 
a widespread phenomenon and near 25 to 50 
percent of the total world population experiences 
it.7 This is more common among women.8 
And it is an important factor in incidence, 
susceptibility or reinforcement of mental and 
physical diseases related to aging period, such as 
depression, suicide and severe disappointment, 
social isolation, impatience, anxiety, disturbance 
of self-care behaviors, and disruption in physical 
health problems such as disruption in immunity 
system function, nutrition and sleep.6, 8 In order 
to help them cope with  loneliness in elderly 
people, we can use numerous ways such as 
keeping animals,9 Gestalt Group Therapy,10 
cognitive counseling with individual, music 
therapy, telling memories, training society in 
order to change individuals attitudes regarding 
aging period, and drug therapy.11, 12 According 
to Robertsa and Pettigrewa’s research and based 
on interviews with the elderly, two general 
approaches are obtained to prevent and improve 
loneliness:
1- developing social behaviors (in group) 
by focusing on relationships with friends and 
family as an emotional source, and attendance 
in parties as a way to maintain social contacts
2- Focus on developing non-social 
behaviors (individually) by spending a 
definite time for activities like reading and 
gardening.13
Peplau and Perlman prescribe improving 
social behaviors to match with loneliness.14 
Eric et.al in their study recommended using 
operations based on cognitive therapy and 
improving social relations in order to modify 
loneliness. They also concluded in comparing 
using these two methods- active methods of 
coping with loneliness (improving social 
relations) and inactive methods of coping 
with loneliness (reducing expectations about 
social relations and focusing on developing 
individual behaviors)- younger, healthy, 
educated and more confident elderly who had 
a job until midlife usually use these active 
matching methods.15
Experts believe that any attempts which 
lead to removing loneliness in the elderly is an 
obstacle against complicated mental problems 
of the elderly and successful treatment of 
loneliness may decrease the risk of serious 
complications such as depression.11 Due to 
constant contact with the elderly, many of 
health care providers, especially nurses, 
have a unique status in identifying and 
interfering loneliness.3 Studies have shown 
that in comparison with general interventions, 
interventions with individuals needs are more 
effective.16 Nurses use these interventions and 
different models as a performance guide in 
order to plann for changing behaviors and 
health promotion. One of these models is 
Pender’s Health Promotion Model and one 
of its features is intervention based on initial 
assessments.17 Pender provided the first 
version of health promotion model in 1982 and 
it is presented as a framework to assimilate 
nursing and behavioral science attitudes 
about effective factors on healthy behavior 
and as a guid for searching complicated 
mental-biological processes that stimulate 

134 
Alaviani M, Khosravan S, Alami A, Moshki M

individuals to be involved in reinforcing health 
behaviors.18 Health Promotion Model is based 
on social cognitive theory in which cognitive-
perception factors (such as perceived benefits 
and barriers) have influence on involvement 
in health promotion behaviors and adjuster 
factors (like demographic factors, effective 
interpersonal factors, and behavioral factors) 
as a casual interaction factor affecting 
cognitive-perception process, thus indirectly 
determining healthy behaviors.18, 19 This model 
emphasizes health promotion behaviors, 
recognizing behaviors and personal factors 
with increased efficacy and perception, 
reforming and strengthening behaviors and 
improving communication and situations. 
Therefore, this is a model which is potentially 
used during lifetime especially aging period 
when people are more vulnerable for various 
reasons.18 Nurses believe that identifying and 
providing applicable solutions in order to 
health improvement at mental- social domain 
of these people and in this regard reducing 
their loneliness based on these models are 
inevitable. So, this research was done to 
determine the effect of a multi- strategy 
program on developing social behaviors 
based on Pender’s Health Promotion model 
to prevent loneliness of old women referred 
to Gonabad urban Health Centers.
Materials and Methods
This study was a quasi-experimental research 
conducted in 2013 from January to November. 
The statistical population of this study was old 
women between 60-74 years who referred to 
Gonabad urban Health Centers of Gonabad, one 
of east cities of Iran, with a moderate loneliness 
level (35-48) through Russell’s questionnaire; 
they were identified in the first stage of this 
study.20 In this study, we used convenience 
sampling with Balanced Block Randomization 
to guarantee balance in numbers during 
intervention. To do this, 150 Persian speaking 
subjects who met the inclusion, criteria had 
appropriate speaking and listening ability, 
and signed informed consents  were selected 
to participant in this study.  We divided the 
subjects into the intervention and control groups. 
There was a total of 6 blocks with 4 patients in 
each block. Based on previous research3( ), the 
estimated sample volume for this study was 120 
for two groups as below:
By considering the attrition rate (20%) in 
research process, all of these subjects (150) 
who were city dwellers were included in the 
study. Exclusion criteria of this research were 
discontinuing participation, being absent for 
one session, experiencing grief during the 
intervention and follow up phases. These 
criteria led to elimination of 10 subjects 
from the intervention group due to absence 
in educational class or  lack of participation 
in the post-test.  
Data gathering tools included Revised 
loneliness scale questionnaire of UCLA 
(University of California Los Angeles), and 
a six part researcher-made questionnaire 
according to the constructs of pander’s health 
promotion model. 
Revised loneliness scale questionnaire of 
UCLA was made by Russell et al. in 1980. 
This questionnaire consists of 20 questions 
and individuals’ score is gained through the 
sum of all 20 questions. The scoring method of 
this scale includes describing multiple choice 
phrases to be elected by individuals. These 
options are “never”, “rarely”, “sometimes”, 
and “often”. Scoring of the mentioned tool 
is in a way that some of its materials are 
scored reversely. The minimum score is 20 
and maximum 80. Scores between 20-34 
show slight loneliness equivalent with no 
loneliness, about 35-48 is medium loneliness 
and up to 48 is severe loneliness. Reliability 
is reported 0.89 through test- retest method by 
Russell.21 Also, Russell and Ferguson in 1998, 
in another test, have reported its reliability 
about 0.78.22 In Iran, Soudani et.al in a study 
reported stability of this scale 0.81 by using 
Cronbach’s alpha method.23

The researcher-made questionnaire was 
made up of five parts; the first part contained 
demographic characteristics with 7 questions, 
the second  part had 7 questions about 
“Perceived benefits” of loneliness (like I 
am not ok, the others’ trouble becomes less, 
I enjoy my life more than before, my grief 
diminishes), the third  has perceived barriers 
including 14 questions (like I have no friends, 
my social relation is weak, I don’t trust on 
others, nobody is  intimate with me, I don’t 
know myself as a member of my friends 
group), the forth part perceived self-efficacy 
including 6 questions( like I can communicate 
with others, I can take over my grief and 
sorrow, I can find many friends) and based on 
Likert scale each of them are graded through 
4 options – from totally disagree (1 score) to 
totally agree (4 score), and the last part  was 
about  interpersonal influences including 5 
questions (who is your supporter and provider 
for your attendance in friends gathering 
and communicating when you feel lonely?) 
which based on Likert scale it is graded into 4 
options – not at all (0 score), to some extent (1 
score), much (2 score) and very much (3score) 
and total score is calculated through the mean 
scores. In order to evaluate the questionnaire’s 
reliability, we used content validity methods. 
The questionnaire is prepared based on 
health promotion model and according to 
valid scientific resources and also its content 
validity was confirmed by 14 academic 
members. Assessing the questionnaire 
reliability was done using Cronbach’s alpha 
test. The total internal correlation of health 
promotion models questionnaire was 79.5% 
(respectively perceived benefits and barriers 
were 80 and 82%, perceived self efficacy 
79%, and interpersonal influences 82%).
After choosing the subjects, at first a pre-
test was conducted for all of them using the 
researcher made questionnaire; and then 
we analyzed these questionnaires to plan a 
multi-strategy program based on constructs 
Pender’s Health Promotion model (Perceived 
benefits, barriers, self- efficacy, interpersonal 
influences, and behaviors) with the aim of 
reduction of loneliness in the elderly women by 
improving social relationships and efficacy.24 
Then, the subjects were blocked by random 
assignment method and divided into two 
intervention and control groups. In order to 
provide better intervention, the intervention 
group was divided into 3 sub-groups of 25 
subjects. And four sessions (two times in a 
week), each of which lasting for 60 minutes, 
were held by monitoring the first author in 
the conference room of health centers. In this 
intervention and in the first session, by using 
lecture and question-answer methods, the 
two first authors talked about the definitions, 
causes, clinical symptoms and complication 
of loneliness. And at the end, a summary of 
all contents was given to them and they were 
asked to think about this question for the 
next session (when you feel lonely, what do 
you do?). The goal of the second session was 
empowerment of subjects to improve social 
relationship as an important factor to reduce 
loneliness. The section was started by a short 
review on related contents of the previous 
session and discussion about the activities and 
behaviors when feeling lonely. Then Effective 
Interpersonal interaction (like realization of 
expectation of interpersonal interaction with 
family, friends, and neighbors, effective 
techniques to improve interactions with social 
network, trust in others, group formation to 
help others) were explained to them. Finally, 
they considered special practical practices 
to motivate and create self-efficacy in 
subjects with improving social interaction 
(such as group walking, participating in 
Quran meetings, visiting children) and 
they were asked to perform it until the next 
session. In the third and fourth sessions, 
their achievements were checked and if they 
achieved their goal, they were faced with 
positive feedback and the researcher reviewed 
the benefits of practical practices. Then, if 
they did not do their assignment, the barriers 
would be checked and the reprogramming 
deviation would be refined. At the end of the 
fourth session, for their familiarity with public 
places and improving social interactions, the 

136

participants went to nursing home. Between 
these sessions, the first author visited the 
subjects in their house in order to observe 
group works and participant behavior changes. 
A few days later, to increase self-esteem 
and positive self-evaluation, by comparing 
themselves to someone better or worse, the 
subjects visited an elderly nursing home and 
a Children Charity Organization. Finally, 
after one month from the last intervention, 
again research tools were completed by 
the intervention and control samples and 
their scores were considered as a post-test. 
Then, the gathered data were analyzed   in 
SPSS, version 20, after assessing normality 
by P-P PLOT and Q-Q PLOT. In order to 
describe characteristics of research units, 
we used descriptive statistics like frequency 
distribution, mean (standard deviation) and 
also analytic statistical tests such as Chi-
Square, T-paired, and T-independent.
The Institutional Review Board and 
Ethics Committee of Gonabad University of 
Medical Sciences approved the study. Also, 
we explained the aim and process of the study 
to the study participants and guaranteed the 
confidentiality of their personal information. 
We also ensured them that both participation in 
and withdrawal from the study were voluntary. 
Finally, a written informed consent was 
obtained from the entire study participants.
Results
The results of demographic characteristics 
of the two intervention and control groups 
are shown in Table 1. According the Table, 
before the intervention, there were not any 
significant differences between the two groups 
in terms of their marital status, educational 
level, occupation, child number, family status, 
earnings and chronic disease (Table 1).
Loneliness scores are shown in Table 2. 
As shown in this table, the average score of 
loneliness in the intervention group showed 
a significant difference, in comparison with 
the control group after the study (P<0.001)
Results of this study indicated that 
before the intervention there was no 
significant difference in the mean score

of health promotion model constructs 
perceived barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, 
and interpersonal influences in both groups. 
However, after the intervention between the 
two groups in terms of the above variables, 
significant differences were observed 
(P<0.001). In the intervention group, the 
mean score of perceived benefits of loneliness 
(social isolation) was decreased, while the 
mean score of barriers to stop loneliness (to 
increase social contacts), perceived social 
self-efficacy and interpersonal influences 
increased (Table 3).
Interpersonal 
influences 
(supportive 
relationship), which were effective in reducing 
loneliness, were improved in the intervention 
group (Table 4).
Discussion
The aim of this intervention is to study the effect 
of designed intervention based on Pender’s 
Health Promotion Model in order to improve 
social relations in old women with loneliness. 
The results showed that the intervention 
reduced loneliness in the intervention group 
subjects. Although, according to authors’ 
search, there was no similar study about the

effect of intervention based on this model in 
the elderly women who suffered loneliness, in 
line with the results of this study, interventions 
such as telling memories and music therapy 
lad to reduction of loneliness in the elderly 
people; one of its probable reasons is attending 
in groups, stabilizing social connections, and 
extending social networks25 which are the 
aim of the program and intervention in this 
study, as well. Previous studies showed that 
participating in prevention programs of social 
isolation including group discussion sessions 
and sharing experiences among the elderly 
people, and historical and famous places of city 
led to reduction of loneliness, depression and 
mental health of the elderly people.26 And it is 
similar to our results, too. Artnez et.al in their 
study and in line with our results showed that 
participating in active social programs like more 
responsibilities in house chores and encouraging 
to attend in social activities led to reduction of 
loneliness of the elderly in nursing home who 
are between 51-89 years old and recently became 
widow.27 A friendship enrichment program 
that was designed to improve friendship and 
self-esteem of older women based on feminist 
therapy, counseling re-evaluation, and self-help 
method, was successful to reduced loneliness 
in the intervention group.28 Although, similar 
to our study, these interventions decreased 
loneliness in the old women, this research was 
a short term multi-strategy program designed 
according to the participants’ needs, and it 
seems that it is more matched with our culture. 
For example, improving family relations and 
enhancing meaningful activities to promote 
social contact and spending time alone, which 
was suggested in Martina and Stevens’ study as 
a complementary intervention to increase the 
effect of friendship enrichment program, were 
consider in this study.
In addition, the results of this study 
indicated the scores of perceived barriers and 
benefits were decreased in the intervention 
group, while the perceived self-efficacy score 
was increased in this group. The results of 
other research were similar to the results of 
this study in that self-efficacy is one of the 
mental health dimensions the improvement of 
which will enhance people’s health promotion 
behavior.29-32
According the results of this study, the 
mean scores of interpersonal influences 
and frequency of social relations showed 
a significant difference with the control 
group. According to other studies, greater 
perceived availability of social support and 
higher levels of social network relationships 
were significantly related to a lower level of 
loneliness;33 such interventions as increasing 
understanding about receiving social supports, 
improving social behaviors, improving 
interpersonal relations through changing 
lifestyle and unfavorable behaviors will lead 
to reduction of loneliness.32, 34-37
This study had a short  follow-up time 
and also  all of Pender’s constructs of health 
promotion model were not assessed.
Conclusion
The results of this study show that constructs of 
Pender’s health promotion nursing model can be 
used as a framework for planning interventions 
in order to anticipate, improve and modify 
related behaviors in loneliness. Researchers 
have recommended application of this model 
to improve other situations in the mental- social 
domain, especially by community nurses.
