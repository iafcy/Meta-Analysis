Abstract
The Internet (electronic mail and the World Wide Web) may provide new opportunities for communication that can help
older adults avoid social isolation. This randomized controlled trial assessed the psychosocial impact of providing Internet
access to older adults over a five-month period. One hundred volunteers from four congregate housing sites and two
nursing facilities were randomly assigned to receive Internet training or to a wait list control group. The pre & post
measures included the UCLA Loneliness scale, modified CES Depression scale, a measure of locus of control, computer
attitudes, number of confidants, and overall quality of life. Participants received nine hours of small group training in six
sessions over two weeks. Computers were available for continued use over five months and the trainer was available two
hours/week for questions. At the end of the trial, 60% of the intervention group continued to use the Internet on a weekly
basis. Although there was a trend toward decreased loneliness and depression in intervention subjects compared to
controls, there were no statistically significant changes from baseline to the end of trial between groups. Among Internet
users (n = 29) in the intervention group there were trends toward less loneliness, less depression, more positive attitudes
toward computers, and more confidants than among intervention recipients who were not regular users (n = 19) of this
technology. Most elderly participants in this trial learned to use the Internet and the majority continued to use it on a
weekly basis. The psychosocial impact of Internet use in this sample suggested trends in a positive direction. Further
research is needed to determine more precisely, which older adults, residing in which environmental contexts are more
likely than others to benefit from this rapidly expanding information and communication link.
Introduction
Many older adults face barriers to communication,
which impair their ability to gather information and
engage in social interaction. Numerous studies
suggest that social and emotional isolation is associ-
ated with adverse health outcomes and diminished
quality of life (Chappell & Badger, 1989; Dugan &
Kivett, 1994; Mullins et al., 1991; Thompson &
Heller, 1990). Particularly among older individuals,
research indicates that social support network size
(i.e., family members, friends and others with whom
the person interacts) and satisfaction with social
support affect health outcomes including affective
states, such as feelings of depression or loneliness
(Kahn & Antonucci, 1980; Kaplan et al., 1987;
Kaplan & Strawbridge, 1994).
The Internet (i.e., World Wide Web and elec-
tronic mail) is a novel vehicle of communication
that has in recent years become more accessible to
all persons and may provide a means of overcoming
barriers to social interaction for the elderly
(Hutchison, Eastman, Tirrito, 1997; Kubeck et al.,
1999; Post, 1996). Although an age bias against
older adults using computer technology may still
exist (Ryan et al., 1992), increasing numbers of
older adults are beginning to utilize this tech-
nology. A national survey conducted in November
of 1995 found that of older adults aged 55 and
over, 29% reported owning a personal computer
(PC) (Adler, 1996) and, among these PC owners,
28% reported regularly using an on-line service.
The Internet, including e-mail, has the potential
to enhance social support and psychosocial well-
being for many older adults in a variety of ways.
Primarily, older adults can use computers to
communicate frequently, easily and inexpensively
with family and friends who also have access to e-
mail at work or at home. Elders can explore
interests and hobbies through the Internet, or
obtain consumer information and access to
community resources. They can meet new people
with similar interests through chat rooms and
bulletin boards. In addition, the Internet may

provide a novel way to control choices about inter-
actions with others and time use that is not
otherwise available, thus providing more autonomy
for older adults. In essence, relatively isolated and
disabled older adults can reconnect, strengthen and
broaden their connection with the outside world by
incorporating computer technology into their lives.
Only a few attempts have been made to investigate
the role of computers in the lives of older adults.
Early studies simply described the use of computer
games (Riddick et al., 1986; Schueren, 1986;
Weisman, 1983; Zemke, 1986). One very early study
introduced older adult congregate housing residents
to the computer. Investigators observed that the
participants enjoyed the more interactive functions
including a game that simulated a conversation and
the ability to ‘message’ with another computer user
at a distant site (Danowski & Sacks, 1980). Another
study incorporated e-mail and Internet training in a
nursing home setting (McConatha et al., 1994;
McConatha, et al., 1995). While generally showing
positive effects, this study was small and required
intensive one-on-one assistance throughout the
intervention.
In a pilot study of 15 participants from a contin-
uing care retirement community we recently
examined the feasibility and psychosocial impact of
introducing older adults to the World Wide Web
(WWW) and e-mail (White et al., 1999). The
majority of this group of older adults was willing
and eager to learn and utilize this new technology.
In addition to the practical aspects learned from
this feasibility study, we observed a trend towards
decreased loneliness among the 15 participants in
comparison to a group of eight residents from the
community who did not participate in the project.
Based on these findings, the present randomized
trial was undertaken to determine the psychosocial
effects of providing Internet access to older adults.
Methods
Subjects and design
Four congregate housing sites and two nursing
facilities agreed to participate. Each site received
IBM style computers, 386 or better (one site used
Macintosh PerformaTM) and cost-free Internet
service provider access. Donations made to several
sites allowed for the purchase of a printer or other
hardware. Sites were required to pay for phone line
installation and maintenance and to provide a
dedicated secured area where the computers could
be used on a 24-hour per day basis.
Information sessions open to all residents on the
general use of computers and the Internet were
provided at each facility. Volunteers were sought at
these sessions and through posted flyers. All
residents of these communities were eligible to
participate. At the nursing facilities health care
personnel were asked to identify residents whom
they thought had the cognitive ability to partici-
pate. Enrollment began in the autumn of 1996 and
data collection was completed in January 1998. A
total of 100 participants provided informed consent
and entered the trial. At each of the six sites
individual participants were randomly assigned to
either intervention or control group.
There were 51 participants randomized to the
intervention group. Nine participants dropped out
of the training but nevertheless completed the
follow-up interview. Reasons for not completing
training were health problems (n = 7) and insuffi-
cient time (n = 2). One additional participant
dropped out of training and refused to complete
the follow-up interview. One participant died
before the study ended and one participant could
not be tested at the time of the follow-up interview
due to progression of physical illness. A total of 39
intervention participants (76% of the initial 51)
completed training and the follow-up interview
after five months. A total of 48 intervention partici-
pants (94% of the initial 51) were used in the
statistical analysis, including nine who dropped out
of training. Of the 49 participants randomized to
the control group, one participant died, one moved
away, and two were not tested at the time of the
follow-up interview. Therefore, 45 control partici-
pants (92% of the initial 49) were included in the
statistical analysis. Of the 100 participants, 15%
were African-American and 2% were Hispanic.
There were no statistically significant differences
between the intervention and control groups on the
13 demographic variables at baseline (see Table 1).
Although more than 60% in each group rated their
health as good or better, about the same percentage
of participants indicated that their activity was
limited due to their health. Of note, the majority
(> 60% in each arm) of participants had no
previous computer experience.
Intervention
After the baseline interview, subjects were randomly
assigned to one of two study arms: (1) Internet
training; or (2) wait list control. Control subjects
were offered a token gift to compensate them for
waiting five months for training. Intervention
subjects received nine hours of group training (three
two-hour sessions and three one-hour sessions, two
elderly participants per computer with four to six in a
class) over a two-week period, which covered basic
computer operation, use of e-mail, and an introduc-
tion to accessing the WWW. We primarily used
SimeonTM, version 4.1.1, as the electronic-mail inter-
face and a NetscapeTM, version 2.02, browser for the
WWW. A training manual covering these topics was
developed specifically for this study and distributed

to each participant. The trainer was a young college
graduate, well versed in the use of the Internet, who
interacted well with older adults. After the initial
training sessions the computer trainer was available
at each site for about two hours per week to answer
questions and help those who experienced difficulty.
The trainer helped participants find places (websites)
of interest on the WWW and, some participants
agreed to be e-mail pals with middle school students
in Kansas. The trainer also was available at other
times by phone or e-mail. To avoid contamination,
members of the intervention group were asked not to
share what they were learning with members of the
control group. Also, control group members were not
provided access to the computer equipment.
Outcome measures
Interviews were conducted by two trained inter-
viewers, at baseline and follow-up, approximately 20
weeks after training started. Demographic informa-
tion, health status, functional status, and social
contacts (in person, by phone, by letter, or by e-
mail) were collected in addition to the outcome
measures. The UCLA Loneliness scale (Russell
et al., 1980; Russell & Daniel, 1996) recently
revised and validated with a sample of older adults
and used successfully in the feasibility study, was
included in a slightly modified form. The 20 ques-
tions are answered on a four-point scale; the anchors
were modified to read: ‘almost never’, ‘sometimes’,
‘often’, and ‘almost always’ for a more evenly
balanced expression of frequency (Bass et al., 1974).
Scores range from 20–80 with higher scores indi-
cating higher levels of loneliness. A modified form of
the CES-Depression scale was used to assess depres-
sive symptoms (Kohout et al., 1993). The 10
questions utilize a three-point scale (anchors: ‘hardly
ever or never’, ‘some of the time’, ‘much or most of
the time’) with higher scores indicating more depres-
sive symptoms (scale 0–20). A scale previously
validated in an elderly sample was used to measure
Perceived Control of Life Situations using eight
items answered on a four-point scale (1: agree
strongly through to 4: disagree strongly) with higher
scores indicating greater control (range 8–32)
(Eizenman et al., 1997). Attitudes towards personal
computers, the World Wide Web, and electronic
mail were assessed with nine questions scored on a
five-point Likert scale regarding efficacy, interest,
and utility of computers (Jay & Willis, 1992). Scores
on this measure ranged from 9–36; lower scores
indicated more favorable attitudes. A single life satis-
faction item was included with five possible response
categories ranging from ‘not satisfied’ to ‘very satis-
fied’. Subjects also were asked to report the number
of confidants in their lives (none, 1–2, 3 or more). At
baseline participants were asked open-ended ques-
tions with regard to specific goals, concerns, and
benefits they expected as a result of study participa-
tion. At follow-up they were asked whether they had
met their goals, what problems they encountered,
and the benefits they perceived from the interven-
tion. They also were asked to estimate the average
number of hours per week they spent on the
computer using the WWW and e-mail.
Statistical analysis
Baseline differences in general characteristics and
outcome measures were assessed by either the non-
parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous
measures or a Chi Square test for categorical
measures. An intention-to-treat model of analysis
was used to compare the intervention and control
groups (i.e., the full potential of a randomized
control trial to eliminate the influence of baseline
confounding variables is only realized when the
results are examined with all study subjects analyzed
according to their random assignments). Thus,

subjects who did not complete the computer training
but were willing to complete the follow-up interview
were included. Change scores were calculated for
the UCLA Loneliness, modified CES-D, Perceived
Control, and Attitudes Toward Computers scales by
subtracting the baseline score from the follow-up
score. Again, differences in change scores between
the two groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon
rank sum test. For the life satisfaction and confidant
questions change was categorized as better, worse or
unchanged. 
Differences 
in 
change 
categories
between the two groups were assessed using the
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi Square test.
Chi Square tests were used to further evaluate
potential differences in characteristics of the
subgroup in the intervention group who actually
used the technology on a regular basis compared to
the subgroup that did not. The Wilcoxon test was
used to identify differences in outcome measures.
E-mail users were defined as having a non-zero
answer to one or more of three questions stated
‘How many times per week do you communicate
with (your children, other relatives, or friends) on
e-mail?’ WWW users were defined as having a non-
zero answer to the question ‘How many hours a
week do you spend using the World Wide Web or
Netscape?’ Internet users were defined as those
participants using either e-mail or WWW.
Results
Psychosocial outcome measures
At baseline there were no significant differences
between the intervention and control groups on the
outcome measures (see Table 2). The scores on the
modified CES-D scale were quite low indicating few
symptoms of depression and thus not allowing much
room for improvement. As might be expected from a
group of volunteers, the attitudes toward computers
were very positive. Also, life satisfaction was high and
almost all participants had at least one confidant.
There were no statistically significant differences
in the change scores on the outcome measures
comparing the intervention and control groups (see
Table 3). Overall, both groups became less lonely
according to the UCLA Loneliness scale with a
slightly greater tendency towards less loneliness in
the intervention group. There was very little change
for both groups on the other measures.
A description of Internet users
Among members of the intervention group, 29
(60%) reported using the WWW at least once a
week. Of these 29, 14 reported using e-mail on a
weekly basis to communicate with family or friends.
Despite the lack of statistically significant improve-
ment in the psychosocial outcome measures,
additional analyses were done to better characterize
the members of the intervention group who used this
technology on a regular basis.
Among World Wide Web users increased age
was not a deterrent for using the WWW (users
mean age = 71, n = 29; non-users mean age = 69,
n = 19). Those in the intervention group who lived
with someone else (89%) were more likely to use
the WWW than those who lived alone (54%). Lack
of education was not a hindrance to learning to use

the WWW; nine members of the intervention group
had less than a high school diploma and six of these
used the WWW regularly. A higher percentage of
men (79%) than women (53%) used the WWW.
More than half (51%) of those with no prior
computer experience used the WWW weekly.
Those with previous computer experience were
especially likely to use the WWW (80%) at least
once a week. Self-reported health did not appear to
be related to use of the WWW; 65% of those with
good to excellent health used WWW compared to
53% of those with fair to poor health. Similarly,
activity limitation due to health and need for assist-
ance with IADLs did not differentiate WWW users
compared to non-users.
Electronic-mail users were a smaller and perhaps
more select group. Again, age was not a deterrent
(users mean = 72, n = 14; non-users mean = 70,
n = 34), and participants who lived with someone
else (55%) used e-mail more than those who lived
alone (23%) did. Perhaps education is more of a
factor for e-mail use since only one of our subjects
with less than a high school diploma used e-mail.
The gender trend was opposite that seen for WWW
users; a higher percentage of women (35%) than
men (14%) used e-mail. More of those with prior
computer experience (47%) used e-mail compared
to those without experience (21%). Those with
self-reported health of good or excellent tended to
use e-mail regularly (42%) compared to those with
fair or poor health (6%). However, there was a
higher percentage of e-mail users among those who
needed assistance with IADLs (43%) than those
who did not need assistance (24%). Similarly, there
were more e-mail users among those reporting
activity limitation due to health (38%) compared to
those without limitation (16%).
As a final step, we contrasted the subgroup of 29
Internet users, which included the smaller group that
also used e-mail with the subgroup of 19 members of
the intervention group who did not regularly use the
Internet on the change scores of the predetermined
outcome measures (see Table 4). In this analysis
there were trends in the direction expected on four of
the outcome measures, but again no statistically
significant differences. In general, the Internet users
reported less loneliness, less depression, more posi-
tive attitudes toward computers, and more confidants
than the intervention recipients who were not regular
users of this technology.
Observations
Many observations made during the course of this
trial indicated that study participants benefited from
the intervention in meaningful ways. For example, at
one congregate housing site participants formed a
computer interest group and started publishing a
community-wide newsletter using the computers.
We also gained insights through recorded observa-
tions made of each participant by the computer
trainer after training. In addition, participants in the
intervention group answered open-ended questions
at the end of the trial about their goals, difficulties
and challenges encountered using the computer, and
the benefits of computer use. Several excerpts from
this database follow:
 Ms. A (78-year-old female from a nursing facility
site)
Trainer: Ms. A is very persistent and stubborn on
the computer, but it has been remarkable tool for
her. She is able to write to her priest, whom she
adores. She also reads the Pope Page and the
Vatican news.
Ms. A: E-mail is the best. It helps me to be able
to send letters instead of putting them in the
mail.

H. White et al.
Trainer: Having problems because of vision,
colors on screen, and chair too low. But still
trying! I’ll see what kinds of things we can come
up with to help. (Later) Seems to be doing quite
well, after modifying colors on the screen and
adjusting chair.
Ms. B: (Problems) I had trouble remembering
the procedure. The only thing that was really
discouraging was my eyesight. (Benefits) It was a
benefit in that it was something I wanted to do
and I did it!
 Mr. C (48-year-old male, confined permanently
to wheelchair due to disability, from congregate
housing site)
Trainer: Great guy, great on the computer, and a
lot of fun. Emerged as a leader of the class.
Mr. C: (Goal) To learn to use a personal
computer. (Problems) Learning the basics: how
to get on the World Wide Web, Internet, and
Simeon (e-mail). I didn’t know anything about
it. (Benefits) It’s allowed me to have more
reading information: to not rely on the news, but
to go out and find things that I’m interested in.
 Ms. D (51-year-old female living with parent
because of chronic disability, from congregate
housing site)
Trainer: Did extremely well. Very competent on
the computer, just lacks confidence, maybe not
getting a lot of confidence and self-esteem from
(other sources).
Ms. D: (Goals) To learn how to operate the
computer, surf the Internet and use the e-mail.
(Problems) Problems using the mouse. (Benefits)
Helped me to learn how to communicate with my
family, keep in touch with information on the
Internet.
 Ms. E (80-year-old female from congregate
housing site)
Trainer: Ms. E was my first ‘born computer user’.
She was concerned initially that she would learn
it all, but then realized that the web would
provide constant education.
Ms. E: (Goal) To learn all I could. (Benefits) It’s
become my whole life. I eat, sleep…I look for
people who have them [computers] or know
about them.
 Ms. F (71-year-old female from congregate
housing site)
Trainer: Ms. F did very well on the computer.
She enjoys sending e-mail to family members and
using the web to read her ‘bitchuaries’ from the
Charleston Daily Mail.
Ms. F: (Goal) Wanted to learn all about it.
(Benefits) Gives me something to do and I’ve
always wanted to learn how to do it.
Discussion
In a group of frail older adult volunteers with
minimal prior computer experience, we were able to
teach Internet and computer skills successfully. We
made computer training and Internet use available
to older adults in subsidized housing and nursing
facilities that might not otherwise have had access.
Indeed, very few had previous computer experience
and almost none owned a computer. Yet, to a great
extent we found older adults eager to learn to use
the Internet. A high percentage of the intervention
group (60% of the total or 74% of those who
completed training) were using the Internet on a
weekly basis at the end of the five months.
This study expands our previously published
pilot study (White et al., 1999) in three important
ways. First, this trial recruited a much larger and
more diverse sample of 100 frail elderly. The pilot

Younger people in dementia care

study involved 33 residents of a continuing care
retirement community all of whom were highly
educated and with adequate financial resources.
The present study cast a much broader net,
soliciting volunteers from subsidized housing units,
a veteran’s administration nursing facility, and a
community nursing facility. This recruitment
resulted in a more educationally, socially, and
racially diverse sample. Second, this was a rand-
omized design, which advertised and recruited
interested and eager elderly into one of two groups:
one that received Internet training and access and
one that did not receive training until after comple-
tion of the study. Our pilot study was not
randomized, but included a comparison group
derived from a small convenience sample of elderly,
many of whom were either unable to attend or not
interested in attending the computer training
sessions. Third, we were motivated and able to
modify our research protocol and computer
training procedure based on lessons learned from
the pilot experience. This served to strengthen the
overall methodological rigor of the randomized
controlled trial. Although the trial results were not
as positive as anticipated, the strong RCT study
design and the multiple strong trends, all in
expected directions position the present study as a
model for future research on Internet use in special
or vulnerable populations.
These observations are encouraging for several
reasons. First, the Internet can only become an
effective tool for health promotion, health care
delivery and other social services if the older adults
who are likely to benefit from such programs are
willing and motivated to access it (Redford &
Whitten, 1997). Second, these results help to dispel
any lingering assumptions that older adults are not
interested or unwilling to learn to use this tech-
nology. Even though most of our participants had a
high school diploma, even those without a diploma
were among those who used the Internet regularly.
Although seniors with more education are more
likely to own a computer (Adler, 1996), it may be
that those with more education simply have greater
financial capabilities or other means of access to
computers. Presently, senior centers, libraries, and
other public institutions are beginning to bring this
technology to a broader group of seniors.
These participants found it easier to learn to use
the World Wide Web than e-mail and were more
likely at five months to be using the WWW rather
than e-mail. Using the WWW may have been easier
because it required fewer steps and did not require
typing. Those with previous computer experience
were more likely to use e-mail.
Socio-demographic and health characteristics
may help predict who is most likely to use the
Internet 
capability. 
We 
detected 
a 
gender
difference between the use of the World Wide Web
and e-mail, in that men in this sample were more
inclined to use the WWW and women were more
likely to use the communication-based e-mail.
Those who lived with someone else were more
likely than others to use the Internet; perhaps
because they received encouragement from their
companion. Interestingly, those who perceived
their health to be good were much more likely to
use e-mail, yet many of these participants did
report functional impairments.
Unfortunately, health or time constraints kept a
substantial number of participants (24% of the
intervention group) from completing their training
even in this group of motivated volunteers.
Although the perception may be that older adults
have a lot of time on their hands, in reality this may
not be the case. In fact, many older adults are
taking care of other family members and friends.
Additionally, seeking and obtaining health care can
take a substantial amount of time. Our participants
were frail, over 60% reported activity limitation
due to health. Such individuals are at risk for acute
illness, which can hinder the acquisition of these
new skills.
Despite successful implementation of the inter-
vention, there were no statistically significant
differences between intervention and control
groups on the psychosocial scales. We were
particularly interested in the UCLA Loneliness
scale, which we had used in our pilot study. In the
present study, both groups showed a decrease in
loneliness, and the decrease was more pronounced
in the intervention group. However, the change in
loneliness between 
intervention 
and 
control
participants was not statistically different. Looking
only at the intervention group and comparing users
to non-users there were trends toward decreased
loneliness and depression.
Contamination of the control group by members
of the intervention group seems unlikely, since the
intervention group members were asked not to
share what they were learning with control group
members and control group members did not have
access to the computers. The fact that we did not
observe statistically significant differences may be
due to ceiling effects on the measures. The scores
on the modified CES-D were low at baseline indi-
cating low levels of depression and little room for
improvement. Similarly, the attitudes toward
computers were quite positive at the start of the
trial and thus could not improve appreciably.
Participants may still have been learning the tech-
nology. Therefore, a longer follow-up period may
have been necessary to capture the full effect of this
intervention. Although the psychosocial effects of
communication via the Internet were of primary
interest, we recognize that effects experienced in
group training and through communal computer
equipment constitute potential confounding influ-
ences.

most likely to benefit and perhaps a need for a
more intense intervention.
There was no evidence of adverse effects from
Internet use, although 
negative 
psychosocial
outcomes have been reported in younger adults
introduced to the Internet. A study of 169 subjects
including 28% adolescents found that greater use
of the Internet was associated with declines in
participants’ communication with family members
in the household, declines in the size of their social
circles, and increases in their depression and loneli-
ness (Kraut et al., 1998). Whereas younger people
may use the Internet to displace more engaging
social activity for less engaging activity and strong
social ties for weak and less meaningful social inter-
action, older adults seem more likely to use the
Internet to develop new social activity to replace
activities that have become more difficult for them
to perform and to strengthen existing social ties
with family and friends through the Internet.
Although we did not automatically track Internet
usage, we found many older adults who expressed
concern about becoming ‘addicted’ to this tech-
nology and in general they did not spend large
amounts of time on-line.
Despite the statistical equivalence of the study
arms, the findings should be of interest to investiga-
tors curious about the psychosocial effects of this
technology on older adults and serve to influence
the design of future research studies. A priori we
chose an array of standardized outcome measures
covering a variety of psychosocial domains that
may have been affected by this intervention.
However, older adults in this study appeared to
gain from exposure to this technology in several
ways not captured in our measures including self-
efficacy, mastery, and empowerment. Measures of
these concepts should be considered for inclusion
in future studies. Considering the expense of
providing this intervention at multiple sites, we
believed that a randomized controlled design was
important in order to compare this new technology
to other usual activities in which older adults
participate. Targeting the intervention to a specific
group of older adults who are more likely to benefit
may be important. Strengthening the intervention
may be feasible by using computer interfaces that
are simpler to learn, adding more individualized
training, and providing individualized resources
rather 
than 
relying 
on 
shared 
resources.
Subsequent studies should include an automatic
computer measure of Internet time to more
accurately track individual participants’ use.
In summary, the Internet is an exciting new tech-
nology with much potential for enriching the lives of
many older adults. As a source of information, social
activity, and interpersonal communication, the
Internet may expand the constrained boundaries of
congregate housing, retirement communities, and
even skilled care nursing facilities. Depending on
the older user, this expansion may include more
frequent contacts with family and friends, new
opportunities to pursue former interests, as well as
avenues to meet new friends and to ‘travel’ to places
no longer accessible due to health limitations.
Computers are now more affordable that ever
and the potential uses of the Internet are becoming
limitless. For instance, there are on-line libraries
that allow users to read books for free; holiday
shopping and banking can be done on-line through
secure websites. Further research in this area is
needed to determine more precisely, which older
adults, residing in which environmental contexts
are more likely than others to benefit from this
rapidly expanding information and communication
link. Such knowledge will move research to the
next level, of tailoring Internet instruction to older
learners, and providing access that, despite disa-
bility, is user friendly and equipped with services
attractive to older adults.
