Abstract
Introduction: Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cogni-
tive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether
conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-
friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function
among older adults without dementia.
Methods: Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial
period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview.
The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally
deﬁned as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini
mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in random-
ization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention dif-
ferences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and
intervention groups using linear regression models.
Results: Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group).
Their mean 6 standard deviation age was 80.5 6 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high.
There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among
the intervention group was 89% (range 77%–100%). Among the cognitively intact participants,
the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic ﬂuency test
(P 5.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic ﬂuency test (P 5.004) at the 18-week assess-
ments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P 5.04) toward improved psychomo-
tor speed was observed in the intervention group.
Conclusion: Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demon-
strated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater
improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through
communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional
studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows
cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia.

1. Introduction
Almost 2 decades ago, Rowe and Kahn [1] suggested the
key elements of successful aging, including (1) a low proba-
bility of disease, (2) high levels of function, and (3) active
engagement with life. The deﬁnition of “active engagement
with life” varies across individuals and cultures. In epidemi-
ologic
studies,
self-reported
social
engagement—one
component of active engagement with life—has been exten-
sively examined in relation to cognitive well-being. Howev-
er, no set of standard activities was used across studies.
Various activities were included, such as reading, playing
games or musical instruments, going to classes, doing cross-
word puzzles, playing cards, going to the cinema or theater
(often categorized as cognitive activities), visiting friends
or relatives and attending organizations (as social activities),
and dancing and walking (as physical activities). Further-
more, larger social networks (a structural aspect of social
connectedness) were also found to be protective against de-
mentia [2–12]. It is as yet unknown which factors of social
engagement or networking might reduce the risk of
dementia. For example, playing games has often been
categorized as an intellectual/cognitive stimulating activity;
however, playing games with someone requires social
interaction. Thus, the question is whether it is the social
interaction or playing the game itself that is protective
against cognitive decline. Randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) with clearly speciﬁed elements and doses of social
engagement are needed to clarify the mechanism of the
protective function of social engagement and networks on
cognitive
function
and,
ultimately
to
translate
this
knowledge into actionable programs.
One integral component of being socially active is the
ability to interact with others. Linguistic ability is known
to be highly correlated with late-life changes in cognition
in healthy older adults and those with dementia [13–15].
Furthermore, the results from psychological studies have
suggested that the task of conversation is highly cognitively
stimulating.
Conversations
require
attention,
working
memory,
the
organization
and
control
of
thought
(executive functions), and social cognition to understand
others’ intentions and feelings [16,17], in addition to
linguistic ability. To develop a prevention approach against
cognitive decline that can be easily adapted to the oldest-
old and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or
those with low motivation or apathy, we developed a
clinical RCT, focusing on conversation. We examined
whether face-to-face conversation—a core component of so-
cial interaction—can enhance cognitive functions by stimu-
lating
social
cognition.
To
facilitate
efﬁciency
and
quantiﬁcation of outcomes, we used contemporary technol-
ogies, including personal computers (PCs), webcams, and
the Internet, to deliver the conversational interventions.
From the epidemiologic and psychological data discussed
in the Introduction, we hypothesized that our trial interven-
tion would lead to improved attention, executive function,
verbal ﬂuency, and memory (i.e., domains frequently
impaired among patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The ob-
jectives of our study were to assess the feasibility, adherence,
and post-trial changes in cognitive functions and loneliness.
In the report, we present the protocol and results of the RCT.
2. Methods
2.1. Subject recruitment
From November 2011 to August 2012, we distributed 2000
surveyquestionnairestargetingthoselivinginretirement com-
munities and senior centers located in the Portland, metropol-
itan area, within an approximately 1-hour commute from the
Oregon Health & Science University (Portland, OR). Sixteen
retirement communities and senior centers that covered a wide
range of socioeconomic status (including low-income house-
hold retirement communities designated by the municipal
government) and that had agreed to collaborate in research
studieswithouruniversitywereincluded.Weconductedinfor-
mation sessions at each community and center to explain the
upcoming trial. The survey was distributed at the conclusion
of the information session and also by mail through the retire-
ment communities and senior center administrative ofﬁces.
In the survey, we collected information, including demo-
graphic data, types and frequencies of social engagement,
loneliness, and PC usage. After a brief introductory para-
graph describing our trial, we asked individuals whether
they would be interested in participating in the trial, and, if
so, to provide their contact information. They were informed
that they could decline to participate any time after learning
about the study. The main information collected in the sur-
vey is listed in Table 1.
2.2. Randomization
We invited those who had provided their contact informa-
tion
to
participate
in
in-person
screening interviews
(Figure 1). The information collected at the interview is
listed in Table 1, and the study inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed in Table 2. Trained research associates con-
ducted the interviews. The subjects were randomly assigned
to either the control or intervention group using the
balancing factors of age (3 groups: aged 65–74, 75–84,
H.H. Dodge et al. / Alzheimer’s & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions 1 (2015) 1-12
2

and 85 years or older), sex, clinical dementia rating (CDR)
scale score of 0 or 0.5 [31], mini mental state examination
score (3 groups: less than 24, 24–26, 27 or more), and years
of education (3 categories: less than 12, 12–15, and 16 or
more). The cognitive status of normal subjects and those
with MCI was operationally deﬁned as a global CDR score
of 0 and 0.5, respectively. A modiﬁed randomized minimiza-
tion algorithm was used [32].
2.3. Duration and protocol of conversational trial
The intervention group engaged in face-to-face conversa-
tions with trained interviewers 5 days a week (Monday
through Friday) for 6 weeks by way of a dedicated video-
chat-enabled PC provided to each subject. Each conversa-
tional session was designed to last 30 to 35 minutes. The
control group received weekly telephone calls to assess their
social engagement activities during the previous week (i.e.,
no PC or Internet provided). If the participants in the control
group were already using a PC before the trial, they were al-
lowed to continue. After randomization, within 2 weeks
before the start of the conversational intervention, we admin-
istered a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Af-
ter the trial (within 2 weeks after trial completion) and at the
endpoint (12 weeks after the post-trial assessment or
18 weeks from baseline), assessments were conducted to
examine the post-trial effect and its durability.
2.4. CDR assessment
The CDR assessment was conducted by trained research
nurses in a standardized manner, including information from
informants or the collateral source [31].
2.5. Development of a user-friendly web-enabled
conversational system
We created our own version of a chat system in which par-
ticipants did not need to know how to use a computer, other
than to touch the touch screen of a computer preconﬁgured
to receive calls and automatically begin the conversational
session. The study computer was enabled to record the trial
sessions and store encrypted audio data automatically. Tech-
nical support personnel visited each participant’s home and
set up the equipment.
2.6. Development of the conversational protocol
Conversation requires synthesis of multiple cognitive
functions. To present an understandable story or “rational-
ity,” the speaker must organize their ideas and thoughts
and pay attention to the other’s response. Thus, attention, ex-
ecutive function, and abstract reasoning are simultaneously
engaged. To take full advantage of this synthetic aspect of
conversation, we placed an emphasis on spontaneous re-
sponses rather than structured answers (i.e., the participants
had to organize their thoughts). We used unstructured con-
versations such as talking about the participants’ “childhood
memories,” “hobbies,” “siblings and parents,” and “movies/
books.” A topic that engages one participant’s attentiveness
and interest might not do the same for others. Nevertheless,
we attempted to create a degree of standardization by using a
daily picture prompt to stimulate the conversation. For
example, we presented Norman Rockwell paintings or pic-
tures of famous events (e.g., the ﬁrst moon landing) on
screen as evocative pictures and asked the participant about
what was happening in the picture. Next, we asked whether

few times a year, a few times a month, a few times a week, almost every day); and for what (check all that apply: send/receive e-mail, make documents,
browse websites for information, shopping, Facebook or other social network sites, games, video chat (Skype, etc.), and other [write in]).

the subject could connect their experience with the story
seen in the picture. We aimed to primarily engage the
executive functions, attention, semantic memory, and ab-
stract reasoning with this type of a semistructured session
approach.
2.7. Standardization of interviewers
The interviewers practiced conversational sessions with
our staff members and elderly volunteers to standardize their
skills before the trial began. We also recorded each conver-
sational session to monitor their interview quality. Permis-
sion for recording each trial session was included in the
consent form. Additionally, we randomly selected three re-
corded conversational sessions per interviewer, one session
each during the baseline, third, and sixth week and had
them transcribed by a single professional transcriber. The
proportion of words spoken by the interviewers was used
as a tool to standardize the conversational sessions. The de-
viation observed in the number of spoken words contributed
by the participant or interviewer during the recorded conver-
sations served as a metric to improve the standardization
of
the
individual
interviewers’
interview
skills.
The
interviewers were unaware of the cognitive status of the par-
ticipants.
2.8. Primary outcome: Cognitive function
We administered the following neuropsychological tests:
(1) for immediate memory, the Consortium to Establish a
Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease word list learning [26];
(2) for delayed memory, the Consortium to Establish a Reg-
istry for Alzheimer’s Disease word list delayed recall [26];
(3) for language, the composite of verbal ﬂuency for letters
(F, A, and S) [25]; (4) for psychomotor speed, the trail mak-
ing A test [27]; (5) for executive function, the trail making B
test [27] and verbal ﬂuency for category animals [25]; (6) for
selective attention/inhibition, the Stroop test [25]; and (7) for
premorbid and general intelligence, the wide range achieve-
ment test-revised [28]. We also used the following items

from computerized cognitive test batteries: two domains
from the Cogstate [30] (for psychomotor speed, the detec-
tion test and for working memory, the one back and two
back), and the full battery of the computer assessment of
mild cognitive impairment [29].
2.9. Secondary outcome: Loneliness score
The changes in loneliness from before to after the trial
were assessed using a 3-item loneliness scale developed by
Hughes et al [18]. The measurement asks three questions:
“How often do you feel” (1) that you lack companionship,
(2) left out, and (3) isolated from others? (1, hardly ever
[or never]; 2, some of the time; and 3, often). A higher score
indicates greater levels of perceived loneliness.
2.10. Control variables
Symptoms of depression can mediate possible treatment
effects, especially as they relate to socialization. Therefore,
we controlled for symptoms of low mood measured using
the geriatric depression scale, 15-item scale [22] in the pri-
mary analysis. As an exploratory analysis, we also examined
personality measured using the NEO-5 factor personality
scales [21] and controlled for them in the multivariate ana-
lyses, hypothesizing that personality could affect changes
in the primary outcomes. Finally, we included the interaction
effect of PC usage (yes/no; the questions are listed in
Table 1) and the study group (intervention versus control
group, with the latter group as a reference) to examine
whether the trial efﬁcacy differed by PC usage/experience.
This was because our previous study found that those who
provided contact information in the survey were signiﬁ-
cantly more likely to be PC users [20]. If PC users have
higher or lower efﬁcacy compared with non-PC users, this
information would be useful for generalizing our study re-
sults to nonparticipants.
Our institutional review board approved the study proto-
col (protocol no. 5590), and all participants provided written
informed consent. The project is listed in ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT01571427), and the ﬁnal face-to-face interview with
the participants was conducted on August 30, 2013.
2.11. Statistical analysis
The characteristics were compared between the interven-
tion and control groups using Pearson chi-square tests for
categorical variables and the t test or nonparametric Wil-
coxon ranked sum test for continuous variables. Adherence
was calculated as the proportion of days the subjects in the
intervention group completed the experiment. The pre- to
postintervention differences in the cognitive tests and lone-
liness scores were compared between the control and inter-
vention groups using t tests (univariate analysis) and linear
regression models (multivariate analysis). Statistical signif-
icance was set at P ,.004, the Bonferroni multiple compar-
ison adjusted P value. All analyses were performed using
SAS, version 9.3, software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
3. Results

with those who provided contact information in the survey
compared with those who returned the survey without
providing the information (potential volunteer bias) have
been previously summarized in detail [20]. In brief, those
who provided contact information were more likely to be
PC users and physically active and to have higher social
isolation scores, with PC usage the most signiﬁcant predictor
after controlling for education and other confounders. A total
of 83 subjects were enrolled and randomized (41 in the inter-
vention group and 42 in the control group; Figure 1). The
participant characteristics at baseline are listed in Table 3.
The mean agewas 80.5 years, and 76% werewomen. Per pro-
tocol, the age, sex, education, CDR score, and mini mental
state examination score distributions were similar between
the intervention and control groups. The other characteristics
not used for randomization (i.e., marital status, wide range
achievement test-revised scores, and PC usage) were also
comparable between the two groups. We also compared the
baseline characteristics between those with a CDR score of
0 and those with a CDR score of 0.5. The MCI group was
somewhat older and more likely to be women. Although
the CDR score was assessed independently, all conventional
neuropsychological test scores, except for letter ﬂuency,
were lower among the CDR 0.5 group, with the most signif-
icant difference observed for category ﬂuency and word list
delayed recall (P ,.0001) and the mini mental state exami-
nation (P , .0001), supporting the validity of our CDR
assessment. The computer assessment of mild cognitive
impairment overall scores were signiﬁcantly lower among
the MCI group, although the items in the Cogstate computer-
ized tests showed no differences between the two groups.
3.2. Adherence
All participants completed the pre- and post-trial neuro-
psychological tests. Among the intervention group, session
adherence was 89% (range 77%–100%). All subjects
(control and intervention groups) completed the 6- and 18-
week ﬁnal assessments.
3.3. Outcome measures
The results of the linear regression models in which the
outcome was the differences in the test scores between the
baseline and post-trial assessments (post-trial score minus
the baseline score) with the study group as the independent
variable and controlling for depressive symptoms (geriatric
depression scale, 15-item scale), are listed in Table 4. The co-
efﬁcients reported in Table 4 are “additional” changes ob-
tained by the intervention group beyond those obtained by
the control group.We found category ﬂuency scores (semantic
ﬂuency scores) had improved more in the intervention group
than in the control group (P 5 .02). The stratiﬁed analysis
showed that this effect came mainly from the CDR 0 group
(P 5 .003). Among the MCI group, the intervention group
gained psychomotor speed, indicated by the Cogstate detec-
tion tests, compared with the control group (P 5.04), although
the differences were not signiﬁcant using the multiple
comparison-adjusted P value. At 12 weeks after the end of
the trial, we examined the durability of the effects (data not
shown). The category ﬂuency scores no longer differed be-
tween the two groups, but the letter ﬂuency scores showed
greaterimprovementamongthosewitha CDRof0inthe inter-
vention group (P 5 .004). Although both groups had similar
levels of improvement/learning effects at the post-trial assess-
ment, the letter ﬂuency scores had improved further in the
intervention group after the end of the trial sessions
(Figure 2) but had declined in the control group. No difference
was found between intervention and control groups in the pre-
to post-trial changes in the loneliness score, the secondary
outcome.Asanexploratoryanalysis,wecontrolledfortheper-
sonality scores, in addition to the geriatric depression scale
scores, which did not inﬂuence the obtained results. Finally,
we included the interaction of the study group (intervention
versus control) and PC usage. No interaction effect was found,
and it did not inﬂuence the obtained results.
4. Discussion
We conducted a pilot behavioral clinical trial to improve
cognitive functions among nondemented older elderly
Fig. 2. Letter ﬂuency test results at baseline, post-trial, and ﬁnal assess-
ments among clinical dementia rating (CDR) 0 group. Among the CDR 0
group, the intervention group kept improving the test score after the trial,
but the control group experienced a decline at the ﬁnal assessment, leading
to a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups in the gain in scores from
baseline to the ﬁnal assessment (P 5 .004).

subjects by enhancing their social interaction through
Internet-based conversation. We achieved high adherence
to the protocol, and the intervention groups showed im-
provements in language-based executive functions within a
short-duration trial period.
Cognitive stimulation through Internet-based face-to-
face conversation has some ideal features as a prevention
approach. First, unlike video game-invoked cognitive
training, the subjects participate in naturalistic “human” in-
teractions that might be more engaging and require less
motivation on the part of older participants, thus allowing
those with low motivation and/or apathy to participate and
remain in the trial. Second, one might achieve more cost-
effective execution of trials by allowing a few interviewers
to interact with many participants daily using the Internet
and also gain access to those who are home-bound or in
remote locations. Third, conversations with interviewers
through the Internet eliminate potential trial confounders
such as indirect effects of tangible support that could affect
overall and cognitive health (e.g., transportation service).
Fourth, the trial differs in nature from the neuropsychologi-
cal test itself. Therefore, the observed gains in the neuropsy-
chological test scores at the post-trial assessment (beyond
the learning effects observed among the control group)
should reﬂect improvement in cognitive function that could
not be attributed to “test-taking” or “limited trained skills.”
Finally, the method provides the ability to record all interac-
tions for off-line analysis with the participants’ consent.
Thus, acoustic speech characteristics, word selections, and
sentence complexity associated with cognitive function, an
area of growing research interest, could be analyzed for
additional information [13,33–38].
We paid special attention to creating a user-friendly envi-
ronment to achieve high adherence, including a large touch
screen monitor that allowed eye-to-eye contact as experi-
enced in in-person conversations to retain attention and
pop-up pictures on the screen to evoke conversations without
any effort by the participants. The published psychological
data suggest that with age, adult cognition becomes more
tightly linked to socioemotional systems, and emotional mo-
tives play an important role in driving engagement and
enhancing cognitive outcomes in later adulthood [39,40].
We believe that tailoring existing technologies to suit the
current generation of the elderly, together with naturalistic
human contact, is key to achieving high adherence when
using contemporary communication technologies.
We found improvements in semantic ﬂuency immediately
after the trial sessions among the intervention group compared
with the control group and at the 18-week assessment from
baseline in phonemic ﬂuency. In Alzheimer’s disease, seman-
tic ﬂuency has been found to be disproportionately impaired,
with phonemic ﬂuency ability less impaired in some [41,42],
although not all studies agree [43]. It has been hypothesized
that the disproportionate impairment in semantic ﬂuency,
compared with phonemic ﬂuency, could occur because the
former relies more on temporal lobe semantic stores, the
area affected by Alzheimer’s disease, and the latter on frontal
lobe functions. It is noteworthy that the intervention group
continued to show improvement in the phonemic ﬂuency
test. The stimulation obtained from the present trial might
have led to sustained or an increased amount of social interac-
tion, even after the termination of the trial sessions, although
we do not have data to conﬁrm this hypothesis. Future studies
that examine the post-trial changes in functional and structural
connectivity between medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe
using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion
tensor imaging could be useful in identifying the underlying
mechanisms of the ﬁnding.
The improvement in cognitive function we have described
was limited to those with intact cognition, although we saw a
trend toward improvement in psychomotor speed among the
MCI group. The lack of improvement in cognitive functions
among those with MCI likely was because our study was not
powered to see changes among the MCI group (the sample
size was predetermined for a combined analysis in this phase
I study). Also, those with MCI are a heterogeneous group, and
the efﬁcacy is likely tovary depending on whether the subjects
have only memory impairment or also have impairment in
other domains (multidomain MCI). The CDR sum of box
scores in our MCI group ranged from 0.5 to 3, suggesting vari-
abilityinthetypesofMCIpresent.Futurestudiesthatallowfor
stratiﬁed analyses by MCI and its subtypes are warranted.
Also, it will be important to identify the biomarker character-
istics of those who improved and those who did not improve in
cognitive functions, to examine the underlying mechanisms of
those differences. This could aid in identifying who should be
targetedforthistypeofbehavioraltrialandalsoinreducingthe
confounding effects and variability in outcomes.
We did not see any improvement in the loneliness scores
(the secondary outcome). The scale we used asked only 3
questions (lack companionship, left out, and isolated from
others), with each having 3 possible answers. It is possible
that the variation in the scale is not great, and, therefore, it
would be difﬁcult to capture within-individual changes
within a short period. Alternatively, loneliness is a subjective
state, indicating a gap between desired levels of social inter-
actions and the amount of available social network and sup-
port. Increasing the opportunity to converse or socialize
might not be sufﬁcient to modify the level of loneliness.
Recent magnetic resonance imaging studies found associ-
ations between the size and complexity of the real-world so-
cial networks and the density of the gray matter [44] and
amygdala volume [45]. Modiﬁable effects of larger social
networks on the symptomatic outcomes of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease pathologic features have also been shown [6].
Nonhuman research has suggested that the social network
size could actually contribute to changes in both brain struc-
ture and function, providing additional support for causal
links [46]. We have previously outlined the possible mecha-
nisms for social interaction’s effects on cognitive function
[47]. Despite the accumulating evidence, just a few RCTs
have

[48,49].
We
searched
the
clinicaltrial.gov website where active and completed trials
in the United States and 187 countries are registered, using
the following search words: cognition, dementia, social
engagement, prevention, intervention. Only ﬁve studies
were identiﬁed other than ours (as of August 2014). This
is
in

to
the

targeting subjects with intact cognition [50]. Increasing so-
cial engagement through user-friendly devices using modern
telecommunication technologies holds high promise as a
translational, large-scale national prevention protocol for
both cognitively intact and impaired individuals.
The limitations of our study included a selection bias. As
shown in our previous study [20], those who volunteer to
participate in such studies differ from the general popula-
tion. For example, the high adherence we observed could
have been in part because the participants were self-
selected volunteers. The sample size for the present pilot
study was determined for the normal/MCI combined ana-
lyses, not for analyses stratiﬁed by cognitive status. Also,
our trial duration was only 6 weeks, and the retention effects
were limited to 18 weeks from baseline. To conﬁrm whether
the rates of decline in cognitive functions are actually
different between the intervention and control groups, we
would need to monitor the participants for at least 6 months
to 1 year to be able to observe and compare the natural his-
tory of cognitive declines with those in the intervention
group. Finally, more effort is required to control for con-
founding effects such as the duration of daily conversation
enacted outside the trial sessions. We intended to measure
the amount of daily conversations; however, the currently
available devices were limited in their battery life, and we
were unable to include this confounder in the analyses.
The strengths of our study included that rigorous ap-
proaches were taken to standardize the interviewers,
including intensive practice sessions before the trial initia-
tion and assessment of recorded conversations, including ex-
amination of the proportion of words spoken by the
interviewers and the participants during the trial sessions.
Second, our study participants were relatively old (mean
age 80 years). This age group is the fastest growing segment
of the population in most developed countries and faces the
greatest risk of developing cognitive impairment or demen-
tia because of their risk factor of age alone. Developing pre-
vention approaches with high adherence that could delay the
onset of dementia for even a few years could have a large ef-
fect on the overall disease burden, especially among the old-
est of the old group, and is urgently needed. To our
knowledge, the present study is one of the ﬁrst RCTs aimed
at increasing social interactions among this age group.
5. Conclusion
Our social engagement intervention (daily conversations)
using
user-friendly
Internet
communication
programs
demonstrated high adherence. The intervention group
showed signiﬁcantly greater improvement in the neuropsy-
chological test scores that evaluate both semantic and pho-
netic ﬂuencies, despite the short duration of the trial
period. Increasing daily social contacts through communica-
tion technologies could offer cost-effective execution of
home-based prevention trials. Additional studies are needed
that are powered to analyze the efﬁcacy among those with
MCI and have longer follow-up durations to examine the dif-
ferences in the rate of decline in cognitive functions between
the intervention and control groups. These studies should
also examine the pre- and postintervention differences in
biomarkers to identity the potential mechanism and should
be able to assess the translational effects on everyday living.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: We reviewed the available
English-language data in PubMed to March 2014
using the search terms “social network,” “social
engagement” or “social interaction,” and “random-
ized controlled clinical trials” to ﬁnd studies to
include in our discussion.
2. Interpretation: Previous epidemiologic studies have
demonstrated that a larger social network or more
frequent social interactions might have protective ef-
fects on the development of Alzheimer’s disease. We
conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial
aimed at improving cognitive functions among nonde-
mented older subjects (mean age 80 years) by
enhancing their social interaction through Internet-
based conversation. We achieved high adherence to
the protocol, and the intervention groups showed im-
provements in language-based executive functions.
3. Futuredirections:Thecognitivestageatwhichthistype
of intervention is most effective should be identiﬁed.
The study should be expanded to have a longer
follow-up duration to examine the differences in the
rate of decline in cognitive functions between the
intervention and control groups. The pre- and post-
intervention differences in biomarker levels should be
examined to identity the potential mechanisms. Finally,
an effective, yet sustainable, dose of social interactions
and methods to deliver the program to a larger com-
munity,scalabletoanationallevel,shouldbeidentiﬁed.
