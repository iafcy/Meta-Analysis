Loneliness is common among older persons and is associated with adverse health and wellbeing outcomes. We
investigated a theory-based intervention that addresses barriers to social contacts and aims at increasing social
self-eﬃcacy. Individuals that met pre-assessment criteria of cognitive function, physical health, and loneliness
levels were randomly assigned either to the I-SOCIAL intervention that combined both individual and group
sessions to address individuals' unique social challenges, or to the control group. Assessment was administered at
baseline, after the completion of the intervention, and after a 3-month follow-up period. The intervention group
showed signiﬁcant decline in loneliness level compared to the control group, both after the intervention and
after the follow-up period. This innovative combination of analysis of personal barriers, support provided by the
counselors, group activities, and individualized suggestions for social activities in the participant's neighbor-
hood, may account for the success of the intervention in decreasing participants' loneliness levels.
1. Introduction
Loneliness has long been recognized as a persistent problem among
older populations, with reported prevalence ranging from 10% to 45%
of older persons depending on their gender, age group, and method of
assessing loneliness (Brodsky et al., 2017; Cohen-Mansﬁeld et al., 2009;
Niedzwiedz et al., 2016). It generally refers to the person's subjective
experience of inadequate quality or level of relationships (Lopata, 1969;
Russell et al., 1984; Weiss, 1973). In contrast to loneliness, “social
isolation” refers to the objective aspect of limited social interactions.
(Chappell and Badger, 1989; de Jong Gierveld et al., 2018; Dykstra,
2009; Weiss, 1973; Wenger et al., 1996).
Multiple factors aﬀect loneliness in older adults. A review of cor-
relates (Cohen-Mansﬁeld et al., 2016) found demographic variables
such as female gender, non-married status, older age, and poor income
to be related to higher levels of loneliness. Psychological attributes such
as poor mental health, low self-eﬃcacy beliefs, cognitive deﬁcits, as
well as social attributes (e.g. quality and quantity of social networks)
and medical and functional status, were also associated with loneliness.
Furthermore, limited ﬁnancial resources and insuﬃcient opportunities
for social contact were found to be signiﬁcant predictors of loneliness
(Cohen-Mansﬁeld and Parpura-Gill, 2007). Successful social integration
is dependent on an appropriate environment and on adequate social
skills (de Jong Gierveld et al., 2018).
Creating avenues for social integration for those who have diﬃculty
fulﬁlling their social needs is of paramount clinical signiﬁcance for
preventing the adverse outcomes of loneliness (Heinrich and Gullone,
2006). Reported negative outcomes of loneliness include poor overall
health, higher blood pressure (Luanaigh and Lawlor, 2008), coronary
issues (Sorkin et al., 2002), depressed aﬀect, faster cognitive dete-
rioration (Donovan et al., 2017; Golden et al., 2009), as well as Alz-
heimer's disease (Wilson et al., 2007), poor quality of life (Chalise et al.,

2010; Paul et al., 2006), and increased mortality rates (Penninx et al.,
1997; Seeman, 2000; Shiovitz-Ezra and Ayalon, 2010; Sugisawa et al.,
1994).
Intervention studies which aimed to decrease loneliness have been
based on either group or individual formats, and they involved diﬀerent
kinds of content, such as psychological help, (e.g. social skills training),
recreational activities (such as art or exercise), or practical help (e.g.,
using hearing aids). Furthermore, although various interventions seem
promising, their eﬃcacy was questionable due to ﬂawed research de-
signs (Cohen-Mansﬁeld and Perach, 2015), and they have been unable
to provide conclusive evidence (Cattan et al., 2005).
The current study addresses limitations of past studies in several
ways. First, the intervention developed for this study, the Increasing
SOcial Competence and social Integration of older Adults experiencing
Loneliness (I-SOCIAL) intervention, is theory-based. It is grounded in
the general framework of a Cognitive-Behavioral theoretical model,
conceptualizing behaviors as resulting from the interaction between
personal and environmental factors, as well as being based on the
MOdel of DEpression and Loneliness (MODEL), which identiﬁed spe-
ciﬁc barriers to social integration among lonely older individuals
(Cohen-Mansﬁeld and Parpura-Gill, 2007). Second, the intervention
integrates individual and group sessions. Third, we aimed to decrease
the methodological ﬂaws by conducting a randomized controlled trial.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
We recruited 136 potential participants from many sources, in-
cluding two local branches of a Health Maintenance Organization
(HMO; 36 participants), calling people from a list of local older persons
purchased from a commercial vendor (36 participants), local senior
centers and university lectures open to the public (19 participants),
persons referred from other studies or through other participants of this
study (13 participants), responses to posters advertising the study (13
participants), referrals from the municipal social service agency (12
participants), and local residential buildings for older persons (7 par-
ticipants). A total of 89 persons were randomized (44 = control,
45 = intervention, i.e., receiving the I-SOCIAL intervention); of these
74 participants completed the intervention (35 = control, 39 = inter-
vention), and 63 completed follow-up (28 = control, 35 = interven-
tion). A ﬂow diagram presenting recruitment and exclusions of poten-
tial participants is presented in Fig. 1. Participants' demographic
characteristics are described in Table 1.
2.2. Assessments
Pre-intervention questionnaire. Demographic information in-
cluded gender, age, marital status, place of birth, and years of educa-
tion. Health was assessed by number of medical diagnoses. Subjective
health was rated on a 4-point scale (poor, fair, good, excellent).
Cognitive function was assessed using the validated Hebrew version of
the Mini Mental State Examination (Folstein et al., 1975; Werner et al.,
1999). The total score ranges from 0 (severe cognitive impairment) to
30 (normal cognitive functioning).
Outcome variable. Loneliness was assessed by three measures: (a)
The UCLA Loneliness Scale- 8 items (ULS-8; Hays and DiMatteo, 1987).
Each item was rated on a 5-point scale from “not at all” (1) to “to a
great extent” (5), with a higher score indicating greater loneliness. The
rating scale of two items, “I am an outgoing person” and “I can ﬁnd
companionship when I want it” was reversed. Based on experience from
another study (Cohen-Mansﬁeld et al., 2015), “I am unhappy being so
withdrawn” was replaced with two items: “I feel physically distant from
other people” and “I feel emotionally distant from other people”; (b)
Frequency of loneliness was measured via “How often would you say
you feel lonely?” (Mullins et al., 1990) on a 6-point scale from “never”
(1) to “several times an hour” (6); (c) Severity of loneliness (Holwerda
et al., 2014) was measured via “To what extent do you feel lonely?”
measured on a 5-point scale from “not at all” (1) to “to a very large
extent” (5). The three measures were highly inter-correlated, with
correlations at baseline ranging from r = .50 to r = .65 with sample
sizes ranging from 117 to 132, p < .001. We therefore used the mean
of the three measures (after transforming the frequency measure to a
1–5 range to equalize its weight to the other two measures) as the
outcome variable for the study.
2.3. Procedure
The ethics committee of Tel-Aviv University approved the study as
did the Helsinki ethics committee of Meir Medical center. The study was
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identiﬁer NCT01842984). Inclusion
criteria were (1) age 65 and above; (2) feeling lonely based on the
questions of degree (moderate level and above) and frequency (several
times a week and above) of loneliness on the screening questionnaire,
as well as not participating in social activities and expressing at least
moderate desire to have additional company; (3) being able to parti-
cipate based on cognitive function (MMSE > 22); (4) no signiﬁcant
depression as screened by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). We
used a cut-oﬀof 10, which indicates moderate depression.
All individuals recruited were interviewed in-person by a research
assistant to complete the pre-intervention questionnaire, which in-
cluded items on background information: demographic, cognitive
function, physical health, as well as on loneliness. Written informed
consent was obtained at pre-intervention interview. Participants were
also interviewed at the end of the intervention about six months after
the baseline pre-intervention interviews (5.65(1.55) with a range of
3.20–9.00 months), and at end of a three-month follow-up period
(3.09(.31) with a range of 2.40–4.07 months).
The study was conducted in three waves, and in each, we went
through all the stages of the study including assessments, intervention,
and control groups. At the end of the intervention process, the parti-
cipants completed the assessment, and they were asked again to do so at
the end of the three months' follow-up period. Post-intervention ques-
tionnaires were administered by a research assistant who was not as-
sociated with the interventions, thus decreasing the likelihood of a
social desirability bias.
Intervention. The I-SOCIAL intervention is based on ﬁndings from
Cohen-Mansﬁeld and Parpura-Gill (2007), which highlighted the role of
barriers in producing and maintaining loneliness in older persons. The
intervention focused on addressing psychosocial barriers, such as low
social self-eﬃcacy, and environmental barriers, such as lack of social
opportunities in the vicinity of the older person. The intervention in-
cluded: (1) identifying the barriers for the speciﬁc person; (2) up to ten
individual meetings with an activities counselor, which focused on
helping the person address personal barriers to social integration and
included discussions concerning options for social contacts as well as
using techniques and local resources to tackle the barriers (e.g., un-
dertaking a mapping of social opportunities in the neighborhood using
resources from local governments and senior centers); and (3) up to
seven group sessions of participants and the activities counselors were
held in order to provide opportunities to increase social competence by
practicing social skills within a protected setting, and as a venue to
discuss barriers and ways to address them. The participants chose
whether to partake in the individual meetings, the group sessions, or
both. The rationale for including both individual and group sessions
was based on our pilot work that found that some lonely persons were
not comfortable in groups or initially not willing to participate in
groups, and that individual meetings would allow us to work on bar-
riers and solutions particular to each individual. In contrast, the group
sessions allowed participants to practice and share solutions with each
other. The activities counselors in this study had at least a Bachelor's
degree in the social sciences. Prior to the intervention, the activities

counselors received training in motivational interviewing and in the
principles of cognitive behavior therapy, and they were introduced to
the principles and the model of the intervention. During the interven-
tion, they summarized the activities after each individual and group
session and received at least one hour of supervision a week.
Control. Participants in the control group received no social en-
gagement nor help in promoting social engagement from the research
staﬀ.
2.4. Statistical analysis
The results were analyzed with a repeated measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA). Group (intervention vs. control) was the between-
subjects factor and time was the within subject factor. Because of the
relatively small sample size and the decreasing size at follow-up, we
conducted two repeated measures ANOVAs, one at the end of inter-
vention and one at follow-up. In addition, in order to examine the

concurrent results of both post-intervention and follow-up assessments
and include all randomized participants, we utilized the mixed model
(linear) procedure in SPSS with data from all 89 randomized partici-
pants and examined the interaction eﬀect of time (baseline, post-in-
tervention, and follow-up) by group (intervention vs control).

where IG=Intervention Group; CG=Control Group; t = after inter-

clarify the impact of the components of the intervention, we conducted
a stepwise multiple regression with loneliness (separately for post-in-
tervention and follow-up) as the dependent variable, and with the fol-
lowing independent variables: level of loneliness at baseline, number of
individual meetings, and number of group sessions the participant
partook of. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software
(IBM, Armonk, NY).
3. Results
Participants were randomized into two groups (intervention and
control). Statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were not found between
the groups with regard to demographics, health, and cognitive function
(Table 1).
Intervention utilization. On average, participants were involved
in 5.77 (SD = 2.42) individual meetings and attended 3.92 (SD = 2.15)
group sessions with the majority choosing a combination of both. These
numbers mask a large variability in involvement which is displayed in
Table 2. One person participated in no meetings, while the largest
subgroup (13 participants) had 5-7 individual meetings and attended
5–7 group sessions. Reasons for not attending varied greatly, from
medical emergencies to lack of interest and various external barriers.
Impact of the intervention on loneliness rates. The intervention
group showed a signiﬁcant decline in loneliness as compared to the
control group both after the intervention and after the follow-up period.
This diﬀerence yielded signiﬁcant interaction terms in both ANOVAs
(p < .05, Table 3, Fig. 2). The mixed model also revealed a signiﬁcant
eﬀect for the interaction of intervention group by time, with an
F5,154.8 = 2.52, p < .05. The eﬀect size was 0.29 post-intervention and
0.24 at follow-up.
We used an ‘intent to treat’ analysis and included a participant who
did not receive any intervention sessions. Our intent was to provide
each participant with about seven individualized meetings and seven
group sessions. When considering seven sessions of any kind as a
minimal treatment threshold, 85% of the intervention group received
this amount, and the eﬀect size for this subgroup was .34 at post-in-
tervention evaluation.
Reasons for not receiving the full-intended intervention were health
problems either of spouses or of the participants themselves (e.g., a
participant who was hospitalized in an intensive care unit during the
intervention period and thus could not complete the process, and other
participants who received chemotherapy) and lack of time due to a full-
time job.
Predictors of post-intervention score. The regressions explaining
loneliness score at post-intervention and follow-up by loneliness at
baseline, number of individual meetings received, and number of group
sessions attended are displayed in Table 4. Results were very similar for
both regression analyses, i.e., baseline loneliness scores and number of
group sessions attended were signiﬁcant predictors of the ﬁnal lone-
liness score, explaining 40.2% and 54.5% of their variances, respec-
tively. Number of individual meetings attended did not emerge as a
signiﬁcant predictor.

4. Discussion
This study found that the I-SOCIAL intervention for lonely older
persons decreased loneliness signiﬁcantly as compared with a no
treatment control group. This ﬁnding is important for both substantive
and methodological reasons. First, loneliness has been associated with
multiple adverse eﬀects, including risk of cognitive decline and de-
mentia (Holwerda et al., 2014), mortality, and morbidity (Holt-Lunstad
et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2012). Therefore, identifying interventions that
decrease loneliness is crucial. Furthermore, prior intervention studies
generally had either signiﬁcant methodological problems or reached
inconclusive results (Cohen-Mansﬁeld and Perach, 2015), making this
controlled trial an important step forward.
The study is pioneering in its individualization of treatment options
to the needs of the participants, as it is the ﬁrst study that combines
individual and group intervention options, and it allows the partici-
pants to choose based on what is acceptable to them. Some lonely
persons are not ready to participate in groups, which are perceived as
too threatening, and individual meetings can ease the way towards this
or towards another social activity. For others, individual meetings
provide a less meaningful or potent intervention than groups, and these
persons chose to participate only in groups, yet most participated in
both. In addition to this format allowing a tailored intervention, in-
dividual meetings were further individualized by exploring the parti-
cipant's barriers to social integration and examining, together with the

counselor, avenues to address these barriers. The intervention also in-
volved counselors examining options for social activities in the parti-
cipant's neighborhood and exploring their suitability for the partici-
pant. Thus, the intervention aimed to facilitate utilization of local
resources that participants could make use of after the termination of
the study.
The intervention resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in
loneliness rates in the intervention group with no such decline in the
control group. Yet, the eﬀect size obtained (0.29) is modest. Multiple
reasons may be responsible for this, and their investigation should
provide directions for future similar studies. First, we designed the in-
tervention to be short based on several considerations. We thought that
a short and therefore less expensive intervention would be more likely
to be utilized by organizations that would target loneliness as an in-
dicator for intervention, such as senior centers, HMOs, or community
centers. In retrospect, we realize that the intervention period was too
short. This was a complaint voiced by most participants, but we did not
have the resources to lengthen the intervention period. Participants told
us that they were just starting to try new social interactions at the end
of the trial, and that they still needed and wanted additional support.
We recommend that future studies using the I-SOCIAL present the in-
tervention over longer periods.
The regression analysis revealed that the number of group sessions
attended predicted the decrease in loneliness rates after the interven-
tion. This ﬁnding likely reﬂects the crucial role of group sessions for
modeling and practicing social skills, for developing connections with
people who are seeking to develop new social ties, and for gaining in-
sight into opportunities to enhance one's social network. However, it
may also reﬂect the fact that those who attended group sessions were
more ready – physically and socially – to enhance their social activities.
Indeed, one of the goals of the individual meetings was to help those
who were reluctant to attend groups overcome their barriers. Therefore,
the statistically signiﬁcant role of group attendance probably reﬂects
both the impact of the groups but also the fact that group attendance
was already an indicator of better readiness to tackle one's loneliness. In
a similar vein, the number of individual meetings was not predictive of
improvement in loneliness, as it was a reﬂection of diﬀerent underlying
processes. In some instances, a high number of individual meetings was
indicative of more support needed to make progress, while a low
number of meetings could mean that participants felt they were gaining
from the group activities and therefore did not need the individual
meetings. It could also include participants who gave up on the process.
Another insight for future work in this area pertains to available
local resources. We assumed that we could rely on local social resources
where participants would ﬁnd avenues for continuing social activities.
However, information received from participants, as well as that ob-
tained by us directly, revealed a combination of insuﬃcient, unsuitable,
and non-accessible social opportunities in the community. In the senior
centers, most of the activities tended to provide entertainment that
required passive participation, such as listening to a concert or a lec-
ture. Activities did not promote social interaction among attendees.
This is a major failure of services for older persons, which needs to be
addressed by those running the services, such as the local municipality.
In addition, the social service system was not designed to address ﬁ-
nancial and mobility barriers. Indeed, a substantial proportion of the
participants was poor, which is in line with research ﬁndings regarding
the relationship between loneliness and low ﬁnancial resources.
Therefore, many could not aﬀord to attend the local senior centers or
similar activity opportunities. Others either had serious mobility lim-
itations, could not use public transportation, or could not aﬀord taxis.
Our sample included persons with multiple physical, medical, ﬁnancial,
and personality limitations who were not provided with the needed
support.
The sample was comprised of about 80% women. This is likely
because there are more women in older populations, and women tend
to be more lonely in old age (Cohen-Mansﬁeld et al., 2016) for multiple
reasons. They are less likely than men to be married and are often of
lower economic status. Similarly, in our study, 57% of the men were
married or living with a partner as compared to 9% of the women.
Cognitive function aﬀects loneliness in multiple ways. When
memory abilities deteriorate people are often avoided by their friends,
contributing to loneliness. Furthermore, the impairment in both
memory and organizational skills that is associated with Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) and with dementia is a barrier to initiation and de-
velopment of new social contacts. Thus, cognitive status may impact
participants' ability to beneﬁt from the intervention. Whereas this study
assessed cognitive function with the MMSE, future studies may further
examine this issue by adding a diagnosis of MCI and dementia to the
background assessment.
Within this study, we monitored verbal responses of the participants
in both the group and the individual meetings. We intend to analyze
these materials qualitatively, and we anticipate this analysis should
shed more light on remaining issues concerning the intervention, such
as how participants perceived encouragement to try activities or how to
handle conﬂicts between group members. It should also highlight spe-
ciﬁc wishes and needs of group members, such as socialization in the
evenings when participants are alone at home and afraid to go out-
doors, or activities geared for speciﬁc subgroups, such as older men
who are looking for a men's club type of venue. In addition to pre-
senting the I-SOCIAL intervention for longer periods, future studies
should develop the I-SOCIAL together with a local social agency that
runs activities for older persons and that is ready to enhance the
sociability impact of its current activities. Such a combined intervention
may allow the I-SOCIAL or parts thereof to be oﬀered on an indeﬁnite
basis.
The above limitations notwithstanding, this study is the ﬁrst to
utilize a well-designed trial to show the eﬃcacy of a new, person-tai-
lored, approach to decreasing loneliness among older persons. The re-
sults support conclusions from a review of loneliness interventions,
which noted the relative eﬀectiveness of educational programs that
include guided social participation and the enhancement of partici-
pants' social networks (Cohen-Mansﬁeld and Perach, 2015). The ﬁnd-
ings highlight the need for a change in approach to the prevention of
loneliness in older persons and provide guidance for conducting new
trials, which would optimize the I-SOCIAL approach to address this
crucial social problem.
