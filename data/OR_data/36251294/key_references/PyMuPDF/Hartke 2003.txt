T
he stress of caregiving over time can
result in emotional, physical, and
social morbidities.1,2 Increased mor-
tality,3 social isolation,4 as well as a range of
disruptive emotional states5,6 have all been
reported. Studies addressing the psycholog-
ical consequences of caring for stroke sur-
vivors confirm significant levels of anxiety
and depression in this population,7–11 with
rates of depression reported to be as high as
42%–52%, especially among spousal care-
givers.10,12,13
Group interventions to alleviate caregiver
stress have been viewed as clinically effec-
tive by their ability to provide respite; affil-
iation and emotional support; perspective
on the universality of caregiver stress; and
education about resources, coping strate-
gies, and problem solving,14,15 However,
group interventions were most often praised
anecdotally for their supportive effect and
have shown disappointingly modest effect
in moderating caregiver stress when sub-
mitted to empirical investigation.1,16–18
Research on caregiver groups has been crit-
icized for its lack of specificity. Studies
have been complicated by sampling prob-
lems, poorly delineated treatment para-
digms, and broad outcome measures that
lacked a direct relationship to the focus of
intervention.15–18
Research findings have suggested that
elder spouses may be particularly vulnera-
ble to caregiver stress. Spouses are the first
choice in a predictable hierarchy of proba-
ble caregivers.6 Pruchno and Potashnik19
indicated that spouses provided the most
extensive and comprehensive care, main-
tained the role of caregiver longer, and tol-
erated greater levels of disability. Their own

Purpose: This study evaluated the effectiveness of telephone groups for older, spousal caregivers of stroke
survivors. Method: The 88 caregivers were mostly white females who were 70 years old on average and
who had been providing care for an average of 3 years. Participants were randomized to treatment or con-
trol conditions, followed for 6 months, and assessed for depression, burden, loneliness, stress, and com-
petence. Treatment participants engaged in an eight-session psychoeducational telephone group. Results:
Treatment participants showed decreased stress over time but were not significantly different from control
participants in the amount of change in stress. Control participants showed a significant increase in bur-
den during the study; treatment participants showed a significant increase in competence. Key words: care-
giver stress, depression, loneliness, stroke, telehealth, telephone

elder, spousal caregivers a high-risk group
for morbidities due to the stress of provid-
ing care. 
The stress of caregiving has been related to
the nature of functional disability in the care
receiver.20 Physical care tasks present differ-
ent challenges and have been considered less
stressful than more unpredictable, poorly
resolved cognitive and behavioral problems.6
In the case of stroke, both physical and cog-
nitive/behavioral disturbances may be inter-
mingled, and this calls for a unique type of
care. It also may take several months before
deficits from a stroke are stabilized.
MacNamara et al.8 reported that anxiety may
actually increase with time even in the case
of “successful” stroke caregivers. 
The increasing availability of telecom-
munications and information technology
has provided a new route for provision of
health care services. Telehealth provides
alternative ways of delivering interventions
when distance, cost, and inconvenience
prohibit conventional face-to-face con-
tact.21 It has the potential to bring assis-
tance to underserved groups, such as the
homebound. Many caregivers are reluctant
or unable to leave their disabled family
member to travel distances and participate
in face-to-face groups. Group treatment
through telephone conference call is now
feasible for delivery of support to care-
givers. Liss et al.21 reviewed the application
of telehealth to persons with chronic dis-
abilities and found preliminary evidence
supporting its effectiveness, but they noted
a particular need for evaluation of tele-
phone-based counseling. Galinsky et al.22
specifically reviewed literature on technol-
ogy-based groups and surveyed practition-
ers on their knowledge, experience, and
comfort level in this area. They cited
advantages to this format of accessibility,
convenience and anonymity, and disadvan-
tages of decreased interpersonal cues, tech-
nological problems, and limitations to
group process, such as trust and cohesion.
Galinsky et al.22 recommended preliminary
guidelines for conducting phone-based
groups, such as use of co-facilitators who
are more active in guiding group process.
Limited research using this intervention
paradigm has been conducted by Evans
and his associates.23–28 These studies have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the inter-
vention with older, blind, and otherwise
severely disabled persons and have shown
changes in loneliness, social involvement,
and life satisfaction among other measures.
Published studies of group interventions
for caregivers provided by telephone con-
ference call have just begun to appear in
the literature. Brown et al.29 compared the
effectiveness of support groups delivered
in person and by telephone for family care-
givers of brain-injured adults, including
stroke. Participants participated in 9 to 10
semi-structured group sessions either in
person or on the phone, with group assign-
ment depending upon the caregivers’ dis-
tance from the sponsoring hospital. Rural
caregivers were assigned to the telephone
groups. Outcome measures were family
functioning, burden, and mood distur-
bance. There were similar amounts of
improvement found for both types of
groups; participants showed significant
reduction in mood disturbance regardless
of mode of intervention. The study was
complicated by group bias; rural caregivers
(assigned to the telephone intervention)
were less distressed across all assessment
periods. Although both types of interven-
tions were rated highly, the telephone

Telephone Group Intervention
67
group participants were somewhat more
satisfied with their experience. The investi-
gators concluded that nothing essential was
lost in conducting caregiver groups on the
telephone when compared to traditional
face-to-face participation.
The mechanism of change in caregiver
stress intervention is often guided by a stress
and coping model. Gatz et al.6 provided a
summary model of caregiving stress with the
following critical features: onset of a dis-
abling event prompting care as the stressor;
appraisal of the experience of caring; the
mediators or coping skills brought to bear;
and the outcome of successful caring or
abandonment of the role. According to this
model, an intervention on the caregiver’s
appraisal of self and situation, as well as on
mediators such as care skills, knowledge of
disability, and outside supports, can positive-
ly influence coping and subjective distress. 
Failure to demonstrate effectiveness of
interventions in caregiver stress research has
been attributed to problems in outcome
measurement. One means of focusing meas-
urement has been to combine more estab-
lished global measures with those that are
more specific to the caregiving situation.
Zarit30 recommended a multidimensional,
multivariate, multimethod approach wher-
ever possible. Evans et al.23,26,27 and Jaureguy
and Evans28 have consistently shown that
group telephone treatment decreases loneli-
ness. Depression is widely recognized as a
specific morbidity in caregivers in need of
treatment.1,6,10 The high prevalence of
depression among caregivers makes it a log-
ical target of intervention. Depression
among spousal stroke caregivers has been
documented to be significantly higher than
in the general older adult population.9,31
Sense of competence or self-efficacy32,33 has
been identified as a factor that mediates cop-
ing. Caregiver competence can buffer the
experience of stress and has been shown to
relate to depression.34,35 The assessment of
the stressfulness of individually identified
problems of providing care has value as a
monitor of the unique accumulation of stress
in the caregiving situation.36 Finally, reduc-
tion in sense of burden has been associated
with successful caregiver stress interven-
tions.6 Higher subjective burden has affect-
ed caregiver decision making, such as nurs-
ing home placement.37
The present study attempted to further
explore the feasibility and effectiveness of a
structured caregiver intervention delivered
by teleconference. The study addressed past
criticism of poor specificity in caregiving
research by targeting older, spousal, stroke
carers with a focused intervention and out-
come measurements. The intervention was
tailored to the stress of providing care to a
stroke survivor and concentrated on care-
giver appraisals and mediating factors of
skills and resources according to a stress
and coping model. Specific outcomes of
depression, burden, loneliness, stress, and
competence were assessed for change. The
following specific hypotheses were tested:
1.
Participants in the treatment group
will show significant improvement in
depression, loneliness, burden, com-
petence, and stress between entrance
into the study and completion of the
intervention and will maintain gains
at 6-month follow-up (p < .05).
2.
Participants in the treatment group
will show significant improvement in
depression, loneliness, burden, com-
petence, and stress in comparison to
the control group at 6-month follow-
up (p < .05).

Method
The current study utilized a randomized,
treatment/control design to test the efficacy
of a caregiver stress intervention. The
intervention was designed according to a
stress and coping model and was refined by
input of a focus group of stroke caregivers.
The newly designed intervention was com-
pared to usual support provided to spousal,
stroke caregivers. 
Sample
Participants were spouses of stroke sur-
vivors who received acute rehabilitation at
a free-standing rehabilitation center or at a
rehabilitation unit of a major suburban
medical center. Participants were recruited
from review of their spouses’ admission
records; various print, radio, and television
media advertisements and news features;
and targeted community outreach. Criteria
for inclusion in the study were (a) 60 years
of age or older, (b) married or spousal
equivalent and living with the stroke sur-
vivor, (c) primary caregiver for a minimum
of 1 month, (d) not currently in a caregiver
support group, and (e) a telephone in the
home and sufficient hearing to participate
in telephone conference calls and individual
assessment interviews. A primary caregiver
was defined as someone who was providing
emotional support in addition to participat-
ing in care in at least one of the following
three areas: personal care, instrumental
activities of daily living, decision making
or informal case management. It was felt
that participants had to be in their role as
primary caregiver for a minimum of 1
month in order to benefit from the interven-
tion.
Over 500 people were solicited for partic-
ipation. Of the 124 participants who were
successfully recruited, 36 dropped out dur-
ing the course of the study, resulting in a
29% dropout rate. Significantly more treat-
ment participants (n = 25) dropped out of the
study than controls (n =11) (χ2 = 4.37, p <
.05). The most frequent reason for dropping
out of the control group was difficulty sched-
uling follow-up evaluations, whereas the
most frequent reasons for dropping out of the
treatment group were death of spouse or per-
ception of a lack of need for the intervention.
A total of 88 persons participated in the
study to conclusion and were assessed at all
time periods, with 43 cases in the treatment
condition and 45 in the control condition.
Table 1 provides a description of the sample
on relevant demographic factors. Treatment
group participants had spouses who were
more significantly impaired on the FIMTM*
motor scale, and the caregivers in this condi-
tion also significantly more often reported
receiving help with their spouses’ care.
Measures
Table 2 lists the means, medians, and
standard deviations by group and time for
the study outcome measures.
Depression 
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies–
Depression Scale (CES-D) was a 20-item
self-report scale38 that measured the presence
and severity of depressive symptomatology
during the preceding week on a 3-point scale
ranging from 0 for rarely to 3 for all the time.

Telephone Group Intervention
69
Scores ranged from 0–60, with higher scores
representing greater symptom severity and a
score of 16 being the usual cutoff to denote
depression. The scale has been shown to be
internally consistent with coefficients as
high as .85 to .9038 and .86 to .88 in a longi-
tudinal study of stroke caregivers.39 The
scale has been shown to be a valid screening
measure for depression in community sam-
ples,40
medical patients (e.g., stroke
patients41), and caregivers.9,19,42,43 Internal
consistency coefficients for the current study
were .85 (Time 1) and .87 (Time 2).
Loneliness 
The UCLA Loneliness Scale was original-
ly developed by Russell et al.44 as a 20-item
self-report scale and was revised by Russell
et al.45 to a 10-item version focused on the
psychological experience of loneliness.
Respondents rated frequency of occurrence
of symptoms of loneliness on a 4-point scale
ranging from 1 for never to 4 for often, with
higher scores reflecting greater loneliness.
Russell et al.45 reported the internal consis-
tency of the revised measure to be high (α =
.94) for the longer version and also demon-
strated a significant relationship between the
scale and a self-labeling loneliness index and
other social behaviors. Knight et al.46
renormed the scale on a general adult popu-
lation and reported internal consistency to be
.83 to .86 for the short version with mean
scores ranging from 17.4 to 17.9. The scale
has been successfully utilized in the assess-
ment of spousal caregivers.47 Internal consis-
tency coefficients for the current study were
.80 (Time 1) and .79 (Time 2).

Competence 
The Caregiver Competence Scale was
developed by Pearlin et al.32 to measure the
construct of competence in a stress and cop-
ing model of caregiving. It was a 4-item, 4-
point self-rating scale ranging from 1 for
not at all to 4 for very much in which the
participants were asked to rate their sense
of competence and confidence in their role
as a caregiver. Total scores ranged from 4 to
16 with higher scores denoting greater com-
petence. Pearlin et al.32 indicated adequate
internal consistency (α = .74). Internal con-
sistency coefficients for the current study
were .78 (Time 1) and .81 (Time 2).
Burden 
The Burden Interview (BI)48 was a 22-
item scale in which caregivers were asked
about feelings of stress, guilt, and resent-
ment in their caring role. Responses were
ratings of frequency on a 4-point scale
ranging from 0 for never to 4 for nearly
always. Item ratings were summed to
achieve a total score that ranged from 0 to
88, with higher scores indicating a greater
sense of burden. Evidence for concurrent
validity48 and internal consistency alphas
ranging from .88 to .9149 have been report-
ed. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated
the BI was comprised of two scales, per-
sonal strain and role strain.50 Internal con-
sistency coefficients for the current study
were .85 (Time 1) and .88 (Time 2).
Stress 
The Pressing Problem Index (PPI)36
was obtained from a semi-structured
interview in which participants were

asked to appraise their caregiving situa-
tion by identifying current problems in
providing care and assessing their sever-
ity. For each problem enumerated, the
participant rated how stressful the prob-
lem is and how effectively the problem is
managed. The scales were numbered
from 1 to 5 (1 = not stressful and effec-
tive; 5 = very stressful and effective). A
total index was derived by computing a
composite score for each problem (the
sum of the stress rating and the reverse
scored effectiveness rating) and dividing
by the total number of problems. A high-
er score indicated greater stress and less
effective management. Toseland et al.36
reported a significant decrease in the PPI
among caregivers in peer and profession-
ally led support groups compared with a
respite-only group. 
Functional level 
The FIMTM was used to assess the func-
tional status of the care receiver.
Function was rated for 18 items on a 7-
point response set from maximum
dependence (1) to independent without
assistance (7). Thirteen items and five
items comprised motor and cognitive
scales, respectively. The cognitive scale
included language, social interaction,
problem solving, and memory ratings.
Higher scores indicated greater function-
al independence. Scores ranged from 18
to 125 for the total FIM. Intraclass corre-
lations for scales have ranged from .89
(cognitive) to .94 (motor).51 The scale has
been shown to demonstrate adequate
intra-rater reliability.52 Internal consisten-
cy coefficients for the current study were
.95 (motor) and .68 (cognitive).
Demographic and caregiving information 
All participants were administered a
questionnaire about basic demographic
information and details of their caregiving
situation, including amount of additional
help received, therapies provided to spouse,
and prior experience with support groups.
Treatment evaluation
All participants in the experimental con-
dition responded to questions to evaluate
the treatment subjectively, including assess-
ment of specific features of the group, what
they liked most and least, and what they
would change. At the final 6-month follow-
up, participants in the experimental condi-
tion were asked about subsequent use of
written materials and frequency and nature
of ongoing contact with other support group
members. Control participants were asked
about their use and evaluation of the read-
ing materials that were provided to them.
Procedure
Recruitment was carried out over a 4-year
period. Participants reviewed and signed an
Institutional Review Board–approved con-
sent form when agreeing to join the study.
They were assessed with measures of
depression, loneliness, competence, bur-
den, and stress (PPI). Questionnaires were
administered to gather demographic and
caregiving facts. Participants were then ran-
domly assigned to a usual care or the tele-
phone support group intervention condition
and were followed for 6 months to test the
enduring effects of the intervention.
Participants in the experimental condition
were assessed when entering the study

(Time 1), immediately after support group
participation (Time 2), and 6 months after
entering the study (Time 3). Participants in
the usual care condition were assessed
when entering the study (Time 1) and after
6 months (Time 3) only. At Time 2, partici-
pants in the experimental condition also
gave subjective feedback about their expe-
rience in the group; at Time 3, they were
asked about further contact with group
members and use of reading materials pro-
vided to them. At Time 3, participants in the
usual care condition were asked about any
counseling sought during the interim period
and their use of reading materials provided
to them. All assessments were conducted by
members of the research staff via individual
telephone interviews.
The telephone support group met for
eight 1-hour sessions and followed a struc-
tured, psychoeducational format. A group
manual that outlined the eight topics of dis-
cussion was mailed to each participant.
These included: 
•
a session to introduce participants to
one another and the group philosophy, 
•
facts about stroke and caregiving,
•
communicating with your spouse, 
•
dealing with your spouse’s problem-
atic feelings and behavior, 
•
your stress as a caregiver, 
•
taking care of yourself as a caregiver,
•
resources for you in the community
as a caregiver, and 
•
a concluding session for review,
future goal-setting, and termination. 
The manual included an audiotape of a
relaxation procedure and a publication on
stress management. Each participant was
given a list of the stressful problems in
caregiving that they had identified during
the initial assessment. Sixteen groups were
conducted through the course of the study,
with the size of each group varying from
three to six members. Most groups had
two group facilitators who were clinicians
in the areas of psychology, social work, or
nursing. The original protocol called for
in-person luncheons for the first and last
meetings of each group. However, these
in-person meetings became too difficult to
schedule. Consequently, almost all groups
were conducted exclusively by telephone
conference call initiated by the group
facilitators over a period of approximately
8 weeks.
Guidelines were developed and communi-
cated to the participants during the introduc-
tion of each group in order to address the spe-
cial features of telephone conference calls and
to emphasize the peer support component of
the intervention. Confidentiality was stressed
by asking participants to keep private the
personal reactions of others in the group.
When possible, participants were asked to
disable the call waiting feature on their
phone to reduce intrusions. They were also
encouraged to find a private space in their
home during the sessions (away from the
care receiver) so that they could speak freely.
The need for consistent attendance was
emphasized because the presence of each
participant was valued for his or her contri-
butions in the sessions. Participants were
asked to identify themselves when they
spoke during the initial sessions until voice
recognition could be established. Pictures of
the group facilitators were included in the
treatment manual. Finally, to augment the
supportive nature of the intervention, partic-
ipants were encouraged to have contacts
with one another outside of the group meet-
ings; with the group’s permission, a list of
their names, addresses, and phone numbers

was mailed to each of them.
Participants in the control condition
received the same stress management publi-
cation included in the treatment manual as
well as a brief written description of caregiv-
er stress and stroke. All participants in both
conditions were given small mementos (e.g.,
specially designed mugs and cards) of their
participation in the study to help them posi-
tively identify with their role as caregiver and
express gratitude for their time and effort.
Analysis
Objective evaluations
Descriptive statistics and frequencies
were calculated for important sample char-
acteristics, and groups were tested for
equivalence using independent t and chi-
square tests as appropriate. The treatment
and control groups were tested at Time 1 for
equivalence on the dependent variables
using independent t tests for depression,
burden, loneliness, and stress. A Mann-
Whitney U statistic was used to test for
equivalence for competence as this measure
did not meet the assumption of normal dis-
tribution.
Hypothesis 1. Within-group comparisons
for the treatment condition were tested with
repeated-measures analyses of variance
(ANOVAs) over the three time intervals
separately for depression, burden, loneli-
ness, and stress (as measured by the PPI).
The competence scores were not normally
distributed, thus a Friedman’s ANOVA was
performed to test differences in this vari-
able within the treatment group over time.
Hypothesis 2. Despite randomization, the
treatment and control groups were not
equivalent on the outcome measures at
Time 1 (see Table 2). Therefore, difference
scores were calculated on the five depend-
ent variables between Time 1 and Time 3.
Between-group comparisons were per-
formed using the difference scores with
independent t tests for depression, burden,
loneliness, and stress. Because the compe-
tence change scores were not normally dis-
tributed, a Mann-Whitney U statistic was
used to test group difference on this
dependent variable. A repeated-measures
ANOVA was also performed on the stress
measure for all participants having both
Time 1 and Time 3 completed assessments
with group as the independent variable.
Subjective evaluations 
Frequencies were tabulated for specific
questions, and content analysis was com-
pleted for open-ended questions.
Results
Objective evaluation 
As shown in Table 1, the majority of the
sample was white and female with an aver-
age age of nearly 70 years and more than a
high-school education. The participants
were mostly in longstanding marriages with
the stroke survivor and, on average, had
been providing care for nearly 3 years.
However, 25% of the sample had been in
the caregiver role for less than 6 months.
The majority were receiving some help
from outside of the family. The participants
were caring for spouses who needed mini-
mal assistance to supervision overall. The
treatment and control groups were equiva-
lent on most of these characteristics, except
that the caregivers in the treatment group

had spouses who were more motorically
impaired, and they were more frequently
receiving assistance in providing care. 
Despite random assignment, the treat-
ment group was more distressed overall at
the Time 1 assessment with significantly
higher levels of depression, burden, loneli-
ness, and stress and lower sense of compe-
tence (see Table 2). Table 3 shows the
within-group change over time for the treat-
ment group (Hypothesis 1). There were no
significant changes in depression, burden,
loneliness, or competence from entry into
the study (Time 1) to the 6-month follow-up
(Time 3). However, there was a significant
reduction in stress, as measured by the PPI,
over time [F(2, 74) = 5.34, p < .01]. Post
hoc analysis showed the change to be sig-
nificant from Time 1 to Time 2 [t(37) =
2.71, p < .01] and from Time 1 to Time 3
[t(37) = 2.68, p < .05]. Between-group com-
parisons were made on the basis of change
scores, given the lack of group equivalence
at Time 1. As shown in Table 4, there were
no significant differences in the degree of
change between treatment and control
groups for depression, loneliness, or stress.
The group differences in change scores
were significant for burden and competence
[t(86) = -2.40, p <.05, for burden; U = -2.15,
p < .05, for competence]. Compared to the
treatment group, the control participants
showed significantly greater change in bur-
den between Time 1 and Time 3. The treat-
ment participants showed a significant gain
in their sense of competence from Time 1
to Time 3. For the repeated-measures
ANOVA comparing the two groups on
stress over time, there was a significant
effect overall for time [F(1, 80) = 12.47, p
< .01] but no significant interaction
between group and time. 
Subjective support group evaluation and 
6-month follow-up 
Results of specific questions are summa-
rized in Table 5. In general, participants
expressed a high level of satisfaction with
various aspects of the group and, similarly,
felt that most of the characteristics of the
group identified in Table 5 were important.
Only 20% of the participants indicated a
willingness to meet in person. When ques-
tioned about contact with one another out-
side of the group, 27% indicated that they
had spoken with at least one other group
member one or more times while the sup-
port group was in process; at 6-month fol-
low-up, 35% had spoken with another

tacts (81%–82%) were by telephone.
Finally, when questioned at the 6-month
follow-up, 68% of the participants had
referred to the treatment manual and associ-
ated materials at least once.
Treatment condition participants were
questioned about their barriers to in-person
attendance. The vast majority of their com-
ments focused on their inability to obtain
coverage for their spouses’ care needs in
their absence and their inability or unwill-
ingness to travel a distance for in-person
meetings. When questioned about what they
liked most about the group experience, the
participants most frequently identified vari-
ous interpersonal benefits, especially peer
contact. They appreciated the honest,
empathic communication that allowed for
emotional ventilation, comparison with one
another, and the experience of the common-
ality of caregiver problems. Relating to oth-
er participants often brought a downward
comparison in which they experienced
someone else as having a more difficult situ-
ation. Secondarily, participants liked the
content of the intervention, especially the
written materials provided, resources men-
tioned during sessions, solutions to specific
care problems, and the expertise of the group
facilitators.

focused on technical problems associated
with phone use, such as not being able to
hear all of the participants, as well as the
loss of intimacy due to the absence of in-
person contact. Other most frequent criti-
cisms centered on the intervention as a
whole or individual session time being too
short and specific complaints about a dis-
ruptive group member. When asked what
they would like to see changed about the
intervention, participants indicated a desire
to meet in-person while simultaneously
acknowledging the difficulties for them in
doing so. Of equal frequency, participants
commented that they would have liked the
intervention to have been extended, either
by having more meetings or longer sessions.
At 6-month follow-up, 98% of the partic-
ipants in the control condition (n = 43) had
reviewed the reading material sent to them
and 85% (n = 39) rated it as good to excel-
lent. However, when asked about how use-
ful the information was to them, only 36%
(n = 36) could mention at least one coping
strategy drawn from the reading, while 64%
had minimal or nonspecific comments.
Only 19% (n = 32) had any comments
about how the information could have been
made more useful to them.
Discussion
The current study provides limited evi-
dence of the effectiveness of the telephone
conference group format as a means of inter-
vention for caregivers. The study hypotheses
were partially supported. The treatment
group showed a decrease in stress related to
their caregiving problems. However, when
compared to the control group over time, the
magnitude of the change was not significant-
ly different. While the treatment group
remained largely unchanged in the experi-
ence of burden, burden significantly
increased in the control group over time.
Treatment participants also showed signifi-
cant gain in caregiver competence in com-
parison to control participants who remained
relatively unchanged throughout the study
on this outcome variable. The groups were
positively rated by the participants in most
ways, and the study demonstrated the feasi-
bility of conducting this type of structured
group treatment entirely over the phone.
The PPI was the most targeted outcome
measure in the study. The items assessed
came directly from the spouses’ caregiving
experiences, and the participants in the
treatment condition were given their per-
sonal list of problems to which they could
refer during the group sessions. This level
of specificity could have made the stress
measure more sensitive to change. Because
of the open-ended discussion involved in
the measurement, however, the process of
identifying and rating the problems may
have been therapeutic in itself. Thus, the
control participants may have experienced a
beneficial effect from the initial administra-
tion of the measure and subsequent rating
of the same problems. The pattern of
change in burden between the treatment and
control groups suggests that the interven-
tion may have prevented rather than
reduced the accumulation of strain over
time. Only the control participants
increased in burden scores over the study,
while the treatment participants remained
relatively stable. The emotional outlet and
comparison with others provided by the
group may have helped achieve this effect.
In their open-ended comments, participants
noted that they felt free to express them-
selves and spoke “from the heart” and that
76
TOPICS IN STROKE REHABILITATION/WINTER 2003

others often had worse problems. The
increase in the sense of competence in the
caregiving role among treatment partici-
pants may have also been a result of the
content and process of the intervention.
Participants in the groups were able to share
their knowledge and strategies with one
another and obtain affirmation of their con-
tribution to their spouses’
recovery.
Participants noted that they learned from
each other, were allowed to contribute to
the group, and felt they were among equals.
The lack of significant change in depres-
sion and loneliness among the treatment
participants and between the two study con-
ditions may be due to the lack of consistent,
specific focus on these issues in the inter-
vention. It was surprising, however, that the
treatment participants did not show a sig-
nificant decline in loneliness given the
results of prior studies with telephone group
support for the homebound.23,27 Further,
lack of social involvement was one of the
most frequently mentioned types of prob-
lems on the PPI.4 It is possible that the time-
limited phone contact may have been insuf-
ficient 
to 
substantially 
reverse 
the
participants’ sense of isolation. Even
though the group members were encour-
aged to have informal contact with one
another outside of group meetings, only a
minority did so. Also, the disruption of the
marital relationship due to the stroke with
the resulting loss of personal and social
companionship may have been too large a
void to be adequately filled through this
type of peer contact. 
Evaluation by group participants
Similar to the findings of Brown et al.,29
the subjective comments of the treatment
group participants generally reflect a high
rate of satisfaction with the telephone for-
mat and endorsement of the importance of
the program. Within the context of this
broad approval rating, the participants fre-
quently stated a desire for an extended
intervention and were ambivalent about
meeting over the telephone. They com-
plained of difficulty hearing others and
wished they could have met in person,
although 80% stated they could not do so.
The fact that the study was conducted in a
large metropolitan area could have con-
tributed to this ambivalence. Participants
were generally not as widely dispersed as
might be the case in a rural setting. In-per-
son contact was generally possible but was
not very convenient. In the participants’
open-ended comments, the interpersonal
aspects of the group were most frequently
cited as beneficial and the content of the
intervention was less frequently men-
tioned. However, while only a minority of
group participants had additional contact
with one another, a majority continued to
refer to the treatment manual. These con-
tradictory reactions may reflect the limits
of the structure and length of the group. A
psychoeducational, time-limited, group
format over the telephone may not move
beyond initial positive group cohesion to a
more emotionally intimate experience.22
Similarly, the time limit may preclude suf-
ficient integration of the information to
achieve an enduring impact on coping.
Notably, none of the participants com-
mented on the advantage of anonymity
provided by only telephone contact.22 It
may be that caregivers (generally not a
stigmatized group) do not wish for
anonymity but appreciate being known,
especially by others in a similar situation.
Telephone Group Intervention
77

Limited comments from the control group
suggest that they reviewed and appreciated
the written information sent to them, but
without ongoing contact, they may not
have integrated the content into their role
as caregiver in a useful way.
Clinical implications
The study results indicate both the feasi-
bility and limitations of applying this for-
mat to caregivers in the clinical setting.
The appeal of teleconference intervention
lies in the convenience it can offer care-
givers who may feel too constrained by
time and distance to engage in face-to-face
contact. However, the current study sug-
gests limits to the impact one can achieve
when using this form of intervention
exclusively. Combinations of in-person
and telephone sessions to foster relation-
ship building and to reinforce effects over
time may be a reasonable, more powerful
alternative. Continuing technological
advances that include visual input (such as
video conferencing) will add other options
to combine with traditional in-person gath-
erings. In the telephone group format, it
appears that structured sessions and asso-
ciated written material and use of group
leaders comfortable with the format all
contribute to a successful subjective expe-
rience for the participants.
Further, some of the caregivers in this
study had been in their role for many years
and had also provided care to their parents
in the past. As caregivers, their coping pat-
terns had stabilized and they were difficult
to modify. This observation suggests that
early intervention when caregivers are
establishing their role behavior may have a
greater impact
There are several limitations that should
be considered in interpreting the results of
this study. The sample of caregivers had
spouses who, on average, were not experi-
encing severe impairments from their
stroke and the majority were receiving
additional, outside assistance. In addition,
caregivers were not selected on the basis of
their level of distress. These characteristics
may have diminished the impact of certain
aspects of the intervention. Sampling was
also restricted to older spouses who have
been found to benefit less from interven-
tions than adult children.17 The intervention
design and choice of assessments may have
been too general despite efforts at increas-
ing specificity. The treatment program was
ambitious in its scope considering the limit-
ed number of sessions. As confirmation of
the latter limitation, the group participants
expressed a desire for more contact in their
evaluative comments. A more exclusive
focus (such as coaching of a particular skill
or management of mood) may have been a
more realistic approach for a successful
impact in a short time frame. Finally, the
attention and materials provided to the con-
trol group may have been sufficient to
lessen the difference between the two con-
ditions and the resulting outcomes.
Future research will be important in fur-
ther developing this form of intervention to
address the needs of stroke caregivers.
Evaluation of combinations of formats and
greater specification in both interventions
and assessment are necessary. Innovative
approaches to respite care are needed to free
caregivers to obtain help for themselves. The
identification of characteristics that differen-
tiate those caregivers who might be more
78

Study limitations and future research needs

receptive to teleconference versus in-person
contact would also be useful to encourage
caregivers to access help. For example, the
stressed caregiver who is reluctant to accept
help might be persuaded to join a telephone
group because of its convenience and
anonymity. After having a positive experi-
ence in this format, they might be encour-
aged to access in-person support. Finally, the
problems of the study illustrate the ongoing
need to refine design and measurement in
caregiver stress research in order to deter-
mine how to best assist and sustain the grow-
ing number of family caregivers who are an
essential, but fragile and often neglected,
component of long-term care after stroke.
