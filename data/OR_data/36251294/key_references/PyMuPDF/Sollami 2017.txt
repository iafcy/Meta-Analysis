Abstract. Background and Aim: There has recently been a growing interest towards patients’ affective and 
emotional needs, especially in relational therapies, which are considered vital as to increase the understanding 
of those needs and patients’ well-being. In particular, we paid attention to those patients who are forced to 
spend the last phase of their existence in residential facilities, namely elderly people in nursing homes, who 
often feel marginalized, useless, depressed, unstimulated or unable to communicate. The aim of this study 
is to verify the effectiveness of pet therapy in improving well-being in the elderly living in a nursing home. 
Methods: This is a longitudinal study with before and after intervention variables measurement in two groups 
of patients of a nursing home for elderly people. One group followed an AAI intervention (experimental 
group) the other one did not (control group). As to perform an assessment of well-being we measured the 
following dimensions in patients: anxiety (HAM-A), depression (GDS), apathy (AES), loneliness (UCLA), 
and quality of life (QUALID). Both groups filled the questionnaires as to measure the target variables (time 
0). Once finished the scheduled meetings (time 1), all the participants, including the control group, filled the 
same questionnaires. Results: In accordance with scientific evidence the results confirmed a significant reduc­
tion of the measured variables. Especially for the quality of life, which showed a greater reduction than the 
other. Conclusions: The implementation and success of the Pet Therapy could have a great emotional and social 
impact, bringing relief to patients and their family members, but also to health professionals.

Introduction
There has recently been a growing interest to­
wards patients’ affective and emotional needs, espe­
cially in relational therapies, which are considered vital 
as to increase the understanding of those needs and 
patients’ well-being. In particular, we paid attention to 
those patients who are forced to spend the last phase of 
their existence in residential facilities, namely elderly 
people in nursing homes, who often feel marginalized, 
useless, depressed, unstimulated or unable to commu­
nicate. The willingness of taking care of another living 
being could be described as an intrinsic need of hu­
man nature, whose satisfaction might bring substantial 
benefits to patients and especially in geriatrics. Not­
withstanding, we noted how this connection has barely 
been studied as of today (1).
In recent decades, the conception of human-ani­
mal relationship has substantially changed and evolved 
in a stronger awareness of the benefits that such con­
nection may bring, in particular to children, to the el­
derly or to people suffering from physical and mental 
illness. The relationship with a pet, which has always 
been invested with an emotional role, has recently been 
re-evaluated, thanks to methodological structures and 
therapeutic applications targeted to specific diseases (2).
These interventions, used as a support to tradi­
tional therapies (defined co-therapies), are performed 

A. Sollami, E. Gianferrari, M. Alfieri, et al.
26
by a multi-professional team with trained animals and 
are individually tailored on each patient.
The expression “Pet therapy” relates to those 
therapies or health care activities performed with the 
decisive involvement of a pet. The proper definition of 
the above-mentioned treatment is “Animal Assisted 
Interventions” (AAI) and have therapeutic, rehabilita­
tive, educational and recreational function (3). These 
interventions mainly target people with physical (neu­
romotor control function), mental and psychic disor­
ders, but can also be directed to healthy individuals (3).
The correct application of AAI requires the in­
volvement of a multidisciplinary team composed, ac­
cording to the type of intervention, by health, educa­
tional and technical professionals with different tasks 
and responsibilities (3). In this environment, nurses 
can and must integrate themselves with their specific­
ity, with a holistic approach to patients’ care. Pet Ther­
apy is not only referred to animal’s activities, but it also 
relates to the work of a team composed by the pet, the 
conductor as well as the nurse. It is the nurse’s duty to 
know how and when it is necessary to implement the 
activities, which are proposed (and never imposed!) to 
the patients and to evaluate the activities effectiveness 
(4). Moreover, the animal improves not only the pa­
tient’s condition during his hospital stay, but also the 
nurse’s: it can certainly relief for a few hours stress and 
routine 9. The nurse must identify final and intermedi­
ate subjective goals to perform ongoing checks of suc­
cesses and failures of the program, through a constant 
measuring of its effectiveness, its results and any aris­
ing issue throughout the intervention cycle (4).
Pet Therapy and the elderly in nursing home
In the geriatric population, interaction with ani­
mals seems not only to reduce behavioral disorders 
(e.g. agitation, aggression), stress and mood disorders 
(anxiety, apathy, depression) but also to stimulate some 
residual cognitive function (5). In particular, previ­
ous research shows a significant benefit on long-term 
memory, linked to the stimulation of previous memo­
ries, on verbal and nonverbal communication, as well 
as on sensory stimulation. In the meantime, it satisfies 
some basic human needs such as attention and affec­
tion feelings (6).
A research leaded by Berry and his colleagues 
evaluated the effectiveness of time spent with dogs in 
improving mood, facilitating social interaction and de­
creasing apathy in the elderly living in a nursing home. 
Results showed an increase in positive behaviors like 
smiles, willingness to communicate and spontane­
ous interaction with dogs. They also found that the 
human-dog interaction could effectively reduce social 
isolation (7). Another study conducted by Colombo 
(8) and colleagues showed that the presence of a canary 
bird, brought psychological benefits to the elderly who 
took care of it. At the end of the intervention, patients 
showed reduced depression and anxiety and less obses­
sive-compulsive disorders (9). Another survey evalu­
ated the effects of the presence of animals on perceived 
loneliness. Patients were asked to interact three times 
a week for six months with four dogs. Patients showed 
a significantly lower score in the “UCLA Loneliness 
Scale” both during and after the intervention (10). 
Other studies explored the effects of pets on the 
elderly with dementia. A study conducted by Chemiak 
(11), assessed the effectiveness of pet therapy on cog­
nitive status and mood in the elderly with cognitive 
impairment. Participants were asked to walk, play and 
pet a dog. Results showed that the animal’s presence 
fostered less agitation and more prosocial behaviors. 
Nordgren and Engström in another study, evaluated 
the effect of AAI on the behavioral and psychological 
symptoms of dementia. They found decreased levels of 
depression, improved memory functions and increased 
motivation for physical activity (12). Another research 
showed an important increase in nutrition and body 
weight in some patients with Alzheimer’s disease af­
ter the introduction of an aquarium in the dining room 
(13). Also Mossello (14) analyzed the condition of 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and he noted, after 
three weeks of visits with a trained dog, a substantial 
improvement of anxiety and sadness in patients, as well 
as a general level of arousal, motor and vocal expression. 
Another pilot study evaluated the effects of AAI on the 
quality of life (QoL) in people with dementia in four 
nursing homes, showing an improvement of QoL (15).
It is interesting that the above-mentioned studies 
always refer to a single dimension of patients’ wellbe­
ing, and we could not find a study focusing on multiple 
dimensions of well-being.

Pet therapy in a nursing home

Aim of the study and initial assumptions
The aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness 
of pet therapy in improving well-being in the elderly 
living in a nursing home.
As to perform an assessment of well-being we 
measured the following dimensions in patients: anxi­
ety, depression, apathy, loneliness, and quality of life.
The initial assumption is that after a pet therapy 
intervention, in the experimental group the levels of 
the measured dimensions will be lower than in the 
control group.
Methodology
Study design
This is a longitudinal study with before and af­
ter intervention variables measurement in two groups 
of patients of a nursing home for elderly people. One 
group followed an AAI intervention (experimental 
group) the other one did not (control group).
Procedure/Participants
In May 2016, the project called: “The dog is my 
co-therapist” was presented to the guests of a nurs­
ing home near Reggio Emilia (Italy). It was afterwards 
delivered an information sheet and an informed con­
sent form. Each patient was asked to sign the informed 
consent to take part to the study. As to evaluate the 
number of participants, we performed a t-test of two 
independent samples using the G * Power 3.1.9.2 soft­
ware. 
Twenty eight guests where included in the study 
program, all meeting the following inclusion criteria: 
older than 60, Italian native speakers, mild or absent 
cognitive impairment (assessed using Mini -Men­
tal State Examination - MMSE -) (16), more than 
2 months of permanence in the nursing home, inter­
ested in the interaction with a dog. Exclusion criteria, 
as to safeguard patients, were: the presence of allergies, 
asthma, phobia, wounds, severe aggression attitude or 
being bedridden. Patients were therefore randomly 
assigned to the experimental or to the control group 
(14 for each group). Both groups filled the question­
naires as to measure the target variables (time 0). The 
control group carried out the normal activities in the 
nursing home, while the experimental group had 16 
AAI meetings: 2 times a week, with one hour sessions. 
The chosen animal was a dog trained and certified as 
suitable for Pet Therapy, with previous health and be­
havioral assessment. 
Once finished the scheduled meetings (time 1), 
all the participants, including the control group, filled 
the same questionnaires.
Intervention
During the AAI were firstly performed introduc­
tory sessions, as to introduce the dog and the operator 
to the participants. At a second stage, caregiving ac­
tivities were gradually performed, which included the 
filling of the basic needs, as nutrition and care of the 
dog’s coat to arouse a sense of safety and privacy thus 
reducing nervous tension. Afterwards, as a practical 
exercise, participants were taught the correct method 
of physically interacting with the dog, aimed to stimu­
late the manipulation. Participants were asked to use 
tools, such as brushes, to avoid focusing on their per­
sonal needs while giving instead attention to the ani­
mal through an increased empathy. Participants played 
fun activities with the dog such as fetch games, hidden 
objects searches, fun dramas, giving basic and complex 
orders to the animal and walking with the dog. The last 
step of the intervention was the re-elaboration of the 
experience, which was stimulated in the participants 
using the recognition tools, representations, images, 
and words.
Measured variables
Depression
In order to assess the depressive symptoms we 
used the Geriatric Depression Scale - GDS (17). This 
instrument consists of 15 items (e.g. Do you feel pretty 
worthless the way you are now?). Answers are on a di­
chotomous scale (1=yes; 2=no). In our study, we found 

A. Sollami, E. Gianferrari, M. Alfieri, et al.
28
an excellent internal reliability (Cronbach’s α=0.81). 
The total score is made by the sum of the answers (0 
to 5=not depressed; 6 to 10=mild depression; 11 to 
15=maximum severity of depression).
Apathy
In order to assess the level of apathy we used the 
Apathy Evaluation Scale - AES (18). This instrument 
consists of 18 items (e.g. “Are you interested in new 
experiences?”). Answers are a Likert-type scale with 
three positions (from 0=not at all to 3=very much). The 
scale identifies three factors: behavioral (Cronbach’s 
α=00:47), cognitive (Cronbach’s α=0.78), emotional 
(Cronbach’s α=0.65). The total score is the sum of the 
scores for each factor (0 to 13 absence of apathy; 14 to 
26 mild apathy; 27 to 39 moderate apathy; more than 
39 severe apathy). The scale has a high total reliability 
(Cronbach’s α=0.85).
Quality of Life
In order to assess the quality of life we used 
the Quality of Life Scale In Late-Stage Dementia 
(QUALID) (19). This scale measures the frequency of 
target behavior or an attitude in the last two weeks. 
This instrument consists of 11 items whose answers 
are on a 5-position type Likert scale (0=never to 5=al­
ways). The scale identifies three factors: discomfort 
(Cronbach’s α=0.80; e.g. “Makes statements or sounds 
that suggest discontent, unhappiness, or discomfort”), 
social interaction (Cronbach’s α=0.74; e.g. “Enjoys in­
teracting or being with others”) and depression (Cron­
bach’s α=0.74; e.g. “Appears sad”). The total score is 
the sum of the answer to each item and it goes from 0 
(best quality of life) to 55 (worst quality of life). The 
total reliability is good (Cronbach’s α=0.70).
Anxiety
In order to assess the level of anxiety we used the 
Hamilton Anxiety Scale - HAM-A (20). This scale’s 
purpose is measuring feelings experienced by the indi­
vidual in the last week, focusing particularly on the sub­
jective experience. It consists of 14 items, and each item 
is a cluster that collects different symptoms (e.g. fears, 
insomnia). The answers are on a Likert-type five-point 
scale (from 0=absent to 5=very severe) (Cronbach’s 
α=0.88). The total score is the sum of the answers to 
each item (0 to 13=no anxiety; 14 o 27=mild anxiety; 
28 to 41=moderate anxiety; 42 to 56=severe anxiety).
Loneliness
In order to assess loneliness, we used the Loneli­
ness Scale - UCLA (21). This tool is mono-factorial 
(Cronbach’s α=0.89) and it consists of 20 items (e.g. “I 
feel completely alone”). The answers are on a Likert-
type scale with four positions (0=never to 4=always). 
The total score is the sum of the answers to each item 
(10 to 19=no loneliness; 20 to 25=mild loneliness; 26 
to 30=moderate loneliness; 31 to 40=severe loneliness).
Data analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 23 
software (© IBM). We used Wilcoxon test to evaluate 
the effect of AAI; we used Mann-Whitney test and to 
evaluate differences between experimental and control 
group.
Results
The characteristics of participants of both groups, 
such as cognitive impairment, age and length of hospi­
tal stay, are shown in Table 1.
Before-after AAI intervention analysis
As to evaluate the effect of the pet therapy inter­
vention we performed a statistical analysis using the 
mean before and after intervention values ​​in the ex­
perimental group (Tab. 2).
The difference between the means (Delta post_
pre) was negative, which means that the after -inter­
vention values ​are lower than pre-intervention ones, in 
line with the initial assumptions. Statistical tests show 
that this difference is significant for each variable.
Apathy (AES) and quality of life (QUALID) 
scales are composed by several factors. The mean of 
these factors showed the significant difference in the 

Pet therapy in a nursing home
29
experimental group before and after the treatment. In 
particular, the factors cognitive and emotional in apa­
thy and depression, discomfort and social interactions 
in quality of life (Tab. 3).
Differences between experimental and control group
As to assess the difference in means between 
the two groups we used the statistical test of Mann-
Whitney. Table 4 shows how the values reported by 
the experimental group are lower than those found in 
the control group.
Discussion
Collected data fully confirmed the initial assump­
tions. Considering the variable Quality of Life, we reg­
istered the biggest difference before-after AAI inter­
vention (Δ post-pre=-8,86; Z=-3,3; p=0,001).

Above mentioned data seems to suggest that pa­
tients in the experimental group improved their percep­
tion of quality of life. Also, considering the factors that 
compose the scale we found significant improvements, 
such as: a lower perception of discomfort (Δ post-
pre=-4,21; Z=-3,304; p=0,001), lower depression (Δ 
post-pre=-1,57; Z=-3,236; p=0,001), better social posi­
tive interaction (Δ post-pre=-3,07; Z=-3,341; p=0,001). 
This finding is also supported by the loneliness 
variable, which had a significant improvement (Δ post-
pre=-5,57; Z=-3,301; p=0,001) with a decrease of the 
mean overall score (M-pre=50,00 a M-post=44,43). 
Also for the variable anxiety, we found the same de­
crease in the mean score (Δ post-pre=-5,50; Z=-3,311; 
p=0,001), indicating a decreased perception of anxiety.
Also for apathy, we found the same overall trend 
(M-pre=29,36 a M-post=23,93), with a shift from ini­
tial moderate apathy (27-39) to mild apathy (14-26) 
(Δ post-pre=-5,43; Z=-3,183; p=0,001).
Moreover, still in apathy, we found a significant 
improvement in cognitive apathy (Δ post-pre=-4,00; 
Z=-3,313; p=0,001) and emotional apathy (Δ post-
pre=-1,07; Z=-2,303; p=0,021).
Conclusion
The presence of the dog during the intervention 
facilitated social activities, acting as a catalyst for inter­
personal relationships. In fact, the elders were pleased, 
stimulated and they really had fun dealing with the 
animal, during game phases, such as fetch games, as 
well as during caring activities.
An increasingly active participation was also not­
ed in those patients who were initially wary and iso­
lated: they got better integrated and socialized thanks 
to the ability of the dog as well as of the operators who 
actively involved them.
From a psycho-affective point of view, we can 
consider this intervention effective, since it generated 
the assumed “emotional contagion”: participants were 
involved in an emotional collective participation and 
in a deeper feeling of belonging and sharing. The rela­
tionship with the dog stimulated communication and 
proper explanation of words or phrases. In fact, guests 
spoke more spontaneously and more adequately, im­
proving, albeit in a specific context, their relationship 
with the external world.
We are fully conscious of the limited range of this 
research, but it is necessary in our view to continue 
on this track, working on the evaluation of the ther­
apy’s effectiveness, and investigating the mechanisms 
underlying this phenomenon For a better analysis of 
the AAI effects, it might be interesting to use a search 
“Mixed Method”, in order to analyze qualitative vari­
ables thus getting a more complex framework.
As suggested by several authors (4, 6, 12), it would 
be interesting to expand the research focus from pa­
tients’ well-being to health professionals’. The imple­
mentation and success of the Pet Therapy could have 
a great emotional and social impact, bringing relief to 
patients and their family members, but also to health 
professionals. Recently, much has been written on the 
holistic vision of the man in the framework of care and 
support: Pet therapy could be considered as a resource 
that the nurse (but not only) could use to provide a

more effective assistance to the patient. The health 
professional would obviously need to acquire specific 
skills as to work with Pet Therapy, as for other speciali­
zations. Pet Therapy could be listed together with oth­
er effective therapies such as the “Touch Therapy” or 
the “Behavioral Cognitive Therapy”, where a team of 
health professionals acts closely for patient’s “health” 
according to each professional expertise. It is, there­
fore, desirable to continue and strengthen the research 
activities in this field with such potentially incisive re­
percussions on several social aspects. 
Limitations
The results of this study should be interpreted 
with caution because of its methodological limita­
tions. The small sample size, taking into account only 
a structure and the diversity of disease, prevents the 
generalization of the observed effects. Also, the time 
factor is not to be omitted, since the project was car­
ried out during a little number of meetings and altered 
temporal continuity. Also, other variables, like quan­
titative variables, should be considered for the assess­
ment in future research.
