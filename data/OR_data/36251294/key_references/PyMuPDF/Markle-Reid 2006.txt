Health promotion for frail older home care clients
Aim. This paper reports a study evaluating the comparative effects and costs of a
proactive nursing health promotion intervention in addition to usual home care for
older people compared with usual home care services alone.
Background. An ageing population, budget constraints and technological advances
in many countries have increased the pressure on home care resources. The result is
a shift in nursing services from health promotion to meet the more pressing need for
postacute care. For frail older people with long-term needs, these changes combine
to create a fragmented system of health service delivery, characterized by providing
nursing on demand rather than proactively.
Methods. A two-armed, single-blind, randomized controlled trial was carried out
with older people ‡75 years and eligible for personal support services through a
home care programme in Ontario, Canada. Participants were randomly allocated
either to usual home care (control) or to a nursing (experimental) group. In addition
to usual home care, the nursing group received a health assessment combined with
regular home visits or telephone contacts, health education about management of
illness, coordination of community services, and use of empowerment strategies to
enhance independence. The data were collected in 2001–2002.
Results. Of the 288 older people who were randomly allocated at baseline, 242
(84%) completed the study (120 nursing group; 122 control group). Proactively

(P ¼ 0Æ009), a reduction in depression (P ¼ 0Æ009), and enhanced perceptions of
social support (P ¼ 0Æ009) at no additional cost from a societal perspective.
Conclusions. Home based nursing health promotion, proactively provided to frail
older people with chronic health needs, enhances quality of life while not increasing
the overall costs of health care. The results underscore the need to re-invest in
nursing services for health promotion for older clients receiving home care.

Introduction
An ageing population, technological advances and budget
constraints have led to major healthcare reforms worldwide.
Extensive reform initiatives have given rise to fewer acute
care hospitals and increasing pressure to continue to expand
and enhance home care services for older, more vulnerable,
and
frail
individuals
within
the
conﬁnes
of
economic
constraint (Bergman et al. 1997, Anderson & Hussey 2000,
United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
Population Division 2002). Formal home care has expanded,
such that the proportion of persons over 65 receiving home
care now substantially outweighs the proportion receiving
health services through residential institutions (Anderson &
Hussey 2000). The result of these trends is increasing
competition for scarce home care resources. Home care
programmes have responded to this increased demand for
their services by shifting the provision of care from health
promotion and preventive functions, for individuals with
chronic health needs, to substitution functions to meet the
more pressing need for postacute care (Soderstrom et al.
1999, Merlis 2000). Notably, nursing is the professional
service most frequently reported as being reduced or elimin-
ated by home care programmes for older people with chronic
needs (Phillips 1988, Canadian Nurses Association 1998).
Substitution of relatively inexpensive home care nursing
services for inpatient acute care offers the prospect of
considerable cost savings, as well as improved health
outcomes (Soderstrom et al. 1999, Johri et al. 2003).Yet
the efﬁciency resulting from this shift from preventive nursing
functions to acute care substitution functions remains unclear
(Parr 1996, Jacobzone 2000). On the contrary, a number of
studies, done mostly in a national system of health insurance,
suggest that for older people with chronic health needs, these
trends combine to create a fragmented system of healthcare
delivery,
characterized
by
providing
health
services
on-demand rather than a comprehensive and proactive
system of care (Browne et al. 2001b, Johri et al. 2003).
Typically, on-demand care is less effective and more costly
than providing comprehensive care. Delays or errors in
detecting and responding to chronically ill older people’s
changing health needs can contribute to more complications,
cause functional decline and negative changes in quality of
life (Fletcher & Bulpitt 2000), and an increased demand for
healthcare services (Browne et al. 2001b).
Older adults, and in particular frail older adults, are
particularly vulnerable. In Canada, 75–80% of home care
users are older adults (Roos et al. 2001). They are typically
over 75 years of age, and have co-occurring health problems,
which are acute and chronic in nature, as well as functional
disabilities. Their social support networks are frequently
overextended or at risk of breaking down (Johri et al. 2003).
Additionally, the prevalence of depression among those
receiving home care is estimated to be between 26% and
44% – at least twice that among older people in general (Illife
et al. 1993). These factors lead to comparatively greater risk
for increased morbidity, institutional and general health
service utilization and death (Gill & Sharpe 1999).
Recent reports on the future direction of health policy in
Canada (Kirby & LeBreton 2002, Romanow 2002, Health
Canada 2003) emphasize the need to coordinate and target
home care services based on evidence about the most
beneﬁcial and efﬁcient mix of services (type of provider and
dose). This evidence is needed to ensure that the most
appropriate services are available to those who most need
them, to ensure the best health outcomes (Shapiro 2003).
However, there is little information available to inform policy
makers as they attempt to restructure how home care services
are provided (Soderstrom et al. 1999, Fassbender 2000).
Background
Home care nurses are well placed to promote the health of
frail older people and carry out preventive functions (Byles
2000, Elkan et al. 2001). Although there is promising
evidence from trials conducted to evaluate the effects and

costs of preventive in-home nursing care of older people in
terms of reducing hospital admissions and lengths of stay
(Hendriksen et al. 1984, Zimmer et al. 1985, Hall et al. 1992,
Pathy et al. 1992, Bernabei et al. 1998), improving functional
status (Pathy et al. 1992, Stuck et al. 1995, Bernabei et al.
1998, Stuck et al. 2000), reducing mortality (Hendriksen et al.
1984, Vetter et al. 1984, Hall et al. 1992, Pathy et al. 1992),
decreasing admission to long-term institutional care (Gunner-
Svensson et al. 1984, Zimmer et al. 1985, Hall et al. 1992,
Stuck et al. 1995, Bernabei et al. 1998,), reducing depression
(Bernabei et al. 1998), increasing use of health and social
services (Hendriksen et al. 1984, Vetter et al. 1984, Pathy et al.
1992, van Rossum et al. 1993, Stuck et al. 1995, 2000),
reducing cost (Hendriksen et al. 1984, Zimmer et al. 1985,
Stuck et al. 1995, Bernabei et al. 1998, Stuck et al. 2000), and
improving caregiver outcomes (Zimmer et al. 1985), there are
methodological shortcomings in many of these studies.
There is a lack of research that documents the effectiveness
of an in-home health promotion intervention on quality of
life, mental health (depression), perceptions of social support,
or examines speciﬁc sub-groups of home care recipients who
beneﬁt most (Markle-Reid 2002). Although several of the
studies suggested cost savings, the costs are limited to
reductions in admissions to institutions rather than examin-
ing the use and costs of the full range of health services.
Economists argue that the effect of a home care service on
society as a whole should be considered when making
decisions about the use of that service (Gold et al. 1996).
The interventions in these trials are limited in their primary
focus on preventive care strategies rather than on health
promotion. To date, research in this area has largely taken a
deﬁcit approach, focussing on illness and disease prevention
strategies, to minimize the risks of chronic diseases and
debilitation associated with ageing (Pender et al. 2002) vs. a
strengths orientation focussing on health promotion and
expanding an individual’s positive potential for health (Caelli
et al. 2003). Yet the data suggests that a combination of
approaches is needed to enhance health and well-being and
contribute to maximizing older person’s independence (Hodg-
son et al. 1996, World Health Organization 1998, McWilliam
et al. 2000). Furthermore, many of the interventions are
staffed by different types of providers in addition to nursing
(i.e. lay community workers and geriatricians), thus, limiting
their ability to identify how the type and quality of nursing
involvement contributes to the outcomes of the studies.
This study was designed to address these gaps in know-
ledge by examining the comparative effects and costs of a
proactive nursing health promotion intervention for frail
older home care clients in addition to usual home care,
compared with usual home care services alone. The rationing
of professional nursing services for home care clients with
chronic needs allowed for a natural comparison of the effects
of a proactive service with the effects of on-demand use of
these services. Our hypothesis was that this model of care
delivery would result in improved functional health status
and quality of life, a reduction in depression, and an increase
in coping and perceptions of social support at no additional
cost from a societal point of view.
Conceptual model
The model of vulnerability (Rogers 1997) provided the
theoretical basis for the development and evaluation of a
proactive nursing health promotion intervention. Vulnerab-
ility is a net result of an interaction between the person’s
personal resources (cognitive, emotional, intellectual and
behavioural)
and
their
environmental
supports
(social,
material and cultural), both of which, along with biological
characteristics (age, gender and genetic endowment), are
determinants of health. Within an individual, personal
resources and environmental supports intersect, as shown in
Figure 1, and can be synergistic and cumulative (Browne et al.
2001b). The base of the triangle represents the degree of
vulnerability (Rogers 1997), and thus also their health status
and quality of life. Based on published evidence (Browne
et al. 1999), we hypothesized that the costs of health and

social services increase proportionately with the level of
vulnerability. Thus, the original model of vulnerability
developed by Rogers (1997) was extended to include a
health services index.
The study
Aim
The aim of the study was to evaluate the comparative effects
and costs of a proactive nursing health promotion interven-
tion in addition to usual home care for older people
compared with usual home care services alone.
Design
This was a two-armed, single-blind, randomized controlled
trial of proactive nursing health promotion in addition to
usual home care vs. usual home care services alone for frail
older people. Eligible and consenting participants were
randomized to one of two treatment strategies, using a
computerized
randomization
schedule,
which
randomly
assigns subjects to two groups to ensure equal numbers at
baseline in both groups. The data were collected in 2001–
2002.
Power calculation
The sample size was calculated to detect a clinically import-
ant difference of ﬁve points in mean change scores between
groups in the SF-36 mental health component summary score
(Ware & Kosinski 2001). A sample size of 276 (138 older
people per arm) was estimated to be sufﬁcient to address this
primary outcome including an allowance of an additional
20% to offset drop-outs (two-tailed alpha ¼ 0Æ05; be-
ta ¼ 0Æ20).
Participants
Study participants were 75 years of age or older and newly
referred
to
and
eligible
for
personal
support
services
through the Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) in
Ontario, Canada. The CCAC provides publicly funded
home care using a contractual model of service delivery. In
this model, publicly funded employees (case managers)
contract out home care services to agencies which provide
care to clients. CCACs also provide long-term care facility
placement, and information and referral to other commu-
nity services (Coyte & Young 1999). Individuals were
eligible
for
personal
support
services
if
they
required
assistance
with
personal
care.
Personal
care
may
be
provided either by a caregiver or a personal support
worker contracted by the CCAC. Potential study partici-
pants were excluded if they refused to give informed
consent, were unable to understand English or if they were
deemed eligible for nursing services. At study start-up, 63%
of CCAC clients eligible for personal support services in
this CCAC were 75 years of age and older.
Interventions
Both study groups received usual home care services. The
interventions are described below.
Usual home care services
Home care services in Ontario, Canada consisted of case
management, personal care, home support (or homemaking),
nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social work
and speech language therapy through community-based
agencies (MacAdam 2000). While this full array of services
was in place, funding cutbacks during the time of the study
resulted in rationing and waiting lists for both professional
and non-professional home care services. The CCAC Case
Manager determined eligibility and priority level for home
care services and the amount and type of home care services
required based on set criteria. Because of growing caseloads
(ratio of 1:150 case managers to clients at study start-up),
there was minimal case planning available for study partici-
pants.
Nursing group: proactive nursing health promotion
A detailed description of the intervention can be found
elsewhere (Markle-Reid 2002). The model of vulnerability
provided the conceptual approach to the study intervention
(Rogers 1997). The main goal of the intervention was to
bolster the participant’s personal resources and environ-
mental supports in order to reduce the level of vulnerab-
ility, enhance health and quality of life, and reduce the
on-demand
use
of
expensive
healthcare
resources.
A
Registered Nurse from a community-nursing agency visited
the home or contacted participants by phone over a
6-month period. The nurses had basic education and held a
general class registration license through the College of
Nurses of Ontario. Strategies for bolstering personal re-
sources included: conducting an initial and ongoing health
assessment,
identifying
and
managing
risk
factors
for
functional decline (i.e. depression, dementia, polypharmacy
and co-occurring illnesses) (Stuck et al. 1999), and provi-
ding health education regarding healthy lifestyles, and
the management of chronic illnesses using a participatory

approach. A participatory approach to enhancing health
involved the use of empowerment strategies designed to
promote positive attitudes, knowledge and skills to main-
tain and enhance health (Maville & Huerta 2002), and
enhance self-efﬁcacy and participation (McWilliam et al.
2000). Strategies for bolstering environmental supports
included referral to and coordination of community servi-
ces, building a trusting, supportive and meaningful rela-
tionship
with
the
client
and
his/her
caregiver,
and
providing
caregiver
support.
Factors
inﬂuencing
health
were identiﬁed and addressed together with clients, through
the development of a health plan, which included speciﬁc
short-term and 6-month goals.
Data collection
Trained interviewers, blinded to the purpose of the study and
the treatment assignment, obtained baseline (prerandomiza-
tion) and follow-up outcome assessments at 6 months from
the participants. Data were collected from February 2001 to
June 2002. Table 1 shows the study variables and their
measures. Participants completed the questionnaires at struc-
tured in-home interviews.
Participant characteristics
Sociodemographic information was obtained at baseline,
including age, gender, education, culture, income, living
arrangements and medical diagnosis.
Engagement rate (measure of dose of intervention)
For the nursing health promotion intervention, engagement
was deﬁned as at least one home visit or telephone contact
that lasted for ‡10 minutes.
Functional health status and quality of life
Functional health status and related quality of life were
assessed using the Medical Outcome Study Short Form
(SF-36) Health Survey (Ware et al. 2000). Several studies
using the SF-36 have established content, concurrent, con-
struct, criterion and predictive validity of the measure in a
variety
of
client
populations,
including
older
people
(McHorney et al. 1993, 1994). The SF-36 consists of eight
scales that assess the following dimensions of health: phys-
ical functioning, role limitations related to physical prob-
lems, bodily pain, general health perception, energy/vitality,
social functioning, and role limitations related to emotional
problems and mental health (Ware & Gandek 1998). Each
of these eight scales is scored separately on a scale of 0–100,
the higher the score, the more favourable the health status.
These eight scales contribute to two summary scores, the
Physical Health Component Summary and Mental Health
Component Summary (Ware & Kosinski 2001) that are
reliable and reﬂect of the eight dimensions (Jenkinson et al.
1997).
Mental health (presence of depression)
Mental health (presence of depression) was assessed using the
Center for Epidemiological Studies in Depression Scale (CES-
D) (Radloff 1977). The CES-D scale is a 20-item self-reported
questionnaire that assesses the current frequency of depres-
sive symptoms. Total scores can range from 0 to 60; the
higher the score, the more depressed. It was chosen as a
measure of depression because of its applicability to the
population (Davidson et al. 1994, Irwin et al. 1999), prior
use in studies of adults with mood disorders (Davidson et al.
1994, Roberts et al. 1997), high degree of reliability
(Himmelfarb & Murrell 1983), and validity (Santor et al.

1995). In support of its validity, the CES-D has been shown
to have good internal consistency for the general population
(Corcoran & Fisher 1987) correlates strongly with the Beck
Depression Inventory (Santor et al. 1995), and distinguishes
between depressed vs. non-depressed people (Schein &
Koenig 1997).
Perceived social support
Perception of social support (subjective) was assessed using
the Personal Resource Questionnaire 85 (part two) (Weinert
& Brandt 1987). The PRQ85 – part two is a 25-item scale
that measures perceived social support along ﬁve dimensions:
provision
for
attachment/intimacy,
social
integration,
opportunity for nurturing behaviour, reassurance of worth as
an individual and in role accomplishments, and the availab-
ility of informational, emotional and material help. The total
scale score was calculated and reported for each participant.
The maximum score that can be attained is 175 – the greater
the score, the greater the perception of social support. This
measure was chosen because of its applicability to the pop-
ulation, prior use in studies involving older adults, and high
degree of reliability, construct and content validity (Weinert
& Brandt 1987).
Coping style
Coping style was assessed using the coping questionnaire
(Moos et al. 1985). The coping questionnaire focuses on
the cognitive and behavioural coping responses that indi-
viduals use when a stressful event has occurred. Respond-
ents are asked to rate their frequency of use of 33 different
coping responses. Responses are classiﬁed into two major
categories: the method of coping (active cognitive coping,
active behavioural coping and avoidance coping), and the
focus of coping (problem solving, logical analysis, emo-
tional distress, affective regulation and information seek-
ing). In support of its validity, the coping questionnaire has
been shown to have good internal consistency, and con-
struct validity based on a general population (Moos et al.
1985).
Costs
The Health and Social Service Utilization Inventory was used
to tally the frequency of self-reported use of all types of health
services by study participants in the previous 2 weeks
(Browne et al. 2001a). The 2-week frequency was annualized
and multiplied by the dollar value of the service and summed
as a per person dollar measure of utilization compared
between the two groups. This measure has been previously
tested and assessed for reliability and validity (Browne et al.
2001a).
Ethical considerations
Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the
McMaster
University
Research
and
Ethics
Board
and
renewed yearly as required. Informed consent was obtained
from all study participants. An information letter outlining
the purpose of the study, expectations of the participants, and
beneﬁts and risks, were given to potential participants prior
to obtaining consent. Participants were assured that their
decision about participation would not affect the care and
services they would receive from the CCAC. They were
assured that the data would be reported in aggregate form
without the ability to identify speciﬁc individuals, and would
be kept conﬁdential and used only for the purpose of the
study analysis. Participants were also assured of their right to
withdraw from the study for any reason, at any time, without
penalty of any sort (and without loss of access to relevant
services).
Data analysis
Data analysis was done using SPSS 11.0 for Windows.
Participants who completed the 6-month follow-up were
compared with those who dropped out on baseline charac-
teristics. Participants in each group retained at 6-months
were also compared on baseline characteristics. The direction
and impact of any differences or biases on results were
examined. The level of statistical signiﬁcance for all tests was
alpha <0Æ05. The hypothesis of effectiveness and efﬁciency
was tested in a two-group comparison of all participants who
completed the 6-month follow-up using intention-to-treat
analysis (Jadad 1998). Chi-square, Kruskal–Wallis tests,
independent t-tests, and repeated measures analysis of vari-
ance were used to compare proportions or mean scores in the
two groups. The frequency of using different types of health
services in each group were described and quantiﬁed as a
Canadian dollar value (Can$1 ¼ US$0Æ641, £0Æ445 and
€0Æ717).
Results
Of the 577 older home care clients eligible to participate in
the study, a total of 288 (49Æ9%) were successfully recruited
and randomized (273 refusals; 16 unable to locate). The
study ﬂow diagram (Figure 2) summarizes the disposition of
participants throughout the study. The baseline characteris-
tics of the 289 non-consenters were not available due to their
refusal to provide informed consent to participate in the
study. As outlined in Figure 2, the loss of 46 participants by
the 6-month follow-up resulted in a 16Æ7% drop-out rate in
M. Markle-Reid et al.
386
 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation  2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

the nursing group and a 15Æ3% drop-out rate in the usual care
group at the end of the follow-up period. Reasons for loss to
follow-up included death (37%), unable to locate or phys-
ically unable to participate (37%), and refused to participate
(26%).
Chi-square, independent t-tests and Kruskal–Wallis tests
were used to compare drop-outs with those participants
retained at the 6-month follow-up (i.e. completers) on their
characteristics at baseline. Completers were similar to drop-
outs (P > 0Æ05) in their age, cognitive status, marital
status, income level, number of medications taken daily,
ethnicity, type of health disorders, % living with and
receiving help from an informal care provider, % living in
a retirement home, % with more than one health disorder,
% with depression, % with one or more hospital admis-
sions in the last 6 months, and % reporting physical
discomfort that limited activities of daily living. A greater
proportion of completers were female (76Æ9%) compared to
drop-outs (63%; v2 ¼ 3Æ90; d.f. ¼ 1; P ¼ 0Æ048). Compl-
eters in comparison with drop-outs reported higher scores
in overall physical functioning [mean difference 9Æ45; 95%

P ¼ 0Æ011).
Chi-square, independent t-tests and Kruskal–Wallis tests
were used to compare the two groups of study participants
retained in the 6-month follow-up on their characteristics at
baseline. Participants in the nursing group, compared with
the usual care group, reported, at baseline, lower scores in
role functioning related to emotional health (mean difference
10Æ08; 95% CI 2Æ53, 17Æ61; Table 2), and lower scores in
mental health functioning (mean difference 10Æ6; 95% CI
5Æ13,16Æ07). It would appear that the respondents in the
nursing group, who participated in the 6-month follow-up,
were somewhat more disadvantaged than those in usual care
with respect to mental health functioning. Additional details
on client baseline variables for the two study groups are
presented in Table 2.
Engagement rates
A visiting nurse engaged 84Æ7% of those older participants
who were randomly allocated to the nursing intervention at
baseline or time 1 (n ¼ 144) (Figure 2). Subjects randomized
to the nursing group received a median of ﬁve home visits and
one telephone contact over the 6-month follow-up compared
with a median of zero nursing visits in usual care using
the
Mann–Whitney
U-test
(Mann–Whitney
U ¼ 793Æ0;
P < 0Æ001). The average duration of the visits was 1 hour.
Notably, 90Æ8% of the sample randomized to the nursing
group received care from the same nurse throughout the
entire intervention period.

Mental health (presence of depression)
Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare
the difference in mean change scores (T1  T2) in the two
groups at 6-months. As indicated in Table 2, 25Æ6% of the
participants were assessed with depression at baseline. From
baseline to the 6-month follow-up, there was a statistically
signiﬁcantly greater reduction in the depressive symptom
scores in the nursing group compared with the usual care
group (mean difference 2Æ72; 95% CI 0Æ39, 5Æ07; Table 4).
This difference in the prevalence of depressive symptoms
translated into a clinically important reduction in the number
of clients who were depressed in the nursing group (16Æ8%)
compared with usual care (11Æ3%) (v2 ¼ 2Æ83; d.f. ¼ 3;
P ¼ 0Æ419), using a cut-off score of ‡21.
Perceived social support and coping style
Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare
the difference in mean change scores (T1  T2) in the two
groups at 6-months. There was a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in the perceived social support scores in the nursing
group compared with a reduction in the usual care group
(mean difference 5Æ26; 95% CI 9Æ18, 1Æ34; Table 4).
However, from baseline to the 6-month follow-up, there was
no statistically signiﬁcant or clinically important difference in
coping styles between the two groups.
Costs
Using Kruskal–Wallis test, there was no statistically signi-
ﬁcant difference between the two groups in the mean
cost of all types of health and social services, and the
total annual per person direct costs of health services at
6-months (v2 ¼ 0Æ001; d.f. ¼ 1; P ¼ 0Æ979). Noteworthy, is
that although there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference
in total costs, there was a statistically signiﬁcantly lower
per person cost of prescription medications in the nursing
group compared with usual care (v2 ¼ 5Æ718; d.f. ¼ 1;
P ¼ 0Æ017).
Discussion
Healthcare planners argue that the shift in home care
function from health promotion and prevention to acute
care substitution functions will improve health outcomes and
reduce healthcare costs (Soderstrom et al. 1999, Chappell
2001, Penning et al. 2002). This study demonstrates that this
assumption is incorrect and untenable. On the contrary,
nursing health promotion, provided to a general population
of frail seniors, 25Æ6% of whom are depressed and 79Æ3% of
whom are functionally limited, enhanced quality of life
(deﬁned and measured to include mental health, depression
and perceived social support) while not increasing the overall
costs of health care, thus making the intervention highly
feasible given its clinical beneﬁts. This study demonstrated
that, with modest reorganization of the delivery of existing
home services, statistically signiﬁcant enhancements in qual-
ity of life can result. McWilliam et al. (1999) reported similar
positive ﬁndings from a postdischarge health promotion
intervention for chronically ill seniors, but the costs were
limited to the use of acute hospitalization and home care
services. Previous studies have only focussed on the use of
institutional care and home care services as measures of cost
(Hendriksen et al. 1984, Zimmer et al. 1985, Stuck et al.
1995, Bernabei et al. 1998, Stuck et al. 2000). Thus, the
present study is unique in that it measured the use and costs
of the full range of health services.

At 6 months, compared with baseline, participants in the
nursing group reported a greater improvement in physical
functioning than the usual care participants. Given the fact
that 79Æ3% of the participants were functionally limited to a
moderate to severe degree, this is a clinically important gain
for those receiving nursing health promotion. Other studies
have reported similar positive effects on functional health
status (Stuck et al. 1995, Bernabei et al. 1998, Stuck et al.
2000) and self-rated physical health (Pathy et al. 1992), but
only two of these studies involved a health promotion
intervention that was staffed by a nurse alone (Pathy et al.
1992, Stuck et al. 2000).
As expected, improvements in physical functioning in the
nursing group resulted in a statistically signiﬁcantly greater
reduction in depressive symptom scores, and a statistically
signiﬁcantly greater improvement in overall mental health
functioning for participants in the nursing group compared
with those in usual care. Given the lower level of mental
health functioning in the nursing group at baseline, this is
statistically signiﬁcant gain for those receiving nursing health
promotion. Bernabei et al. (1998) reported similar positive
ﬁndings but the intervention was provided by a multidisci-
plinary geriatric team. Unrecognized, untreated and under
treated mood disorders such as depression increase the risk of
functional decline and the use of expensive healthcare
resources (Stuck et al. 1999). The study results provide
support for including depression screening and management
as a component of a nursing health promotion program for
frail older people as a means of decreasing morbidity,
enhancing quality of life and promoting the appropriate use
of health services.
At 6 months, compared with baseline, participants in the
nursing group reported a statistically signiﬁcantly lower cost
of prescription medications. This ﬁnding is noteworthy, given
the fact that nearly 50% of all medications used by older
people are used inappropriately, and almost 25% of hospital
admissions of older people are due to medication problems
(Halton Region Health Department 2004). In summary, the
ﬁndings underscore the need to re-invest in Registered
Nursing services for health promotion including disease
prevention for frail older home care clients with chronic
needs.
This trial is unique in that it was designed and evaluated
using a theoretical model. Previous studies lack a theoretical
foundation. As a result, it is difﬁcult to assess the appropri-
ateness of the intervention to the outcomes being measured,
or to formulate hypotheses regarding why or how a particular
intervention should be expected to result in a particular
outcome (Pawson & Tiley 1997). The study results provide
empirical support for the positive synergistic and cumulative
effects of bolstering personal resources (physical and mental
health functioning) and environmental supports (perceived
social support) on health status and related quality of life
(Rogers 1997) to considerable economic effect (no additional
cost). Future intervention studies need to incorporate a
theoretical model, and focus more on the process of
delivering care to identify the relative contribution of each
component of the intervention, and the synergistic effect of
the sum of the parts (Elkan et al. 2001).
Our results support and extend the literature regarding best
practice guidelines for providing nursing health promotion to
older home care clients. Key recommendations include a
ﬂexible, client centred and interdisciplinary approach to care
delivery, an initial and ongoing health assessment (including
depression screening), combined with regular home visits or
telephone contacts (Elkan et al. 2001, Stuck et al. 2002),
education regarding healthy lifestyles, and the management
of chronic illnesses, referral to and coordination of commu-
nity services (Rubenstein et al. 1991), and empowerment
strategies designed to enhance independence and self-efﬁcacy
(Robinson & Hill 1998, McWilliam et al. 2000). Our
ﬁndings also underscore the importance of nurse–client
relationships and continuity of care for positive outcomes
(McWilliam et al. 1997, McNaughton 2000).
We also examined the characteristics of participants (age,
depression, living arrangement, availability of an informal
caregiver, coping style and cognitive status), which may have
interacted
with
the
approach
to
treatment
to
explain
improvement in SF-36 mental component summary score.
There were no particular types of clients who beneﬁted more
from nursing health promotion vs. usual home care services.
This ﬁnding is consistent with Browne et al. (1999) in a
review of 12 studies evaluating a community-based approach
to care in Canada, who concluded that regardless of age,
chronic illness or circumstance, setting or speciﬁc interven-
tions, early proactive and comprehensive care is both more
effective and no more expensive in a system of national health
insurance.
Study limitations
Although our large sample size, high retention and engage-
ment rate were major strengths, a limitation of the study was
the retention of a higher functioning group of older people
when compared with dropouts. This may limit the general-
izability of the results to lower functioning elders, speciﬁcally
those with cognitive impairment. Since the study took place
in a well-developed urban region in Ontario, the results may
not be transferable to recipients of home care services living
in rural areas or other environments (Birch & Gafni 2003).

The CCAC Case Managers were aware of which participants
were assigned to the nursing group. This was unavoidable
and the only feasible means to conduct such a trial in a
clinical setting without unduly disrupting service provision.
Blinding was not 100% assured. Participants may have
inadvertently alerted the interviewers of their assignment to
the nursing group. The ﬁnding that there was no statistically
signiﬁcant difference between the two groups in total annual
per person cost of health and social services may be due to an
insufﬁcient sample size and limited power to detect differ-
ences in cost. Future trials with an economic evaluation are
needed that have sufﬁcient power to detect differences in cost.
Conclusion
In conclusion, nurses have an important role to play in
providing health promotion to older home care clients with
long-term healthcare needs. Our results suggest that with
modest reorganization of the delivery of existing home care
services, giving greater priority to nursing health promotion,
frail older home care clients can experience improved quality
of life at no additional cost to society as a whole. Implemen-
tation of efﬁcient care reforms for older people requires a
comprehensive rethinking of entire delivery systems (Hol-
lander & Pallan 1995). That is, decisions made in one part of
the system (such as reducing access to nursing services for
health promotion and preventive functions), need to be
evaluated for their impact on the larger whole, considering
both health outcomes and costs to society. Lessons learned
from this study have opened the space for dialogue between
service providers and decision-makers and can be used to
inform clinical practice and resource allocation in home care
to enhance the quality of life of older people with chronic
needs.

What is already known about this topic
• Extensive health service reforms have given rise to a
shift of home care nursing services from health pro-
motion and preventive functions for older people with
long-term health needs to short-term postacute care
substitution functions.
• These changing trends in the provision of home care
combine to create a fragmented system of healthcare
delivery, characterized by providing nursing services on
an on-demand basis rather than proactively.
• Typically, on-demand care is less effective and more
costly because delays or errors in responding to chron-
ically ill older people’s changing health needs can con-
tribute to functional decline and dependency that often
leads to use of expensive healthcare resources.
What this paper adds
• Health promotion proactively provided by nurses to a
general population of frail older home care clients,
compared with providing nursing services on-demand,
enhanced quality of life, mental health and social sup-
port while not increasing the overall costs of health
care.
• Health service providers need to re-invest in nursing
services for health promotion, including disease pre-
vention, for older home care clients with long-term
needs.
• Effective nursing health promotion interventions should
use
a
ﬂexible,
client-centred
and
interdisciplinary
approach to care delivery, continuity of care provider,
comprehensive assessment combined with regular home
visits, health education about management of chronic
illnesses, and use of empowerment strategies designed
to enhance self-care and independence.
