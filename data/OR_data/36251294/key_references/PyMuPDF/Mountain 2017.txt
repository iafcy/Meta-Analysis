Abstract
Objectives: to test whether an occupation-based lifestyle intervention can sustain and improve the mental well-being of
adults aged 65 years or over compared to usual care, using an individually randomised controlled trial.
Participants: 288 independently living adults aged 65 years or over, with normal cognition, were recruited from two UK
sites between December 2011 and November 2015.
Interventions: lifestyle Matters is a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended multi-component pre-
ventive intervention designed to improve the mental well-being of community living older people at risk of decline. It
involves weekly group sessions over 4 months and one to one sessions.
Main outcome measures: the primary outcome was mental well-being at 6 months (mental health (MH) dimension of the
SF-36). Secondary outcomes included physical health dimensions of the SF-36, extent of depression (PHQ-9), quality of life
(EQ-5D) and loneliness (de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale), assessed at 6 and 24 months.
Results: data on 262 (intervention = 136; usual care = 126) participants were analysed using intention to treat analysis.
Mean SF-36 MH scores at 6 months differed by 2.3 points (95 CI: −1.3 to 5.9; P = 0.209) after adjustments.
Conclusions: analysis shows little evidence of clinical or cost-effectiveness in the recruited population with analysis of the
primary outcome revealing that the study participants were mentally well at baseline. The results pose questions regarding
how preventive interventions to promote well-being in older adults can be effectively targeted in the absence of proactive
mechanisms to identify those who at risk of decline.

Introduction
Current national guidance advocates the implementation of
health promoting interventions for older people with the
aim of compressing morbidity in the later stages of the life
course and promoting quality of life and well-being [1, 2].
The guidance is informed by evidence, which demonstrates the
relationship between extent of social activity and morbidity and
mortality in the extended lifespan [3] and the importance of par-
ticipation in meaningful activities for mental well-being [4, 5].
An
occupation-based
intervention
designed
in
the
United States to promote continued participation and
627

engagement (Lifestyle Redesign) was shown to be effective
in improving the mental well-being of older adults through
two randomised controlled trials [4, 6]. The aim of the
study reported in this paper was to test whether an inter-
vention modelled on Lifestyle Redesign and adapted for a
UK population (Lifestyle Matters) could also demonstrate
clinical and cost-effectiveness.
Methods
Study design
A pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial was
conducted in two contrasting UK sites (rural North Wales
and a large urban city in Northern England) between
December 2011 and November 2015. The study protocol
was published [5]. A Trial Steering Group (TSC) and inde-
pendent
Data
Monitoring
Committee
(DMC)
were
appointed to monitor the quality and conduct of the study.
Participants
A variety of recruitment methods were used to attract com-
munity living people aged 65 years and over with reason-
able cognitive ability to participate. The feasibility study had
highlighted the value of using local communities to identify
those who might beneﬁt [7]. Therefore, considerable effort
was invested in informing community health and social care
practitioners and groups for older people through face to
face meetings and media advertisements. However, the time
constraints of undertaking a randomised controlled trial
necessitated an additional recruitment strategy via general
practicioner (GP) mail outs in the areas where intervention
delivery was planned. The original intention was that mail
outs would support achievement of recruitment targets
within the required time frame [8].
The intervention
Based on an occupational approach to healthy ageing, the
manualised Lifestyle Matters intervention was designed to
assist participants to improve their well-being and avoid the
decline associated with social isolation and poor mental health
(MH). Participants met in a weekly group of up to 12 people
over 4 months at a local venue. Participants were also asked
to engage in monthly individual sessions with a facilitator.
Session topics were either chosen from the manualised pro-
gramme or new topics identiﬁed [9]. The facilitators worked
with the participants to explore the selected topic through dis-
cussion, activities and community enactment. The emphasis
throughout was upon the identiﬁcation of participants’ goals,
empowerment through sharing strengths and skills and pro-
viding support to enable them to practice new or neglected
activities independently, particularly in the community [10, 11].
The facilitators were paid National Health Service (NHS) or
social care staff who were provided with training and super-
vised by qualiﬁed occupational therapists throughout.
Study procedures
Eligible participants were enroled, screened for cognition and
consented by a research assistant (RA) and randomised to
one of two study arms (intervention or usual care) via a
remote web-based randomisation service. The randomisation
sequence was computer generated in advance by the trial stat-
istician and stratiﬁed by site. Random permuted blocks of
variable size were used to ensure that sufﬁcient participants
were allocated in a 50:50 ratio to each arm of the trial at each
study site. When a couple in the same household both con-
sented to take part, the pair was randomised as a couple.
The principal investigator (PI), TSC, study statisticians,
health economists and RAs collecting outcome data at 6 and
24 months were blinded to treatment allocation but the Trial
Manager, clerical team and participants were not blinded.
RAs who undertook follow-up appointments asked partici-
pants to avoid revealing which arm they were allocated to.
All study participants were asked to participate in study
data collection at baseline and follow-up.
Adherence to the manualised intervention was assessed
[5, 9]. Facilitator ﬁdelity to the group intervention was
determined by two independent researchers evaluating
video recordings of four groups (two at each site) during
weeks 4 and 10 of delivery using a checklist which rated six
domains: goals and needs, resources, personal qualities,
enabling, group work skills and content. ‘Group member
performance’ was also assessed using a checklist to deter-
mine a participant’s uptake of the intervention and their
understanding of it. Participant attendance at group and
individual sessions was monitored through registers.
Outcomes
All participants were assessed at baseline and followed up
at 6 and 24 months post-randomisation using validated
questionnaires, completed either face to face or over the
telephone by an RA.
The primary outcome was mental well-being measured
by the 36 Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) MH
dimension score at 6 months [12], measured on a 0 (poor)
to 100 (good health) scale. Secondary outcomes were other
dimensions of the SF-36, Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ) [13], EQ-5D-3 L [14], de Jong Gierveld Loneliness
Scale [15], General Self-Efﬁcacy Scale (GSE) [16] and
Ofﬁce for National Statistics (ONS) well-being at 6 and 24
months post-randomisation [17]. Serious adverse events
(SAEs) were assessed at 6 and 24 months; these were
assessed by the PI for relatedness to the intervention.
Economic evaluation involved collection of all health and
social care use over the previous 3 months at each data col-
lection point through application of a bespoke health and
social care resource use questionnaire.
Statistical analysis
Sample size was derived from the mean SF-36 MH dimen-
sion score of a general health survey (68.3 with a standard
G. Mountain et al.
628

deviation (SD) of 19.9) [18]. Assuming a mean difference in
SF-36 MH scores of 8 or more is of a clinical or practical
importance, and a SD of 20 points, to have an 80% power
of detecting this difference, signiﬁcant at the 5% (two-sided)
level, with cluster sizes of 10 subjects per Lifestyle Matters
group, an intra cluster correlation of 0.01 and with 20%
lost to follow-up at 6 months, the study needed to recruit
268 participants (134 per arm). Primary and secondary out-
comes were analysed using a linear mixed effects model
with independent correlation and two levels of nested clus-
tering. The lower level of clustering treats each couple as a
cluster of size two, or each individual, if not in a couple, as
a cluster of size one. The higher level of clustering regards
participants in the same Lifestyle Matters intervention
group as a cluster. Participants allocated to either arm who
withdrew from intervention before being allocated a group
were treated as a cluster of size one, or of size two if they
were in a couple. An adjusted analysis was performed
alongside this unadjusted analysis, which included potential
baseline prognostic covariates of age, sex and baseline SF-
36 MH dimension score and whether the participant lived
alone in a mixed effects model. Analysis of secondary out-
comes at 6 and 24 months post-randomisation was per-
formed in a similar manner.
In calculating the cost-effectiveness of the intervention,
a cost perspective of the NHS and social care was
adopted. Intervention costs (cost of facilitators and their
supervision, venue hire and related costs of delivering the
intervention), drugs, inpatient stay, general practitioner vis-
its, outpatient appointments, visits to the emergency
department and day care services were included. Costs
were obtained from NHS reference costs 2013–14 and
other published sources [19, 20]. There was less than 5%
missing data for costs and as a result no imputation was
necessary. Costs and beneﬁts had not been discounted.
Utilities were calculated using SF-6D derived from SF-36
collected at baseline, 6 and 24 months. Quality-Adjusted
Life Years (QALYs) were estimated using a total of 30
imputations and were calculated using the area under the
curve method.
Cost-effectiveness was analysed using seemingly unre-
lated regression, a multivariate technique that takes into
consideration
potential
correlation
between
costs
and
QALYs [21]. An incremental analysis was conducted by
dividing mean incremental QALYs to produce an incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) by comparing parti-
cipants in the intervention and control groups. Uncertainty
in the decision is assessed from cost-effectiveness accept-
ability curve, which plots the probability that the interven-
tion is cost-effective for a range of thresholds that the NHS
would be willing to spend per QALY.

Results
The trial randomised 288 participants between 14 August
2012 and 19 April 2013 (18 couples and 252 individuals);
145 and 143 were allocated to the intervention and control
groups, respectively (Figure 1). Twenty six participants
either withdrew, were lost to follow-up, or had missing pri-
mary outcome data at 6 months, leaving 262 (91%) partici-
pants in the primary analysis (136 intervention; 126
control). Baseline characteristics of the participants are dis-
played in Table 1.
Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis found no difference in
the primary outcome (SF-36 MH) between randomised
groups (Table 2, adjusted mean difference 2.3, 95% CI:
−1.3 to 5.9, P = 0.209). Fifty-two percent (71/136) of parti-
cipants allocated to the intervention received a therapeutic
dose of group sessions in that they attended 12 or more of
the 16 weekly groups before 6-month follow-up. A sensitiv-
ity (per-protocol) analysis of the 71 participants who
received a therapeutic dose of the group found similar
results to the ITT analysis. Other sensitivity analyses, of the
imputing missing data, gave consistent estimates of treat-
ment difference (see Supplementary data, Table Appendix
1, available at Age and ageing online). There was no evidence
of difference between those the intervention and usual care
groups on any secondary outcomes at 6 months. However
at 24 months, scores on two subscales (de Jong Gierveld
Emotional
Loneliness
and
de
Jong
Gierveld
Social
Loneliness) were signiﬁcantly improved in the intervention
compared to the usual care group (Table 2), although the
relevance of this ﬁnding is questionable due to a lack of evi-
dence to support a minimal clinically important difference
[15]. Assessment of ﬁdelity to the group component was
satisfactory in seven out of eight video recordings for both
group member and facilitator performance, indicating that
the group component had been delivered as intended. The
mean number of group sessions attended per participant
was 9.2 (SD = 5.8). Out of the 123 participants who
attended at least one group session, 93 (75.6%) were
offered four individual sessions as per-protocol but only
ﬁve (4.1%) accepted and received all four sessions. The
number of participants that experienced a SAE was similar
across the trial arms (46% (63/136) of the intervention and
53% (67/126) of the treatment as usual group). The major-
ity of the SAEs reported persistent or signiﬁcant disability/
incapacity over the time scale since last assessment, which
accounted for 71% of the total. All SAEs reported by inter-
vention group participants were assessed as either unrelated
or unlikely to be related to the intervention. RAs were
unblinded to group allocation in 13.7% (n = 109) of follow-
up appointments.
The cost of Lifestyle Matters was estimated at £430 and
£575 (£1 = $1.51) per person in the North England and
North Wales sites, respectively. From the regression ana-
lysis, the ICER was found to be £7,621 (see Supplementary
A preventative lifestyle intervention for older adults
629

data, Table Appendix 2, avaliable at Age and Ageing online)
but this lies in the third quadrant of the cost-effectiveness
plane implying that the intervention is less costly but less
effective. At a threshold of £20,000, commonly used within
the NHS, there was a probability of 30% that Lifestyle
Matters would be cost-effective. Utilities generated from
EQ-5D to generate QALYs were used as sensitivity ana-
lysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £7,861
but remained less costly and less effective.
Discussion
This trial was undertaken to a high standard including
blinding of outcome assessors, concealed randomisation
techniques and recruitment to sample size. Follow-up was
successful at 6 and 24 months post-randomisation (85%
retention at 24 months). Limitations were that targeted
recruitment through service providers and the community

despite sustained effort [7]. To recruit the required numbers
of participants meeting study eligibility criteria within the
allocated time frame almost all were recruited through GP
mail outs, resulting in a self-selecting sample.
The ﬁndings do not support the hypothesis that an
intervention modelled on Lifestyle Redesign and adapted
for a UK population (Lifestyle Matters) is effective at
improving the well-being of older adults. The change in the
primary outcome (MH dimension of the SF-36) over a 6-
month period was not signiﬁcantly different between the
usual care and intervention groups [12]. Compared to the
second US Lifestyle Redesign study, where recruited parti-
cipants had a mean baseline SF-36 Mental component
summary (MCS) score of 41, participants in our study
were mentally well with mean baseline SF-36 MCS score
scores of 52 [4] (MCS scores are standardised to have
mean of 50 and SD of 10 the same as the reference popu-
lation). Participants in the US studies were independently
residing in retirement communities and private homes;
those in private homes visited senior community centres.
In our trial, older adults were also independently living
but were recruited from the community and did not
necessarily have any involvement in community centres. It
can be deduced that participants recruited to Lifestyle
Matters were not at a stage of their life when then would
beneﬁt most from such an intervention, nor were they
activity seeking support when recruited. The US studies
suggest that recruiting from an existing support group
enabled recruitment of those with lowered mental well-
being [4].
At 24 months there were signiﬁcant decreases in aspects
of emotional loneliness (e.g. ‘I often feel rejected’; ‘I miss
having people around me’) for those who had participated
in the Lifestyle Matters intervention. This suggests that the
groups could have inﬂuenced a reappraisal of relationships
and social networks, a potential area for further study. A
small proportion of individuals (4.1%) took up all four
offers of a one to one session with a facilitator. Fostering
increased uptake of these sessions, which focussed on goal
setting, may aid individuals gain quality of life in future
evaluations.
Identifying older people at risk of mental decline and in
particular those not known to services is challenging and
has only recently been identiﬁed as a priority for UK health,
social care and other agencies [2]. Consensus is required as
to the responsibility of clinicians—especially GPs—for

The Short Form (36) Health Instrument (SF-36) Dimensions are scored on a 0 (poor) to 100 (good) health scale, except for the Physical and MCS scores which are standardised to have a mean of 50 and SD of 10. The
EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) utility score is measured on a −0.56 to 1.00 (good health) scale. The EQ-5D visual analogue scale is measured on a 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).
The brief resilience scale is scored on a scale of 1–5 with higher scores indicating more resilience. The emotional loneliness scale of the De Jong is scored on a 0–6 scale with higher scores indicating more loneliness. The
social loneliness scale of the De Jong is scored on a 0–5 scale with higher scores indicating more loneliness. The total loneliness scale of the De Jong is scored on a 0–11 scale with higher scores indicating more loneliness.
The PHQ−9 is measured on a 0–27 scale with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. GSE Scale is scored on a 10–40 scale with higher scores indicating more perceived self-efﬁcacy. The ONS instru-
ment measures subjective well-being on a 0–40 scale, with higher scores indicating high subjective well-being.
For the SF-36, EQ-5D, Brief Resilience Scale, GSE, ONS a positive mean difference indicates the invention group has the better QoL. For the de Jong Gierveld and PHQ-9 a negative mean difference indicates the
Intervention group has the better QoL.

identifying such individuals, and the exact methods by
which isolated older adults can be identiﬁed.
Identifying older people when they are beginning to
decline and taking action at that point is crucial to the suc-
cess of preventive interventions. Proactive recognition and
signposting strategies are required, which were not in evi-
dence during this study; the beneﬁts of which were strongly
indicated in our feasibility study [7]. Unlike the feasibility
study, the randomised controlled trial methodology did not
provide the time required to seek those in most need. We
therefore do not know if those who are experiencing mental
or physical decline would actually participate in and beneﬁt
from such an intervention. Identiﬁcation of those in poten-
tial need remains an elusive challenge.
Key points
• Social participation and involvement in meaningful activ-
ities can prevent mental ill-health in older adults.
• Two US studies found that an occupation-based lifestyle
intervention improved the mental well-being of older
adults.
• We adapted the US lifestyle intervention for a UK popula-
tion and assessed it’s effectiveness in comparison to usual
care.
• We were unable to recruit those with lowered mental well-
being, which contributed to the intervention not showing
effectiveness.
• Findings highlight the need for strategies to identify those
who are on the cusp of decline.
