ABSTRACT
Objectives: This study examined effects of a social intervention on depressive symptoms, melancholy,
loneliness, and perceived togetherness in community-dwelling Finnish older people.
Method: Promotion of mental well-being in older people (GoodMood; ISRCTN78426775) was a singleblinded randomized control trial lasting 1.5 years. Two hundred and twenty-three persons aged 75–
79 years reporting symptoms of loneliness or melancholy were randomized into intervention and
control groups. The intervention group was allowed to choose among supervised exercise, social
activity, or personal counseling. Follow-up measurements were conducted at the end of 6-month
intervention, and at 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention.
Results: Number of depressive symptoms remained unchanged, while loneliness and melancholy
decreased in both the intervention and control groups during the study (p < 0.001). Social integration
increased in the intervention group but not in controls (p D 0.041). Attachment and guidance
increased in both groups (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: The intervention did not alleviate depressed mood. Positive changes over time were
observed in loneliness, feelings of melancholy, attachment, and guidance but these occurred
independently of the intervention. Our secondary analysis suggests that the intervention increased
perceived social integration. In sum, the effects of the intervention were moderate only and did not
expedite further overcoming depressive mood or loneliness.

##### Introduction

Declining health and changes in a person’s social network
with aging may threaten the maintenance of mental wellbeing in older people. However, older people who have
access to social relations in which they experience mutual
proximity and security and through which they can get help
when they need it, suffer less often from feelings of loneliness
and depressive symptoms (Tiikkainen & Heikkinen, 2005).
Other observational studies have shown that the incidence of
depressive symptoms is lower among people involved in
social activity (Glass, Mendes de Leon, Bassuk, & Berkman,
2006; Wahrendorf, Ribet, Zins, & Siegrist, 2008). However,
intervention studies suggest that alleviating loneliness and
depressive symptoms in older people may not be as straightforward as the observational studies suggest. In a systematic
review, Dickens, Richards, Greaves, and Campbell (2011) concluded that only 3 out of 12 group interventions were effective in reducing loneliness and 3 out of 8 effective in
alleviating depression.
Loneliness may be defined as an unpleasant, anxietyinducing subjective experience resulting from inadequate
social relationships (Peplau & Perlman, 1982). The association
between loneliness and social contacts has been addressed in
several studies. An important predictor of loneliness is living
alone (Routasalo, Savikko, Tilvis, Strandberg, & Pitk€al€a, 2006).
Receiving fewer visits from friends and having a less extensive
social network were also related to loneliness (Adams,


Sanders, & Auth, 2004). However, the frequency of contacts
may not be paramount. Routasalo et al. (2006) found that the
feeling of loneliness was associated not with the frequency of
contacts with children and friends, but with satisfaction with
these contacts. Thus, especially qualitative aspects of social
contacts count for feelings of loneliness.
Depression is a broader phenomenon than loneliness, as it
may result from changes in social relationships or in nonsocial situations (Peplau & Perlman, 1982). Earlier studies have
shown, for example, that chronic diseases, disability, poor
self-rated health, poor vision, perceived negative changes in
life, lack of a friendly companion, less participation in organized social activities, and irritation with one’s family are predictors of depressive symptoms (see Adams et al., 2004;
Heikkinen & Kauppinen, 2004; Kaneko, Motohashi, Sasaki, &
Yamaji, 2007; McGuire, Strine, Allen, Anderson, & Mokdad,
2009). Grieving over a recent loss of a close person was associated with both depressive symptoms and loneliness (Adams
et al., 2004). Depressive symptoms and loneliness are strongly
associated, and often co-occur both with each other and
other setbacks in life. It is possible that loneliness and depressive symptoms can act in a synergistic way to impair wellbeing in older people (Cacioppo, Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, &
Thisted, 2006).
The qualitative aspect of social interaction can be
described by the concept of perceived togetherness, which is
grounded in Weiss’s (1974) idea that people need various


-----

kinds of social relationships to fulfill their various social needs.
Perceived togetherness describes the way people experience
their social interaction and the social support they receive
(Tiikkainen, Heikkinen, & Leskinen, 2004). According to Weiss
(1973), feelings of loneliness may result from a deficit in one
or more relational functions: attachment, social integration,
sense of reliable alliance, guidance, nurturance, and reassurance of worth. Emotional loneliness arises from the lack of an
intimate relationship or a confidant, whereas social loneliness
refers to negative feelings resulting from the absence of
meaningful relationships and social integration. Tiikkainen
and Heikkinen (2005) found that, among 80-year-old persons,
loneliness correlated with the lack of reliable alliance, social
integration, and attachment, while depressive symptoms
were explained by low scores in guidance, reassurance of
worth, reliable alliance, and attachment. Thus, experiencing
insufficiently met social needs may negatively affect mental
well-being. Although all six relational functions are important
to older people, their relative importance may vary depending on age and life situation.
Previous systematic reviews concluded that interventions
that were effective in decreasing loneliness were typically
conducted in a group setting, involved some form of educational or training input and social activity, and in which older
people were active participants (Cattan, White, Bond, & Learmouth, 2005; Dickens et al., 2011). For older women living
alone, discussion on health-related topics reduced their feelings of loneliness (Anderson, 1985). A group intervention
focusing on self-management abilities attenuated social loneliness in older women (Kremers, Steverink, Albersnagel, &
Slaets, 2006). A group intervention including therapeutic writing and group psychotherapy or physical exercise and discussion or art activities, increased psychological well-being in
older participants suffering from loneliness (Routasalo, Tilvis,
Kautiainen, & Pitkala, 2009). In addition, reminiscence and life
review have been reported to be potentially effective methods for the enhancement of psychological well-being (Bohlmeijer, Roemer, Cuijpers, & Smit, 2007), and for treating
depressive symptoms in older adults (Bohlmeijer, Smit, &
Cuijpers, 2003). A group-based exercise training program was
more effective than individual home exercise in improving
mood in older women (Timonen, Rantanen, Timonen, &
Sulkava, 2002).
Among the Finnish community-dwelling older population, approximately 5% report feeling lonely often or almost
always (Savikko, Routasalo, Tilvis, Strandberg, & Pitkala,
2005; Tiikkainen & Heikkinen, 2005) and 39% suffer from
loneliness at least occasionally (Routasalo et al., 2006). Heikkinen and Kauppinen (2004) found that over one-third of
75-year-old women and one-quarter of same age men were
depressed, and that the proportion of depressed persons
increased, particularly among women, from age 80 to
85 years. Minor depression among older people is typically
a dynamic and episodic phenomenon (Heikkinen & Kauppinen, 2004). Similarly, loneliness often is a result of situational factors and may be transitory (Luanaigh & Lawlor,
2008). However, when depressive symptoms and loneliness
become prolonged, a person may need support to recover.
Regardless of the positive results of intervention studies on
enhancing the mental well-being of elderly people,
more intervention studies are called for to investigate costeffective ways to mitigate loneliness and depressive mood


The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a
social intervention on depressive symptoms, melancholy,
loneliness, and perceived togetherness in community-dwelling Finnish people aged 75–79 years who reported depressed
mood or loneliness at study entry. In addition, the aim was to
study whether the parallel effects would be found across the
three intervention subgroups, and between the depressed
and not-depressed groups. The basic idea behind the intervention was that by giving the participants a possibility to
interact and by promoting social integration their loneliness
would decrease.

##### Methods

 Design

The GoodMood, project, with the purpose of promoting mental well-being in older people, was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) lasting 1.5 years. The specific aims
of the project were to develop screening tools to identify persons with early signs of declining mental well-being, to
develop counseling and group interventions promoting perceived togetherness and mental well-being, and to evaluate
the impact of early intervention on depressive mood, loneliness, and participation in older people who were at increased
risk for impaired mental well-being. GoodMood was carried
out in co-operation with the GeroCenter Foundation for
Research and Development, University of Jyv€askyl€a, JAMK
University of Applied Sciences, and the City of Jyv€askyl€a, Finland. The Ethical Committee of the Central Finland Health
Care District approved the study. All participants gave their
written informed consent prior to the study.
The selection of the participants and study design are
shown in Figure 1. The target population comprised of all the
75- to 79-year-old residents of Jyv€askyl€a, Central Finland, who
were living in the city center area in August 2008 (N D 1167).
This age group is suitable for an intervention of this kind:
although a large proportion of them will have some health
issues, in most cases these are unlikely to be severe enough
to restrict participation. Based on earlier studies, it was presumed that some 30%–40% of population in this age group
would report symptoms of loneliness or melancholy (see e.g.
Heikkinen & Kauppinen, 2004; Tiikkainen & Heikkinen, 2005),
and that two-thirds would be willing to participate in a study
of this kind (Leinonen et al., 2007). Therefore, we assumed
adequate coverage of the target population. Contact information was gathered from the Finnish population register. Of
the original target population of 1167 people, information on
perceived loneliness and melancholy was obtained for 985
persons via phone screening. Of these, 24% reported feeling
lonely and 37% melancholy at least sometimes. Altogether
50% reported feelings of melancholy or loneliness at least
sometimes. All the inclusion criteria: (1) feeling loneliness,
melancholy, or depressive mood at least sometimes, (2) a
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score greater than 21
in order to be able to participate in discussions, and (3) willing
to participate in the study, were met by 296 persons, of whom
39 withdrew from the study before randomization. After a
more detailed structured face-to-face home interview
between September and November 2008, the participants
met a counselor once. The meeting included discussion of the
participant’s life situation and available social support. After

257 persons were allocated to the intervention or control
groups, using a randomized ratio 1:1, by drawing lots. The trial
administrator performed the randomization. Interviewers and
data collecting assistants were blinded to the group assignment of the participants throughout the study. After the end
of the six-month intervention, a larger follow-up face-to-face
interview was carried out between April and June 2009, in the
participants’ homes. Shorter follow-up interviews were carried
out by phone at 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention
ended. One participant died and 33 withdrew from the study
during the intervention. Only the data on the persons who
participated in both home interviews (intervention group n D
105, control group n D 118) were analyzed in this study.
Drop-outs did not differ from those who remained in the
study in sex, self-rated health, or melancholy. A slightly larger
proportion of participants lived alone (66% vs. 56%), felt
lonely at least sometimes (68% vs. 52%), and did not have a
supporting person in their network (22% vs. 13%) than dropouts. At each stage, reasons most often given for withdrawal
were lack of interest (24%), no expected benefit from participation (27%), lack of time (28%), and poor health (27%). In
addition, drop-outs in the intervention group during the intervention did not differ significantly from drop-outs in the
control group in depressive symptoms (mean Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS) 5.17 in the intervention group vs. 4.22
in the controls).

##### Measurements

The primary outcome of this study was information on depres

GDS is specially designed to screen for depressed mood in
older adults. A larger score indicates greater severity of symptoms and the scale maximum is 15. The cut-off score for
depression has most commonly been defined as �5 (see
Greenberg, 2007). We used the summary score of the scale in
the analyses.
The secondary outcomes were melancholy, feelings of loneliness, and dimensions of perceived togetherness. Melancholy
was assessed with the question: ‘How do you perceive your
mood in general?’ The response options were almost always
good, sometimes melancholy, and often or almost always
melancholy. The response options for the question ‘Do you
feel lonely?’ were very rarely or never, sometimes, and often or
almost always. Perceived togetherness was measured using the
Social Provisions Scale developed on the basis of Weiss’s theory (Cutrona & Russell, 1987). Its 24 items are equally divided
between the six different dimensions or provisions: attachment, social integration, reliable alliance, guidance, opportunity for nurturance, and reassurance of worth. Attachment
refers to social relationships which satisfy the need for proximity, affection and love, and which can promote feelings of
security and well-being. Social integration refers to a sense of
belonging to a group or community where people can share
common concerns and exchange experiences. Reliable alliance refers to having a relationship one can turn to in an
emergency. Guidance refers to having access to advice and
assistance. Opportunity for nurturance means having the relationships in which a person feels responsible for the wellbeing of another. Reassurance of worth is possible in social
relationships where the individual’s skills and competencies


-----

are positively and two negatively worded. On a scale from
strongly disagree (scored 1) to strongly agree (scored 4), the
respondents were asked to assess to what extent they
thought that each statement described their current social
relationships. The responses to the negatively worded items
were reversed. A composite measure was calculated for each
dimension with scores ranging between 4 and 16, where
larger values indicated a more positive aspect. Depressive
symptoms and perceived togetherness were assessed at
baseline and at the end of the six-month intervention, and
melancholy and feelings of loneliness were further assessed
at the 3-, 6-, and 12- month post-intervention follow-up
measurements.
Information on age (in years), sex, full-time education (level
of schooling), perceived economic situation (good, moderate,
or poor), living alone (yes/no), morbidity, cognitive functioning, and mobility were gathered during the face-to-face interviews. Morbidity was assessed by asking the participant to
state what physician-diagnosed chronic diseases of more
than three months’ duration he or she currently had. Cognitive functioning was assessed with the MMSE (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). Mobility was assessed by asking
about perceived difficulties in walking 2 km, 500 m, ambulating indoors, and climbing stairs. The response options for
these were ‘not able’ (scored 0), ‘not able without somebody
to help’ (scored 1), ‘yes, but has difficulties’ (scored 2), or ‘yes,
without difficulties’ (scored 3). Summary measures were computed for mobility.

##### Intervention

The participants randomized to the intervention group were
allowed to select from three alternatives the intervention
regime they thought would benefit them the most (Table 1).
The exercise program was the most favored (n D 45) followed
by personal counseling (n D 33) and the social activity program (n D 27). The three regimes were similar in that each
included social interaction, participants were able to influence
the content of the meetings, and well-being was promoted.
Participants in the exercise and the social activity programs
met weekly altogether 19–21 times. The exercise program
involved varying types of exercise and was conducted by
qualified instructors in municipal gyms. The social activity program was delivered by health care students from JAMK University of Applied Sciences and participants met in the city
library. Activities included group discussions, self-expression
using art and creative methods, and going on day-trips. Personal counseling was conducted by a rehabilitation counselor


and meetings took place in a health care center. Meetings
were held approximately every third week and each participant attended 4–5 meetings. The issues discussed in the
meetings varied depending on what topics the participant
considered important. Counseling was given when needed.
The control group received one counseling session which
took place prior to randomization. Controls had access to the
usual services offered by the municipality and other service
providers.

##### Statistical analysis

Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were used to
estimate parameters for group- and time-main effects and
group-by-time interaction for depressive symptoms, melancholy, loneliness, and the dimensions of perceived togetherness. We report the type III effect p-values that are invariant
to the choice of reference category. In the analyses, to optimize statistical power relative to the control group, we did
not separate the three intervention subgroups but treated
them as a single group. We then conducted ancillary GEE
analysis for the intervention subgroups and for those above
and below the GDS cut-off score (�5). These analyses were
performed with IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22.0. The proportion of missing data in individual variables varied between 0%
and 3.6%. The Multiple Imputation procedure of SAS for Windows (version 9.1) was used to impute missing values using
the available information from the model variables and on
background characteristics, physical activity, and functional
ability.

##### Results

Average participant age was 77.0 years at baseline, 75% were
women, and 65% lived alone (Table 2). Mean MMSE score was
27.2 and mean number of chronic diseases was 2.9. Participants typically had only early signs of mobility decline as 35%
reported difficulties only in walking longer distances (2 km)
and 60% reported no difficulties in any mobility tasks. In
depressive symptoms, melancholy, loneliness, and dimensions of perceived togetherness, the intervention and the
control groups were comparable.
Primary outcome: the six-month intervention did not affect
depressive symptoms. The number of symptoms remained at
the same level over the six-month intervention (Table 3).
Secondary outcomes: Table 3 shows that feelings of loneliness and melancholy decreased in both the intervention and
control groups. The improvement in melancholy (Figure 2)

and loneliness (Figure 3) remained up to the 12-month postintervention follow-up. Of the dimensions of perceived
togetherness, guidance and attachment increased in both
groups during the six-month intervention. Time and groupby-time interaction effects were statistically significant for
social integration indicating positive change only in the intervention group.
Ancillary analyses conducted for the intervention regimes
did not add to the existing results. In each regime, social integration, attachment, and guidance increased, and feelings of
loneliness and melancholy decreased during the six-month
intervention. One difference between regimes was observed
in reassurance of worth. Participants who chose personal
counseling reported less often than those in the exercise
group that they felt their individual’s skills and competencies
were respected.
Ancillary analyses among those who were categorized as
depressed (GDS score � 5; n D 36 in the intervention and 34
in the control group) or non-depressed (GDS score 1–4; n D
69 in the intervention and 84 in the control group) revealed
no additional information on the effectiveness of the intervention. Overall, while the time effects indicated that depressive symptoms decreased among those who were depressed
and loneliness decreased among those who were nondepressed, the changes were similar in the intervention and
the control groups. As a consequence of the intervention,
social integration increased only among those who were nondepressed at baseline


##### Discussion

The results of our study showed that the intervention did not
alleviate depressed mood. Feelings of loneliness and melancholy decreased and perceived attachment and guidance
increased over time similarly in both the intervention and
control groups. The intervention was efficacious in increasing
social integration. However, changes in social integration and
feelings of loneliness were observed only among those who
felt lonely but were not depressed.
Our results add to the diversity of previous findings on the
effectiveness of interventions in reducing depressiveness or
loneliness in older people. Some randomized controlled trials
have reported a decrease in depressive symptoms (Bohlmeijer
et al., 2003; Constantino, 1988; Pinquart, Duberstein, & Lyness,
2007; Timonen et al., 2002) or loneliness (Anderson, 1985;
Ollonqvist et al., 2008). Other targeted interventions, however,
have not been successful in alleviating depressive mood
(Arnetz, Theorell, & Arnetz, 1983; White et al., 2002) or loneliness (Routasalo et al., 2009; White et al., 2002). We designed
our intervention based on studies that had obtained positive
results, but we were not able to detect additional benefits
with respect to loneliness, melancholy, and depressive symptoms beyond those achieved naturally over time. Some other
studies have similarly reported that, e.g. loneliness was also
attenuated in the control group during the study (Kremers
et al., 2006; see e.g. Martina & Stevens, 2006).

and loneliness in the whole study group over time may partly
result from the attention participants received during the
study. In addition to a home interview, each participant had a
meeting with a counselor at baseline. This may also have
brought about an increase in perceived guidance and attachment in both groups. Another explanation may be the Hawthorne effect, according to which people behave differently
just because they know that they are being studied (see
Becker, Roberts, & Voelmeck, 2003). It is also possible that simply reporting about their feelings of loneliness and melancholy, social relationships, and activities outside the home led
the control group members to independently make efforts to
change their situation, which was subsequently reflected in
reduced loneliness and melancholy.
In our study, the intervention did not expedite the process
of overcoming the depressive mood or loneliness. However, a
more individualized therapeutic perspective might have
resulted in an improvement in depressiveness (see Pinquart
et al., 2007). Loneliness may be difficult to alleviate as it has
many different causes and perceived deficiencies in social
relationships affect loneliness in many different ways. Theories of loneliness emphasize factors relating to personality or
traits, or various states in a person’s life. Loneliness may be
associated with the loss of a confidant and the resultant grief,
lack of meaningful social relationships, dissatisfaction with
existing relationships, existential questions, deficits in early
attachment relationships, or shyness and fears in social situations. These matters should be taken into account and interventions targeted accordingly.
In this study, social integration increased in the intervention but not in the control group. Social integration refers to
experiencing oneself as part of group or having people
around one who like the same social activities, think the same
way about things, have the same interests and concerns, and
like to do things in the same way as oneself. Lack of social
integration is associated with social loneliness and might best
be resolved by acquiring new contacts. In a pilot study focusing on older people who were clients of home health care,
receiving volunteer visitors during a period of six weeks
improved older persons’ perceived social integration (MacIntyre et al., 1999). Meeting peers in a group setting or a counselor in a one-to-one setting may offer the older person

attention (see the multidimensional model of affiliation in Hill,
1987, 2009) which, in turn, may enhance the experience of
acceptance and belonging (see Leary & Kelly, 2009). All three
intervention regimes in our study included social interaction
and were participatory, which may explain the findings.
Participants were allowed to choose from three possible
regimes selected on the basis of the results of previous studies. This was done because the opportunity to choose enhances the experience of control over one’s life and the
motivation to complete the intervention (see Mannell &
Kleiber, 1997, p. 144). In our study, the proportion of dropouts from the intervention group was 16%, whereas in studies
offering the same intervention regime to all participants, the
drop-out rate has ranged from 20% to 27% (Kremers et al.,
2006; Ollonqvist et al., 2008; White et al., 2002).
Depressive symptoms were measured with the GDS, which
has been found to be a good screening tool for depressive
symptoms among older adults (e.g. de Craen, Heeren, & Gussekloo, 2003) and has been observed to detect changes in
depressive symptoms. In a study among 85-year-old persons
who experienced a major negative life event, the shorter form
of the GDS was able to detect a change in their depressive
symptoms (Vinkers, Gussekloo, Stek, Westendorp, & Van Der
Mast, 2004). The meta-analysis by Pinquart et al. (2007) concluded that the GDS detected improvements in depressive
symptoms. Consequently, we believe that GDS is valid and
reliable and that the present result is not an outcome of deficiencies in the assessment scale.
This study has both strengths and weaknesses. One weakness may be that we assessed loneliness with a single question which does not enable a distinction to be drawn
between emotional and social loneliness, or between the
state and trait aspects of the experience (Luanaigh & Lawlor,
2008). However, the question is understandable and generally
acceptable, and measures loneliness directly (Bowling, 2005).
In addition to loneliness, we measured perceived togetherness, which is a positive perspective on social relationships
that correlates negatively with feelings of loneliness.
The strengths of the study were its sampling and screening
methods and design. First, the target population included all
the residents in a particular age group living in a certain geographical area. Those recruited, based on their feeling of loneliness or melancholy, were otherwise comparable with those
who did not meet the study inclusion criteria. Compared to
studies based on non-probability or convenience samples,
our study gives a more realistic picture of the prevalence of
loneliness and melancholy among older people and of the
possibilities to alleviate these problems. Second, those who
dropped out during the study did not differ in their feelings
of melancholy from those who continued their participation
in the study. Third, having a control group in the study
allowed to conclude that the observed positive changes happened over time independent of the intervention. Had we
not had a control group, we would likely have concluded that
the intervention alleviated the problems, which would have
been a misleading interpretation of the results. Fourth, the
participants were allowed to choose the intervention regime
they preferred, which probably reduced the drop-out rate.
Drop-out during the study was comparable to that reported
in other similar studies and it was factored into the study
design.
In light of the aspects discussed earlier, we may conclude


home-dwelling population in other parts of Finland and in
other similar cultures. The design and implementation of the
study could also be applied in other older population. However, the effect of social intervention of the present kind on
loneliness and depressive mood among older populations
requires further research.

##### Conclusion

In sum, the effects of the social intervention of choice were
moderate and did not expedite the process of overcoming
depressive mood or loneliness. These phenomena were
somewhat alleviated, but these improvements occurred independently of the intervention. Notwithstanding, our secondary analysis suggests that some positive changes occurred in
perceived social integration as a direct consequence of the
intervention, and the improvement was parallel in each of
the three intervention regime. Loneliness, melancholy, and
the dimensions of perceived togetherness are intertwined,
and thus more research is needed to achieve deeper understanding of the links between these psychosocial phenomena.
