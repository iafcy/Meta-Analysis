#### Introduction


In order to improve older people’s well-being and quality
of life, tackling the issues of social isolation and loneliness
is recognised in an international policy (WHO, 2002).
Absence of social isolation and loneliness may be seen as a
desirable state that older people wish to maintain. Social
integration and participation of older adults in society are
seen as indicators of productive ageing, and alleviation of
loneliness forms a part of policies aimed at achieving the
goal of ‘successful’ ageing (de Jong Gierveld, 1998).
Loneliness is defined as a state resulting from deficiencies


in a person’s social relationships. It is a subjective experience,
and not synonymous with objective social isolation. The experience of loneliness is unpleasant and distressing (Peplau &
Perlman, 1982). In addition, loneliness signifies a discrepancy
between one’s desired and achieved levels of social contact
(Perlman, 1987). The experience of loneliness is distinct from
social isolation. Although some studies have tried to distinguish these concepts, the results have been contradictory. On
the one hand, loneliness has been associated with scarce
contacts with close persons (Bondevik & Skogstad, 1998;
Prince et al, 1998; Savikko et al, 2005), and on the other
hand, it has not been associated with visits by children or
friends (Dugan & Kivett, 1994; Fees et al, 1999). However,
living alone is connected with loneliness (de Jong Gierveld &
van Tilburg, 1999; Samuelsson et al, 1998; Yeh & Lo, 2004).

-----

Most estimates suggest that a majority (two thirds) of
older people are not lonely (Andersson, 1998; Wenger &
Burholt, 2004; Victor et al, 2005), but a high proportion of
older people suffer from loneliness in Finland. More than a
third of older people (65+) have been found to suffer from
loneliness, of whom five per cent report feeling this way
often or always (Savikko et al, 2005). Feelings of loneliness
increase with age (Andersson, 1998; Victor et al, 2000),
especially among people aged 75 or older (Samuelsson et al,
1998; Tijhuis et al, 1999). The increase in loneliness is not
explained by age itself, but rather there is a complex web of
underlying factors involving changes and losses in health
(Wenger & Burholt, 2004; Victor et al, 2005), functional
capacity (Andersson, 1998; Savikko et al, 2005; Wenger &
Burholt, 2004) and social networks (Jylhä, 2004; Tiikkainen
& Heikinnen, 2005; Wenger & Burholt, 2004). In addition,
loneliness is associated with depression (Adams et al, 2004;
Alpass & Neville, 2003; Prince et al, 1997), either as a cause
or as a consequence. Loneliness contributes to increased use
of health services (Ellaway et al, 1999), early institutionalisation (Russell et al, 1997; Tijhuis et al, 1999; Tilvis et al,
2000) and impaired survival (Penninx et al, 1997).
In a recent review of health promotion interventions
designed to alleviate and prevent social isolation and
loneliness (Cattan et al, 2005), it was found that group
interventions were effective when they involved some form
of educational or training input and social activities targeted
to specific groups of older people. Although there are a
wide range of services and activities intended to alleviate
and prevent social isolation and loneliness among older
people, many of them do not meet the actual needs of older
people (Cattan et al, 2003).
Rehabilitation may be beneficial both by alleviating
loneliness and by reducing some of the adverse effects of
loneliness (Donaldson & Watson, 1996). First, during a
rehabilitation programme, it is possible to develop a
supportive network among the participants. Second, the
rehabilitation professionals can strengthen the existing
support systems of the participants by increasing their
contacts with friends, neighbours and family, thereby
affecting social loneliness. Third, the professionals may
instruct the participants about how to gain access to the
resources or organisations available to them.
In Finland, the municipalities are responsible for
providing social and health services, including rehabilitation
of the elderly. Rehabilitation is carried out partly by rehabilitation centres, which are independent of the general health
care system. While rehabilitation after acute incidents is
carried out in hospitals, the rehabilitation centres mainly
serve individuals with chronic conditions. Since 1977,


The trial was implemented in seven independent rehabilitation
centres and 41 municipalities around Finland. All the
municipalities and rehabilitation centres involved had previous experience of the group rehabilitation model. The
participants were recruited through a two-phase standardised selection process between January and October 2002
(Figure 1, overleaf) (Hinkka et al, 2006). Representatives
of the local social and health services in the municipalities
made the preliminary selection according to written guidelines. Thereafter, the rehabilitation centre concerned and
the local SII office jointly assessed the selected individuals’
suitability for rehabilitation.
The goal was to recruit a representative sample of frail
older persons aged over 65 years who, at enrolment, were
living at home but faced a risk of institutionalisation within
the next two years owing to their progressively decreasing
functional capacity. As an indication of frailty, they had to
meet the criteria of eligibility for the SII care allowance for
pensioners (Kela, 2004). This benefit is granted to pensioners
with a medical disability verified by a physician, and a
verified need of assistance. The benefit is independent of


rehabilitation has been provided systematically for World
War II veterans. At the same time, publicly funded rehabilitation centres were founded across the country. Since 2000,
a rehabilitation programme designed to support communitydwelling frail older people’s independent living has been in
place. The programme is based on networking of private
in-patient rehabilitation centres, the local offices of the
Social Insurance Institution of Finland (SII) and the municipal social and health service providers. In order to explore
the effectiveness of this new network-based model, a national
randomised controlled multicentre research project, the AGE
study, was initiated in 2002 (Hinkka et al, 2006).
To our knowledge, there are no earlier studies concerning
the effect on loneliness of group rehabilitation of frail
older people. The primary objective of the present report
was to assess whether a network-based rehabilitation
programme has an effect on emotional loneliness among
community-dwelling older people at high risk of long-term
institutional care.

#### Methods


The Ethical Committees of the Social Insurance Institution
of Finland and the Turku University Hospital approved the
study protocols. The participants were informed in person,
and they gave their written informed consent.

the individual’s other income. For this study, the exclusion
criteria were:

� severely declined cognitive capacity (MMSE < 18
points (Folstein et al, 1975)
� acute or aggressively progressing diseases such as
some cancers or heart diseases that would prevent
participation in the group rehabilitation
� participation in some type of in-patient rehabilitation
during the preceding five years.


The outcome, on which the power calculations were
mainly based, was living independently at home after the
five-year follow-up. The important difference estimated
between the intervention and control group was 10%
(50% to 40%, respectively). A type I error of 0.05 and


power of 80% were used in calculations, resulting in a
sample size of 305 in both groups. Based on these calculations, 44 rehabilitation groups were included. In order
to ascertain the fulfilment of every intervention group, a
substitute group was also created. If a person in the
intervention group refused to participate in the rehabilitation, he or she was replaced by a substitute. The
intention was to find 18 persons per rehabilitation group
to be randomised to the intervention (n = 8), control (n = 8)
or substitute (n = 2) group.
Altogether 741 older persons were recruited. After the
baseline measurements, they were randomly allocated by
the blinded examiners to the intervention (n = 332), control
(n = 317) and substitute (n = 92) groups. The randomisation
was based on numbered and sealed envelopes stratified by
gender, using a computer random number generator. Each


-----

municipality had its own envelopes containing, in random
order, an allocation to one of the three groups. Of the subjects
in the intervention group, 33 dropped out and were replaced
by substitutes. An additional 12 substitutes filled up the
rehabilitation groups, while the rest of the substitutes were
integrated into the control group. The final study group
consisted of 343 people in the intervention group and 365
in the control group. The drop-outs did not differ from the
intervention group (Hinkka et al, 2006).

#### Intervention


The subjects in the intervention group participated in
geriatric rehabilitation. The controls continued their
normal life. The rehabilitation programme, which had
been in use since 2000, was based on networking
between the rehabilitation centres, the SII local offices,
and the municipal social and health service providers
(Hinkka et al, 2006; Ollonqvist et al, 2007). Since Finland
is a sparsely populated country and the rehabilitation
centres are often located far from the centres of the
municipalities, an in-patient rehabilitation model was
selected in preference to an outpatient rehabilitation
model. The eight participants in each rehabilitation group
came from the same municipality, and the groups kept
together throughout the programme.
The rehabilitation consisted of three separate in-patient
periods (Figure 1) at a rehabilitation centre within eight
months. The evaluation and follow-up periods were
individually orientated. The key members of the rehabilitation team (physician, physiotherapist, social worker,
occupational therapist) met personally with the participants.
In addition, these periods included group activities, most
often physical activities (Ollonqvist et al, 2007). The actual
rehabilitation period was based on group activities. Again,
the main part of the group activities focused on physical
activation such as exercises in a sitting position, pool
exercises or resistance training in the gym. The participants
also attended group discussions and lectures given by
members of the rehabilitation team. The topics covered
older people’s life situation and possible problems,
promotion of self-care, psychological counselling, discussions
on medical aspects, information on social services and
recreational activities. Individual counselling was provided
when indicated. Usually the individual encounters involved
physical therapy (Ollonqvist et al, 2007). The total time
used for group activity varied from 20 to 56 hours, and
individual counselling from four to 19 hours during the
three in-patient rehabilitation periods, depending on the
rehabilitation centre.


#### Data collection

Baseline measurements between February and November
2002 and the subsequent 12-month follow-up measurements
(Figure 1) were carried out in the participants’ home
municipalities by three blinded independent examiners,
who were qualified physiotherapists, specially trained to
perform the measurements, and who had no role in the
intervention (Hinkka et al, 2006).
The examiners checked a pre-mailed questionnaire and
completed it together with the participant when needed.
Living arrangements and type of dwelling were asked
about. Loneliness was measured with three indicators.
First, loneliness was assessed with the question ‘Do you
feel yourself lonely?’ (0 = never, 1 = seldom, 2 = sometimes,
3 = often, 4 = always). Loneliness was categorised into two
groups: 1 (lonely) = those who suffered from loneliness
sometimes, often or always, and 2 (not lonely) = those who
suffered from loneliness seldom or never. This question
type has been used in population-based studies and has
good predictive validity (Pitkälä et al, 2004; Routasalo et
_al, 2006; Tilvis et al, 2000). The second and third measures_
were derived from a multiple-choice question ‘Does one of
the following cause you insecurity?’. (Answer ‘yes’ to
alternatives: loneliness, fear of being left alone). Participants’
social network was assessed by asking the number of their
relatives and friends, and their satisfaction with their
engagement with their children.
Depressive mood was assessed using the shorter version
of the Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS-15 (Sheikh &
Yesavage, 1986; Yesavage et al, 1983), with a scale from 0
to 15 expressing the severity of the symptoms of depression;
the higher the score, the more severe the depression. A
questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale was applied to
enquire about the participants’ subjective health. Functional
ability was assessed by asking about ability to move outdoors,
using a three-point scale (1 = no difficulties, 2 = difficulties
to perform, 3 = need of help).


#### Statistical analyses

Baseline characteristics and associations were compared
between the groups using the t-test and the χ[2] test. In
longitudinal studies, the repeated measurements of the same
subject are correlated, and in order to take this into account,
the generalised estimating equation (GEE) technique was
applied in the analysis. Liang and Zeger (1986) introduced
the GEE as a comprehensive and robust method of dealing
with correlations when analysing data with generalised linear
models. Using the SAS Institute’s GENMOD procedure

satisfaction in engagement with children in both groups.
Furthermore, the change in loneliness was associated with
the change in subjective health in the intervention group.

#### Discussion


The aim of this study was to describe the effect of an inpatient group rehabilitation intervention on emotional
loneliness among frail older people. Although the rehabilitation programme was physically orientated, a decrease in
feelings of loneliness was observed. The decrease was still
visible two to three months after the programme had been
completed. Physical activity interventions have been shown
to reduce feelings of loneliness in older people, but these
improvements were reversed following the programme
termination (McAuley et al, 2000). This suggests that it is
not the exercise programme itself but rather the environment
that provides social resources to buffer feelings of loneliness.
However, in our study there was an association between
improved subjective health and reduced feelings of
loneliness in the intervention group, suggesting that the
programme was effective. Loneliness has been reported
to be a symptom of health problems (Victor et al, 2000;
Victor et al, 2005).
The programme under study was implemented in groups
whose members came from the same municipality. Besides
the organised programme, the participants had the opportunity
to spend time with other group members, for example during
meals and in the evenings. The programme brought together
older people in a way that enabled them to discover what
they had in common. Unfortunately, it is not possible to
conclude from our data whether the participants were actually
able to make friends with each other. In a previous controlled
study, loneliness among elderly women was reduced after
participating in a programme that helped them to develop
new friendships (Stevens & van Tilburg, 2000).
In our study, the number of friends decreased during
the follow-up, but this was not associated with any change
in loneliness. One explanation is offered by the selectivity
theory (Carstensen, 1992), which suggests that older
people actively narrow down their social interaction to the
most meaningful contacts. If this is really the case, the
question could be raised of whether or not it is even possible
to establish a deeper, meaningful relationship during the
few weeks of shared rehabilitation. It has also been shown
that when people’s social contacts decrease, the need to be
engaged with others is also reduced (Perlman, 1988).
In contrast, the change in feelings of loneliness was
associated with a change in satisfaction with seeing one’s
children. Consequently, this study confirms the findings of


some previous studies suggesting that the unmet expectations
of social relationships are important predictors of loneliness
(Mullins & Dugan, 1990; Perlman, 2004; Routasalo et al,
2006). However, it does not support the previous finding
that older parents’ expectations of their children did not
predict loneliness (Long & Martin, 2000).
The level of loneliness was defined by asking the participants directly whether they felt lonely. It has been shown
earlier that, although older people with deficiencies in their
relationships describe feelings and actions closely associated
with loneliness, they do not always admit that they are lonely.
In addition, older people are reluctant to admit to being
lonely because of the stigma of social failure; to be alone
and to feel lonely is to have failed in the eyes of society and
oneself (Cattan et al, 2003). Consequently, use of explicit
questions in which the term ‘loneliness’ is mentioned, in
investigating loneliness, may result in under-reporting (de
Jong Gierveld, 1998). In order to avoid this effect, loneliness
in our study was measured with multiple questions.
The study sample consisted of old and frail individuals,
and a few refused to participate in the study. As has been
noted before (Andersson, 1985; Cattan et al, 2005; Stevens,
2001), we may wonder whether or not the truly lonely
older people were reached at all, or whether they were the
ones who refused to participate. In addition, the study sample
is selected, and so the results can be generalised only to
frail older people, not older people in general.
Assuming that the participants in our study were reluctant
to admit that they were lonely and under-stated their feelings
of loneliness, loneliness among them is actually quite
extensive. Rehabilitation actions should be based on the
participants’ needs, which in this case would be avoiding
loneliness. The programme, however, was physically orientated. Earlier studies have shown that older people are
often treated as a homogeneous group, and little consideration
is given to the specific or individual needs of socially
isolated or lonely older people (Cattan et al, 2003).
The results of our study suggest that, in order to relieve
loneliness and to prevent its negative predictive outcomes,
it is not enough merely to seek to increase the number of
social contacts of lonely older people, although this may
have its benefits. Since satisfaction with social contacts
was connected with feelings of loneliness, a greater understanding of the significance of having meaningful contacts
seems to be important in caring for older people.
