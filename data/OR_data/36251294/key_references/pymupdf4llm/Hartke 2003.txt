## Telephone Group Intervention for Older Stroke Caregivers

**_Robert J. Hartke and Rosemarie B. King_**


Purpose: This study evaluated the effectiveness of telephone groups for older, spousal caregivers of stroke
survivors. Method: The 88 caregivers were mostly white females who were 70 years old on average and
who had been providing care for an average of 3 years. Participants were randomized to treatment or control conditions, followed for 6 months, and assessed for depression, burden, loneliness, stress, and competence. Treatment participants engaged in an eight-session psychoeducational telephone group. Results:
Treatment participants showed decreased stress over time but were not significantly different from control
participants in the amount of change in stress. Control participants showed a significant increase in burden during the study; treatment participants showed a significant increase in competence. Key words: care_giver stress, depression, loneliness, stroke, telehealth, telephone_

tality,[3] social isolation,[4] as well as a range of
disruptive emotional states[5,6] have all been
reported. Studies addressing the psychological consequences of caring for stroke survivors confirm significant levels of anxiety
and depression in this population,[7–11] with
rates of depression reported to be as high as
42%–52%, especially among spousal caregivers.[10,12,13]
Group interventions to alleviate caregiver
stress have been viewed as clinically effective by their ability to provide respite; affiliation and emotional support; perspective
on the universality of caregiver stress; and
education about resources, coping strategies, and problem solving,[14,15] However,
group interventions were most often praised
anecdotally for their supportive effect and
have shown disappointingly modest effect
in moderating caregiver stress when submitted to empirical investigation.[1,16–18]
Research on caregiver groups has been criticized for its lack of specificity. Studies
have been complicated by sampling prob

lems, poorly delineated treatment paradigms, and broad outcome measures that
lacked a direct relationship to the focus of
intervention.[15–18]
Research findings have suggested that
elder spouses may be particularly vulnerable to caregiver stress. Spouses are the first
choice in a predictable hierarchy of probable caregivers.[6] Pruchno and Potashnik[19]
indicated that spouses provided the most
extensive and comprehensive care, maintained the role of caregiver longer, and tolerated greater levels of disability. Their own
advanced age and health problems make

elder, spousal caregivers a high-risk group
for morbidities due to the stress of providing care.
The stress of caregiving has been related to
the nature of functional disability in the care
receiver.[20] Physical care tasks present different challenges and have been considered less
stressful than more unpredictable, poorly
resolved cognitive and behavioral problems.[6]
In the case of stroke, both physical and cognitive/behavioral disturbances may be intermingled, and this calls for a unique type of
care. It also may take several months before
deficits from a stroke are stabilized.
MacNamara et al.[8] reported that anxiety may
actually increase with time even in the case
of “successful” stroke caregivers.
The increasing availability of telecommunications and information technology
has provided a new route for provision of
health care services. Telehealth provides
alternative ways of delivering interventions
when distance, cost, and inconvenience
prohibit conventional face-to-face contact.[21] It has the potential to bring assistance to underserved groups, such as the
homebound. Many caregivers are reluctant
or unable to leave their disabled family
member to travel distances and participate
in face-to-face groups. Group treatment
through telephone conference call is now
feasible for delivery of support to caregivers. Liss et al.[21] reviewed the application
of telehealth to persons with chronic disabilities and found preliminary evidence
supporting its effectiveness, but they noted
a particular need for evaluation of telephone-based counseling. Galinsky et al.[22]
specifically reviewed literature on technology-based groups and surveyed practitioners on their knowledge, experience, and
comfort level in this area. They cited


advantages to this format of accessibility,
convenience and anonymity, and disadvantages of decreased interpersonal cues, technological problems, and limitations to
group process, such as trust and cohesion.
Galinsky et al.[22] recommended preliminary
guidelines for conducting phone-based
groups, such as use of co-facilitators who
are more active in guiding group process.
Limited research using this intervention
paradigm has been conducted by Evans
and his associates.[23–28] These studies have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the intervention with older, blind, and otherwise
severely disabled persons and have shown
changes in loneliness, social involvement,
and life satisfaction among other measures.
Published studies of group interventions
for caregivers provided by telephone conference call have just begun to appear in
the literature. Brown et al.[29] compared the
effectiveness of support groups delivered
in person and by telephone for family caregivers of brain-injured adults, including
stroke. Participants participated in 9 to 10
semi-structured group sessions either in
person or on the phone, with group assignment depending upon the caregivers’ distance from the sponsoring hospital. Rural
caregivers were assigned to the telephone
groups. Outcome measures were family
functioning, burden, and mood disturbance. There were similar amounts of
improvement found for both types of
groups; participants showed significant
reduction in mood disturbance regardless
of mode of intervention. The study was
complicated by group bias; rural caregivers
(assigned to the telephone intervention)
were less distressed across all assessment
periods. Although both types of interventions were rated highly, the telephone


-----

group participants were somewhat more
satisfied with their experience. The investigators concluded that nothing essential was
lost in conducting caregiver groups on the
telephone when compared to traditional
face-to-face participation.
The mechanism of change in caregiver
stress intervention is often guided by a stress
and coping model. Gatz et al.[6] provided a
summary model of caregiving stress with the
following critical features: onset of a disabling event prompting care as the stressor;
_appraisal of the experience of caring; the_
_mediators or coping skills brought to bear;_
and the _outcome of successful caring or_
abandonment of the role. According to this
model, an intervention on the caregiver’s
appraisal of self and situation, as well as on
mediators such as care skills, knowledge of
disability, and outside supports, can positively influence coping and subjective distress.
Failure to demonstrate effectiveness of
interventions in caregiver stress research has
been attributed to problems in outcome
measurement. One means of focusing measurement has been to combine more established global measures with those that are
more specific to the caregiving situation.
Zarit[30] recommended a multidimensional,
multivariate, multimethod approach wherever possible. Evans et al.[23,26,27] and Jaureguy
and Evans[28] have consistently shown that
group telephone treatment decreases loneliness. Depression is widely recognized as a
specific morbidity in caregivers in need of
treatment.[1,6,10] The high prevalence of
depression among caregivers makes it a logical target of intervention. Depression
among spousal stroke caregivers has been
documented to be significantly higher than
in the general older adult population.[9,31]
Sense of competence or self-efficacy[32,33] has


_Telephone Group Intervention_ 67

been identified as a factor that mediates coping. Caregiver competence can buffer the
experience of stress and has been shown to
relate to depression.[34,35] The assessment of
the stressfulness of individually identified
problems of providing care has value as a
monitor of the unique accumulation of stress
in the caregiving situation.[36] Finally, reduction in sense of burden has been associated
with successful caregiver stress interventions.[6] Higher subjective burden has affected caregiver decision making, such as nursing home placement.[37]
The present study attempted to further
explore the feasibility and effectiveness of a
structured caregiver intervention delivered
by teleconference. The study addressed past
criticism of poor specificity in caregiving
research by targeting older, spousal, stroke
carers with a focused intervention and outcome measurements. The intervention was
tailored to the stress of providing care to a
stroke survivor and concentrated on caregiver appraisals and mediating factors of
skills and resources according to a stress
and coping model. Specific outcomes of
depression, burden, loneliness, stress, and
competence were assessed for change. The
following specific hypotheses were tested:
1. Participants in the treatment group
will show significant improvement in
depression, loneliness, burden, competence, and stress between entrance
into the study and completion of the
intervention and will maintain gains
at 6-month follow-up (p < .05).
2. Participants in the treatment group
will show significant improvement in
depression, loneliness, burden, competence, and stress in comparison to
the control group at 6-month followup (p < .05).

**Method**

The current study utilized a randomized,
treatment/control design to test the efficacy
of a caregiver stress intervention. The
intervention was designed according to a
stress and coping model and was refined by
input of a focus group of stroke caregivers.
The newly designed intervention was compared to usual support provided to spousal,
stroke caregivers.

**Sample**

Participants were spouses of stroke survivors who received acute rehabilitation at
a free-standing rehabilitation center or at a
rehabilitation unit of a major suburban
medical center. Participants were recruited
from review of their spouses’ admission
records; various print, radio, and television
media advertisements and news features;
and targeted community outreach. Criteria
for inclusion in the study were (a) 60 years
of age or older, (b) married or spousal
equivalent and living with the stroke survivor, (c) primary caregiver for a minimum
of 1 month, (d) not currently in a caregiver
support group, and (e) a telephone in the
home and sufficient hearing to participate
in telephone conference calls and individual
assessment interviews. A primary caregiver
was defined as someone who was providing
emotional support in addition to participating in care in at least one of the following
three areas: personal care, instrumental
activities of daily living, decision making
or informal case management. It was felt
that participants had to be in their role as
primary caregiver for a minimum of 1
month in order to benefit from the intervention.


Over 500 people were solicited for participation. Of the 124 participants who were
successfully recruited, 36 dropped out during the course of the study, resulting in a
29% dropout rate. Significantly more treatment participants (n = 25) dropped out of the
study than controls (n =11) (χ[2] = 4.37, _p <_
.05). The most frequent reason for dropping
out of the control group was difficulty scheduling follow-up evaluations, whereas the
most frequent reasons for dropping out of the
treatment group were death of spouse or perception of a lack of need for the intervention.
A total of 88 persons participated in the
study to conclusion and were assessed at all
time periods, with 43 cases in the treatment
condition and 45 in the control condition.
**Table 1 provides a description of the sample**
on relevant demographic factors. Treatment
group participants had spouses who were
more significantly impaired on the FIM[TM]*
motor scale, and the caregivers in this condition also significantly more often reported
receiving help with their spouses’ care.

**Measures**

**Table 2 lists the means, medians, and**
standard deviations by group and time for
the study outcome measures.

**_Depression_**

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies–
Depression Scale (CES-D) was a 20-item
self-report scale[38] that measured the presence
and severity of depressive symptomatology
during the preceding week on a 3-point scale
ranging from 0 for rarely to 3 for all the time.


-----

Scores ranged from 0–60, with higher scores
representing greater symptom severity and a
score of 16 being the usual cutoff to denote
depression. The scale has been shown to be
internally consistent with coefficients as
high as .85 to .90[38] and .86 to .88 in a longitudinal study of stroke caregivers.[39] The
scale has been shown to be a valid screening
measure for depression in community samples,[40] medical patients (e.g., stroke
patients[41]), and caregivers.[9,19,42,43] Internal
consistency coefficients for the current study
were .85 (Time 1) and .87 (Time 2).

**_Loneliness_**

The UCLA Loneliness Scale was originally developed by Russell et al.[44] as a 20-item
self-report scale and was revised by Russell
et al.[45] to a 10-item version focused on the

psychological experience of loneliness.
Respondents rated frequency of occurrence
of symptoms of loneliness on a 4-point scale
ranging from 1 for never to 4 for often, with
higher scores reflecting greater loneliness.
Russell et al.[45] reported the internal consistency of the revised measure to be high (α =
.94) for the longer version and also demonstrated a significant relationship between the
scale and a self-labeling loneliness index and
other social behaviors. Knight et al.[46]
renormed the scale on a general adult population and reported internal consistency to be
.83 to .86 for the short version with mean
scores ranging from 17.4 to 17.9. The scale
has been successfully utilized in the assessment of spousal caregivers.[47] Internal consistency coefficients for the current study were
.80 (Time 1) and .79 (Time 2).

The Caregiver Competence Scale was
developed by Pearlin et al.[32] to measure the
construct of competence in a stress and coping model of caregiving. It was a 4-item, 4point self-rating scale ranging from 1 for
_not at all to 4 for_ _very much in which the_
participants were asked to rate their sense
of competence and confidence in their role
as a caregiver. Total scores ranged from 4 to
16 with higher scores denoting greater competence. Pearlin et al.[32] indicated adequate
internal consistency (α = .74). Internal consistency coefficients for the current study
were .78 (Time 1) and .81 (Time 2).

ratings of frequency on a 4-point scale
ranging from 0 for _never to 4 for_ _nearly_
_always. Item ratings were summed to_
achieve a total score that ranged from 0 to
88, with higher scores indicating a greater
sense of burden. Evidence for concurrent
validity[48] and internal consistency alphas
ranging from .88 to .91[49] have been reported. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated
the BI was comprised of two scales, personal strain and role strain.[50] Internal consistency coefficients for the current study
were .85 (Time 1) and .88 (Time 2).

**_Stress_**

The Pressing Problem Index (PPI)[36]
was obtained from a semi-structured
interview in which participants were


-----

asked to appraise their caregiving situation by identifying current problems in
providing care and assessing their severity. For each problem enumerated, the
participant rated how stressful the problem is and how effectively the problem is
managed. The scales were numbered
from 1 to 5 (1 = _not stressful and effec-_
_tive; 5 =_ _very stressful and effective). A_
total index was derived by computing a
composite score for each problem (the
sum of the stress rating and the reverse
scored effectiveness rating) and dividing
by the total number of problems. A higher score indicated greater stress and less
effective management. Toseland et al.[36]
reported a significant decrease in the PPI
among caregivers in peer and professionally led support groups compared with a
respite-only group.

**_Functional level_**

The FIM[TM] was used to assess the functional status of the care receiver.
Function was rated for 18 items on a 7point response set from _maximum_
_dependence (1) to_ _independent without_
_assistance (7). Thirteen items and five_
items comprised motor and cognitive
scales, respectively. The cognitive scale
included language, social interaction,
problem solving, and memory ratings.
Higher scores indicated greater functional independence. Scores ranged from 18
to 125 for the total FIM. Intraclass correlations for scales have ranged from .89
(cognitive) to .94 (motor).[51] The scale has
been shown to demonstrate adequate
intra-rater reliability.[52] Internal consistency coefficients for the current study were
.95 (motor) and .68 (cognitive).

**_Demographic and caregiving information_**

All participants were administered a
questionnaire about basic demographic
information and details of their caregiving
situation, including amount of additional
help received, therapies provided to spouse,
and prior experience with support groups.


**_Treatment evaluation_**


All participants in the experimental condition responded to questions to evaluate
the treatment subjectively, including assessment of specific features of the group, what
they liked most and least, and what they
would change. At the final 6-month followup, participants in the experimental condition were asked about subsequent use of
written materials and frequency and nature
of ongoing contact with other support group
members. Control participants were asked
about their use and evaluation of the reading materials that were provided to them.


**Procedure**


Recruitment was carried out over a 4-year
period. Participants reviewed and signed an
Institutional Review Board–approved consent form when agreeing to join the study.
They were assessed with measures of
depression, loneliness, competence, burden, and stress (PPI). Questionnaires were
administered to gather demographic and
caregiving facts. Participants were then randomly assigned to a usual care or the telephone support group intervention condition
and were followed for 6 months to test the
enduring effects of the intervention.
Participants in the experimental condition
were assessed when entering the study

(Time 1), immediately after support group
participation (Time 2), and 6 months after
entering the study (Time 3). Participants in
the usual care condition were assessed
when entering the study (Time 1) and after
6 months (Time 3) only. At Time 2, participants in the experimental condition also
gave subjective feedback about their experience in the group; at Time 3, they were
asked about further contact with group
members and use of reading materials provided to them. At Time 3, participants in the
usual care condition were asked about any
counseling sought during the interim period
and their use of reading materials provided
to them. All assessments were conducted by
members of the research staff via individual
telephone interviews.
The telephone support group met for
eight 1-hour sessions and followed a structured, psychoeducational format. A group
manual that outlined the eight topics of discussion was mailed to each participant.
These included:

  - a session to introduce participants to
one another and the group philosophy,

  - facts about stroke and caregiving,

  - communicating with your spouse,

  - dealing with your spouse’s problematic feelings and behavior,

  - your stress as a caregiver,

  - taking care of yourself as a caregiver,

  - resources for you in the community
as a caregiver, and

  - a concluding session for review,
future goal-setting, and termination.
The manual included an audiotape of a
relaxation procedure and a publication on
stress management. Each participant was
given a list of the stressful problems in
caregiving that they had identified during
the initial assessment. Sixteen groups were


conducted through the course of the study,
with the size of each group varying from
three to six members. Most groups had
two group facilitators who were clinicians
in the areas of psychology, social work, or
nursing. The original protocol called for
in-person luncheons for the first and last
meetings of each group. However, these
in-person meetings became too difficult to
schedule. Consequently, almost all groups
were conducted exclusively by telephone
conference call initiated by the group
facilitators over a period of approximately
8 weeks.
Guidelines were developed and communicated to the participants during the introduction of each group in order to address the special features of telephone conference calls and
to emphasize the peer support component of
the intervention. Confidentiality was stressed
by asking participants to keep private the
personal reactions of others in the group.
When possible, participants were asked to
disable the call waiting feature on their
phone to reduce intrusions. They were also
encouraged to find a private space in their
home during the sessions (away from the
care receiver) so that they could speak freely.
The need for consistent attendance was
emphasized because the presence of each
participant was valued for his or her contributions in the sessions. Participants were
asked to identify themselves when they
spoke during the initial sessions until voice
recognition could be established. Pictures of
the group facilitators were included in the
treatment manual. Finally, to augment the
supportive nature of the intervention, participants were encouraged to have contacts
with one another outside of the group meetings; with the group’s permission, a list of
their names, addresses, and phone numbers


-----

was mailed to each of them.
Participants in the control condition
received the same stress management publication included in the treatment manual as
well as a brief written description of caregiver stress and stroke. All participants in both
conditions were given small mementos (e.g.,
specially designed mugs and cards) of their
participation in the study to help them positively identify with their role as caregiver and
express gratitude for their time and effort.

Time 1 (see Table 2). Therefore, difference
scores were calculated on the five dependent variables between Time 1 and Time 3.
Between-group comparisons were performed using the difference scores with
independent _t tests for depression, burden,_
loneliness, and stress. Because the competence change scores were not normally distributed, a Mann-Whitney U statistic was
used to test group difference on this
dependent variable. A repeated-measures
ANOVA was also performed on the stress
measure for all participants having both
Time 1 and Time 3 completed assessments
with group as the independent variable.


Descriptive statistics and frequencies
were calculated for important sample characteristics, and groups were tested for
equivalence using independent _t and chi-_
square tests as appropriate. The treatment
and control groups were tested at Time 1 for
equivalence on the dependent variables
using independent _t tests for depression,_
burden, loneliness, and stress. A MannWhitney U statistic was used to test for
equivalence for competence as this measure
did not meet the assumption of normal distribution.
_Hypothesis 1. Within-group comparisons_
for the treatment condition were tested with
repeated-measures analyses of variance
(ANOVAs) over the three time intervals
separately for depression, burden, loneliness, and stress (as measured by the PPI).
The competence scores were not normally
distributed, thus a Friedman’s ANOVA was
performed to test differences in this variable within the treatment group over time.

treatment and control groups were not

As shown in Table 1, the majority of the
sample was white and female with an average age of nearly 70 years and more than a

were mostly in longstanding marriages with
the stroke survivor and, on average, had
been providing care for nearly 3 years.
However, 25% of the sample had been in
the caregiver role for less than 6 months.
The majority were receiving some help
from outside of the family. The participants
were caring for spouses who needed minimal assistance to supervision overall. The
treatment and control groups were equivalent on most of these characteristics, except

Finally, when questioned at the 6-month
follow-up, 68% of the participants had
referred to the treatment manual and associated materials at least once.
Treatment condition participants were
questioned about their barriers to in-person
attendance. The vast majority of their comments focused on their inability to obtain
coverage for their spouses’ care needs in
their absence and their inability or unwillingness to travel a distance for in-person
meetings. When questioned about what they
liked most about the group experience, the
participants most frequently identified various interpersonal benefits, especially peer
contact. They appreciated the honest,
empathic communication that allowed for
emotional ventilation, comparison with one
another, and the experience of the commonality of caregiver problems. Relating to other participants often brought a downward
comparison in which they experienced
someone else as having a more difficult situation. Secondarily, participants liked the
content of the intervention, especially the
written materials provided, resources mentioned during sessions, solutions to specific

facilitators.
The most frequent criticisms of the group


-----

focused on technical problems associated
with phone use, such as not being able to
hear all of the participants, as well as the
loss of intimacy due to the absence of inperson contact. Other most frequent criticisms centered on the intervention as a
whole or individual session time being too
short and specific complaints about a disruptive group member. When asked what
they would like to see changed about the
intervention, participants indicated a desire
to meet in-person while simultaneously
acknowledging the difficulties for them in
doing so. Of equal frequency, participants
commented that they would have liked the
intervention to have been extended, either
by having more meetings or longer sessions.
At 6-month follow-up, 98% of the participants in the control condition (n = 43) had
reviewed the reading material sent to them
and 85% (n = 39) rated it as good to excellent. However, when asked about how useful the information was to them, only 36%
(n = 36) could mention at least one coping
strategy drawn from the reading, while 64%
had minimal or nonspecific comments.
Only 19% (n = 32) had any comments
about how the information could have been
made more useful to them.

**Discussion**

The current study provides limited evidence of the effectiveness of the telephone
conference group format as a means of intervention for caregivers. The study hypotheses
were partially supported. The treatment
group showed a decrease in stress related to
their caregiving problems. However, when
compared to the control group over time, the
magnitude of the change was not significantly different. While the treatment group


remained largely unchanged in the experience of burden, burden significantly
increased in the control group over time.
Treatment participants also showed significant gain in caregiver competence in comparison to control participants who remained
relatively unchanged throughout the study
on this outcome variable. The groups were
positively rated by the participants in most
ways, and the study demonstrated the feasibility of conducting this type of structured
group treatment entirely over the phone.
The PPI was the most targeted outcome
measure in the study. The items assessed
came directly from the spouses’ caregiving
experiences, and the participants in the
treatment condition were given their personal list of problems to which they could
refer during the group sessions. This level
of specificity could have made the stress
measure more sensitive to change. Because
of the open-ended discussion involved in
the measurement, however, the process of
identifying and rating the problems may
have been therapeutic in itself. Thus, the
control participants may have experienced a
beneficial effect from the initial administration of the measure and subsequent rating
of the same problems. The pattern of
change in burden between the treatment and
control groups suggests that the intervention may have prevented rather than
reduced the accumulation of strain over
time. Only the control participants
increased in burden scores over the study,
while the treatment participants remained
relatively stable. The emotional outlet and
comparison with others provided by the
group may have helped achieve this effect.
In their open-ended comments, participants
noted that they felt free to express themselves and spoke “from the heart” and that


-----

others often had worse problems. The
increase in the sense of competence in the
caregiving role among treatment participants may have also been a result of the
content and process of the intervention.
Participants in the groups were able to share
their knowledge and strategies with one
another and obtain affirmation of their contribution to their spouses’ recovery.
Participants noted that they learned from
each other, were allowed to contribute to
the group, and felt they were among equals.
The lack of significant change in depression and loneliness among the treatment
participants and between the two study conditions may be due to the lack of consistent,
specific focus on these issues in the intervention. It was surprising, however, that the
treatment participants did not show a significant decline in loneliness given the
results of prior studies with telephone group
support for the homebound.[23,27] Further,
lack of social involvement was one of the
most frequently mentioned types of problems on the PPI.[4] It is possible that the timelimited phone contact may have been insufficient to substantially reverse the
participants’ sense of isolation. Even
though the group members were encouraged to have informal contact with one
another outside of group meetings, only a
minority did so. Also, the disruption of the
marital relationship due to the stroke with
the resulting loss of personal and social
companionship may have been too large a
void to be adequately filled through this
type of peer contact.

**Evaluation by group participants**

Similar to the findings of Brown et al.,[29]
the subjective comments of the treatment


_Telephone Group Intervention_ 77

group participants generally reflect a high
rate of satisfaction with the telephone format and endorsement of the importance of
the program. Within the context of this
broad approval rating, the participants frequently stated a desire for an extended
intervention and were ambivalent about
meeting over the telephone. They complained of difficulty hearing others and
wished they could have met in person,
although 80% stated they could not do so.
The fact that the study was conducted in a
large metropolitan area could have contributed to this ambivalence. Participants
were generally not as widely dispersed as
might be the case in a rural setting. In-person contact was generally possible but was
not very convenient. In the participants’
open-ended comments, the interpersonal
aspects of the group were most frequently
cited as beneficial and the content of the
intervention was less frequently mentioned. However, while only a minority of
group participants had additional contact
with one another, a majority continued to
refer to the treatment manual. These contradictory reactions may reflect the limits
of the structure and length of the group. A
psychoeducational, time-limited, group
format over the telephone may not move
beyond initial positive group cohesion to a
more emotionally intimate experience.[22]
Similarly, the time limit may preclude sufficient integration of the information to
achieve an enduring impact on coping.
Notably, none of the participants commented on the advantage of anonymity
provided by only telephone contact.[22] It
may be that caregivers (generally not a
stigmatized group) do not wish for
anonymity but appreciate being known,
especially by others in a similar situation.

Limited comments from the control group
suggest that they reviewed and appreciated
the written information sent to them, but
without ongoing contact, they may not
have integrated the content into their role
as caregiver in a useful way.

**Clinical implications**


**Study limitations and future research needs**


The study results indicate both the feasibility and limitations of applying this format to caregivers in the clinical setting.
The appeal of teleconference intervention
lies in the convenience it can offer caregivers who may feel too constrained by
time and distance to engage in face-to-face
contact. However, the current study suggests limits to the impact one can achieve
when using this form of intervention
exclusively. Combinations of in-person
and telephone sessions to foster relationship building and to reinforce effects over
time may be a reasonable, more powerful
alternative. Continuing technological
advances that include visual input (such as
video conferencing) will add other options
to combine with traditional in-person gatherings. In the telephone group format, it
appears that structured sessions and associated written material and use of group
leaders comfortable with the format all
contribute to a successful subjective experience for the participants.
Further, some of the caregivers in this
study had been in their role for many years
and had also provided care to their parents
in the past. As caregivers, their coping patterns had stabilized and they were difficult
to modify. This observation suggests that
early intervention when caregivers are
establishing their role behavior may have a
greater impact


There are several limitations that should
be considered in interpreting the results of
this study. The sample of caregivers had
spouses who, on average, were not experiencing severe impairments from their
stroke and the majority were receiving
additional, outside assistance. In addition,
caregivers were not selected on the basis of
their level of distress. These characteristics
may have diminished the impact of certain
aspects of the intervention. Sampling was
also restricted to older spouses who have
been found to benefit less from interventions than adult children.[17] The intervention
design and choice of assessments may have
been too general despite efforts at increasing specificity. The treatment program was
ambitious in its scope considering the limited number of sessions. As confirmation of
the latter limitation, the group participants
expressed a desire for more contact in their
evaluative comments. A more exclusive
focus (such as coaching of a particular skill
or management of mood) may have been a
more realistic approach for a successful
impact in a short time frame. Finally, the
attention and materials provided to the control group may have been sufficient to
lessen the difference between the two conditions and the resulting outcomes.
Future research will be important in further developing this form of intervention to
address the needs of stroke caregivers.
Evaluation of combinations of formats and
greater specification in both interventions
and assessment are necessary. Innovative
approaches to respite care are needed to free
caregivers to obtain help for themselves. The
identification of characteristics that differentiate those caregivers who might be more


-----

receptive to teleconference versus in-person
contact would also be useful to encourage
caregivers to access help. For example, the
stressed caregiver who is reluctant to accept
help might be persuaded to join a telephone
group because of its convenience and
anonymity. After having a positive experience in this format, they might be encouraged to access in-person support. Finally, the
problems of the study illustrate the ongoing
need to refine design and measurement in
caregiver stress research in order to determine how to best assist and sustain the growing number of family caregivers who are an

essential, but fragile and often neglected,
component of long-term care after stroke.
