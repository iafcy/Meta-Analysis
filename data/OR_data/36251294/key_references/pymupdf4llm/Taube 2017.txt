The use of case management for community-dwelling
older people: the effects on loneliness, symptoms of
depression and life satisfaction in a randomised
controlled trial

Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management
intervention for community-dwelling frail older people,
with functional dependency and repeated contacts with
the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive
symptoms and life satisfaction.
Design: A two-armed, nonblinded, randomised control
trial with repeated follow-ups, of N = 153 participants at
baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control
(n = 73) group.
Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥65 years
of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance
in two or more self-reported activities of daily living,
having at least two hospital admissions or at least four
visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment.
Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an
intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety.
The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or
more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An
intention-to-treat analysis was applied for the primary

### Introduction

Poor psychological health among older people is widespread, albeit a neglected area, where providing social
support is highlighted as an area in need of improvement
(1, 2). Among older people loneliness is a prevalent phenomenon, internationally (3, 4) as well as nationally (5).

outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity
analyses.
Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33
dropped out. No significant difference was found
between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention-to-treat analysis did not result in
any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of
the follow-ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case
analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of
the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49,
p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at
6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47,
p = 0.035) at 12 months.
Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older
people did not result in clear favourable effects for the
primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case
management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.

Loneliness has serious consequences for cognition, emotion, behaviour and overall health if left unattended (6)
where a reciprocal association between loneliness and
depressive symptoms appears to be salient (4, 6). The
importance of promoting and utilising psychological
resources has been highlighted as fundamental for
healthy ageing (7). However, frail older people, in particular, have complex medical and social needs and their
overall care is characterised by fragmentation and weak
accountability (8). Case management is one approach to
face the challenge of delivering coordinated, and integrated care, which encompasses prevention as well as


-----

medical and social needs, including dealing with poor
psychological health. To date, there are very few published randomised controlled trials (RCT) aiming to evaluate the effects of using case management for frail older
people in regard to dealing with loneliness, depressive
symptoms and life satisfaction.

### Background

The core of case management comprises planning, facilitation, coordination, evaluation and advocating, based on
an individual’s comprehensive health needs (7, 9). In a
systematic review by You et al. (10) (N = 15, n = 10
RCTs, n = 5 quasi-experimental trials), the available evidence showed that case management in community aged
care can improve psychological health and well-being of
the clients. Assessing these psychological aspects, including loneliness, are emphasised as an important part of
case management (8, 11, 12) in order to achieve successful client outcomes (13). Moreover, when being frail, the
importance of prevention and early intervention has
been emphasised to counteract negative outcomes experienced by these individuals (14). Briefly, the term frailty
can be seen as a state with multiple causes and contributors, resulting in an increased vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death (15) as well as an
increased risk of institutionalisation and use of healthcare
services (16).
Masi et al. (17) highlights the distinction between
loneliness and social isolation, where loneliness is the
social equivalent of physical pain, and seeking connections to feel safe, secure and content with life alleviates, whereas social isolation is an objective measure of
social interactions and relationships. Thus, loneliness is
a subjective and undesired experience involving a negative affect (4, 18). Moreover, the known reciprocal
relationship between loneliness and depression (4, 6,
19) is apparent when older people themselves describe
the experience of depression as being associated with
loneliness, isolation and shielding (20). Symptoms of
depression among older people differ from younger
people where the former displays somatic symptoms,
cognitive changes and loss of interest. This can be characterised by depressed mood, decreased energy, feelings
of worthlessness and inability to enjoy pleasurable
activities or events, among others (21). In regard to the
fact that loneliness is associated with both physical and
psychological adverse health outcomes (4), including
lower life satisfaction (5, 22), and depressed mood (4,
5), elucidates the importance of recognition in clinical
practice.
There is evidence that case managers benefit a client’s
perception of psychological support in terms of providing
reassurance, feelings of security and social support (12).
In addition, attributes such as self-efficacy, self-esteem,


confidence, optimism, purpose in life and coping are of
major importance for healthy ageing (7) and these attributes are reflected in the concept of life satisfaction as
described by Neugarten et al. (23). Low self-esteem has
been found to be associated with lower life satisfaction
among older Europeans, along with being unsatisfied
with social contacts and feeling hindered by health problems (24). Accordingly, the actual effect of case management for frail older people in regard to life satisfaction as
well as loneliness is of further interest, but remains
unclear due to the limited number of published experimental trials and, in particular, RCTs.
Frail older people living at home are currently at risk
of receiving fragmented care with limited focus on psychological health as well as social support. Evaluation of
the comprehensive approach, as provided in case management, with focus on loneliness, depressive symptoms
and life satisfaction, would generate additional knowledge concerning the care and well-being of frail older
people.

### Aim

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a
case management intervention to community-dwelling
frail older people with functional dependency and
repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing
on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction.

### Method

Design

The study had a nonblinded, two-armed randomised controlled design (RCT) with repeated follow-ups. The study
has been developed applying the Medical Research
Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions
(25–27) using a stepwise approach including development, feasibility/piloting, evaluation and implementation
(25, 26). The development phase included a literature
review (28). Thereafter, the intervention programme was
developed and included a pilot study (29) and final modifications of the intervention. To date, there are three
published experimental studies evaluating the effect of
the case management intervention in relation to falls
(30), in relation to healthcare utilisation (31) and in relation to cost utility (32).

Setting and sample

The study was conducted in a medium-sized municipality
in the County of Sk�ane in Southern Sweden, with
approximately 32 000 inhabitants. The municipality contains one town and rural areas. In total, 153 participants
were enrolled in the study, with 80 participants


-----

randomised to an intervention group, and 73 participants
randomised to a control group (Fig. 1). The participants
were consecutively recruited between October 2006 to
April 2010 from three clinics at the local university hospital (n = 20), three primary healthcare centres in the
municipality (n = 117), the home care organisation in
the municipality (n = 13) or through self-referrals by
contacting the research group (n = 3). Inclusion criteria
were as follows: 65 years of age or older, living in ordinary housing in the municipality, being in need of assistance in two or more self-reported activities of daily
living (ADL), having at least two hospital admissions or
at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to
enrolment in the project. The participant was also able to
communicate verbally in Swedish and had no severe cognitive impairment. To determine cognitive impairment,
the Mini Mental State Examination (33) was used with a
range between zero and 30 points, where a cut-off score
of ≥25 points was considered as having no cognitive
impairment.

Altogether, 1079 persons were assessed for eligibility.
The participants were recruited by staff at the facilities
who asked a potential participant if he or she agreed to
be contacted by a team member in the research group.
At the hospital, three nurses involved in the study managed the recruitment process. The majority of the participants (n = 862) were assessed for eligibility through a
screening procedure performed on two occasions at two
primary healthcare centres in the municipality (≥4 visits
at the primary clinic during the previous year) and contacted by telephone or mail. When contacted by telephone, the potential participants were given verbal
information and were assessed for eligibility by a member
in the research group. When contacted by mail, potential
participants were given written information about the
study and asked to complete and return a prepaid form
saying that they were interested in the study. If this was
done, a research group member called up, providing
further information, gained consent and assessed for
eligibility. Finally, some participants were recruited by


-----

self-referral. Information leaflets regarding the study
were provided at eligible settings, enabling individuals
themselves to contact the project team. Reasons for not
being recruited were as follows: did not respond to invitation (n = 571), did not meet the inclusion criteria
(n = 231), declined to participate (n = 71), could not be
reached (n = 28), were too sick or tired (n = 18) or had
died before randomisation (n = 7) (Fig. 1).
The randomisation procedure, carried out by members
of the research group, included sealed envelopes containing a note informing if the participant was allocated to
the control or the intervention group. The possibility of
being randomised to either group was equal, and the
procedure was undertaken after inclusion and prior to
baseline.

The case management intervention. The intervention was
given over a 12-month period. The case managers represented two professions, nurses (RN) and physiotherapists
(PT). All participants in the intervention group were
given a case manager (CM) from each profession. It
should be noted that in the piloting phase of the intervention, there was only a RN CM (29). The PT CM was
introduced after the piloting phase. The two CMs (RN
and PT) did either a monthly home visit together or separately (i.e. one monthly visit for each CM, respectively).
Thus, home visit’s occurred at least once a month for
each CM or more frequently, if needed. The intervention
comprised of four main components: general case management (I), general information (II), specific information
(III) and continuity and safety (IV) (29, 34). General case
management (I) included assessment of lifestyle, functional and cognitive status and nursing needs of the individual. A care plan was developed based on the
assessment undertaken and included monitoring and
evaluation. In addition, this component of case management also comprised care coordination, navigation in the
healthcare system, advocating as well as encouraging
social activities. This could mean guiding, assisting and
supporting participants in their contact with different
establishments in the healthcare system, including guiding towards an accurate level of care or accompany the
participant to outpatient visits. General information (II)
was provided regarding the healthcare system, as well as
details concerning ageing and its consequences. Information regarding activities arranged by the municipality,
such as social activities, was also given. Specific information (III) was comprised of information focusing on the
participants’ specific health problems and needs, including the use of medication and exercise, as well as psychosocial aspects. This could, for example, mean how
and when to administer a certain medical product or give
ideas and support of what to do if feeling lonely or isolated. In addition, an evaluation of the prescribed medications was made, and a physician connected to the


project, also reviewed the prescribed medications for
inaccuracies in both the intervention and control groups.
Continuity and safety (IV) included availability and
reachability. This meant that the CMs were reachable by
telephone to participants during office hours for answering questions, assist in solving problems, as well as provide assistance in crisis situations.
The CMs intervened according to the four main components, although focus differed depending on the individual professionals’ expertise. The RN CM focused on
nursing care related to health, medications and psychosocial aspects. The Mini Data Set for Home Care (MD-HC)
(35) was used by the RN CM as a regular part of the
overall assessment and covers demographic characteristics, functional and cognitive status and nursing needs.
The PT CM focused on fall prevention and physical functioning. In addition, the PT could include a social activity
as a part of an exercise session and the RN used a similar
approach where a social activity could be combined with
a practical errand, such as stopping for coffee while going
to the pharmacy (34). The interventions given to each of
the participants were documented by the CMs, including
diaries with personal reflections (29). It was also possible
to contact a physician involved in the project if needed.
All CMs communicated and collaborated regularly with
the research group, including attending steering group
meetings (29, 34). During the steering group meetings,
the CMs presented specific participant cases that were
brought up for discussion both from a problem-solving
aspect and/or success aspect. On average, each RN CM
made eleven visits and two phone calls throughout the
12-month intervention period to those participants who
completed the intervention. Corresponding average for
the PT CM was ten visits and one phone call (34).

Standard care. During the study, all participants were
receiving standard care. This care was according to the
Swedish Health Medical Services Act, encompassing health
and medical care, and the Social Services Act, encompassing home care services. The care according to the two
legal acts is provided by the municipality and the county
council in terms of in- and outpatient care, and home
care services. Home care services are based on a
need assessment carried out by the municipality and
can include meals-on-wheels, cleaning, shopping and
assistance in personal activities such as showering. If
medical specialised care is needed, the participants could
receive home nursing and/or other assistance such as
rehabilitation.

Data collection

Questionnaires were collected by means of structural
interviews in the participant’s home at baseline, and at
3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month intervals. The questionnaires


-----

from baseline, 6- and 12-month intervals were used in
this study and encompassed several assessments and
questions from which primary and secondary outcomes
were selected. The assessors were members of the project
team who all had training in performing structural interviews as well as assessing the questionnaire.

Measurements

Three primary outcomes were chosen and analysed at
baseline, 6 and 12 months for the purpose of evaluating
the effects of the intervention in regard to loneliness,
depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. For baseline
characteristics of the sample, assessments covering
sociodemographics and health aspects were chosen.

Primary outcomes. Loneliness was assessed by a singleitem question regarding the prevalence of loneliness (at
the time of the assessment): ‘Do you feel lonely nowadays?’ with three response alternatives: 1. Yes, I feel very
lonely 2. Yes, I feel rather lonely 3. No, I don’t feel
lonely. A dichotomisation (0/1) of the response alternatives was made into not lonely (3 = 0) and lonely
(1–2 = 1). The Geriatric Depression Scale-20 (GDS-20)
comprising of 20 questions (yes/no) assessed depressive
symptoms. The GDS-20 generates a score from zero to
20, where a cut-off score ≥6 indicates risk of depression
and has been validated in a Swedish context (36). Levels
of life satisfaction was obtained by using the Life Satisfaction Index-Z (LSIZ) (37) consisting of 13 items in statement form, including both negative and positive
statements, on a three-point Likert scale (agree, don’t
know, disagree). The scores range from zero to 26, and a
higher score indicated greater satisfaction. The LSIZ has
been translated into Swedish, and the instrument is suitable for measuring general life satisfaction in older people
(38).

Baseline measures. To describe the characteristics of the
sample, single-item questions covering age, gender, civil
status, educational level and use of municipal care was
applied. In addition to this, the following assessments
were made: level of dependence in personal activities in
daily living (PADL) and instrumental activities in daily
living (IADL) was obtained by a supplemented ADL staircase (39) based on Katz’s ADL index (40), and the supplement constitutes four well-defined IADL (39). PADL
refers to six activities: bathing, dressing, going to the toilet, transfer, continence, feeding, with IADL referring to
four activities: cleaning, shopping, transportation and
cooking. The instrument generated a score ranging from
zero to ten based on the performance of each of the ten
activities (can (0)/cannot (1)), where ≥1 indicates dependency in ADL. The EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D) (41),
which assesses health-related quality of life, contains a


visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS ranges from zero
(worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable
health state), on which the participant was asked to score
his or her current health status (41). This information
was used as an indicator of the subjective health status
among the participants. A single-item question for assessing depressive mood as a health complaint was drawn
from a total of 32 different questions regarding common
health complaints for older people, which were assessed
by the presence and severity during the last 3 months,
with four response alternatives (1. No; 2. Yes, little; 3.
Yes, quite a lot; 4. Yes, very much). The original version
of health complaints (42) has been revised by adding
response alternatives and symptoms from a later study
(43). The response alternatives for the item assessing
depressed mood were dichotomised as ‘no’ = 0 and ‘yes,
little’, ‘yes, quite a lot’ and ‘yes, very much’ = 1. Data on
prescribed antidepressive medication (yes (1)/no (0))
were assessed using the Downton Fall Risk Index (44)
and treated as a single item. Finally, a dichotomous single-item question was used covering whether the participant had a confidant or not (yes (0)/no (1)). The latter
three items served as background data, primarily for the
main outcomes of depressive symptoms (the items for
depressed mood and prescribed antidepressive medication) and loneliness (having a confidant or not).

Statistical analysis

Intention-to-treat analysis. This study was performed
according to the intention-to-treat principle (ITT), meaning that all participants were kept in the group to which
they were assigned, or accounted for in the final analysis
of treatment effects (45). The primary outcomes: loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, were
included in the ITT analysis. A complete case analysis
was also performed for the primary outcomes. For the
ITT analysis, missing outcome data pattern was analysed
and plausible assumptions about the missing data were
considered. Imputation method was chosen based on
these assumptions (46). The last observed value replaced
the missing value according to the last-observationcarried-forward (LOCF) method (47) applied, and when
baseline data was missing, the subsequent value for the
item replaced the baseline data. In those cases where no
data were available at any time point on item level, the
value of zero (0) replaced the missing value. This
occurred in two cases for the loneliness variable and in
seven cases at item level for the GDS-20 variable. To
enhance the robustness of the ITT analysis, supplementary analyses were undertaken for the main outcomes at
baseline and the follow-ups (46). For the item assessing
loneliness, all missing values were imputed with (0) for a
best-case scenario, and (1) for a worst-case scenario. For
the GDS-20 and the LSIZ, a likelihood-based approach


-----

and expectation maximisation (EM) (46, 48) were used.
The supplementary analyses investigating the missing
data from different approaches served as a sensitivity
analysis of the results from the ITT analysis (44).

Statistical tests. For comparisons between the intervention
(0) and control groups (1), the Student’s t-test was used
for normally distributed interval data and the Mann–
Whitney U-test was used for interval data, which was
not normally distributed. For nominal data, the chisquare test or the Fischer’s exact probability test was
used. One-Way repeated-measures ANOVA, for interval
data, and Cochran’s Q-test, for nominal data, were used
for comparisons over time within the intervention and
control groups. When significant values, Cohen’s d for
interval data was calculated and used to determine the
effect size (ES), 0.20 was considered a small effect, 0.50 a
medium effect and 0.80 a large effect (49). For nominal
data, the relative risk (RR) was used as an indicator of
ES. The differences (Δ) in ES for each of the primary outcomes were calculated between baseline and 6 months,
and baseline and 12 months for the intervention and
control groups, applying the values suggested by Cohen
(49) or if RR, in percentage. For repeated measures, the
p-value was adjusted according to the Bonferroni method
and set to 0.017; for all other analyses, a p-value less or
equal to 0.050 was considered as statistically significant.
The software program IBM SPSS Statistics (versions 21,
22) was used for the statistical analyses.

Power analysis. To avoid type II errors, a power analysis
was conducted a priori to determine the sample size of
the study. Depressive symptoms, assessed by the GDS-20,
and life satisfaction, assessed by the LSIZ, were considered. The a-level was set to 0.05 and power (1 � b) to
0.80. A mean change of 1.5 points with a standard deviation (SD) of 3.4 points over 12 months was considered
relevant for depressive symptoms. Corresponding mean
change for life satisfaction was set to 2.5 points with a
SD of 4.8 points. Based on these assumptions, a total of
59 (LSIZ) to 81 (GDS-20) participants were required in
each group.

Rigour

The CONSORT 2010 statement (50) and the CONSORT
extension for nonpharmacological trials (51) were used
as guidance when reporting. The main study is trial registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01829594.

Ethical considerations

The study was designed and conducted in accordance
with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of
Helsinki (52). Beauchamp and Childress’ (53) four ethical


principles: respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice, were used for additional ethical
guidance.

### Results

Participant flow and baseline characteristics

Of the 153 participants randomised, 108 participants
remained at the 12-month follow-up (n = 12 died, n = 33
dropped out), leaving 56 participants in the intervention
group and 52 participants in the control group (Fig. 1). At
baseline, the age span in the study ranged from 66 to
94 years of age, with a mean (M) age of 82 (SD = 6.4)
years. The women were in the majority (67% vs. 33%)
(Table 1), but did not differ in age compared to the men
(M = 82, SD = 5.7 vs. M = 81, SD = 6.7). No significant
difference was found between the intervention and control groups regarding age, marital status, educational level,
ADL and use of municipal care (Table 1). The majority
(68%) of the participants lived in an apartment or condominium, compared to 32% who lived in a house.
When using the EQ-5DVAS to rate current health status
at baseline, the mean score of the total sample was 60
(SD = 17.5) on a zero to 100-scale, with 40% of the total
sample reporting depressed mood as a health complaint,
and with 16% prescribed antidepressive medication
(Table 1). No significant differences were found between
the two groups in regard to health status, depressed
mood as a health complaint, prescribed antidepressive
medication or having a confidant (Table 1).
The prevalence of loneliness at baseline, in the total
sample (complete cases), was 24% (Table 2). The corresponding mean score for the GDS-20 was 6.0 (SD = 3.4),
and for the LSIZ 14.7 (SD = 5.1), respectively. No significant difference was found between the groups regarding
the three primary outcomes at baseline (Table 2).

Complete case analysis

In the 6-month follow-up, the complete case analysis
resulted in significant differences between the groups
regarding both loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life
satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) (Table 2). At the 12month follow-up, a medium-sized effect was found in
favour of the intervention (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) regarding
depressive symptoms. In addition, the mean score for the
intervention group was below cut-off (M = 5.0, SD = 3.48)
for the GDS-20, whereas the mean score for the control
group was above (M = 6.7, SD = 3.74) (Table 2).

Intention-to-treat analysis

After replacing the missing data and conducting the ITT
analysis, no significant differences between the two

revealed no significant differences over time between


baseline and follow-ups (6 and 12 months) regarding
loneliness (p = 0.092 and p = 0.532), depressive symptoms (p = 0.398 and p = 0.186) or life satisfaction

any significant differences between the two groups at
any time point (data not shown).

### Discussion

Discussion of results

According to the ITT analysis, this study showed that
the intervention did not have a favourable significant
effect on loneliness. Although the intervention comprised aspects regarding psychosocial health, there was
no standardised or explicit strategy when intervening
against loneliness. Instead, it was individually tailored
and this could be reflected in the lack of effectiveness.
However, identifying the frail older person’s own barriers for overcoming loneliness has been suggested as a
strategy in previous research (54). Considering the
trend for prevalence of loneliness over time in the
intervention group, along with the significant effect of
the complete case analysis, it appears that the intervention may have had an effect on loneliness at 6 months
from baseline. This could indicate that the support in
terms of alleviating loneliness provided by the CM was
sufficient initially, but not over a longer period of time.
The content of the case management intervention may
cover some dimensions of loneliness related to social
aspects, which resulted in an initial favourable effect,
but the strategy failed to accomplish a sustainable
effect. Sandberg et al. (55) found that the participants
in the case management study experienced the CM as
an important source of social support and enjoyed having someone to talk to. However, Masi et al. (17)


suggests that due to the complexity of loneliness, social
interventions targeting social support and social skills
are not the most effective strategies in combating loneliness, but rather targeting ‘maladaptive social cognition’, for instance through cognitive behavioural
therapy (CBT). In line with previous findings, further
improvement of case management should include a
more structured and evidence-based approach in assessing and intervening against loneliness specifically,
although with respect to individual needs and
preferences.

A further important finding was that the participants
in the total sample, as well as in both groups, were likely
to be depressed, when applying the cut-off score for the
GDS-20 (36). Although this is not equal to a clinical
diagnosis, the finding shows that depressive symptoms
are common among frail older people. Research conducted by Mezuk et al. (56) shows that there is a known
reciprocal relationship between depression and frailty,
and the need for providing appropriate support has been
highlighted (1). The case management intervention did
not result in a favourable significant effect on depressive
symptoms. Nevertheless, when accounting for the trend
of the GDS-20 scores over time, along with the complete
case analyses, it indicates that the intervention group


could have benefitted from the intervention. Integrated
care, as well as collaborative interventions, has been
shown as preferred and successful when caring for older
people with depression (57). In addition, changing
thoughts, behaviours, skills and associated feelings
through CBT have shown to be effective in reducing
depressive symptoms among older people (58). This is in
line with suggested strategies in combating loneliness
(17). Given the reciprocal relationship between loneliness
and depression (4, 6, 19, 20), it would be of further
interest to elaborate and investigate the possibilities of
providing support beyond social dimensions. Nevertheless, early recognition of depressive symptoms has shown
to be effective in preventing recurrent episodes of depression (21). Thus, the CM could play an important role in
detecting those at risk, providing basic preventive or
reductive strategies and when needed, advocating and for
advanced treatment such as CBT.
The final primary outcome of this study was related to
life satisfaction and can be seen as the opposite to depressive symptoms experienced by individuals since it refers
to the positive aspect of the psychological well-being,
including maintaining happy and optimistic (23). The
mean scores of the LSIZ, in the total sample as well as in
both groups, respectively, are in line with previous
reported scores for similar samples in Sweden as well as
in other European countries (59). However, among older
(60+ years) Swedes in general, a mean score of 18
(SD = 4.8) has been reported (60) and supports that frail
older people appear to have a lower life satisfaction compared to older people in general. Moreover, being less
satisfied with life is associated by deficits in social contacts, feeling hindered by health problems and low selfesteem (24). The components of the intervention were
intended to cover the mentioned factors as well as
enhancing overall psychological well-being of individuals.
Previous research on case management for frail older
people has shown favourable effects in regard to aspects
of life satisfaction such as satisfaction with psychological
health (61). Nevertheless, there are difficulties in
attempting to provide an intervention against psychological well-being due to stigma as well as referring to physical symptoms instead of psychological (57). Seemingly, it
could be that the physical-oriented components of the
intervention were more feasible for the CM delivering
the intervention as well as for the older person himself
or herself. Despite the absence of significant positive outcomes for case management in this study, there are indications that frail older people could benefit from the use
of case management in terms of loneliness, symptoms of
depression and life satisfaction. However, when aiming
to target these complex phenomena, this study indicates
that an elaboration comprising a focused and specific
intervention strategy, with well-defined outcomes, could
potentially be more beneficial for the frail older person.


-----

This compared to a broader approach such as applied in
the case management intervention. Nevertheless, this
study indicates that the CMs and the services they provide have an important role in the caring process for frail
older people living at home. By applying the core principles of case management, assessment, planning, facilitation, coordination, evaluation and advocating (9),
loneliness and depressive symptoms could be relieved
either by the CM or by referrals to primary care, including the advocating for evidence-based, state-of-the-art
treatment and counselling. Moreover, this could also
potentially result in increased life satisfaction for the frail
older person. Given the vulnerable situation for those
who are frail, and the importance of prevention in order
to counteract disability (14), the potential influence of
psychological well-being needs to be recognised as well
as further investigated and evaluated.

Limitations

In this study, as well as in the main study, loneliness was
conceptualised as a negative experience. When assessing
loneliness in form of a single-item question, neither a definition nor a specific type of loneliness was articulated. It
cannot be ruled out that the participants may have had a
diverging conceptualisation, hence threatening construct
validity. However, using a single-item question when
assessing loneliness has the advantage of approaching
direct feelings of loneliness (4). Also, in the questionnaire
used in the main study various aspects of loneliness were
assessed by single-item questions and it would be reasonable to assume that diverging conceptualisations were not
frequently occurring among the participants.
The participants in the study were considered to be frail
based on the inclusion criteria of functional dependency
and repeated contacts with the healthcare services. Not
using a well-established assessment for identifying frailty
could threaten the external validity. However, there is no
international standard or perfect frailty assessment tool
(62). Nevertheless, there is a consensus regarding preferable screening assessments where the Clinical Frailty Scale
(CFR) (63) has been recommended (15). In line with the
CFR, the participants in the present study can be considered to be mildly or moderately frail, that is being need
for help in IADLs or being in need for help in IADLs and
some PADLs (15, 63). Although an assessment with the
CFR was not performed, there is nevertheless support that
the sample in fact was frail in various degrees.
In regard to internal validity, the random assignment
itself improves and supports internal validity by enabling
other conditions, apart from the intervention effects, to be
experienced equally between the groups within the limits
of chance (64). However, the attrition that occurred
after participants were randomised, encompassing missing
items in the questionnaire, as well as declining further


participation, may affect the internal validity (64). During
the study period, 29% (n = 45) of the participants dropped
out due to several reasons, as described in the flow diagram (Fig. 1), although nearly one-third of the dropouts
were inevitable due to death. In regard to the intervention
and control groups, the attrition was fairly equally distributed. A previously published dropout analysis of the
study sample showed no significant difference between
the dropouts and the remaining sample in regard to age,
gender, financial status, health complaints, functional
dependency and depressive symptoms (31). Accordingly,
there appears to be no treatment-correlated attrition of
participants, which strengthens the internal validity (64).
Based on the assumptions regarding the missing data in
the study, it was considered to be missing at random
(MAR); that is, the systematic difference can be traced or
predicted within the complete data set but not directly due
to the variables in which data were missing (48, 65). The
ITT principle was applied to maintain the benefits of random assignment (64), and with the intention of reporting
unbiased results (46, 65). The appliance of ITT and imputing missing values have implications for the statistical conclusion validity in terms of both threats and strengths.
Applying LOCF as a method for imputing is common (46)
but also criticised. However, the sensitivity analyses
yielded no significant differences between the intervention
and control groups, at any time point, supporting the
validity of the chosen approach. Furthermore, when
imputing missing data, the gained estimate of the treatment effect is often conservative (66, 67) or underestimated (68). Nevertheless, applying ITT when conducting a
RCT is recommended as well as required according to the
CONSORT statement (50). Given the potential threats and
strengths for statistical conclusion validity as well as internal validity, it is suggested that the interpretation of the
results from the ITT analysis in this study should be complemented with the results from the complete case analysis. Finally, according to the MRC complex intervention
framework, identifying the active ingredient in the intervention is of interest (26). However, due to the flexibility
within the intervention in the present study, identifying
the active ingredient(s) may be difficult (69). It is therefore
suggested that conducting a process evaluation would be
beneficial to further understand the barriers and facilitators in the provided intervention (25, 26).

### Conclusion

Case management for frail older people living at home
did not result in significant favourable effects regarding
the prevalence of loneliness, symptoms of depression and
life satisfaction. However, when accounting for the ITT
analysis, as well as the complete cases, there are indications that case management can benefit the frail older
person in terms of these three outcomes. Due to the


-----

complexity of the outcomes, in relation to experience,
definition and assessment, an elaboration of the intervention is suggested along with further research in accordance with the MRC framework.
