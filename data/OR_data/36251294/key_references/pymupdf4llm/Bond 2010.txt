#### Purpose

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of
a 6-month Web-based intervention on the psychosocial
well-being of older adults with diabetes.

#### Methods

This study was a randomized controlled trial (N = 62) comparing the effects of a 6-month Web-based intervention
plus usual care with usual care alone among adults aged 60
years or older with diabetes. The outcomes included quality
of life, depression, social support, and self-efficacy.

#### Results

The intervention group showed significant improvement,
_F(4.48) = 4.03 P = .007, when compared with the control_
group on measures of depression, quality of life, social
support, and self-efficacy when controlling for all baseline outcome variables (age, gender, and number of years
with diabetes).

#### Conclusions

These findings provide support for the conclusion that a
Web-based intervention is effective in improving the


-----

psychosocial well-being of participants at a 6-month
follow-up. Future research needs to investigate the longterm effectiveness of Web-based interventions for
sustaining psychosocial well-being, including factors
that may affect quality of life, such as diabetes-specific
beliefs, attitudes, social support, and disease-specific
coping skills.

eople with diabetes experience psychosocial
challenges that can affect their life significantly.[1,2] Despite advances in treatment regimens now available for care, the
self-management activities of diabetes

# Premain complex, with treatment recommendations diffi
cult to incorporate into existing lifestyles.[2,3 ] The daily
management of diabetes can be overwhelming.[4] Many
emotional factors play an important role in diabetes care.
People with diabetes often experience high levels of
diabetes-related emotional distress as they manage fluctuating blood glucose levels, which can result in poor
self-management due to feelings of “diabetes burnout.”[4,5]
A significant number of patients with diabetes who have
participated in research report being depressed,[6-8] and
depression is twice as high among persons with diabetes
as compared with those who do not have diabetes.[6 ]

Depression and the feelings associated with depression
can interfere with self-care management activities and
affect glycemic control, which can lead to increased risks
of morbidity and greater health care costs.[4,9-11] Because
people with diabetes use a disproportionately greater
share of health care resources and the associated costs,
the investigation into nontraditional ways to help treat
the disease appears more than warranted.[12]

The proliferation of the Internet, in conjunction with
the advent of new health care technologies, has enabled
caregivers to target people with diabetes and other
chronic conditions, with the hope of improving their quality of life and psychosocial well-being through means of
remote access.[13,14] Several particularly promising areas of
innovation have emerged, including online support
groups, online communities, e-mail, access to health care
advice and information, and electronic bulletin boards.[15,16]
One especially attractive feature of Internet-based support groups involves how individuals with chronic illnesses or disabilities might find it more convenient to
participate in an online format rather than having to

attend meetings in person.[17] The question of whether
online support interventions can be effective in providing
social support and lower feelings of depression as compared with face-to-face interactions is particularly compelling for Internet-based support interventions since
they rely exclusively on interactions that are not face to
face.[15,18,19]

Research regarding the investigation of the potential
effects of the Internet on the psychosocial well-being of
adults with diabetes and other chronic illness continues
to emerge. Researchers have used various forms of a
Web-based intervention (transmission of data, e-mail,
accessing health-related educational information, or
online support groups) with a variety of chronic conditions, including diabetes, asthma, depression, congestive
heart failure, osteoarthritis, pain, and HIV.[18,20-23] These
investigations suggest that Web technology may improve
quality of life, reduce feelings of social isolation and
depression, and increase social support for adults with
chronic care demands.[20,24-26] Taken together, these studies
indicate that the Internet may provide a feasible alternative for the delivery of health care to such individuals.
The purpose of this study, therefore, is to investigate the
impact of a 6-month Web-based intervention on the psychosocial well-being of older adults with diabetes. The
specific hypothesis tested was that the group receiving
the Web-based intervention would experience improvement with feelings of depression, feelings of social support, and quality of life and self-efficacy issues when
compared with a group not receiving the intervention.

##### Methods

**Eligibility and Exclusions**

Criteria for inclusion were aged 60 years or older, a
diagnosis of diabetes for at least 1 year, living independently in the community, and oral fluency in English.
Exclusion criteria were moderate or severe cognitive,
visual, or physical impairment or the presence of severe
comorbid disease (end-stage renal disease, blindness,
terminal illness). No prior computer experience was
required. Individuals were eligible regardless of A1C
level.

**Study Design**

System, and local diabetes fairs held in the greater
Seattle area. A total of 67 participants responded to flyers, provider referral, or letters sent to potential subjects
from members of the Washington State Diabetes Registry.
Screening for eligibility was conducted by telephone
prior to the baseline examination. Eligible subjects were
then contacted by mail and telephone and invited to
attend the baseline examination where informed consent

was obtained. To ensure overall balance, participants
were randomized using a stratified 2-tier format based on
glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) level (above and below
7.5 [median cut]) and gender. Subjects were recruited to
participate in 1 of 2 phases, with the first phase (n = 31)
beginning September 2004 and ending September 2005.
The second phase started February 2005 and ended
February 2006. Subjects assigned to the intervention
group who did not have access to a computer were provided one. An appointment was made by telephone for
the installation of the study computer equipment, and
subjects were given training to use the equipment. A
follow-up examination was conducted at 6 months after
the baseline examination. Personnel conducting these
examinations were blinded to intervention status and
were not involved in supporting the technical aspects of

the intervention or in delivering diabetes case management
services. The study also provided access to the Internet if
an intervention participant did not have a means of access.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of Washington.

**Intervention**

The intervention was designed for and delivered via
the Internet, and it emphasized the patient’s role in maintaining health and the importance of setting goals and
using problem-solving skills to overcome barriers. The
primary objective was to improve the participants’ diabetes self-management behaviors and psychosocial wellbeing. Intervention strategies included using behavioral
and motivational strategies, using cues to modify perceptions of self-efficacy, and using cues to modify personal
beliefs regarding the subject’s ability to affect the progress of the disease and change his or her personal behavior. The intervention served as an adjunct to the usual
care provided by the subject’s provider. The primary care
physicians of the intervention patients retained full
responsibility and control over the patients’ care.
Additional strategies included instruction in disease


management, diet, and exercise and the introduction of
interventions to deal with the physical and emotional
demands of the disease.
The interaction between the study nurse and the intervention participants occurred using both synchronous
communication (instant messaging and chat) and asynchronous communication (e-mail and a bulletin board).
In addition, participants accessed a study Web site to
enter their blood glucose readings, exercise programs,
weight changes, blood pressure, and medication data.
The study nurse accessed participants’ logs to monitor
changes in their self- management patterns. As part of the
intervention, the study nurse contacted the participant via
e-mail or through instant messenger and/or chat when
there were changes in blood glucose patterns that needed
problem solving to resolve. The weekly online educational discussion group treatment component served 2
purposes: (1) to provide educational material and (2) to
promote peer support and social interaction through sharing of each person’s personal experiences in dealing with
their diabetes. The formal weekly discussion group was
delivered by the principal investigator through a weekly
online communication forum using MSN Messenger
software provided by Microsoft Corp (Redmond, WA).
The content for these weekly educational discussion sessions was developed using resources available from the
National Institute of Health, American Diabetes
Association, and the Joslin Center. The sessions related
to depression, burnout, and coping were led by either an
MSN social worker or a PhD psychologist. In addition to
the weekly formal discussion sessions, the participants
had access to one another through e-mail and instant
messaging. Participants could have real-time conversations when they were online and logged into MSN
Messenger. These interactions were participant generated and not moderated by any study personnel. See
Table 1 for a listing of the intervention resources provided as part of this study.

**Control/Usual Care Group**

Participants in the control group received their standard diabetes care from their provider. No educational or
training materials associated with the intervention were
provided to participants in the control group. Participants
in the control group had access to educational materials/
classes through traditional face-to-face classroom methods furnished by their health provider and/or via the

Internet. Internet usage for both groups was assessed during the study.

**Outcome Measures**

Psychosocial outcome measures included depression,
social support, quality of life, and self-efficacy. Depression
was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).[27] The CES-D is a
20-item self-report measure that assesses frequency of
depressive symptoms during the preceding 2 weeks. The
ratings of depressive symptoms range from 1 (rarely) to
4 (occasionally or moderate). Scores of 16 or higher are
considered indicative of depression. The CES-D has been
found to be sensitive to change over time.[28] It also shows
good reliability (a = .92; test-retest reliability = 0.54) and
validity (r = 0.44 and 0.56) in comparisons with the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and severity of
depression ratings in older adults.[27,29] In the current
study, a was .90 for the CES-D, and test-retest reliability
was 0.81.
In addition to depression, 3 other components of psychosocial well-being were examined (quality of life, selfefficacy, and social support). The Problem Areas in
Diabetes Scale (PAID)[30] is a 20-item questionnaire that
assesses emotional functioning and quality of life in
people with diabetes. This instrument measures a wide
range of feelings related to living with diabetes, lifestyle
adjustments, quality of life, treatment, and distress. Each


y g

449

item is rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from
1 (no problem) to 6 (serious problem). A total scale score
is hypothesized to reflect the degree to which the item is
perceived as currently problematic. The 20-item PAID
has high internal consistency (a = .95), and the first principal component from a factor analysis accounted for
52.5% of the variance across the set of all 20 items.[31]
Concurrent validity of the PAID scale was supported by
correlations with the Health Belief Scale (–0.34), the
Diabetes Social Support Scale (–0.47), and glycemic
control (A1C [0.18]), with greater distress associated
with poorer glycemic control.[31] For the current study, a
was .95, and test-retest reliability was 0.73.
The perception of diabetes-related social support was
assessed using the Diabetes Support Scale.[13] This 12-item
measure assesses both social support received for diabetes care and the support exchanged in a computer-mediated intervention. The scale is balanced with 6 items
worded positively (available support) and 6 items worded
negatively (unavailable support). Six of the items refer to
support that can be provided by anyone, while the other
6 items refer to support provided by another person with
diabetes. Each item is scored on a 7-point scale ranging
from _strongly agree_ (1) to _strongly disagree (7). The_
internal consistencies of the scale with subjects who participated in an Internet-based diabetes intervention study
were 0.90 and 0.91.[13] For the current study, a was .85 for
internal consistency of this scale, and test-retest reliability
was 0.57. The scale ratings also correlated significantly

Internet.[14,24]

Self-efficacy was assessed using the Diabetes
Empowerment Scale (DES).[32] The DES is a 28-item selfreport that measures the participant’s self-efficacy related
to (1) managing the psychosocial aspects of diabetes, (2)
assessing readiness to change, and (3) setting and achieving diabetes treatment goals. The DES has high internal
consistency (a = .96) and test-retest reliability (0.79) and
was found to be significantly correlated with the Diabetes
Care Profile Index and A1C.[32] In the current study, a was
.92 for internal consistency of the DES, and test-retest
reliability was 0.61.

**Sample Size and Power Calculations**

For planning purposes, the statistical power for the
study was modeled by an independent groups t-test contrast of differences in pre-post change scores for a typical
outcome variable or by the use of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of a 6-month measure of an outcome
variable by group, with the baseline measurement of that
same outcome variable used as a linear covariate for statistical control. Assuming 62 total participants (31 per
group), a 15% longitudinal attrition rate, an r = 0.5 correlation between premeasures and postmeasures of the
outcome variable, and a moderate effect size (d = 0.55),
the study was projected to have 80% predicted statistical
power to detect a group difference in the primary outcomes. Moderate-to-large effect sizes and attrition rates
in the 10% to 20% range have been reported in previous
similar Web-based intervention studies.[33-36]

**Statistical Analysis**

The planned statistical analyses for this randomized
intervention study were intended to evaluate treatment
group differences in 4 psychosocial outcome variables
(depression, quality of life, self-efficacy, and social support). To accommodate individual differences in each
participant’s initial scores, the analyses were controlled for
baseline level of the variables using an ANCOVA approach.
The analyses were also controlled for participant characteristics such as age, gender, number of comorbidities, and
number of years diagnosed with diabetes.
The proposed study threshold for statistical significance was a = .05. Because 4 outcome variables were to
be tested, the worst-case possibility that 1 of the 4 tests
would falsely appear to be significant just by chance


increases to about P = .185. To protect against this multiple-testing bias, a single analysis of the combined set of
all 4 outcome variables was first conducted using a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) procedure,
statistically controlling for the baseline levels of the variables and patient characteristics. MANCOVA analysis
results in a single P value that describes the probability
that the observed group differences in the overall pattern
of the 4 outcome variables could have happened by
chance. This becomes the primary technical test of intervention effect in this study. For interpretability, individual ANCOVA results for each of the 4 outcome variables
were also reported.
Additional exploratory analyses were also undertaken
to evaluate group differences on interpretable subscales
of several of the outcome measures and in subgroups of
participants.

##### Results

The intervention and control group did not differ with
respect to baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. See Table 2 for baseline demographics of the participants (N = 62), by group assignment. The mean age for
the intervention group was 66 years (SD = 5.7) and for the
control group was 68 years (SD = 6.2). The mean level of
education was 15 years for both groups (SD = 1.8 and 2.2,
respectively). The 2 groups did not differ significantly on
their amount of computer experience. One hundred percent of the treatment group and 89% of the control group
had some experience with using a computer. In addition,
the 2 groups did not differ significantly on any of the
baseline psychosocial well-being variables (depression,
social support, quality of life, and self-efficacy).
MANCOVA with the use of the Pillai criterion to
evaluate the multivariate significance of the set of 4
dependent variables (depression, social support, quality
of life, and self-efficacy), controlling for baseline depression, social support, quality of life, self-efficacy and age,
number of comorbidities, and years since diagnosed with
diabetes, showed a significant main effect related to
group differences, F(4, 48) = 4.03 P = .007. The univariate ANCOVA F tests for the 4 individual outcome variables showed a significant (P < .05) difference for
depression, social support, quality of life, and self-efficacy. See Table 3 and Figure 1 for the displayed statistics
of before and after unadjusted means, covariate adjusted
difference score, _d statistic, and observed power and_

main effect related to group differences, F(3, 49) = 3.50
_P_ = .035. The univariate _F tests obtained in the_
MANCOVA showed significant _P < .05 difference for_
the subscales of “assessing readiness to change” and
“achieving diabetes treatment goals” (data not shown).
Additional analyses were conducted to further explore
the possible association between the psychosocial
domains of depression, quality of life, self-efficacy, and
social support with disease-specific variables known to
influence the relationship between psychosocial wellbeing and treatment type in adults with diabetes.[37-40]
These variables included number of years with diabetes,
number of comorbidities, and treatment type (insulin use,
oral glycemic agent, no medication). A MANCOVA was
conducted using the change scores on depression, quality
of life, self-efficacy, and social support as the dependent
variables and controlling for the individual characteristics (age, gender, martial status, A1C, education, and
baseline score on the dependent variables). Number of


years with diabetes (more and less than 16 years), number of comorbidities (more and less than 6), treatment
type (insulin use, oral glycemic agent, no medication),
and group assignment (treatment versus control) were
used as independent variables. Findings showed a significant main effect (P < .05) for treatment type, together
with a significant main effect (P < .05) for depression
and quality of life with regard to group assignment.
There was no significant main effect for number of years
with diabetes, number of comorbidities, or any other
significant interactions. As can be seen in Figures 2 and
3, the participants in both groups (treatment and control)
experienced the same pattern of change as the participants in the no-medication category. Their change scores
on their depression and quality-of-life ratings, however,
were much lower than that of the participants in the oral
agent or insulin use group. Participants in the oral agent
group showed the greatest improvements on their depression and quality-of-life scores, whereas insulin users
also experienced improvements in their depression and

##### Discussion


The purpose of this study was to investigate the
impact of a 6-month Web-based intervention on the psychosocial outcomes associated with diabetes management. The specific hypothesis tested was that a 6-month
Web-based intervention would improve the psychosocial
well-being of the participants who received a 6-month
Web-based intervention compared with a control group.
Participants who received the Web intervention did
improve on their depression, quality of life, self-efficacy,
and social support ratings compared with the control
group. Findings from this study also provide support for
the premise that duration of diabetes, number of comorbidities, and glycemic control are not associated with
quality of life and depression.
The type of diabetes treatment regimen, however, was
associated with depression and quality-of-life outcomes.
Participants who were in the no-medication group reported
more depression and poorer quality of life than participants who were taking either an oral agent or insulin.

group should have better psychosocial well-being because
their disease has not advanced to the point that they
require medication intervention. In contrast, however, the
average time period for establishing diagnoses of diabetes
was 9.9 years for participants in the no-medication group
compared with 8.9 years for participants in the oral agent
group. Since insulin resistance and progression of insulin
secretory dysfunction are major confounders of effective
long-term glycemic management,[41-44] it is possible that
participants in the no-medication group have to work
harder (exercise more and eat a diet lower in carbohydrates to keep their blood glucose levels within the reference range compared with people who are currently
taking an oral agent). This pressure to maintain normal
blood glucose levels in light of the increasing unavailability of insulin could create a catch-22–type situation
responsible for generating negative feelings about not
being able to manage the disease as well as in the past.
The initiation of medication is often delayed in patients
with type 2 diabetes for several reasons, including a lack
of resources in an office-based practice, fear of hypoglycemia, and provider and patient resistance to its use.[45,46]

This study was limited to a small sample of older
adults, who were mainly Caucasian, well educated, and
earned an annual income greater than $40 000. It did not
look at the long-term effectiveness of the intervention. In


addition, since this was a multicomponent intervention, it
was not possible to determine which aspect of the intervention was the most effective and contributed the most
to changes in the psychological outcome measures.
Furthermore, participants varied widely in how actively
they used the Web site intervention components. As can
also be inferred, this study lacked a diverse pool of participants in terms of race, socioeconomic status, and
geographic location. Finally, the study sample was composed of a motivated group of volunteers with fairly good
glycemic control who chose to enroll in an intervention
study (all characteristics of patients motivated to engage
in an appropriate regimen of self-care management).
In the light of these limitations, the findings of this
study provide additional evidence regarding the effects of
a Web-based intervention for improving depression,
social support, self-efficacy, and quality of life in a
sample of older men and women with diabetes. Webbased interventions to enhance self-confidence and
social support may be important for assisting older adults
to better manage their diabetes. In addition, Web interventions that link both physical and psychosocial wellbeing and social support (ie, peer and health care
provider support) may be particularly relevant for adults
with diabetes because of their potential contribution to
improving both the physiological and psychosocial outcomes associated with diabetes. The interrelatedness of
physiological and psychosocial adjustment in people
with diabetes warrants further attention. Researchers and
clinicians need to learn how can we design, implement,
and evaluate Web-based interventions that influence factors that may affect quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing, including diabetes-specific beliefs and attitudes,
social support, and disease-specific coping skills.
