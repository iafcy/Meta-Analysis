**_Background. Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is claimed to have a variety of benefits, but almost all published results_**
are anecdotal. We characterized the resident population in long-term care facilities desiring AAT and determined
whether AAT can objectively improve loneliness.

**_Methods. Of 62 residents, 45 met inclusion criteria for the study. These 45 residents were administered the Demo-_**
graphic and Pet History Questionnaire (DPHQ) and Version 3 of the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS). They were
then randomized into three groups (no AAT; AAT once/week; AAT three times/week; n � 15/group) and retested with
the UCLA-LS near the end of the 6-week study.

**_Results. Use of the DPHQ showed residents volunteering for the study had a strong life-history of emotional inti-_**
macy with pets and wished that they currently had a pet. AAT was shown by analysis of covariance followed by pairwise comparison to have significantly reduced loneliness scores in comparison with the no AAT group.

**_Conclusions. The desire for AAT strongly correlates with previous pet ownership. AAT reduces loneliness in resi-_**
dents of long-term care facilities.


S the geriatric population in the United States is
steadily increasing, many older Americans eventually

# A

come to live in some type of long-term care facility. These
facilities tend to restrict the resident’s personal belongings,
including the possession of pets. Loneliness is common in
these facilities (1–3).
As discussed by Peplau and Perlman (4), predisposing
factors make individuals prone to loneliness, and precipitating events can cause the onset of loneliness. The onset of
loneliness can be caused by a change in an individual’s actual or desired need for social relationships. Physical separation from loved ones, such as when a family member
moves to a new community, can precipitate loneliness (4).
How can loneliness be decreased among elders in longterm care facilities? One method that has been suggested is
the use of animal-assisted therapy (AAT), also known as
pet-facilitated therapy (5). AAT has been used in other settings to combat loneliness or to increase socialization.
Levinson (6) used the dog “Jingles” in psychotherapy sessions to enable children to better express their feelings.
Brickel (7) used cat mascots on a hospital ward of total-care
elderly patients. Friedmann and colleagues (8) found pet
ownership to be the most robust of several factors that predicted survival in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or angina. Mugford and M’Comisky (9) found that,
among old-age pensioners living alone in an urban area in
Yorkshire, England, and randomly given either budgerigars
(a type of bird) or begonias, the budgerigar owners were
better off emotionally, had more friends, had more visitors,
and generally were more involved with the community than


the plant owners. Many other, mostly anecdotal, reports suggest a positive effect of association with animals (10–21).
No randomized, prospective study has determined whether
AAT is effective in combating loneliness among elderly adults.
A simplified version of the UCLA Loneliness Scale was used
in a retrospective analysis of patients already participating in
resident pet or visitation pet programs (22). The study found
that nursing home patients who reported a high level of voluntary contact with pets had lower scores for loneliness than
those who reported a low level of contact.
Here, we used a questionnaire called the Demographic
and Pet History Questionnaire (DPHQ) to characterize individuals in a long-term facility who volunteered to participate in AAT. Loneliness was measured with Version 3 of
the University of California at Los Angeles Loneliness
Scale (UCLA-LS) before and after exposure to AAT.

**METHODS**

The research study was conducted in three long-term care
facilities in a city in southern Mississippi. Each of the facilities is privately owned and is licensed to maintain between
75 and 100 beds. The facilities receive private, Medicaid,
and Medicare funds. The occupancy rate for each of the facilities is about 95%. Most of the rooms are semiprivate.
The Institutional Review Board of the Louisiana State
University Medical Center (LSUMC) and the three longterm care facilities reviewed and approved the study.
Power analysis based on pilot study data (not presented)
was used to estimate that 15 residents per group would be
needed to achieve statistical significance for a clinically rel

evant effect. Inclusion criteria were no cognitive impairment as stated by the physician in the history and physical
examination; no known history of psychiatric disorders or
diseases; no known allergies to dogs or cats as stated verbally by the resident; a minimum of a sixth-grade education;
ability to speak, read, and write English; a score greater than
or equal to 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination; completion of the Demographic and Pet History Questionnaire;
and a score greater than or equal to 30 on the UCLA-LS (a
score demonstrating a significant degree of loneliness).
Residents were recruited and screened until 45 were
found who met all criteria. The number of residents recruited from each nursing home was 11, 16, and 18. Residents were randomly distributed into three groups consisting of 15 residents each: the control group (no AAT),

AAT-1 (one 30-minute session of AAT/week), and AAT-3
(three 30-minute sessions of AAT/week). Residents were
allowed to withdraw from the study at any time, but none
chose to do so.

_Instruments_

Three instruments were used: (a) the Mini-Mental State
Examination (23); (b) the Demographic and Pet History
Questionnaire (DPHQ); and (c) the UCLA-LS (24).
The DPHQ is a 26-item instrument questionnaire used by
us to elicit data on demography, the history of pet ownership, the ages of pet ownership, the types of pets previously
owned, the length of ownership, and the desire to have an
animal in the long-term care facility (Table 1). The prefer

ence for a particular pet was ascertained by a verbal response.
The UCLA-LS is a 20-item questionnaire (24) with
scores ranging from 20 (never lonely) to 80 (always lonely).
The UCLA-LS has a high internal consistency with a coefficient alpha of 0.89 to 0.94 (24). The UCLA-LS was given
prior to the 6 weeks of AAT and again before the last session of AAT.
AAT consisted of bringing a dog into the long-term care
facilities. The guidelines for bringing the dog into the longterm care facilities are identical to the Louisiana State University (LSU) School of Veterinary Medicine Tiger Hats
Program. The dog was temperament tested and checked by
a veterinarian to ensure it was free from all diseases and was
current on all the required vaccinations.
A pet attendant (an investigator or owner of the pet) accompanied the dog during the session, but did not interact
with either the dog or the resident during the AAT session.
The intervention took place in the individual’s room of the
long-term care facility, although walking the pet in the facility’s hallway was also allowed. If the resident’s room was
semiprivate, AAT was conducted when the roommate was
not in the room. In order to circumvent the socialization between the animal attendant and the individual receiving
AAT, their interaction was limited to a script read by the attendant at the beginning of each AAT session. The dog always remained on a leash. The resident was allowed to fully
interact with the pet. Interactions included holding, stroking, grooming, walking, talking to, and playing with the animal. The same animal was used for the same resident for a
period of 6 weeks.

_Data Analysis_

The demographic data are presented as descriptive statistics and profile the nursing home residents who elected to
participate in AAT.
A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used
to analyze the data with the pretest score as the covariant,
treatment (0, 1, and 3 sessions/week) as the independent
variable, and the post-test score as the dependent variable.
Pairwise comparison was used to determine differences
among groups. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for data analysis.

**RESULTS**

Sixty-two residents were interviewed for the full study.
Eight residents elected not to participate in AAT as they did
not like dogs or cats, and nine residents did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 45 residents, 80% were
women, 91% were white, 78% were widowed, 60% had less
than a 9th grade education, 31% had a high school or GED
diploma, 31% were older than 85 years, and 70.9% were
older than 75 years. Major medical diagnoses were cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), Parkinson’s disease, atrial fibrillation, hip fracture, and severe osteoporosis.
Selected results of the DPHQ are given in Table 2. They
show a strong history of association with animals as pets,
usually dating from childhood. More than 95% had pets at


-----

or before the age of 8 years and were responsible for the
care of the pet. The majority (84.4%) had dogs as pets, and
the remainder had either cats (5%) or cats and dogs (4.4%).
All answered questions that indicated that the pets were an
intimate part of their lives, and all residents would have
liked to have a pet currently, but were prevented from doing
so by the institution or other circumstances.
Five residents (11.1%) volunteered that they would like
to have a pet as a mascot at their facility. Of the eight residents who did not wish to participate in AAT, none ever had
pets as children or as adults. Two of these residents stated
that they were scratched by cats when young and are fearful
of cats.
AAT reduced loneliness in a statistically significant manner (Figure 1). The Levene test found no significant differences in variance among the groups and so indicated that
ANCOVA is an appropriate statistical test for these results:
_F(2,42) � 1.56, p_ � .223. The ANCOVA was significant,
_F(2,44) � 5.21, p_ � .001, showing that there were statistically significant differences among the three groups. Pairwise comparisons showed that those differences were because AAT reduced loneliness. There was no statistically
significant difference between the 1 and 3 AAT sessions per
week groups.

**DISCUSSION**

The results of this study show that AAT can effectively
reduce the loneliness of residents in long-term care facilities
who wish to receive such therapy. This study found that a
large subpopulation of residents in these facilities have a
strong life-history of a relationship with pets as an intimate

part of their emotional support system and, if given a
choice, would continue that relationship.
The demographics of the residents in this study population were typical of long-term care facilities in general. The
great majority of residents were women, widowed, and
older than 75 years of age. More than 31% were older than
85. These results agree well with the 1996 U.S. Census,
which found that seniors between the ages of 76 and 90 account for more than 50% of all residents living in long-term
care facilities. The major medical diagnoses of the residents
were also typical of such facilities. In these particular facilities, the majority of residents did not have a high school education and were white.
All but two residents who elected to participate in AAT
had pets during childhood, whereas the other two did not
have pets until later in life. Most of the individuals had responsibility for their pets early in life and formed strong
emotional bonds with them. The majority of the pets lived
outdoors rather than indoors. None of the eight residents
who chose not to participate in the study had pets during
childhood. The results of the DPHQ clearly show that past
life experiences are a major predictor of who desires pet
therapy and who does not.
One serendipitous finding of this study was the occurrence of spontaneous recollection by the residents. While
visiting with the animal, the residents often spontaneously
began to talk to the animal about past events with their pets.
For example, one resident spoke to the dog and asked if the
dog had gone hunting. She remembered fondly how her pet
dog would bring dead squirrels, rabbits, and opossums back
to her. She would then “fillet them and fry them in oil” and
eat them. Another resident remembered how her dog would
sit at her feet and keep her company. One male resident reflected on his hunting dogs and the pleasure he had derived
from hunting raccoons with his dogs.
We found that AAT, even one session of 30 minutes per
week, was effective in reducing loneliness to a statistically
significant degree. The mean UCLA-LS score of the residents not receiving AAT was almost 50, indicating a high
degree of loneliness. Even with therapy, scores were still
about 40. Increasing the sessions to three times per week did
not have a significant effect on further reducing loneliness,
but prolonging therapy beyond 6 weeks might. Availability
of a pet daily or on a per need basis may also increase the
effectiveness of AAT.
This study had several strengths that helped to negate
possible confounders. Residents were randomized, and the
results were analyzed by ANCOVA, which can correct for
any differences in the pretest scores that might have arisen
from insufficient randomization. A pretest/post-test design
with separate control and intervention groups was used. The
pretest/post-test design allows the change in any individual
to be measured, greatly strengthening statistical power. Any
retesting effect would occur for the control as well as the
treatment groups and so be negated.
An important feature of this study was that the population
studied was self-selected. The results of the DPHQ and the
responses of those individuals who declined to participate in
AAT show that the desire to associate with animals is a
quality-of-life issue generated from life experiences. As


-----

such, it is likely that populations that are self-selected will
derive the greatest benefit from AAT.
The patients studied here were cognitively intact.
Whether similar results would be obtained in demented individuals is an important question.
A confounder in many studies of pet–human interactions
is that the pet can act as a catalyst for socialization or human–human interactions. In this study, AAT was administered on an individual basis, and interactions between the
therapist and the resident were minimized. Therefore, the
benefit found here with AAT is likely to be due to associating with the pet.
The study tested AAT for a graded response; that is, residents were exposed to AAT either once or three times a
week. Use of such a graded response has several advantages. First, it is more difficult to achieve statistical significance by chance in two treatment groups than in one. Second, this design gives an indication of how much AAT is
needed to affect loneliness. The results show that AAT once
a week is as effective as three times a week.
In summary, we found that the loneliness of self-selected
residents in long-term care facilities improved with AAT.
These residents had a strong life-history of responsibility
and emotional attachment to pets, usually beginning in early
childhood. These residents missed their pets and desired to
have pets in their current environment. A single, 30-minute
session of AAT per week for 6 weeks significantly reduced
loneliness as measured by the UCLA-LS and was as effective as three sessions per week. The results show that AAT
is effective in combating loneliness in long-term care facilities.
