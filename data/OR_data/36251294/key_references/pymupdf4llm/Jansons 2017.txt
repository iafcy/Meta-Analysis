Question: What is the effectiveness of gym-based exercise versus home-based exercise with telephone
follow-up amongst adults with chronic conditions who have completed a short-term exercise program
supervised by a health professional? Design: A randomised, controlled trial with concealed allocation,
intention-to-treat analysis, and blinded outcome assessment at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
Participants: The participants were recruited following a 6-week exercise program at a community
health service. Intervention: One group of participants received a gym-based exercise program for
12 months (gym group). The other group received a home-based exercise program for 12 months with
telephone follow-up for the first 10 weeks (home group). Outcome measures: Outcome measures
included European Quality of Life Instrument (EQ-5D), the Friendship Scale, the Hospital and Anxiety and
Depression Scale, Phone-FITT, 6-minute walk test, body mass index and 15-second sit-to-stand test.
Results: There was no significant difference between study groups in the primary outcome (EQ-5D visual
analogue scale, 0 to 100) across the 12-month intervention period, with an estimate (adjusted regression
coefficient) of the difference in effects of 0 (95% CI �5 to 4). The gym group demonstrated slightly fewer
symptoms of depression over the 12-month period compared to the home group (mean difference
0.8 points on a 21-point scale, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.6). Conclusion: Similar long-term clinical outcomes and
long-term exercise adherence are achieved with the two approaches examined in this study.
Participation in gym-based group exercise may improve mental health outcomes slightly more,
although the mechanisms for this are unclear because there was no change in the selected measure of
social isolation or other measures of health and wellbeing. This finding may also be a Type 1 error. Further
research to reproduce these results and that investigates the economic efficiency of these models of care
is indicated. Trial registration: ACTRN12610001035011. [Jansons P, Robins L, O’Brien L, Haines T (2017)

Australian Bureau of Statistics data from 2004 to 2005 demonstrate that approximately 70% of Australians aged - 15 years were
classified as sedentary or having low levels of physical activity.
Physical inactivity causes a significant public health burden, with
direct healthcare costs estimated at over AUD377 million per year
in Australia.[1] Chronic conditions such as coronary heart disease,
stroke, depression, and type-II diabetes contribute the greatest
burden to the Australian healthcare system.[2]

One of the easiest and most effective ways of reducing
healthcare costs in Australia might be older adults having greater
adherence to physical activity. There are a number of interventions
to enhance physical activity in populations with chronic diseases
such as cardiac disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and


diabetes. One such approach is to use short-term (4 to 6 weeks)
supervised exercise programs. Supervised exercise programs in
these populations have been shown to improve clinical health
outcomes, such as quality of life, anxiety, depression and exercise
tolerance.[3][–][5] However, there is evidence that exercise adherence
declines after the programs are completed, with many people
ceasing altogether. A randomised, controlled trial with 109 participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease identified that
approximately 50% of older adults ceased exercise within 9 months
of completing a supervised exercise program.[6] Unfortunately, the
benefits of exercise are rapidly lost when exercise is ceased,[7]

highlighting the need to promote ongoing participation. Hence,
there is a need to identify ways of promoting ongoing physical
activity following completion of a short-term supervised exercise
program.

Strategies to encourage ongoing participation frequently
employ behaviour change techniques. Three main approaches
have been used: home-based exercise programs with no followup,[8] gym-based exercise programs,[9][–][14] or home-based exercise
programs with telephone follow-up.[6] Home-based prescribed
physical activity programs with telephone support are thought to
work by embedding exercise into daily routine, and avoiding the
need for travel to an exercise centre. However, they may fail by not
facilitating inter-personal connections between the individual and
his/her peers, and by the prescriber having limited capacity to
monitor the person’s physical progress. Structured gym-based
programs may have an advantage over home-based programs, by
controlling the amount and quality of direct training and
supervision, allowing personal attention and immediate verbal
feedback from the exercise facilitator. Motivation for exercise may
also be enhanced via social support and interaction between
exercise group members with similar health issues.[15] However,
there are conflicting findings across these studies as to which of
these follow-up approaches is more effective, and none have yet
undertaken a head-to-head comparison in a regional, suburban,
single-site, community health centre.
The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a
home-based exercise program with telephone follow-up to a gymbased follow-up program amongst adults with a variety of chronic
conditions and who had completed a short-term exercise program
supervised by a health professional.
Therefore, the research question for this randomised, controlled
trial was:

What is the effectiveness of gym-based exercise versus homebased exercise with telephone follow-up amongst adults with
chronic conditions who have completed a short-term exercise
program supervised by a health professional?

Method

Design

This was a randomised, controlled trial with concealed
allocation, and blinded outcome assessments conducted at
baseline (ie, at the completion of the short-term supervised
exercise program), 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Prior to enrolment, all
participants received an initial health assessment (also used to
obtain participant baseline demographic data) from an exercise
physiologist and then completed a 6-week supervised exercise
program at a community health service. This consisted of 1-hour
group exercise sessions, with participants encouraged to attend
three sessions per week. Each participant was provided with a
home-based exercise program at the conclusion of the supervised
exercise program. Exercise physiologists collected baseline data for
this trial at the discharge assessment of the short-term supervised
program. Patients were then randomised to one of the two 12month intervention programs. Randomisation involved the investigator opening a sealed, opaque envelope containing the random
allocation sequence, which was developed by a separate investigator with no knowledge of participants’ baseline results. This
sequence was set out in permuted blocks of 4, 6 and 8, and was
stratified by the participant’s primary chronic disease diagnosis
type (pulmonary, musculoskeletal, diabetes, other). A blinded
research assistant conducted the reassessments at 3, 6, 9 and
12 months. Participants were not blinded to group allocation;
therefore, their self-reported outcomes could not be considered to
be blinded. However, the research assistants who administered the
physical tests were blinded.

Participants, therapists and centres

Participants were recruited from a pool of adults who had
completed a 6-week exercise program at the Cardina Casey


Community Health Service, South East Melbourne, Australia. Those
referred to this service typically have: multiple co-morbidities;
poor or declining mobility; physical de-conditioning; or a
combination of these problems. Mixed population rehabilitation
groups are a potentially useful mechanism of service delivery for
regional areas where throughput within a specific diagnostic
grouping is insufficient to justify a disease-specific rehabilitation
program (eg, pulmonary rehabilitation). We excluded people with
acute psychiatric impairment or cognitive impairment that made
the person unsuitable for participation in a gym-based or homebased exercise program, as determined by health service staff.
Partners and/or couples were also excluded from participation.

Intervention

Gym-based exercise program
Participants allocated to the gym-based intervention were
given a 12-month, individualised, exercise program. An exercise
physiologist from the community health service supervised this at
the gym from Monday to Friday for 2 hours per day. This meant
that there was a person present at the gym with whom the
participant already had a pre-established relationship from when
they had completed the initial short-term supervised exercise
program. Participants were encouraged to attend during the times
that the exercise physiologist attended the gym. However,
participants were able to independently attend the gym during
off-peak times (Monday to Friday 08:00 to 16:00). Each participant
was encouraged to complete a 1-hour exercise session, three times
per week. They were required to pay the standard casual entry fee
of AUD5 per visit to the gym. The exercise prescription adhered to
the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for chronic
health conditions.[16]

The prescribed exercise included strengthening, aerobic and
stretching exercise components. The strengthening component
involved 40 minutes of six to eight strength training exercises for
the upper and lower body (eg, leg press, calf raise, bicep curl,
triceps push-down, lateral pull-down, chest press or scapula
retraction) using pin-loaded resistance equipment, unless contraindicated. Participants were prescribed a two-set repetition
maximum per exercise set at a moderate intensity of approximately 60% of their 10-repetition maximum. The aerobic component of the exercise involved up to 15 minutes of stationary bike,
treadmill or cross trainer. The rating of perceived exertion scale
was used to monitor a safe ‘moderate’ intensity.[17] The stretching
component involved 5 minutes of upper and lower limb stretching
(eg, pectoral, shoulder, calf, hamstring and quadriceps) with two
repetitions of each static stretch prescribed for 30 seconds. The
healthcare professionals providing the intervention were trained
in the Health Coaching Australia model that uses motivational
interviewing techniques, solution-focused coaching and cognitive
behavioural therapy techniques to identify techniques and address
behavioural, emotional, situational and cognitive barriers to
exercise adherence.[18]

Home-based program with telephone support
Participants allocated to the home-based intervention were
also given a 12-month, individualised, exercise program. Each
participant was encouraged to complete a 1-hour exercise session,
three sessions per week, at home. The home-based exercise
program was supervised via five telephone calls over the first
10 weeks, approximately 25 to 30 minutes in duration. The total
time in minutes to complete the five phone calls for each
participant was comparable to that spent supervising each
participant in the gym over a 12-month intervention period. The
exercise physiologist supervising the telephone intervention was
also trained in the Health Coaching Australia Model. The same
exercise physiologists who provided supervision for the gymbased program also provided the supervision for the home-based
program, ensuring equivalence in the experience and educational
background of the providers of each of these interventions.


-----

The exercise prescription aimed to be comparable to that of the
gym-based program. It also adhered to the American College of
Sports Medicine guidelines for chronic health conditions,[16] with
strength, aerobic and stretching components comparable to the
gym-based program. The strength-training component involved
six to eight exercises for the upper and lower body (eg, sit to stand,
calf raise, bicep curl, triceps push-down, lateral pull-down, chest
press or scapula retraction) using body weight or an elastic
exercise band[a] to provide resistance. The aerobic component
included community walking or, if participants had access to their
own exercise equipment such as a stationary bike, this was
incorporated.

Outcome measures

Primary outcome
Health-related quality of life was assessed using the European
Quality of Life Instrument (EQ-5D).[19] This questionnaire contains
five multiple-choice questions and a 100-point overall health
state visual analogue scale. The five questions reflect mobility,
personal care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/
depression. The respondent selects one of three ordinal statements to describe their health for each. In order to obtain an
overall score, the Dolan utility calculator[20] was applied. A utility
score is determined where 0 represents death and 1 perfect
health. Test-retest reliability for community-based adults following stroke is 0.83 at 3 weeks and 0.86 at 3 months.[21] A minimum
clinically important difference using this calculation approach for
the EQ-5D amongst mixed chronic diagnosis groups has been
estimated to be 0.074.[22]

Secondary outcomes
Productivity was measured using the Health and Labour
Questionnaire.[23] This questionnaire contains methods for calculating productivity losses that are not the sole result of absenteeism.[23]

Social activity was measured using the Friendship Scale, which
is a short and user-friendly instrument that measures six
dimensions contributing to social isolation and social connection.[24] A score between 0 and 24 is obtained; higher scores indicate
less social isolation.
Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale.[25] This scale includes 14 items, seven
of which relate to an anxiety subscale and seven to a depression
subscale. Each item is scored between 0 and 3, and a sub-scale
score - 8 indicates a possible case and a score - 10 a probable
case.[25]

Body mass index (BMI) was determined by body weight in
kilograms divided by height in metres squared.[26] Body mass index
has been shown to predict cardiac mortality across a 15-year
span.[27]

The 15-second sit-to-stand test[28] was included, as it is
commonly used to measure lower limb strength in older people.
The test-retest reliability was established to be excellent
(ICC = 0.96) in a study assessing older adults with knee or hip
osteoarthritis.[29] In a study examining mobility tests for predicting
multiple falls in community-dwelling older adults, good test-retest
reliability was reported (ICC = 0.89).[30]

The 6-minute walk test,[31] which measures the distance a
participant is able to walk in 6 minutes, was performed once per
participant at each time point, using the American Thoracic Society
guidelines. In community-dwelling adults aged � 65 years, the 6minute walk test showed correlations with the Short Physical
Performance Battery (0.61), chair stand time (–0.62), habitual gait
(0.80), maximal gait (0.80) and stair climb time (–0.83).[32]

Physical activity was measured using the Phone-FITT,[33] which
is a self-reported questionnaire about the frequency, intensity,
time and type of physical activity undertaken. The Phone-FITT
allows respondents to report on household activity (such as
cooking, cleaning and gardening), recreational physical activity


(such as lifting weights or playing sport), and total physical
activity. A total physical activity (PA) summary score between
0 and 209 can be derived from the frequency and duration data
by multiplying the two across all questions and adding the
products. A higher score signifies greater participation in
physical activity.
Attendance at the community-based fitness centre over the
12 months was measured via gym scanning software that
recorded client attendance. Participation in alternate forms of
physical activity was measured at follow-up assessments at 3, 6,
9 and 12 months, with a patient-recorded logbook. Participation
in the home-based exercise program was measured using the
patient’s logbook and collated at the 3, 6, 9 and 12-month
assessments.
An adverse event was any injury or exacerbation of existing
illness that required medical attention while participating in either
intervention and was measured using the patient logbook at 3, 6,
9 and 12 months.
A range of other outcomes measures that were relevant to an
economic evaluation of this trial were also collected, but will not be
reported in this clinical trial report.

Data analysis

Each of the outcomes was compared between groups using
linear regression analyses. Data were clustered within individual
participants and robust (Huber-White) variance estimates were
used.[34] Each analysis compared groups across all follow-up
assessments simultaneously with adjustment for baseline scores
for that same outcome. A group-by-assessment time point
interaction effect was also examined to see if there was a
difference in the rate of change in an outcome between groups.
Alpha criterion level was set at p = 0.05. All analyses were
conducted using STATA software[b].
A sample size of 52 participants per group was required for this
experiment to have 90% power to detect a 7-point change in the
EQ-5D visual analogue scale of global health-related quality-of-life
at the 12-month follow-up assessment. Many minimum clinically
important difference levels have been established for the EQ-5D
visual analogue scale across a range of patient populations with
chronic disease, although a 7-point change is a standard that is
commonly employed.[35] A standard deviation of 11 points was used
on the basis of a pre-trial survey of 20 patients within the target
group conducted by the investigators. A 10% participant attrition
rate was accommodated for; thus we aimed to recruit 57 participants per group.

Characteristics of participants

A summary of the demographics of the participants is
presented in Table 1 and the baseline scores on the outcome
measures are presented in the first two columns of Table 2. The two
groups were broadly similar at baseline, although some discrepancies in characteristics were evident in terms of the proportion
of married participants; 42/54 (78%) in the gym group compared to
31/51 (61%) in the home group, and for the proportion who were
widowed; 12/54 (24%) in the home group compared to 2/51 (4%) in
the gym group. The gym group were more likely to be born in
Australia (78 versus 60%), more likely to have a primary diagnosis
of cancer (39 versus 23%) or diabetes (39 versus 23%) and less likely
to have lung disease (24 versus 45%).

Effects of the interventions

A summary of the primary and secondary outcome measures is
presented in Table 2. (Individual participant data are presented in
Table 3. See eAddenda for Table 3). The regression coefficients that
are presented represent the between-group difference averaged
across the follow-up time points adjusted for baseline scores. A
second coefficient is also presented representing the group-by

time interaction effect to identify whether the effect of group
allocation changed over follow-up time points. There was no
significant difference between study groups in the EQ-5D (primary
outcome) across the 12-month follow-up. The gym group
demonstrated fewer symptoms of depression (Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale - depression subscale) over the 12 months of
follow-up compared to the home group (p = 0.02); however, this
was the only significant between-group difference observed.

Adherence to the interventions

The mean number of exercise sessions completed at the 12month follow-up was 52 sessions (SD 43, range 0 to 156) in the
home group compared to 53 sessions (SD 34, range 8 to 150) in the
gym group. The proportion of people fully adherent (defined as
three sessions completed per week) was 34% in the gym group and
33% in the home group.

Adverse events

No participants in either group reported any adverse events
after completing the allocated intervention.

Discussion

This study has identified that gym-based and telephone followup approaches produce similar longer-term outcomes in people
with chronic diseases who have recently undertaken a 6-week,
centre-based, supervised exercise program. The only apparent
difference in outcomes was identified for the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (depression subscale) outcome. It had been
anticipated that a gym-based program might produce superior
mental health outcomes mediated via the social interaction that
participants would have participated in while at the gym. However,
no change was found in the measure of social isolation, bringing
this hypothesis into question. It is possible that the measure of
social isolation (the Friendship Scale) was not the correct scale to
measure the change in the amount of social interaction a person


encountered. The Lubben Social Network Scale[36] may have been
preferable for this purpose, as it is a measure of social network size
rather than one of loneliness and the ability to interact with others
(as is the Friendship Scale). It is possible that a mechanism of action
not mediated via social interaction may also have been responsible
for this finding. For example, having to go to the gym forces people
to leave their house, which has potential mental health benefits
from experiencing new environments or being exposed to sunlight
while travelling to the gym.[37,38] It is also possible that this may
have been a Type 1 statistical error, given the number of secondary
outcomes that were examined. Overall, the mechanism for the
between-group difference in depression symptoms was unclear
and warrants repeated investigation to reproduce this result and to
more deeply examine the potential mechanism of action. It was
encouraging, however, that the health states attained at the end of
the initial program were largely maintained at 12 months in both
groups.
To date, this study is the first to directly assess the effectiveness
of gym-based follow-up compared with home-based follow-up via
telephone support amongst people with chronic diseases who
have just completed a supervised exercise program. A recent
review identified 11 studies that have previously examined one of
these interventions compared to a control. Meta-regression
analyses found no differential effect of follow-up approach on
the rates of adherence to the exercise programs that had been
prescribed.[39] The present study concurred with this finding, in that
it identified no difference in adherence rates between the two
follow-up approaches. It is still possible, however, that the
different approaches may have different therapeutic outcomes
despite similar adherence rates. It could be postulated that
exercising in a gym environment with a range of available
equipment may enhance the ability of participants to exercise at
a higher intensity. Further research would be required to see if this
is the case.
A limitation of the present study was that it did not meet the
planned sample size of 114 participants. This study was conducted
in a somewhat regional suburban centre approximately 40 km
from a major metropolitan city (Melbourne, Australia). The study
location served as the single, major community health centre
location for this area, meaning that many of the current and
potentially future participants in this study often interacted with
each other at this centre. Consequently, study recruiters noted that
potential participants were becoming increasingly aware of the
study prior to being approached as the study progressed. These
‘study aware’ individuals were forming preferences for study
allocation grouping (usually centre-based), which then affected
recruitment, in that people who did not prefer centre-based
follow-up were disproportionately refusing to enter the study. A
meeting of study investigators determined that it was better to
cease the recruitment early at 105 rather than recruit a biased
sample into the study. A consequence of this was that the study had
lower statistical power than anticipated and that Type II statistical
errors may have been made. A review of the analyses of the primary
and secondary outcomes indicates that this may have been an issue
for the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale – Anxiety subscale.
The present study was not able to determine whether the
exercise participation rates or health outcomes would have been
any better for this patient population if a ‘no follow-up’ control
condition been employed. Reis et al[12] and Berry et al[10] found that
following the completion of a short-term, supervised, pulmonary
exercise program, the initial gains in 6-minute walk test distance
significantly declined with a ‘no follow-up’ control compared to a
centre-based exercise intervention. The Short Form-36 quality of
life questionnaire scores[12] and the Fitness Arthritis and Seniors
Trial functional performance inventory[10] also significantly declined with a ‘no follow-up’ control. In contrast, the present 12month follow-up indicated that health outcomes were largely
unchanged over this period for people allocated to either of the two
follow-up approaches. One could also question whether the
adherence rates observed in this study were sufficient to generate

a physiological benefit for participants, as both groups only
participated on average in one session per week. Previous research
has identified that one session per week after previously
completing a more intensive program is sufficient to maintain
muscle strength, particularly when compared to completely
stopping exercise participation.[40]

The present study had some other limitations. It was impossible
to blind participants or people delivering the intervention as to
group allocation. In the home-based group with telephone
support, participants’ self-reported adherence was recorded using
logbooks, whereas in the gym-based group, attendance at the gym
was recorded through electronic scanning of a membership card. It
is anticipated that the self-report approach may be more prone to
spuriously inflated scoring by study participants leading to an
overestimate of exercise adherence rates in this group.
This research has implications both for clinical practice and
future research. Clinicians could justifiably employ either of these
follow-up approaches in clinical practice, although use of an
approach that minimises overall healthcare resource use and
aligns with patient preferences is recommended. As such, future
research that investigates the cost-effectiveness of each follow-up
approach should be considered. Furthermore, there is a need to
compare these approaches in this patient population with a ‘no
follow-up’ control to ensure that it is worthwhile pursuing either
of these follow-up approaches. Future research could also take the
form of a multicentre trial varying location (regional versus
metropolitan) to investigate whether this factor influences the
relative effectiveness and economic efficiency of either approach.
This study identified no difference in outcomes between
the gym-based approach and the home-based approach with

telephone follow-up for people with chronic diseases who had
recently undertaken a 6-week, centre-based, supervised, exercise
program. This was with the exception that gym-based follow-up
may improve mental health outcomes. However, the mechanism
for this was unclear, as there was no change in the selected
measure of social isolation or other measures of health and
wellbeing. Future research that investigates the cost-effectiveness
of each follow-up approach should be considered.


What is already known on this topic: Supervised exercise
programs in adults with a chronic disease improve clinical
status. Unfortunately, many adults do not persist with the
exercise after the supervised program, thereby losing the
benefits they have obtained.
What this study adds: Adults with a chronic disease who
have recently completed a supervised exercise program
achieve similar outcomes and maintain similar exercise adherence a year later with either a gym-based maintenance
exercise program or a home-based maintenance exercise
program with telephone support. The gym-based program
may improved mental health outcomes more, but this finding
requires further investigation.
