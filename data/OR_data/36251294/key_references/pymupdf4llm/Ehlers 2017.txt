### Introduction: Despite the prevalence of and negative health consequences associated with perceived loneliness in older adults, few studies have examined interactions among behavioral, psychosocial, and neural mechanisms. Research suggests that physical activity and improvements in perceived social support and stress are related to reductions in loneliness. Yet, the influence of brain structure on these changes is unknown. The present study examined whether change in regional brain volume mediated the effects of changes in social support and stress on change in perceived loneliness after an exercise intervention. We also examined the extent to which baseline brain volumes moderated the relationship between changes in social support, stress, and loneliness.

 Methods: Participants were 247 older adults (65.4 4.6 years-old) enrolled in a ± 6-month randomized controlled trial comprised of four exercise conditions: Dance (n = 69), Strength/Stretching/Stability (n 70), Walk (n 54), and Walk Plus (n 54). All = = = groups met for 1 h, three times weekly. Participants completed questionnaires assessing perceived social support, stress, and loneliness at baseline and post-intervention. Regional brain volumes (amygdala, prefrontal cortex [PFC], hippocampus) before and after intervention were measured with automatic segmentation of each participant’s T1-weighted structural MRI. Data were analyzed in a latent modeling framework.

 Results: Perceived social support increased (p 0.003), while stress (p < 0.001), and = loneliness (p 0.001) decreased over the intervention. Increased social support directly = ( 0.63, p < 0.01) and indirectly, through decreased stress ( 0.10, p 0.02), predicted − − = decreased loneliness. Changes in amygdala, PFC, and hippocampus volumes were unrelated to change in psychosocial variables (all p 0.44). However, individuals with ≥ larger baseline amygdalae experienced greater decreases in loneliness due to greater reductions in stress (0.35, p 0.02). Further, individuals with larger baseline PFC volumes =

 Conclusions: The social support environment and resulting reductions in stress, as opposed to exercise mode, may represent important features of exercise programs for improving older adults’ perceived loneliness. As amygdala volume has been linked to anxiety, depression and impaired cognitive control processes in the PFC, moderation findings suggest further investigation in this area is warranted.

## INTRODUCTION

The aging process is multifaceted, with the rate and magnitude
of neural and cognitive declines varying between individuals.
This suggests additional factors, such as physical and emotional
health, shape aging trajectories. The experience of loneliness
is one such factor that occurs in typical aging. Loneliness is
generally higher during young adulthood, declines during middle
age, and increases again in older adulthood. Unfortunately, the
prevalence of loneliness among older adults over the age of 65
is estimated to be 7–20%, with 40% of older adults experiencing
loneliness at least some of the time (Dickens et al., 2011; Ong
et al., 2016). Loneliness is defined as a feeling of social isolation
and is related to perceived inadequacies in the quality and
quantity of one’s social relationships (Russell et al., 1984; Coyle
and Dugan, 2012). Because loneliness is multi-dimensional,
even individuals with a large social network may feel socially
isolated if the quality of social ties and support is perceived as
unsatisfactory (Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2010). A considerable
body of literature has connected loneliness to a host of health
outcomes, including increased blood pressure and body mass
index, lower inflammatory control, weakened immunity, poor
sleep health, and mortality. Such declines in physical health have
been linked directly to declines in cognitive ability during aging,
and greater loneliness is associated with impaired cognition and
increased rate of cognitive decline, reduced executive control,
clinical dementia, and depression (Cacioppo et al., 2009; Coyle
and Dugan, 2012; Shankar et al., 2013; Cacioppo and Cacioppo,
2014; Ong et al., 2016). Importantly, evidence suggests a doseresponse relationship between loneliness and health in which
chronically lonely individuals exhibit worse health outcomes
when compared with individuals who report only situational
or no loneliness (Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2007). Moreover,
loneliness, and the factors that contribute to it, may be intervened
upon to potentially slow cognitive decline and promote successful
aging. As the aging population continues to grow rapidly,
the burden loneliness poses to public health and our ability
to intervene to improve older adults’ quality of life may be
significant.
The mechanisms by which loneliness influences health are
complex and include psychological, emotional, behavioral, and
neural processes (Ong et al., 2016). During older adulthood,


increased feelings of loneliness often follow from decreases in
social connectedness and increases in stress due to life transitions
such as retirement, illness or disability, declines in physical
mobility, or death of a spouse or loved one (Hawkley and
Cacioppo, 2007; Aartsen and Jylhä, 2011; Masi et al., 2011).
The stress buffering hypothesis posits that social support serves
a protective health role during stressful events (Cohen, 2004;
Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2007; Holt-Lunstad and Uchino, 2015).
In other words, individuals with a strong and positive social
support network are thought to be better able to cope with
stress (Wethington et al., 2015). Stress appraisals and responses
attenuate or exacerbate health both directly and indirectly
through individuals’ health behaviors. Older adults, when faced
with stressful events, may be less likely to seek social support and
employ active coping strategies when managing stress (Cacioppo
et al., 2003), but may be more likely to use behavioral withdrawal
as a coping mechanism (Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2007; Segrin and
Passalacqua, 2010). As such, research suggests interventions to
reduce loneliness should aim to enhance one’s social environment
and social interactions (Masi et al., 2011).
Physical activity programs represent one approach with
promising evidence for reducing loneliness in older adults
(McAuley et al., 2000; Masi et al., 2011). Although the benefits of
physical activity are well-documented, activity levels decline with
age (McAuley et al., 2009) and inactivity has been associated with
social isolation (Reed et al., 2011). The combination of loneliness
and decreased physical activity participation may have serious
implications for older adults’ physical and psychological health
and quality of life. In a large sample of older adults aged 65 years
and older, Netz et al. (2013) found that feelings of loneliness
were highest among inactive participants, while individuals
meeting federal guidelines for physical activity reported the
lowest levels of loneliness. Similarly, McAuley et al. (2000)
observed decreases in loneliness in older adults after a groupbased, 6-month exercise intervention and reported that these
improvements may have been partially explained by the social
support environment of the program. Mackenzie et al. (2014)
examined predictors of loneliness in 127 older adults enrolled
in a 10-month aerobic exercise or stretching/toning program.
While exercise condition and sex differentially predicted
changes in loneliness, social support emerged as a stronger
independent predictor. Further, individuals reporting higher


-----

physical activity levels, lower depression, and lower perceived
stress also reported lesser loneliness across the intervention. The
combination of the social support environment and physical
exercise may, therefore, serve to reduce psychological distress,
which may, in turn, reduce perceptions of loneliness (Masi
et al., 2011; McEwen and Gianaros, 2011; McHugh and Lawlor,
2011).
Despite this evidence, the neural mechanisms through which
physical activity, social support, and stress affect loneliness are
largely unexplored (Ong et al., 2016). The equivocal body of
literature on the “neurology of loneliness” (Cacioppo et al.,
2014) suggests that perceptions of loneliness may be regulated
by various brain regions, including the amygdala, prefrontal
cortex (PFC), and hippocampus. These regions are central in
determining behavioral and physiological responses to stress
and, as such, may play particularly critical roles in older adults’
experience of loneliness. Stress is known to induce amygdala
growth while decreasing areas of the PFC and impairing
neurogenesis in the hippocampus (McEwen, 2006; Davidson
and McEwen, 2012). These changes in brain structure are
associated with increased anxiety and depression (Davidson and
McEwen, 2012) and reduced behavioral regulation (Hawkley and
Cacioppo, 2010). For example, high stress events can trigger
emotional regulation processes in the amygdala, inhibit cognitive
control and attentional processes in the PFC, and impair memory
functions in the hippocampus (McEwen, 2006, 2007). Over
time this can lead to structural and functional changes in
these regions, in addition to increased behavioral withdrawal,
which can further aggravate feelings of loneliness. Research has
linked increased perceptions of loneliness to cognitive functions
regulated by the amygdala, PFC, and hippocampus, including
executive function and memory (Shankar et al., 2013; Cacioppo
et al., 2014). Moreover, recent evidence suggests structural
changes to the brain and cognitive impairments may precede
increased perceptions of loneliness in older adulthood (Ayalon
et al., 2016).
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects
of changes in perceived social support and stress on
change in loneliness after a 6-month, group-based exercise
intervention. We hypothesized that increases in perceived
social support over the course of the intervention would
predict reductions in perceived loneliness, and that reductions
in stress would partially mediate this effect (H1). We also
examined interactions between these effects and changes in
regional brain volumes (i.e., amygdala, PFC, hippocampus).
Specifically, we tested three hypotheses of the role of brain
volume within this framework. (1) Regional brain volumes
may change over the course of the intervention and mediate
the effects of changes in social support and stress on change
in loneliness (H2). (2) Individuals with larger amygdala
volumes at baseline may be more vulnerable to loneliness
and stress and may, in turn, report greater reductions in
loneliness after the intervention (H3). (3) Individuals with
larger PFC and hippocampal volumes at baseline may
have greater capacity for behavioral regulation and may,
in turn, reported greater reductions in loneliness after the
intervention (H4).


## MATERIALS AND METHODS

 Participants
Participants were 247 community-dwelling older adults (mean
age 65.39 4.56 years, 68.4% female) enrolled in a 24= ±
week randomized controlled exercise trial examining the effects
of aerobic exercise and cognitive training on brain health.
Individuals were eligible to participate if they met the following
inclusion criteria: (a) 60–79 years-old; (b) able to read and
speak English; (c) right-handed; (d) low-active or inactive (i.e.,
participated in 30 or minutes of moderate physical activity fewer
than 2 days per week over the past 6 months); (e) local to the
study location for the duration of the program; (f) willing to
be randomized to one of four interventions; (g) not involved in
another physical activity program; and (h) scored >21 on the
Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status questionnaire (de Jager
et al., 2003) and >23 on the Mini Mental State Exam (Folstein
et al., 1975). Eligibility also included meeting inclusion criteria
for completing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment,
consisting of: (a) free from neurological disorders; (b) no history
of stroke, transient ischemic attach, or surgeries including the
removal of brain tissue; (c) no implanted devices or metallic
bodies above the waste; (d) normal or corrected-to-normal vision
of at least 20/40 in both eyes; and (e) no color blindness.
The project coordinator assessed all interested individuals for
eligibility via a telephone pre-screening interview. The flow of
participants through the study is illustrated in Figure 1. Due to
missing MRI data, 78 participants had incomplete data at baseline
and post-intervention. Analyses were completed with the intentto-treat principle, maintaining the complete sample and handling
missing data via full information maximum likelihood—a nonimputation approach that leverages all available data during
latent model estimation (Muthén et al., 1987; Little, 2013).
This study was approved by and carried out in accordance
with the recommendations of the Institutional Review Board
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with written
informed consent from all participants. All participants provided
written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.

## Procedures
After all baseline data were collected, eligible participants were
randomly assigned to one of four interventions implemented
over four waves from October 2011 to November 2014: Dance
(n 69), Strength/Stretching/Stability (SSS; n 70), Walk (n
= =
54), and Walk Plus (n 54). Dance represented the aerobic
= =
cognitive training condition, Walk and Walk Plus represented
+
aerobic training only, and SSS served as the active, non-aerobic
control condition. Each wave included 18 participants per
∼
group. The trial was powered for the clinical trial’s primary
outcomes based upon MRI data from previous studies (Kramer
et al., 1999; Colcombe and Kramer, 2003). Participants were
randomized using a computer data management system and
baseline-adaptive randomization scheme (Begg and Iglewicz,
1980). Participants in all conditions attended three 1-h exercise
sessions per week for 24 weeks ( 6 months). Each group
∼
session was supervised by trained exercise leaders, began with


-----

a brief warmup consisting of walking and full-body stretching,
and concluded with an abbreviated set of stretches. The trial
is registered with United States National Institutes of Health
ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT01472744).

## Training Protocol
### Dance
Individuals assigned to the Dance condition participated in
social dancing comprised of American and English folk dancing.
Participants learned three to five dances at the start of each
month, with the speed and complexity of dances increasing over
the course of each month and across the intervention. Dances
were led by an experienced “caller,” who provided instruction on
upcoming figures and reduced instruction over the course of each
month.

### Strength/Stretching/Stability (SSS)
Individuals assigned to the SSS condition participated in exercise
sessions designed to improve flexibility, strength, and balance
with the aid of yoga mats and blocks, chairs, and resistance
bands. Sessions included 10–12 exercises and were led by trained
exercise leaders. Participants learned new exercises at the start
of each month. Exercises increased in complexity, difficulty,
and volume over the course of each month and across the
intervention. Three exercises leaders demonstrated different
versions of each exercise throughout each session: the intended
exercise, an easier modification of the exercise, and a more
challenging version of the exercise.

### Walk and Walk Plus
Individuals assigned to the Walk and Walk Plus conditions
participated in walking sessions led by trained exercise leaders.
Individuals assigned to Walk Plus also received a nutritional


supplement containing antioxidants, anti-inflammatories,
vitamins, minerals, and beta alanine (Abbott Nutrition, Abbott
Park, Illinois). Preliminary analyses of the primary outcomes
indicated no differences between the walking interventions;
therefore, Walk and Walk Plus were collapsed for the present
analyses. Participants walked at 50–60% of their maximal heart
rate, as ascertained from a maximal graded exercise test and
increased from 20 to 40 min of walking during the first 6 weeks
of the program. During the remaining 18 weeks, participants
walked for 40 min at 60–75% of their maximal heart rate each
session.

## Measures
### Perceived Loneliness
Perceived loneliness was measured using the UCLA Loneliness
Scale (Russell et al., 1980), a 20-item scale assessing the frequency
with which individuals experience feelings of loneliness.
Individuals are asked to respond to 9 positively and 11 negatively
worded statements to indicate how often they feel, on a scale
from 1 (never) to 4 (always), the way described by the statement.
Positively worded items are reversed coded and all items are
summed for a possible range of 20–80, with higher scores
indicating greater loneliness. Reliability and validity of the UCLA
Loneliness Scale has been previously established in older adults
(Cutrona and Russell, 1986).

### Perceived Social Support
Perceived social support was measured using the Social
Provisions Scale (SPS) (Cutrona and Russell, 1987), a 24-item
scale assessing relational provisions including: attachment, social
integration, reassurance of worth, reliable alliance, guidance,
and opportunity for nurturance. Each provision is assessed by
four items, two describing the presence and two describing the


-----

absence of the provision. Items were modified for the exercise
setting (e.g., “I feel part of the exercise group”). For each item
participants respond in relation to the extent to which each
statement described their current social relationships within an
exercise program on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).

### Perceived Stress
Perceived stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale
(PSS) (Cohen et al., 1983; Cohen and Williamson, 1988), a 10item scale assessing the degree to which an individual perceived
life situations as stressful. Participants are asked to rate how
often they feel a certain way (e.g., “nervous and stressed”), with
response options ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often).

### Regional Brain Volume
We acquired Magnetic Resonance (MR) images during a single
session on a 3T Siemens Trio Tim (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)
to measure amygdala, PFC, and hippocampus volumes. Highresolution structural MR scans were acquired using a 3D
MPRAGE T1-weighted sequence (TR 1900 ms; TE 2.32 ms;
= =
TI: 900 ms; flip angle 9[◦]; matrix 256 256; FOV
= = × =
230 mm; 192 slices; resolution 0.9 0.9 0.9 mm; GRAPPA
= × ×
acceleration factor 2). All images were individually checked
for quality by AZB. Automated brain tissue segmentation
and reconstruction of cortical models was performed on T1weighted images using the Freesurfer software, version 5.3
[(http://surfer.-nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). In brief, individual T1-](http://surfer.-nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)
weighted images underwent non-brain tissue removal, Talairach
transformation, creation of representations of the gray/white
matter boundaries (Dale and Sereno, 1993; Dale et al., 1999),
and calculation of the cortical thickness as the distance between
the gray/white matter boundary and the pial surface at each
point across the cortical mantle (Fischl and Dale, 2000).
Surface reconstructions were carefully screened to evaluate the
success and plausibility of the automatically processed results,
as recommended by the software developers. Next, cortical
thickness maps were inflated (Fischl et al., 1999a), smoothed
using a circularly symmetric Gaussian kernel across the surface
with a full width at half maximum of 10 mm, and registered to a
spherical atlas to match individual cortical folding patterns across
subjects (Fischl et al., 1999b). The mean cortical thickness of each
cortical parcellation was then extracted and saved in text format
for data analysis. Prior to data analysis regional brain volumes
in each hemisphere were corrected for intracranial volume
separately by time point (baseline, 6 months) via analysis of
covariance (Jack et al., 1989). Volumes were corrected separately
for males and females if the homogeneity of slopes assumption
between sexes was violated.

## Data Analytic Strategy
Hypotheses were tested in a latent modeling framework
estimated in MPlus software (v7; Muthén and Muthén).
Changes in psychosocial and brain measures from pre- to
post-intervention were estimated in latent change score models
(LCSMs). A LCSM is similar to a difference score, but because it
is derived from latent constructs, the mean estimate of change


and individual differences therein are free of measurement
error (McArdle and Nesselroade, 1994; McArdle, 2009). Latent
constructs were defined by multiple measures: even and odd
items of the UCLA scale for loneliness and the PSS scale for stress,
and social support was defined by the attachment (emotional
support), guidance (informational support), and reliable alliance
(tangible aid) subscales. For each construct, a single indicator was
fixed to 1 to identify the scale, the other identifying indicators
were estimated, and all measurement residuals were estimated,
which produced latent scores similar to error-free composites.
To ensure the assumption of measurement invariance was met,
several constraints were placed on the model: estimated factor
loadings and measurement residuals were constrained to be
equal across time, and measurement intercepts were fixed to
0. In addition, repeated measures were allowed to correlate
across time. There were a few exceptions: the measurement
residuals of the PSS were not constrained to be equal and even
items were uncorrelated over time, nor were even items of the
UCLA scale correlated, and residuals of left amygdala were freely
estimated across timepoints. A similar procedure was applied in
the grouped modeling, in which measurement invariance was
imposed across time, as well as between groups, and only the
mean effects, corresponding variance, and paths tested for group
differences were freely estimated. Planned pair-wise comparisons
between intervention conditions and the control group were
made simultaneously during model estimation.
Prior to model estimation, all measures were normed to
baseline means and standard deviations of the total sample.
Thus, change scores can be interpreted as standardized change
from baseline. Unless otherwise stated, all reported effects are
unstandardized coefficients. A standardized effect size of mean
latent change is reported: d (Mean Latent Change)/[√](Baseline
=
Latent Variance). To test mediation hypotheses, parallel LCSMs
were constructed (H1 and H2). A significant indirect effect
was accepted as sufficient evidence of mediation (James and
Brett, 1984). To avoid spurious results due to a smaller sample
size, all LCSMs were bootstrapped with bias-correction (5,000
draws) (Hayes and Scharkow, 2013) to produce 95% confidence
intervals (BS 95% CI) of unstandardized effects. Latent models
included the complete sample and missing data were handled
via full information maximum likelihood (FIML)—a nonimputation approach that leverages all available data during
effect estimation (Muthén et al., 1987; Larsen, 2011), and the
current recommended practice for longitudinal studies with
attrition(Little, 2013). Model fit was determined by several
accepted indices (Hu and Bentler, 1999): non-significant normal
theory weighted chi-square (χ [2]), comparative fit index (CFI >
0.90), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA < 0.05),
and standardized root mean residual (SRMR < 0.08). Model fit
was determined for the total sample and with grouped modeling
procedures.
To test the hypothesis that baseline brain volumes may
moderate the relationship between changes in social support
and stress predicting change in loneliness (H3 and H4), models
were tested in a random effects framework. In this modeling
approach, path moderation is tested by calculating an interaction
term between two latent constructs (i.e., brain volume change
×


-----

in stress) and the path of the dependent variable regressed on
the interaction is tested for significance. The sample was split at
the median latent score for each regional brain volume to test
the moderation effects. Due to the modeling approach, model
fit can only be evaluated by nested model comparisons with
Akaike information criterion (AIC) and sample-size adjusted
Bayesian information criterion (BIC), for which lower values
indicated relatively improved fit. The hypothesized moderation
models were compared to constrained models that estimated
the interaction terms but did not predict outcome measures.
Thus, relative improvement in this comparison suggests the
hypothesized moderation effect fits the observed data better than
no effect. For random effects models, 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) of unstandardized effects without bootstrapping
procedures are reported.

## RESULTS

 Descriptive Summary of Sample
A descriptive summary of the sample is provided in Table 1.
Briefly, our sample was comprised primarily of females, and
white, college educated, and married older adults. Descriptive
statistics of manifest psychosocial variables are reported in
**Table 2. One-way analysis of variance comparing participants in**
each exercise condition indicated that participants across the four
conditions did not differ in demographics, psychosocial variables,
or regional brain volumes at baseline (all p > 0.05).

## Longitudinal Consistency of Measures
Prior to latent modeling, the internal consistency of the
measures within persons over time was evaluated with Pearson
correlations. Stress indices (PSS) were divided into even and
odd items for the purpose of latent construction, and these were
moderately consistent over the course of the intervention (r

inconsistency that remained in the measures was accounted for
in the LCSMs by constraining factor loadings, measure residuals,
and intercepts to be the same across time, thereby imposing
the assumption of measurement invariance during hypothesis
testing.

Further, individuals significantly varied in the magnitude of
change in each of these constructs (see Table 3), suggesting

## Changes in Regional Brain Volumes As Mediators of Change in Loneliness (H2)
Amygdala volume did not change over the course of the
intervention (mean 0.04, p 0.40; BS 95% CI: 0.04/0.14; d

stress, or loneliness. Thus, concurrent changes in brain volumes
were unrelated to psychosocial outcomes, providing no evidence
in support of H2. The models of change in amygdala and PFC
volume had good fit (respectively): χ(5, 3)[2] [=][ 11.17 and 3.15,][ p][ ≥]

## Baseline Regional Brain Volumes As Moderators of Change in Loneliness (H3 and H4)
The following correlations were accounted for in the model that
tested baseline brain volumes as moderators of the effects of
changes in stress and social support on change in loneliness (H3
and H4). At baseline larger amygdala volume correlated with
lower perceived social support ( 0.15, p 0.01) and greater
− =
loneliness (0.14, p 0.01), but not with stress (0.11, p 0.05).

PFC (all r 0.13 to 0.12, p 0.05) and hippocampal volumes
= − ≥
(all r 0.08 to 0.06, p 0.15) were unrelated to social and

affective measures at baseline. Baseline amygdala volume was not
directly correlated with changes in any measure (all r 0.002 to

0.09, all p 0.08). Larger baseline PFC volume was correlated
≥
with greater reductions in loneliness (r 0.12, p 0.01), but not

change in social support (r 0.03, p 0.49), or stress (r 0.03,
= − = =
p 0.43).
=
Individuals with larger baseline amygdala volumes were more
likely to experience a greater decrease in loneliness from stress
reduction over the course of the intervention (0.35, p 0.02;
=
95% CI: 0.10/0.60; Figure 3A). A non-significant trend further
indicated that larger amygdala volume accounted for greater
stress reduction due to increases in social support ( 0.48, p
− =
0.08; 95% CI: 0.94/ 0.02; Figure 3B). Similarly, individuals
− −
with larger PFC volume experienced greater reduction in


loneliness which was directly related to decreased stress (0.30,
p 0.02; 95% CI: 0.08/0.52; Figure 4A). A non-significant

trend was also observed in which larger baseline PFC volume
modified the effect of increases in social support on reductions
in stress ( 0.28, p 0.05; 95% CI: 0.51/ 0.05; Figure 4B).

Neither amygdala ( 0.12, p 0.65; 95% CI: 0.55/0.31) nor

the direct path from change in social support to change in

volume measures of amygdala (AIC 7216.49; BIC 7231.76

vs. AIC 7222.93; BIC 7236.17) and PFC (AIC 7048.79,
= = =
BIC 7063.38 vs. AIC 7066.39, BIC 7079.62). Individual

differences in baseline hippocampal volume did not modify
changes in loneliness from stress reduction ( 0.05, p 0.60;
− =
95% CI: 0.21/0.11) or increased social support (0.24, p
− =
0.31; 95% CI: 0.15/0.63); however, a non-significant trend for
−
greater reduction in stress from social support was observed
(0.40, p 0.07; 95% CI: 0.04/0.76). The hypothesized model

fit including hippocampal volumes (AIC 7156.01, BIC
= =
7171.28) was similar to the constrained model (AIC 7157.90,
=
BIC 7171.14), further suggesting a negligible influence of
=
hippocampal volume on the relationship among social support,
stress, and loneliness.

## Reverse Effects
To further test the direction of effects in the hypothesized model,
we tested a reverse effects model that inverted the main paths
between loneliness, stress, and social support. The reverse effects
model fit incrementally worse than the hypothesis model [χ(81)[2]
111.64, p 0.01, CFI 0.99, RMSEA 0.04, SRMR
= = = = =
0.06], and change in loneliness did not directly predict change in
stress (0.14, p 0.20). However, decreases in loneliness explained
=
increases in social support ( 0.27, p < 0.001) that, in turn,
−
accounted for decreases in stress ( 0.44, p 0.03; indirect effect
− =
0.14, p 0.04; BS 95% CI: 0.04/0.31; R[2] 0.11). While the
= = =
hypothesized model is substantiated in theory and supported by
model fit, the direction of the paths should be interpreted with
caution.

## Group Differences
Finally, possible group differences in mean latent change and
in the mediation paths were tested using a grouped modeling
procedure. The intervention conditions experienced similar
change in loneliness (difference 0.03 to 0.18, p 0.15),
= − ≥
social support (difference 0.03 to 0.08, p 0.45), and stress
= − ≥
(difference 0.22 to 0.12, p 0.29), and the magnitude of all
= − − ≥
paths in the mediation model were similar to the SSS group (i.e.,
control group; all p 0.11). The grouped mediation model had
≥
sub-optimal fit indices: χ(354)[2] [=][ 420.45,][ p][ =][ 0.01, CFI][ =][ 0.98,]
RMSEA 0.06, SRMR 0.11. Therefore, the mode of exercise
= =
intervention did not account for individual differences observed
in changes in social support, stress, and loneliness.

## DISCUSSION

This is one of the first studies to examine interactions among
psychosocial and neural predictors of loneliness in the context of
an intervention. Similar to previous research, increases in social
support due to participation in an exercise intervention directly
predicted reductions in loneliness (McAuley et al., 2000) as well
as indirectly through decreases in perceived stress. These effects
were consistent across exercise group assignment, suggesting
exercise mode may not be a factor in older adults’ perceptions of
loneliness (McAuley et al., 2000; Mackenzie et al., 2014). Contrary
to our hypothesis, the influence of changes in social support
and stress on loneliness were not related to change in brain
volumes. However, larger amygdalae at baseline accounted for


greater decreases in loneliness amidst reductions in stress and
larger PFC volumes accounted for greater decreases in stress
amidst increases in social support, but neither directly modified
the response in loneliness to changes in social support. Taken
together these findings suggest potential target mechanisms to
reduce loneliness and have important implications for physical
activity recommendations for health benefits in aging adults.
While previous studies have observed direct effects of
increases in social support on reductions in loneliness after
exercise interventions (McAuley et al., 2000; Hwa Kwag et al.,
2011), our findings indicate that the impact of social support on
feelings of loneliness may also be indirect through decreases in
perceived stress. Mode of exercise did not alter the pattern of
changes, suggesting group-based exercise programs, in general,
may provide these benefits. This is similar to recent evidence
from McHugh and Lawlor (2011) in which exercise and
social support independently influenced psychological distress
(depression, anxiety, and stress) in older adults. The authors
concluded that the benefits of exercise on psychological outcomes
may be partially related to social interactions inherent to groupbased programs. Together these results indicate a need for
further research comparing social and non-social (e.g., homebased) exercise programs and dissecting the components of social
exercise programs that contribute to reductions in loneliness.
Our results, along with previous studies (McAuley et al., 2000;
Mackenzie et al., 2014), suggest factors other than mode of
exercise may explain relationships among social support, stress,
and loneliness. This is further supported by the lack of effects
in relation to change in regional brain volumes. Although
individuals varied in the magnitude of change, changes in social
support, stress, and loneliness were unrelated to individual
differences in brain volume changes, nor did these mediate the
concurrent psychosocial changes. Aerobic activity and resulting
improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness are known to increase
PFC and hippocampal volumes in older adults (Kramer et al.,
1999; Colcombe et al., 2006; Erickson et al., 2011; Voss
et al., 2013). Because improvements in social support, stress,
and loneliness occurred across groups and in the absence of
improvements in brain volumes, reductions in loneliness after
exercise programs may not be restricted to aerobic exercise or be
the result of exercise’s effects on brain structure. Further research
in this area may help us to better understand the theoretical
pathway between exercise participation and loneliness.
Despite this previous evidence, the lack of mediation effects
related to change in brain volumes may in part be due to
the relatively short time period and generally high-functioning
nature of the sample of older adults. Older age is typically
associated with robust shrinkage of the PFC and hippocampus
that is exacerbated by age-related decline in cardiovascular health
and carriage of genetic pro-inflammatory risk (Raz and Rodrigue,
2006; Persson et al., 2014). Aerobic exercise is expected to
mitigate these risks during aging to promote better maintenance
of brain volumes into senium, with some studies even reporting
volumetric gains in healthy older adults after 6 months of
exercise (Kramer et al., 1999). Here we observed decreases in
PFC and a trend for the same in hippocampal volumes. However,
individuals varied in the magnitude of change, suggesting factors
in the course of study may have promoted maintenance of brain


-----

structure. Indeed, the magnitude of shrinkage observed in these
regions (PFC d 0.10; hippocampus d 0.08) were
= − = −
smaller than other longitudinal studies of brain aging (Driscoll
et al., 2009; Persson et al., 2014), further suggesting a protective
influence of exercise on the brain. Despite this, change or relative
stability of regional brain volumes over 6 months did not account
for concurrent changes in psychosocial measures. The impact of
the intervention on brain volume may have been too small during
the relatively short period to detect association with reductions
in loneliness. Interventions lasting 1 year or longer, and longterm follow-up assessments may be needed to better assess the
potential mediating role of change in brain structure on change
in loneliness (Cacioppo et al., 2003). Similarly, as these effects are
expected to be larger in samples at higher health risk, exercise
interventions targeting socially isolated older adults (Cacioppo
et al., 2014) and those with mild cognitive impairment are also
warranted.
Although we failed to find evidence of change in brain
volumes interacting with concurrent change in psychosocial
measures, baseline amygdala, and PFC volumes did account for
individual differences in response to the intervention. Individuals
with larger amygdalae at baseline were more likely to report
greater reductions in loneliness following decreases in stress. This
was related, in part, to increases in social support. Amygdala
volume was also negatively correlated with perceived social
support at baseline. Therefore, older adults with larger amygdalae
may have gained more from the social support environment
of the exercise sessions, particularly as demonstrated by a
decline in perceived stress. Amygdala volume has been linked to
anxiety and depression, and an overactive amygdala can result in
impaired cognitive control processes in other areas of the brain,
particularly the PFC (Davidson and McEwen, 2012).
Similarly, increased PFC activation amidst decreased negative
affect exerts an inhibitory influence on amygdala activation
(Urry et al., 2006). The PFC is involved in behavioral and
emotional regulation, attentional and inhibitory control, and
response selection (Miller and Cohen, 2001). Functional deficits
in the PFC can therefore impair the regulation of behaviors
such as physical activity and emotions such as stress, thereby
potentially exacerbating perceptions of loneliness (Hawkley and
Cacioppo, 2007). Individuals with better cognitive control, on the
other hand, may be better able to regulate amygdala activation
and negative emotions (Urry et al., 2006; Etkin et al., 2011).
Consistent with this evidence, individuals with larger baseline
PFC volumes were more likely to report greater reductions
in stress following increases in social support. Interestingly,
the influence of reductions in stress on decreases in loneliness
were strongest for participants with larger amygdalae. Because
participants in the current study were low-active and less familiar
with regular exercise, those with large PFC volumes may have
exerted more cognitive control and more easily adapted to the
three-times weekly exercise intervention (Miller and Cohen,
2001). Amygdala results suggest these adaptations may have
been most important for older adults with chronic stress.
Further research to identify the PFC- and amygdala-related
cognitive processes (e.g., self-regulation, inhibitory control, and
executive function) that may be associated with changes in


social support, stress, and loneliness may help to further explain
affective responses to exercise programs. For example, McAuley
et al. (2011) observed direct and indirect effects (via selfefficacy) of PFC-dependent cognitive functions, including selfregulation and executive function, on older adults’ adherence
to an exercise program. Additional examination of neural and
cognitive predictors of exposure to exercise interventions may
inform the design of future interventions that optimize older
adults’ behavioral and affective response to exercise.

## LIMITATIONS

The present study is one of the first to examine interactions
between brain structure and psychosocial health indicators and
their influences on changes in loneliness after a behavioral
intervention (Kanai et al., 2012; Cacioppo et al., 2014). We
examined pathways of change in loneliness using a relatively large
sample, a randomized experimental design, and sophisticated
methods of data analysis. Despite these strengths, this study
is not without limitations. First, as emotional regulation
involves complex interactions among regional brain structure
and function, it is possible that other brain regions (e.g.,
anterior cingulate cortex, striatum) may explain the relationships
observed among social support, stress, and loneliness (Davidson
and McEwen, 2012; Cacioppo et al., 2014). However, these
preliminary findings support further investigation in this largely
unexplored area of research. Additionally, while we accounted
for participant attrition via FIML estimation, some bias may
still be present, as over 30 percent of our sample had missing
MRI data at baseline and/or post-intervention. Finally, we cannot
definitively demonstrate causal lead-lag relationships among
changes in perceived social support, stress, and loneliness. While
the hypothesized model is supported by theory and fits the
data well (Cohen, 2004; Holt-Lunstad and Uchino, 2015), the
temporal order of effects remains equivocal across the loneliness
literature (Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2010; Ayalon et al., 2016).

## CONCLUSIONS

Exercise programs, regardless of exercise mode, may be effective
vehicles for reducing loneliness in older adults. The social support
environment of exercise sessions and resulting declines in stress
may at least partially explain these reductions. Older adults
with larger amygdala and PFC volumes—regions implicated in
processing emotional and social experiences—were more likely
to report reductions in loneliness due to reductions in stress
and gains in social support. Biomarkers of brain structural
integrity, along with perceptions of social support and stress,
may help researchers identify for whom an exercise intervention
may be most effective. Given the nascence of this research,
these preliminary findings warrant additional investigation of the
mediating and moderating roles of brain structure on changes
in loneliness as a result of participation in exercise programs.
Studies comparing social and non-social exercise programs and
examining other brain regions in addition to the amygdala, PFC,
and hippocampus are specifically needed.
