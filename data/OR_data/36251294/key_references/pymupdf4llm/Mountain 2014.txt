Abstract

Background: Loneliness in older people is associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We
undertook a parallel-group randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
telephone befriending for the maintenance of HRQoL in older people. An internal pilot tested the feasibility
of the trial and intervention.

Methods: Participants aged >74 years, with good cognitive function, living independently in one UK city were
recruited through general practices and other sources, then randomised to: (1) 6 weeks of short one-to-one
telephone calls, followed by 12 weeks of group telephone calls with up to six participants, led by a trained
volunteer facilitator; or (2) a control group. The main trial required the recruitment of 248 participants in a 1-year
accrual window, of whom 124 were to receive telephone befriending. The pilot specified three success criteria
which had to be met in order to progress the main trial to completion: recruitment of 68 participants in 95 days;
retention of 80% participants at 6 months; successful delivery of telephone befriending by local franchise of national
charity. The primary clinical outcome was the Short Form (36) Health Instrument (SF-36) Mental Health (MH)
dimension score collected by telephone 6 months following randomisation.

Results: We informed 9,579 older people about the study. Seventy consenting participants were randomised to
the pilot in 95 days, with 56 (80%) providing valid primary outcome data (26 intervention, 30 control). Twenty-four
participants randomly allocated to the research arm actually received telephone befriending due to poor recruitment
and retention of volunteer facilitators. The trial was closed early as a result. The mean 6-month SF-36 MH scores were
78 (SD 18) and 71 (SD 21) for the intervention and control groups, respectively (mean difference, 7; 95% CI, −3 to 16).

Conclusions: Recruitment and retention of participants to a definitive trial with a recruitment window of 1 year
is feasible. For the voluntary sector to recruit sufficient volunteers to match demand for telephone befriending created
by trial recruitment would require the study to be run in more than one major population centre, and/or involve
dedicated management of volunteers.

Background
Many older people live in social isolation, with those
over the age of 65 and living in the UK twice as likely as
other age groups to spend over 21 hours of the day
alone [1]. Social isolation and loneliness are strongly correlated with poor physical and mental health outcomes
and admission to residential care [2], while low levels of
social engagement in older people are related to morbidity and mortality [3]. On the other hand, strong social
networks are known to be protective of physical and
mental health [4-6]. As a result, policy makers are encouraging the delivery of health promotion interventions
to older people with the aim of compressing morbidity
and increasing quality of life in the later years of life

[7-12].
In 2008, the UK National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence (NICE) highlighted shortcomings in
the evidence (identified by systematic reviews) for interventions that promote mental wellbeing in older people

[11-13]. In particular, one review suggested that the
most effective interventions were those conducted in a
group with educational and/or supportive input [13]. As
a result, the PLINY study was commissioned to establish
whether a home-based intervention could improve or
successfully maintain the mental wellbeing of older
people living in the community with a focus upon those
who are vulnerable and hard to reach. Qualitative research reported since the publication of the NICE
guidance suggested that telephone befriending services
promoted by two UK national charities “helped older
people to gain confidence, re-engage with the community and become socially active” [14]. The authors’ recommendation, that initial one-to-one telephone calls
with older people might be used to encourage participation in telephone clubs [15], echoed that of an earlier
randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the US

[16]. It was these research findings which informed the
design of the PLINY intervention, the evaluation of
which we report here.
We undertook an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of a telephone befriending intervention compared with usual health and social care
provision for the maintenance of health-related quality
of life (HRQoL) in community-based older people. Telephone befriending is an example of a complex intervention, in that it has several interacting components [17].
As evaluation of complex interventions is challenging

[17], and publicly funded trials often fail due to inadequate participant recruitment [18]; the UK National
Institute for Health Research tend to commission RCTs
with internal pilots to assess feasibility of the full or
main study. In this paper, we report the results of the
internal pilot trial and discuss the decision to stop
the main trial early due to feasibility concerns. The


dissemination of pilot trial results to inform the design
and conduct of future studies is widely recommended

[19,20]. The results of our pilot study have utility, beyond underpinning further trials of telephone befriending, as they incorporate rarely documented issues with
the delivery of health and social care interventions by
the voluntary sector. This pilot trial does not attempt to
provide evidence for the clinical effectiveness of telephone befriending for the maintenance of HRQoL in
older people. For this reason, our findings are presented
using the CONSORT 2010 checklist [21] (Additional
file 1), but are also in conformity with proposed
CONSORT-modifications for reporting the results of
pilot studies and pragmatic trials [22,23].

Methods
The protocol for the main trial, including the internal
pilot, is available from the National Institute for Health
Research (NIHR) website [24].

Trial design
This paper reports on the internal pilot trial of a
parallel-group RCT with a 1:1 allocation ratio.

Participants and setting
Between June 2011 and December 2013, eighteen general practices sent brief study information and invitations to contact the research team to 9,051 people aged
75 years and over from their practice lists. Further invitations were sent to 528 participants of an existing longitudinal observational study who had consented to be
contacted about further research [25]. A total of 2,000
recruitment packs containing similar invitations were
issued to local NHS, social care and third sector organisations who agreed to distribute them; the number subsequently received by the target population is unknown.
Research assistants posted the participant information
sheet to those who expressed an interest, and then telephoned respondents to arrange a screening visit, which
was held in their own home. Those eligible for the study:
(a) were aged 75 or over; (b) had good cognitive function, defined as Six Cognitive Impairment Test (6CIT

[26]) score of 7 or under; (c) lived independently (alone
or with others) or in sheltered housing; and (d) could
converse in English. We excluded those who: (a) could
not use a telephone even if provided with appropriate
assistive technology; (b) lived in residential/nursing care
homes; and (c) were already receiving telephone interventions. Those scoring 7 or more on the 6CIT were
contacted by a clinically qualified member of the research team, informed of their score and advised to
contact their general practitioner, and excluded from
the study.

Interventions
After confirmation of eligibility and consent, we used a
centralised web based randomisation service provided by
the Sheffield Clinical Trials Research Unit central webbased randomisation service to allocate participants to
either: (1) telephone befriending group intervention; or
(2) a control group receiving no treatment as part of the
study protocol. Participants in both groups continued to
receive usual health and social care outside of the study
protocol. The principal investigator and study statisticians were blinded to treatment allocation codes until
the final analysis was complete.
The aim of the group intervention was to help older
people maintain good mental health by increasing the
extent of their social networks. The group intervention
was preceded by using one-to-one telephone befriending
to encourage participants to join telephone friendship
groups [14]. The intervention was delivered by volunteers, with no previous experience of one-to-on befriending or group facilitation, who were recruited by a
local franchise of a national UK charity dedicated to
improving the lives of older people (Age UK), hereafter
‘the provider’. Following delivery of a standard induction
programme for new volunteers, the provider’s Customer
Engagement Manager then facilitated training in one-toone befriending to groups of between two and seven volunteers in one session lasting between 1 and 2.5 hours.
This initial training covered topics consisting of issues of
confidentiality and equality, information about the research study, and training in making one-to-one calls.
Training in group facilitation was then delivered to all
volunteers by the same professional trainer who was experienced in this role. This training used standardised
content developed for telephone friendship group facilitators working with Community Network, a national
charity and social enterprise which supplies a range of
commercial telephone services to the third sector. Up
to five volunteers simultaneously received four 1-hour
training sessions in group facilitation skills, delivered
over Community Network’s teleconferencing system.
Training involved using scenarios to teach volunteers
how to facilitate cohesive groups thereby providing a
safe and supportive environment for achieving group
goals. It also entailed skills development to be able to
intervene in the event of conflict or where the predefined participant ground-rules were broken [27]. The
training was supported by a written manual for the volunteer befrienders. Community Network and the service
provider harmonised their policies on confidentiality and
safeguarding ‘clients’ for the purposes of study intervention delivery. To avoid cost to the volunteers and participants, one-to-one and group calls were made through
the Community Network teleconferencing system and
paid for by Age UK (National).


Initial one-to-one befriending involved 10- to 20-minute
calls once per week for up to 6 weeks made by the volunteer befriender to an allocated participant. One-to-one
calls aimed to familiarise the participant with the volunteer, conduct everyday conversation and prepare participants for the telephone friendship groups.
Subsequent friendship groups consisted of up to six
participants and involved 1 hour teleconferences, at a
pre-arranged time, once per week for 12 weeks facilitated
by the same volunteer as had conducted one-to-one
befriending. Friendship groups did not aim to induce behaviour change but to reduce social isolation by providing
a safe environment for building relationships, sharing
experiences, companionship and support, thereby maintaining participants’ sense of confidence and mental wellbeing.

Clinical outcomes
The primary clinical endpoint was the level of mental
wellbeing at 6-months post-randomisation, measured
using the Short Form (36) Health Instrument (SF-36)
mental health (MH) dimension [28]. Secondary endpoints were: other dimensions of the SF-36 to measure
functional health and well-being; subjective wellbeing,
measured using the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
approach [29]; health status, measured with the EuroQol
5-Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire [30]; symptoms of
self-reported depression, using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [31]; optimistic self-beliefs about the
ability to cope with difficult life using the 10-item General Perceived Self Efficacy (GSE) scale [32]; overall,
emotional, and social loneliness, using the 11-item De
Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale [33]; and a bespoke
health and social care resource use questionnaire. A
cost-effectiveness analysis was planned but, due to early
closure of the main trial, was not undertaken [25]. In the
absence of data on actual expenditure, a detailed breakdown of the provider and trainer budgets will appear in
the NIHR monograph.

Sample size for the main trial
The SF-MH dimension is scored on a 0 (poor) to 100
(good health) scale, with between-group differences of
between 5 and 10 points considered “clinically and socially relevant” [34]. In a general population survey of
3,084 community residents, the mean SF-36 MH score
was 68.3 with an SD of 19.9 [35]. We assumed a correlation of 0.50 between the baseline and 6-month MH
score, an average cluster size of six participants per telephone befriending group and an intra-cluster correlation
(ICC) of 0.04, with a design effect of 1.28. With 80%
power to detect a mean difference of eight points in
6-month MH scores and allowing for 20% loss to follow

up, the main trial required recruitment and randomisation of 124 people per arm (248 in total).

Feasibility criteria
The internal pilot study assessed two formal progression
criteria. In order to continue the full trial to completion
the trial team had to: (1) recruit a minimum of 68 participants in 95 days; and (2) collect valid primary outcome data for 56 (80%) of those recruited 6 months
later. A third progression criterion, which was not defined in formal quantitative terms in the research protocol, was that the service provider should be able to
recruit, train and retain enough volunteers to deliver the
telephone friendship service. In order to match supply of
service provision to demand for telephone befriending
from participants, the research team contracted the service provider to recruit and train 50 volunteers over a
12-month window between March 2012 and February
2013. This number was intended to retain enough
trained volunteers to facilitate twenty 12-week friendship
groups for 124 participants between August 2012 and
December 2013, notwithstanding unplanned absences
and the high levels of volunteer attrition predicted by
the literature [36,37]. Because each four-session group
facilitation training programme required a minimum of
four people and cost £840, it was deemed particularly
important that places were filled to ensure capacity for
service delivery and efficient use of a finite training
budget.

Randomisation
The randomisation sequence was generated in advance
by a CTRU statistician who was not a member of the
trial team, without stratification but using blocked
randomization with randomly-selected block sizes.

Blinding
Neither participants nor outcome assessors were blind
to treatment allocation. Trial statisticians and the chief
investigator were blinded to the treatment allocation
codes until after the final analysis. Data presented to the
Trial Steering Committee and Trial Management Group
did not identify treatment allocations.

Statistical methods
The early closure of the trial (see below) meant there
was no opportunity to follow-up participants recruited
from 1 October 2012. As participants randomised to the
intervention arm from October 2012 onwards were unable to receive the intervention due to service provider
capacity, the primary analysis used an ‘intention-to-treat’
data set. This included all participants randomised before that time plus one participant randomised thereafter
who received the intervention due to another participant


dropping out prior to receiving the intervention. The
‘per protocol’ data set contained all participants in the
control group and participants in the intervention group
who completed nine (75%) or more of the group telephone calls over the 12 weeks of group intervention.
As a pilot study, the analysis was largely descriptive
and focused on confidence interval estimation and
not formal hypothesis testing. Since the intervention is
volunteer-led, we also used the data to estimate the ICC.
Baseline and socio-demographic characteristics were
summarised and assessed for comparability between trial
arms without formal testing of statistical significance

[38,39]. Data completeness, based on the primary outcome, is displayed in Figure 1.
We used a marginal general linear model (GLM) with
robust standard errors, and an exchangeable correlation
to compare the mean SF-36 MH scores from the
treatment and control groups [40]. The GLM used
Generalised Estimating Equations to estimate regression
coefficients. The exchangeable correlation assumes individual outcomes in the same cluster (telephone friendship group) have the same correlation. Participants in
the control group were treated as a cluster of size one in
the analysis. A 95% CI for the between-arm difference in
scores is reported. An adjusted analysis was also performed which included baseline covariates, such as age,
sex and baseline SF-36 MH dimension score in the marginal GLM.
Secondary outcomes were analysed in the same way.
Estimates of the critical parameters which would be used
for a sample size calculation (SD, correlation between baseline and 6-month outcomes and the ICC) are reported.

Ethical approval
This study received ethics approval from South Yorkshire
Research Ethics Committee.

Results
Participant recruitment and retention
The team received 298 inquiries about involvement in
the trial, of which 275 (92%) were derived from postal
invitation and 23 (8%) from other sources (see Figure 1).
The first study progression target was met on 30
September 2012 by which time 70 participants had been
randomised in the 95 days since recruitment began. As a
result, recruitment continued and, between 28 June and
11 January 2012, a total of 157 participants were randomised. By the end of March 2013, the team had successfully followed up 80% (56/70) of the participants
randomised before October 2012.

Delivery of the intervention
Between 17 May 2012 and 22 October 2012, the service
provider received 42 expressions of interest from potential

volunteers as a result of their advertising campaign and
direct approaches. Thirty, however, did not follow up their
initial expression of interest to commit to training for the
role and, of the twelve who did commence training, only
four commenced service provision. One of the four then
dropped out due to ill health before delivering the group
intervention. The eight who commenced training and then
dropped out did so because they could not prioritise
volunteering over other commitments including return to


employment and fulltime education (n = 3), objected to
the allocation of public money to the research team
(n = 2), lacked confidence (n = 1), and grew tired of waiting
for participant recruitment to start (n = 1). Reasons for
discontinuation were not available from one volunteer.
Over the same period, four 4-session group training programmes intended for 20 volunteers were conducted, but
only 11 volunteers were trained. Lack of take-up meant

15 volunteers, were cancelled between August 2012
and January 2013. The number of days volunteers were
retained by the service provider ranged from 12 days to
118 days (mean 62) between point of completing group
training and the day they dropped out.
After up to 6 weeks of one-to-one befriending, three volunteers facilitated four 12-week groups (n = 24) between
September 2012 and May 2013. However, one group received one-to-one befriending and group facilitation from
different volunteers, due to the volunteer attrition described
above. As a result of poor recruitment and retention of volunteers, by 17 January 2013, 55 out of 78 participants randomly allocated to the research arm had not been allocated a
volunteer facilitator - that is, could not be treated per protocol. For these reasons, and after ruling out the availability of
an alternative service provider, the Trial Management Group
suspended recruitment to the main trial and made recommendations to the Trial Steering Committee. Shortly after,
the funder recommended that the main trial should be terminated when 6-month follow-up was complete for the pilot
cohort. These recommendations were accepted.

Participant characteristics
Tables 1 and 2 show the baseline demographic characteristics and participant reported outcome (PRO) scores


for the SF-36, EQ-5D, PHQ-9, de Jong Gierveld scale,
ONS well-being outcome and the general self-efficacy
scale of the 70 subjects who were part of the internal
pilot study. Overall, the two randomised groups were
well matched with respect to baseline demographic
characteristics.

Participant reported outcomes
By 6 months post-randomisation follow-up, 56 participants had valid primary outcome data (SF-36 MH
Dimension) - 26 in the intervention group and 30 in the
control group (Figure 2). The mean SF-36 MH score at
6 months post-randomisation was 77.5 (SD 18.4) in the
intervention group and 70.7 (SD 21.2) in the control
group, a mean difference of 6.5 (95% CI, -3.0 to 16.0) or
9.5 (4.5 to 14.5), adjusting for age, sex and baseline score
(Table 3).
Table 3 also shows that, for the secondary PROs such
as the other dimensions of the SF-36, the differences in
quality of life favoured the intervention group. For five
dimensions (role physical, bodily pain, social functioning, physical component summary and mental component summary) after adjustment for baseline score, age
and sex, the confidence interval excluded zero, suggesting a non-zero effect. There were no differences in mean

The Short Form (36) Health Instrument (SF-36) Dimensions are scored on a 0 (poor) to 100 (good) health scale. The EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) utility score is
measured on a −0.56 to 1.00 (good health) scale, except for the Physical and Mental Component summary scores which are standardised to have a mean of 50
and a SD of 10. The EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) is measured on a 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The emotional
loneliness scale of the De Jong is scored on a 0 to 6 scale with higher scores indicating more loneliness. The social loneliness scale of the De Jong is scored on a
0 to 5 scale with higher scores indicating more loneliness. The total loneliness scale of the De Jong is scored on a 0 to 11 scale with higher scores indicating more
loneliness. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 is measured on a 0 to 27 scale with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. General
Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale is scored on a 10 to 40 scale with higher scores indicating more perceived self-efficacy. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) instrument
measures subjective well-being on a 0 to 40 scale, with higher scores indicating high subjective well-being.
Models are general linear mixed model with befriending group included as a random effect. *Unadjusted: fixed covariate is randomised group only. **Adjusted:
fixed covariates are randomised group, baseline score, age and gender.

scores between the intervention and control groups, observed for the other PROs except for the ONS wellbeing
total score.
The results for the primary outcome were robust to
missing data in sensitivity analyses, with all imputation
methods producing similar results (Table 4 and Figure 3).
Only 35% (9/26) of intervention group participants who
had valid 6-month outcome data completed 75% or
more of the group intervention telephone calls and were
entered in the per-protocol analysis. Six months after
randomisation, there was a mean difference in the SF-36
MH score of 3.2 (95% CI, -5.2 to 11.6), or 8.0 (3.3 to
12.7) after adjustment for age, sex and baseline score.
The estimated ICC from the marginal model for the
primary outcome was −0.06 indicating little if any clustering by facilitator; the correlation between baseline
and 6 months MH scores was 0.78.

Discussion
This internal pilot trial demonstrated that the trial team
could recruit 0.74 participants per day over a 3-month
period and collect valid primary outcome data for 80%
of randomised participants, rates which fulfilled pre

specified success criteria. It also established that local
charitable providers do not necessarily have the resources
to match service demand that exceeds what they would
usually respond to. The trial was closed early when targets
for recruitment and training of volunteer interventionists,
built into the subcontract between the University and the
service provider, were unmet, leaving 55/78 (70%) of participants randomised to the intervention unable to receive
it more than 3 months after randomisation.
The adjusted, between-arm mean difference (9.5; 95%
CI, 4.5 to 14.5 points) in the primary outcome (SF-36
MH score at 6 months) is within the 5 to 10 point range
defined by the instrument developers as “clinically and
socially relevant” [34], but must be treated with caution.
The lack of statistical power, the small number of intervention arm participants who received the intervention
per protocol, the method of recruitment which was reliant upon individuals opting in and the possibility of resentful demoralisation [41] of control arm participants
not blinded to their allocation, all make this estimate of
effect problematic for decision-making purposes.
The participant consent rate was 1.6% of those
approached about the study, which is in line with rates

achieved in other studies evaluating preventive interventions in middle-aged and older populations within the
region [14,42]. The same studies also confirm that opt-in
recruitment for the purposes of research studies using
targeted mail-outs is more reliable than direct referral by
health and social care professionals or third sector agencies, if potentially less externally valid. Levels of participant self-efficacy that are high and levels of loneliness
that are low, when compared with population norms

[43,44], and low uptake rate presents the possibility of
participant bias, where the target population for preventive services does not get involved in the RCTs which
evaluate them [45,46]. The 20% attrition rate is at the
margin of acceptability [47]; comorbidity, exhaustion,
and respondent burden frequently result in rates of 20%
and 30% in RCTs evaluating health promotion interventions in community-dwelling older people [48].
A strength of our study is that volunteers received
standardised training and delivered an intervention that is
manualised and therefore more reproducible than most
interventions intended to ameliorate social isolation or
loneliness [49]. In line with the Medical Research Council
Framework [17], a process evaluation, nested within the
trial to assess intervention fidelity and quality of implementation, will be published in the NIHR monograph series.
The problems experienced by the service provider with
the recruitment and retention of volunteers are welldocumented in research papers on volunteer management.
The retention of volunteers can be affected by personal and
organisational factors. The evidence that demographic and
psychometric variables are associated with volunteer adherence to work programmes is often weak or contradictory;
the factors most strongly associated with retention are educational achievement, prior voluntary experience and lifecourse stability [36,37]. Policies which require recipients of
state benefits to be available for paid work, or which sanction participation by those perceived as ‘workshy’ are
thought by some researchers to be creating barriers to sustained volunteering [50]. Two volunteers dropped out of
our programme due to pressure to take paid work. Organisational factors are often cited as drivers of volunteer
attrition [36,51,52]. Sufficient support to ensure that
volunteers are comfortable with their role and its
procedures [36,52-55], with a professional volunteer coordinator dedicated wholly to the programme, is essential

[16]. Volunteers also frequently cite ongoing training as a
motivation for programme adherence [36,53,54,56]. More
generally, congruence between the goals and ideals of the
volunteers and those of the voluntary sector organisations
for which they work are thought to promote adherence

[36]. The only trial of which we are aware which documented recruitment and attrition of volunteers to deliver a
befriending intervention recorded 60/124 (48%) of those
expressing interest completing training and 49/60 (82% of


those trained) delivering the intervention, compared to 11/
42 (26%) and 3/11 (27%), respectively, in our study [57].
Reasons for volunteer attrition were not reported. Unlike in
our study, volunteers were recruited and hosted by more
than one type of organisation, and resource was available to
employ dedicated volunteer co-ordinators, jointly managed
by the ‘host’ organisations and the research team. Those
wishing to recruit rapidly and retain large numbers of
volunteers to telephone befriending programmes should
consider using either charitable providers in multiple population centres or outsourcing the work of volunteer recruitment and management to commercial or (where available)
state providers.
Our trial adds to tentative evidence that community
befriending interventions may be effective in the preservation of good mental health. One systematic review
found that, compared with usual care or no treatment,
befriending demonstrated small but significant effects on
self-reported symptoms of depression in nine studies,
five of which followed up for 12 months or more [58].
However, the results should be interpreted with caution
as the review authors acknowledged the possibility of
publication bias in their work, and only half of the included studies evaluated befriending by lay volunteers,
as in our trial. A second systematic review evaluated interventions to reduce loneliness and social isolation in
older people [59], including two randomised evaluations
of telephone interventions [16,60], and one of a combination one-to-one/group programme like that evaluated
in this paper [61]. Whilst the quality of most of the
included studies was poor, the review concluded that
effective interventions had a theoretical basis and offered
“social activity and/or support within a group format”

[59]. A third systematic review synthesised the results of
RCTs evaluating four strategies to reduce loneliness and
social isolation [62]. The conclusion drawn was that
social cognitive training interventions yielded greater
effect sizes than trials of interventions to enhance social
support, improve social skills, or increase opportunities
for social interaction, and is unlikely to have applicability
to volunteer-led interventions. Its formal analysis, showing that a group-based format was not found to be an
effective modifier, is likely to be an artefact of the
number of professionally-delivered one-to-one interventions included in the review.
The need for well-conducted studies evaluating theoretically informed, manualised interventions to alleviate
loneliness and reduce social isolation in older people
remains [49]. Services commissioned especially for research studies are likely to encounter the same issues
with matching service supply to demand as demonstrated through our study [15]. The natural tendency of
many local voluntary sector organisations may be to
deliberately regulate demand for their services based on


-----

http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/15/1/141

the resources available to them, resulting in ‘trickle’ recruitment of both volunteers and clients based on selfreferral [63]. Ideally services with well-established and
effective processes for volunteer recruitment and management systems should be identified to ensure the feasibility
of large-scale evaluation. There may also be an argument
for non-randomised evaluations if there are significant
concerns that trial participants are systematically different
from those who would take up the offer of an intervention
outside the context of a randomised trial.

Conclusions
It is feasible to recruit and retain participants aged
75 years or more for an RCT evaluating a volunteer-led
telephone friendship group intervention for the maintenance of good mental health. Failure to deliver the intervention at scale led to the early termination of the trial.
Future studies should focus on theoretically-based, manualised interventions delivered by service providers with
track record of rapidly recruiting and managing large
numbers of volunteers. Commissioners of volunteer-led
services should be aware that, even where part-time, paid
volunteer co-ordinators exist, volunteer recruitment and
retention represent a significant management challenge,
and such services cannot always be scaled up quickly.
