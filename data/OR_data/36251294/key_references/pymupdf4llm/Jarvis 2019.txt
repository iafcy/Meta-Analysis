**Abstract: There is a high prevalence of loneliness among older people, especially in residential care**
settings. Loneliness is often accompanied by maladaptive cognitions which can affect the maintenance
and establishment of meaningful social connections. This study implemented and evaluated a
low-intensity Cognitive Behavior Therapy (LI-CBT) mHealth-supported intervention which targeted
maladaptive cognitions in older people (≥60 years) experiencing loneliness. The three-month
intervention using WhatsApp was implemented with older people in four inner-city residential care
facilities. The intervention included three components: technology acceptance, psycho-education,
and individualized positively worded messages addressing maladaptive cognitions. The intervention
was evaluated using a randomized control design. Key outcomes were measured pre-, post-, and one
month after the intervention. There were significant changes in social cognition (YSQ-SF T0–T1–T2, X[2]

= 9.69, p = 0.008) and loneliness levels (total loneliness T0–T1–T2, X[2] = 14.62, p = 0.001), and an increase
in WhatsApp usage (T0 = 26% vs. T1 = 60%, X[2]=15.22, p = 0.019). At 1-month follow-up, even with
a significant reduction in WhatsApp usage, a significant reduction in loneliness was maintained.
LI-CBT delivered via instant messaging may be effective in reducing loneliness experienced by
older people.

**1. Introduction and Background**

Relocation to residential care may bring about changes in social network structures and social
network density for older people [1–3]. This can result in social isolation, loneliness and reduced
mental well-being [4,5], with loneliness prevalence reported as high as 56% among older people living
in residential care in Norway [6]. Loneliness, seen as the cognitive discrepancy between desired and
actual quality and quantity of relationships [7], may result in negative or maladaptive cognitions
commonly expressed by people experiencing loneliness [8,9] that can interfere with the development
or maintenance of social connections [8,10]. Loneliness has pathophysiological effects on older people
which increase mortality [11].
There are a plethora of primary studies, and systematic reviews addressing loneliness in older
people [5,12,13]. Various social and psychological interventions have been recommended to address
loneliness in older people, including interventions using technology [5,9,14,15], with varying degrees
of effectiveness [16] and differing levels of quality in evaluation design [8,9]. Interventions addressing

maladaptive or negative social cognitions have been reported to be most effective in reducing loneliness
by changing social behavior and thereby improving social connections [8,9]. Improvement in social
connections can contribute to healthy ageing and improved cognitive functioning [17,18]. Previously
held beliefs that face-to-face interaction is the gold standard of social participation [19] has been
challenged, with evidence that feelings of connection can also be established via communication
technology [3]. Social media and instant messaging have been cited as instances of communication
technology that may improve social networks by maintaining visibility, re-awakening previous social
networks, or development of new networks [20–23]. Instant messaging using mobile cellular phones
can be used to address maladaptive cognitions, but older people are reported to be less inclined
to use technological communication to initiate social connections [24]. MHealth projects for older
people are often viewed with skepticism in regard to cost, perceived poor technology acceptance and
ageism [25,26], but when appropriate consideration is given to facilitating conditions [25,27,28] and
cost [29,30] older people are capable of learning new technology [25]. Despite studies examining older
people’ existing engagement with social media and its effects on loneliness [21,31] a gap exists for
intervention studies that specifically target loneliness using social media. Chipps et al. [14] in their
umbrella review of systematic reviews examining eInterventions targeting loneliness in older people
failed to identify any mHealth interventions in the included primary studies. Chen and Schulz [12]
in their systematic review of communication technology interventions, suggested further studies in
the fields of loneliness and social media to identify the opportunities to reduce loneliness in older
people. This study accordingly sought to implement and evaluate a low-intensity cognitive behavioral
therapy (LI-CBT) mHealth-supported intervention delivered via mobile instant messaging (WhatsApp)
to address maladaptive cognitions and reduce loneliness in older people living in a residential setting.

**2. mLINCC—A LI-CBT Intervention Supported by WhatsApp**

A LI-CBT intervention, Living In Network Connected Communities (mLINCC) to be delivered on
WhatsApp, was developed by a stakeholder group consisting of a CBT specialist psychologist, a mental
health nurse, and an mHealth expert. The intervention was informed by a theoretical framework of
loneliness [32,33] and evidence from two umbrella reviews on the effectiveness of interventions to
address loneliness [14,34]. A gap in mHealth interventions was identified [14,23] along with strong
evidence that social cognition interventions [8,9] and psycho-education [35] were most effective in
addressing loneliness and the need for participants to be actively involved in the intervention [35].
The three-month intervention had three distinct phases involving threads of trust, social network
development, and gerontechnology self-efficacy, reinforced with homework assignments requiring
a WhatsApp response [36] and a weekly face-to-face Help Desk for technological support [37].
All participants in the intervention group (IG) were added to the mLINCC WhatsApp group, which
was a closed group and at cross-over a separate WhatsApp group (mLINCC 2) for the control group
(CG). Apart from the closed groups, participants were able to use the smartphone and communication
on mLINCC as they chose and there was no incentive for increased use. The data package selected
to offer the greatest financial sustainability post-intervention, allowed for any form of WhatsApp
interaction apart from WhatsApp calls. No participants had previously used WhatsApp; in the IG
apart from one participant all owned feature (basic) mobile phones which did not support such
applications as WhatsApp, predominantly making calls and the participant who owned a smartphone
used it as a feature (basic) mobile phone. In the first phase (2 weeks), technology acceptance was
developed through activities which included the selection of a smartphone and four 90-min face-to-face
(F2F) group-training sessions on the use of the smartphone and WhatsApp. The participants could
keep the phones post-intervention but would be responsible for the purchase of data (600 Mb for
ZAR15.00/month/US $1.10). In the second phase (2 weeks), psycho-education was delivered through
four 90-min F2F sessions on factors underlying loneliness. Key messages from these sessions were
confirmed through messages on WhatsApp. In phase three (1 month) individualized messages with
positively framed content aimed at countering maladaptive cognitions were sent to participants via

WhatsApp. Individual maladaptive cognitions were identified through the administration of the Young
Schema Questionnaire short-form (YSQ-SF)—Disconnection and Rejection domain. The messages
were constructed by the CBT specialist and each message had two components: acknowledgment of
the maladaptive cognition linked to loneliness, and a positively framed counter message to allow the
participants an opportunity to reflect on the cognitive distortion and its influence on their feelings
and behaviors (Table 1). The final phase was a maintenance stage (1 month) during which just the
weekly Help Desk was continued, with the moderator still presiding over the WhatsApp group though
not participating.

**3. Methodology**


It is understandable that you may
feel suspicious of other people and
worry that they may hurt you,
take advantage of you, or have
ulterior motives, especially if these
types of experiences have
happened in the past.


**Positively Framed Message**
**Delivered on mLINCC (Voice**
**Note and Text) (Day 2)**

Counter message; Not all people
have negative intentions. There
are genuine and trustworthy
people in the world.
Unfortunately, negative
expectations can act as a barrier to
your being able to reach out to
others. You can change this. Try to
evaluate the accuracy of your
beliefs. Look back on your life and
identify someone who really cared
about you. Think about what
made this person different.


_Setting: The study was conducted in an Non-Government Organization (NGO) which offers_
accommodation for resource-restricted residents, ranging from independent living to frail care and
services throughout the city to 1900 older people (≥60 years).
_Study design: A randomized control study with two groups—IG and CG—was conducted to_
evaluate the intervention. Due to the nature of the intervention there was no blinding. Participants
were randomly assigned to the IG or the CG. The CG received usual care, which was a generic wellness
program for all residents. For ethical reasons, on completion of the intervention the CG also received
the intervention, receiving their smartphones and all resources at this cross-over point. The study was
approved by the Humanities and Social Sciences Ethics Committee (HSSREC) of the University of
KwaZulu-Natal. (HSS/1169/016D) on 16 September 2016, followed by gatekeeper permission from
the research site. Approval was received to feature the WhatsApp brand in the printed material
(Asset Request # 34292).
_Population and sampling: The population was 828 residents living in four inner-city residential_
NGO care facilities (n = 828) in a large South African city. Eligible participants were identified through
a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 277 residents and met the criteria for inclusion: namely,
≥60 years, residing in the residence, willing to participate, cognitively intact on the Subjective Memory
Complaint Clinical (SMCC) [38] and socially isolated (≤15 on the Friendship Scale) [39], or lonely
(2–6 on de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS) [40] [6-item]) or with decreased mental well-being
(World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index, (WHO-5) [41] score < 13) (Figure 1) A minimum
sample size of 52 participants was estimated to provide a medium to large effect size.

_Research instrument: A standard researcher-administered questionnaire was used to capture_
the key outcome measurements of WhatsApp usage, social cognitions, loneliness, and mental
well-being. The questionnaire captured data on demographics and WhatsApp usage, social cognition
(Disconnection and Rejection domain of the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-SF 3)) [42], loneliness
(6-item) (DJGLS) [40], and mental well-being (WHO-5) [41] (Table 2).

over the past year from “Completely untrue of me” (1) to “Describes me

(Cronbach α 0.72 –0.90) and Western settings (Cronbach α 0.81–0.94) [44] and
with the elderly [45].

The DJGLS is a 6-item scale (0–6) with two sub-scales of emotional (0–3) and
social loneliness (0–3) [40]. A score of six represents extreme loneliness and three
of extreme emotional or social loneliness, measured on its sub-scales [40]. It is
recommended for use in the elderly [46], reliable and well validated [40].


The WHO-5 is a 5-item scale using a 6-point Likert rating and is a first screener
Mental well-being for depression (raw score <13) [41,47]. The scale items are positive statements
based on mood, vitality and general interest over a two-week period [41].

_Data collection:_ The questionnaire was administered three times: pre-intervention (T0),
post-intervention (T1) and one month post-intervention (T2). The participants provided written
informed consent and the LI-CBT mHealth-supported intervention was conducted from March to
June 2018. In preparation, research assistants (1:4 participants) were trained and resource materials
prepared (manuals, stylus pens, and phone pouches) [48–50].
_Data analysis: Data from the questionnaires were entered into SPSS v.25. Ages were categorized into_
younger old (60–79 years) and older old (80+ years) and time in residence (1–18 months and ≥19 months).
Summary scores for all outcome measures were calculated. Items in DJGLS were reverse scored for
emotional loneliness subscale. Non-parametric Friedman test (X[2]) was used to detect within-group
differences in the intervention across three time periods tests, followed by Wilcoxon signed rank test (W)
to compare the time points for significance (p ≤ 0.05). Differences between groups were compared using
Mann-Whitney-U (U) and due to the small sample and different sample sizes, Hedges’ g calculated
[effect sizes ([M1–M2]⁄SDpooled and weighted) (https://www.socscistatistics.com/effectsize/default3.aspx).](https://www.socscistatistics.com/effectsize/default3.aspx)
Missing data was handled by excluding cases pairwise. Cronbach’s alpha was used to test the internal
consistency of the subscale and scale scores (≥0.70 good).

**4. Results**

_Demographics_

Eighty-nine respondents (n = 89) were eligible to participate in the intervention, and 32 (35.95%)
agreed to participate (Figure 1). Of the eligible participants 32 (35.95%) were not interested, 13 (14.61%)
ill, 10 (11.24%) were not available and two participants declined for personal problems (Figure 1),
Eligible participants who declined participation showed similar levels of mental well-being (WHO-5
_m = 16.5/25 ± 4.9) and total loneliness (m = 3.14/6 ± 1.59) to the participants. Fifteen participants_
were allocated to the IG and 17 to the CG, resulting in 13 (IG) and 16 (CG) participants after attrition
(Figure 1). The participants were between 61 and 87 years (m = 74.93 ± 6.41 years), mainly female,
Asian/Indian, widowed, and primary school and lesser-educated. Nearly two thirds of the participants
had lived in the residences for 19 months or longer (n = 20, 62.5%) (Table 2). Cronbach-alpha was
measured at T0 and shown to be good for YSQ-SF and all five schemas and the WHO-5, but low
internal constancy for social loneliness (α = 0.55).
At T0 there were no significant demographic or outcome differences between the IG and CG
(Table 3). At the start of the intervention, only slightly more than half of participants (54.84%) used their
mobile phones weekly to contact family or friends (Table 4), with the majority (n = 26, 83.87%) using
the call function. The total group (n = 32) were mostly mentally well, but showed moderate levels
of maladaptive social cognitions on the selected domain (YSQ-SF m = 78.38/150 ± 25.06), with Social
_Isolation rated the highest, and moderate levels of loneliness (total loneliness m = 3.56/6 ± 1.24; emotional_
loneliness m = 1.63/3 ± 0.83; social loneliness m = 1.94/3 ± 0.72) (Table 4).

intervention and control groups for usage of mobile phone were tested using Chi-square tests (X[2]) and cognition,
loneliness, and mental well-being were tested using non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U; Significance was set as

The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated at three time points (T0–T1–T2). In the IG at
T0–T1–T2, a significant increase in the frequency of mobile phone usage (X[2] = 8.90, p = 0.012) and
WhatsApp (X[2] = 12.17, p = 0.002) was recorded, as opposed to the CG where no significant changes in
the frequency of usage of the mobile phone were recorded. In the IG from T1 to T2, the significant
increase in the frequency of daily smartphone usage (T0 = 26% vs. T1 = 60%, X[2] = 15.22, p = 0.019) was

not maintained with a significant reduction by the end of the intervention (T1 = 60% vs. T2 = 53.3%,
_X[2]_ = 13.48, p = 0.036). Monitoring of participants’ smartphone activity was only possible through
the WhatsApp group (mLINCC) and not through their encrypted messages. On mLINCC there was
evidence of participants’ active use of all functions offered by the select WhatsApp data package
(excluded WhatsApp calls), except for the function of creating a voice message. While recording a voice
message and the simultaneous requirement of holding the voice message icon appeared to present
co-ordination challenges.
Over the intervention (T0–T1–T2), the IG showed significant decreases in the total YSQ-SF
(X[2] = 9.69, p = 0.008) and the schemas (Social Isolation X[2] = 16.45, p ≤ 0.001, Emotional Deprivation
_X[2]_ = 11.04, p = 0.003, Defectiveness X[2] = 9.50, p = 0.009) except in the schemas Abandonment and

(X[2] = 14.62, p = 0.001) and emotional loneliness (X[2] = 15.80, p = < 0.001). In comparison. (T0–T1–T2),
the CG participants became more lonely (total loneliness, W = 5.51, p = 0.064) and significantly more
emotionally lonely (X[2] = 12.29, p = 0.002) (Table 5). For the IG, T0 to T1 showed the most significant
reductions for all measurements (YSQ-SF (YSQ-SF W = −2.34, p = 0.019, Social Isolation W = −3.06,
_p = 0.002, Defectiveness W = −2.72, p = 0.007, Emotional Deprivation W = −2.45, p = 0.014, Abandonment_
_W = −2.08, p = 0.037, total loneliness W = −2.16, p = 0.031, emotional loneliness W = −2.27, p = 0.023))_
(Table 5). During the post-intervention period (T1–T2), the CG had significantly higher loneliness
(total) (p = 0.011) and emotional loneliness (p = 0.003) (Table 5).
Comparing the overall effect between the IG and CG pre- and post-intervention (T0–T1) the
IG had significantly improved WhatsApp usage (IG 73.3% vs. CG 11.8%, X[2] = 16.22, p ≤ 0.001),
with accompanying significantly greater improvements in their social cognitions for Social Isolation
(IG 7.08 ± 5.62 vs. CG 1.29 ± 6.08, U = −2.39, p = 0.015), Emotional Deprivation (IG 6.69 ± 7.58 vs. CG
1.12 ± 7.75, U = −2.24, p = 0.025), Abandonment (IG 6.69 ± 7.58 vs. CG 1.12 ± 7.75, U = −2.24, p = 0.025).
The improvements in loneliness and mental well-being were not significant between the groups at T1
(Table 6). However, in the post-intervention period (T1–T2), the significant increase in WhatsApp users
(IG 66.7% vs. CG 5.9%, X[2] = 17.08, p ≤ 0.001), was accompanied by significant improvements in the
IG compared to the CG in all levels of loneliness (Total loneliness IG 0.92 ± 1.26 vs. CG-1.53 ± 2.00,
_U = −3.28, p = 0.001; emotional loneliness IG 0.31 ± 0.75 vs. CG 1.12 ± 1.11, U = −3.36, p = 0.001; social_
loneliness (IG 0.62 ± 1.04 vs CG −0.41 ± 1.18, U = 2.36, p = 0.028) (Table 5). The largest effect size was

**5. Discussion**

Although the study sample size was small, the LI-CBT WhatsApp intervention was effective
in significantly adjusting maladaptive social cognitions and reducing loneliness in older people in
this setting and can be used in other resource-restricted settings and non-resource-restricted settings.
Customization of the intervention is suggested in tailoring the positively worded MIM to be culturally
and contextually specific. In future at the invitation to the intervention a period of experimentation
with a smartphone in a low risk setting has the possibility of increasing enrolment. The study though
delivered using WhatsApp concurred with the study byChiang et al. [15] involving reminiscence in
older men (n = 92) which showed the effectiveness of targeting maladaptive social cognitions in the
reduction of loneliness.
Improved cognition and a reduction in loneliness was significantly evident post-intervention
(except social loneliness) and was maintained one month after the active intervention. The continued
effect, despite some decrease in WhatsApp usage possibly due to the lessening of the novelty
effect [51], may be related to the changes in the format and frequency of communication with the social
networks from participants’ initial preference for mobile phone calls to their use instead of WhatsApp,
which allowed them to maintain or develop contact with both kin and non-kin networks.
The social cognition schema which demonstrated the largest effect size (ES = 1.28) was Social
_Isolation, with changes in the feelings of alienation, not belonging, being an outsider, and socially_
different. Social Isolation has predictive validity for depression [52], and links to emotional loneliness [53].
Similarly, deprivation is a core component of loneliness [7] and the large effect on Emotional Deprivation
(ES = 1.24), which involved improved feelings of nurturance, empathy and protection may further
reduce emotional loneliness [53]. Improvement in the schemas of Emotional Deprivation, Social Isolation,
and emotional loneliness were paralleled with an increase in smartphone contact with social networks.
The findings suggest that through the network link in the intervention, the participants found nurturance
and a sense of belonging and inclusion, and were able to experience relationship salience [19].
The effect for social loneliness (ES = 0.47) was small and appeared more resistant to change.
The IG participants showed slower changes in their perceptions of adequacy in the number of people
in the social networks and it was only after the maintenance period that social loneliness showed a near
significant change. This may relate to the progressive nature of loneliness, with dissipation of emotional
loneliness preceding dissipation of social loneliness [54]. It was anticipated that social loneliness
improvement would have occurred earlier due to the early face-to-face interaction among participants
and the group-based interventions, reported to be of value in the reduction of loneliness [9,32].
The resistance to change in social loneliness may also relate to the resistance to change in the schema of
_Mistrust, needing a change to occur in the cognitive appraisal of relationships before there is a change in_
the social deficit [54]. The cognitive appraisal of Mistrust can be a problem for social engagement: trust,
which is often likened to the “glue” that binds society [55], is closely intertwined with social loneliness.
Edwards [56], following Putnam’s various propositions in relation to social capital, states that trust is
foundational to civic culture and is the outcome of a person’s correct prediction of others’ co-operative
behavior, facilitated by external conditions. In addition, Pope et al. [57] note that the higher the level of
trust, the greater the possibility of social participation. Because Mistrust is linked to social loneliness it
may also be interwoven with the schema of Defectiveness leading to feelings of shame, inadequacy,
and hypersensitivity to criticism that hamper trust and relationship development. A further possible
factor relates to socio-emotional selectivity theory, according to which older people select to maintain
contact with their closest, familiar relationships [57] rather than building new relationships [58,59].
Lastly, delayed changes in social loneliness, may be related to South Africa being a country with low
levels of trust [54] and with older people showing lower trust levels than younger people [55]. Mistrust
is often higher in settings such as South Africa that have high levels of crime, social inequalities, low
income and political corruption [55].

**6. Conclusions**

The unique LI-CBT mHealth supported by the social networking platform of WhatsApp
(mLINCC) incorporated face-to-face development of technological readiness in smartphone usage,
psycho-education, and the delivery of positively worded mobile instant messages. Overall the
intervention showed significant improvements in maladaptive cognitions, and loneliness, highlighting
the role of cognitive appraisals in the subjective experience of loneliness. In addition, the unique use of
WhatsApp and the crafting of a LI-CBT mHealth-supported intervention that addressed technological
readiness in smartphone usage mitigated against loneliness experienced by cognitively intact older
people living in residential care settings. The study demonstrated the possibility of the delivery of
LI-CBT by a non-psychologist in a low resourced setting in Africa and demonstrated the ability of
older people to learn smartphone technology thereby facilitating e-inclusion.

**7. Recommendations**

It is recommended that residential care facilities implement measures to facilitate residents’
positive cognitive appraisals of relationships and contexts such as regular psycho-education sessions.
It is further recommended that the study is repeated with a larger sample, over for a longer period,
possibly six months, and involves community dwelling older people. In particular, this should be
conducted in Africa, where there is a paucity of comparable loneliness studies. In addition, further
studies on the development of trust among older people could result in a measure to increase enrolment
in intervention programs targeting loneliness.

**8. Limitations**

Overall, the study found that a low-intensity CBT intervention, tailored to individuals, can be
delivered to older people using smart phones and instant messaging with potential to reduce loneliness,
although some limitations in the study should be noted. Firstly, the sample size was low, with eligible
participants showing low intent to participate (64.04%), which may be a side-effect of being lonely and
may require different study recruitment in future studies. This is confirmed by high attrition rates in
loneliness studies [51,60–62] due to higher levels of physical ill-health in older people experiencing
loneliness [63], coupled with reticence to use smartphone technology possibly due to anxiety levels or
a reduced sense of self-efficacy [27]. The low number of participants in the study and the high number
of demographics variables and outcome measures could have had an impact on significance. Secondly,
a limitation in the use of the DJGLS in this setting should be noted, with possible misinterpretation
by the participants of the terms “plenty”,” many” and “enough” in the DJGLS [64] that may have
influenced ratings of social isolation, and also the notably low reliability in the social loneliness subscale
for this study in comparison with other studies [40]. Thirdly, the nature of the study design did not
enable differentiation between the various components or the vehicle of delivery of the intervention,
and it is recommended that factorial and smart designs be used for future evaluations.
