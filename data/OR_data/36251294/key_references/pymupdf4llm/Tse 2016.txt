experimental group (p ¼ 0.003) and from 6.3 6 3.0
(P1) to 3.1 6 2.4 (P2) for the control group
(p ¼ 0.001). Activities of daily living significantly improved for both the experimental group (p ¼ 0.008)
and the control group (p ¼ 0.014). There was an enhancement in happiness level for the experimental
group (p < 0.001), while the loneliness level dropped
significantly for the experimental group (p < 0.001)
and the control group (p ¼ 0.031). The peer volunteers showed a significant increase in self-rated
pain management knowledge (2.9 6 2.6 to 8.1 6 1.2,
p < 0.001) and self-efficacy in volunteering (5.8 6 2.9
to 8.3 6 1.5, p ¼ 0.032).

Conclusion The peer-led pain management program was feasible and has potential in relieving
chronic pain and enhancing the physical and psychological health of nursing home residents.

Introduction


Setting Two nursing homes.

Subjects Fifty nursing home residents.


Methods The experimental group (n ¼ 32) was
given a 12-week group-based peer-led pain management program. There were two 1-hour sessions per
week. Education in pain and demonstrations of
nonpharmacological pain management strategies
were provided. The research team and 12 trained
peers led the sessions. The control group (n ¼ 18)
received one 1-hour session of pain management
program each week over 12 weeks from the research team only. Outcome measures for the participants were collected at baseline (P1) and at
week 12 (P2). Data from peer volunteers were collected prior to training (V1) and at week 12 (V2).
T-tests were used to compare the differences in
outcome measures collected at two time points.

Results There was a significant reduction in pain
intensity from 5.8 6 2.6 (P1) to 3.4 6 2.5 (P2) for the


When people enter the aging process, they are more
vulnerable to suffering from age-related disease and
hence pain. Chronic geriatric pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience affecting
persons who are over 65 years old for more than 3
months, and it is associated with actual and potential
tissue damage that is noncancerous in nature [1] or is
described in terms of such damage. It is estimated that
37–50% of community-dwelling older people in Hong
Kong suffer from pain [2,3]. The prevalence of pain
among nursing home residents may even be as high as
70% [4]. Consequences of unrelieved chronic pain
among older adults include hindered activities of daily
living, depression and anxiety, decreased social interaction, impaired mobility and falls, sleep disturbances,
malnutrition, and, ultimately, an increase in health care
utilization and expenditures [5]. Therefore, innovative
and cost-effective ways of managing chronic pain
should be explored.

To address chronic pain, analgesics remain the primary
pain management tool [5,6]. However, the use of
pharmacological methods has been found to be unpopular among older adults, as they worry about

adverse drug reactions and accept chronic pain as part
of aging [7]. Due to low compliance with the pharmacological approach for pain management, an increasing
number of studies have been conducted to support the
use of nonpharmacological pain management strategies
as an effective approach to dealing with chronic pain

[8]. The commonly used strategies include education
programs, empowerment programs for pain sufferers,
exercise programs, acupuncture, transcutaneous nerve
stimulation, massage, relaxation therapies, cognitive-behavioral therapy, listening to music, visual stimulation,
guided imagery, motivational interviewing, acupressure,
and multisensory stimulation arts and crafts therapy.
Indeed, it is expected that the use of nonpharmacological interventions is more acceptable for older adults
who are already taking multiple medications for their
chronic diseases.

A pain management program (PAP) has been carried
out in nursing homes in Hong Kong by health care professionals [4]. Nursing homes were randomized into an
experimental group in which the participants (n ¼ 296)
received a 1-hour session of pain management education each week, or a control group in which the participants (n ¼ 239) were provided with regular care only,
such as routine physio sessions and social activities
organized by the nursing homes. The PAP included pain
education and an introduction to and demonstration of
various nondrug strategies. Those in the experimental
group showed a significant reduction in pain scores,
higher scores in happiness, and lower perceptions in
loneliness than the control group. The use of nonpharmacological methods of pain relief significantly increased
among the participants in the experimental group as
compared with those in the control group.

As with other chronic conditions, effective selfmanagement is essential for optimal outcomes in
chronic pain management. Self-management is “the
ability to manage the symptoms, treatment, physical
and psychosocial consequences and lifestyle changes
inherent in living with a chronic condition” [9]. The effectiveness of self-managed interventions for pain
among older adults has been explored in a review, in
which 96% of the 27 articles identified showed positive
outcomes from using nonpharmacological approaches
to manage pain, with a median reduction in pain scores
of 23% [10]. Despite the benefits of self-management
for people with chronic pain, it is challenging to implement pain self-management due to limited health care
resources in a busy clinical setting.


ages and life experiences [12], and allows participants
to feel less threatened when supported by someone like
themselves as compared with the experience of seeking
professional help [13].

Pain management programs with peer support have
been shown to yield positive outcomes, including an improvement in perceived quality of life, functional capacity, number of complaints about pain, and belief in
pain myths [14,15]. In addition, a Cochrane review
showed that self-management education programs by
lay individuals (rather than health professionals) for people with chronic conditions had positive outcomes, such
as reductions in pain, disability, and fatigue [16]. Peer
support interventions for community-dwelling adults with
chronic noncancer pain were also reported to be effective in a systematic review [17].

Although positive outcomes have been shown in peer
education programs in pain management, to the best of
our knowledge, none of them have focused on older
adults and those living in nursing home settings. A PAP
led solely by health care professionals has been found
to be effective [4]. Therefore, the question of whether a
PAP using peer volunteers for older adults in nursing
homes would also be effective seemed well worth
exploring. Thus, the objectives of the present study
were to examine the feasibility of a peer-led PAP in
reducing pain, enhancing pain self-efficacy and activities
of daily living (ADL), reducing loneliness and increasing
happiness for nursing home residents; and to evaluate
the volunteer experience for the peer volunteers.


Methods

Study Design


A quasi-experimental design was applied to investigate
the efficacy of adding peer volunteers (PVs) into PAP.
Ethical approval from the ethics committee of the university was obtained.

Peer Volunteers


Peer support models are becoming widely used because they are cost-effective in helping patients manage
chronic conditions and have shown promising results

[11]. Peer support, where lay individuals receive a moderate amount of training to support those with whom
they have shared experiences, has been regarded as an
effective self-management strategy for chronic conditions. Using peers to lead health programs helps to
build a high level of rapport among people of similar


Peer volunteers were recruited from a pool of regular
members of the Institute of Active Ageing (IAA) of the
Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which is dedicated
to delivering innovative educational programs to promote active aging. The IAA staff announced and promoted this study to those members. Individuals who
expressed an interest attended a selection interview.
The selection criteria for the PVs included those who
were � 50 years old (the requirement for membership in
the IAA), retired, and committed to completing two 2hour training sessions, and who had passed an exit test
that included knowledge, demonstration, and redemonstration of skills in the use of the program materials and in leading the program.

Educational materials on pain relief were prepared. A
“Guidebook for Peer Volunteers” was given to all PVs to


-----

ensure that the procedure and content of each session
were standardized. Safety and privacy issues were mentioned in the guidebook. It also included instructions on
how to use the “I can do it” booklet, which summarized
the information on pain management strategies and the
use of drugs and various nondrug therapies, and gave
pictures of the steps involved in the physical exercises.
The “I can do it” booklet was given to all participants.
The contents of these materials were validated by the
research team.

Participants


Nursing homes were approached and invited to participate in the study by phone or email. Two nursing
homes responded to the invitation, and they were
randomized at cluster levels according to a randomization list (i.e., all participants in a nursing home were either in the experimental group or control group). The
randomization list was kept in an opaque sealed envelope and held by a person who was independent of the
trial. The two nursing homes that participated in this
study were run by the same elderly care group. They
can be considered comparable settings, as the organization, management, and service provided were similar.
Inclusion criteria were older adults aged � 60 years, who
scored � 6 in the Abbreviated Mental Test [18], had
been experiencing nonmalignant physical pain either
continuously or intermittently for more than 3 months,
and were able to understand Cantonese. Exclusion criteria were those with cognitive impairment and a history
of mental disorders, and those with cancer and currently in cancer treatment. Those suffering from conditions that limited safe participation were excluded, as
this program involved physical activities. These included
individuals who had suffered from a fracture or undergone surgery in the past 2 months, and those with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute
stroke, or acute myocardial infarction.

Nursing home residents underwent screening. Those
who were eligible to participate in the study were assigned to either the experimental group or control
group. Clustered randomization was used so that all
participants in a nursing home were either in the experimental group or control group to prevent potential communication between participants of the intervention and
control groups (information flow). The randomization list
was kept in an opaque sealed envelope and held by a
person who was independent of the trial.

components: physical exercise, interactive teaching,
and sharing of pain management education and portfolio entry. All teaching components were provided in
the “I can do it” booklet, which was developed and validated by physicians in pain management and geriatric
care and a physiotherapist. The session started with
physical exercises (20 minutes), including towel dancing;
exercises on correct body posture and alignment; and
the stretching of arms, legs, and body muscles. The second part of the session was the pain management
education or revision (30 minutes), which included information on pain situations, the effects and impacts of
pain on older adults, and the use of drugs and nondrug
strategies in pain management. The use of nondrug
therapies included viewing photographs of the natural
environment, listening to music, and participating in multisensory stimulation arts and crafts activities. At the end
of each session, portfolio entries on the knowledge and
activities of the day were made to help the participants
recall the various pain relief methods learned in class.
Session 1 was led by the research team with PVs as
observers, and session 2 of the same week was led by
the PVs only without the presence of the research
team.


Control Group—PAP

A weekly 1-hour session of PAP was solely delivered by
the research team over 12 weeks. The content of the
session was the same as the experimental group. No
PVs were involved in the control group.


Treatment Fidelity

To ensure adherence and compliance with the content
and process of the protocol, regular meetings were held
among the research team, peer volunteers, and nursing
home staff. Ongoing supervision, monitoring, support,
and encouragement of peer volunteers were given in
the regular PV group meeting. Onsite visits in the nursing homes were provided to give feedback and coaching. The peer volunteers were encouraged to contact
the research team for prompt support when necessary.


A 12-week group-based peer-led PAP was given to the
experimental group participants during weeks 1 to 12.
Each session involved a small group of six participants.
Each PV was responsible for guiding and providing assistance to two to three participants each time. There
were a total of 24 sessions, with two 1-hour sessions
each week. Table 1 shows the details of the program.
Briefly, each session was composed of three


Data Collection

The following data were collected from the participants
for both groups at baseline (P1): demographic data
(including age, gender, level of education, marital status,
and frailty status), pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, ADL,
loneliness level, and happiness level. Outcome measures were collected again at week 12 on the completion
of the intervention (P2). The peer volunteers were asked
to complete a questionnaire at two time points, i.e., before the training (V1) and at week 12 (V2).


The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was used to measure
pain intensity using an 11-point scale. The NRS is a line
marked in equal segments from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst
possible pain). The NRS has been shown to be a

reliable and valid measure of pain intensity and pain distress in older patients with persistent pain [19].

The Chinese version of the Pain Self-Efficacy
Questionnaire (PSEQ-HK) was used to assess the participants’ confidence in their ability to perform specific
tasks or their confidence in performing more generalized
constructs such as coping with chronic nonmalignant
pain. It is a 10-item self-report inventory. Each item is
scored on a 7-point Likert scale (ranging from 0, “not at
all confident” to 6, “completely confident”), with a higher
total score indicating stronger self-efficacy beliefs. It is a
reliable assessment tool with satisfactory psychometric
properties [20].

The Modified Barthel Index (MBI) was used to measure
performance in activities of daily living, testing 10 items
such as feeding, grooming, toileting, ambulation, and
bathing. The score varies from item to item and the
maximum total score is 100, indicating total independence [21]. The interrater reliability is greater than 0.95,
and the test-retest reliability is 0.89 [22]. The Chinese


The level of subjective happiness was assessed using
the Chinese version of the subjective happiness scale

[25]. The scale consists of four items rated on a 7-point
Likert scale. The total scores range from 4 to 28, with
higher scores indicating higher subjective happiness.
The Cronbach’s alpha is 0.82, and the 2-week testretest reliability was 0.70.

A questionnaire containing closed-ended questions was
completed by the peer volunteers. The peer volunteers


version has already been validated and has been shown
to be reliable for use with older adults with stroke [23].

Loneliness level was measured using the Chinese version of the Loneliness Scale [24]. The scale consists of
20 items to assess the participants’ perception of loneliness and social isolation using a 4-point Likert scale
(1 ¼ never, 2 ¼ seldom, 3 ¼ sometimes, 4 ¼ always). The
total possible scores range from 20 to 80, with higher
scores indicating greater loneliness. The Chinese version
with a Cronbach’s alpha was used.

were asked to rate their confidence in implementing the
pain education program (Likert scale from 10 [the most
confident] through 1 [the least confident]) and their level
of pain management knowledge (Likert scale from 10

[the most adequate] through 1 [the least adequate]).

Data Analysis


All statistical analyses were performed using the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). A
descriptive statistical analysis of the quantitative data
was carried out. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test
was used to examine the normality of the outcome variables. To examine the effects of the intervention, t-tests
were used to compare outcome measures collected at
two time points (i.e., P1 and P2) because the data followed a normal distribution. The questionnaires for the
volunteers collected at two time points (i.e., V1 and V2)
were compared using a pair sample t-test. A score of
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

residents. Fifty nursing home residents participated in
the study. There were no significant differences in
demographic data between the two groups. Most were
female and over 80 years old. Over 50% of the nursing
home residents were widowed and had received no formal education. Almost 75% of them had suffered from
chronic pain over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, 12
PVs completed the training and led in the program.
Most of the PVs were female, and about 50% of them
were below 60 years old. Over 75% of the PVs were
married and had received a secondary level of education or above. Nearly half of the PVs had experienced
chronic pain in the past 12 months, and over 90% of
the PVs had participated in volunteer service in the
past.

Evaluation of the Volunteer Experience


Peer volunteers also benefited from the peer-led PAP.
They were asked to rate their knowledge of pain management and self-efficacy in carrying out the volunteer
service (Table 4). It was found that their perceived
knowledge of pain management increased significantly
from 2.9 6 2.6 before the training (V1) to 8.1 6 1.2 upon
the completion of the program (V2; p < 0.001). Their
confidence in carrying out the volunteer service also
increased significantly, from 5.8 6 2.9 (V1) to 8.3 6 1.5
(V2; p ¼ 0.032).

Discussion


The present study demonstrated that a pain management program significantly reduced pain intensity,
enhanced ADL, and improved loneliness levels among
nursing home residents, regardless of whether the program was led solely by health care professional staff or
with the use of peer volunteers. The peer-led pain management program also showed potential to improve
happiness levels among older adults living in a nursing
home, while there was no significant change in happiness level among control group participants. The study
generated evidence to support the feasibility of peer volunteers, and the results add to the growing body of evidence supporting the feasibility of peer volunteers in
pain education programs [14–17,26,27].

In a literature review, four barriers to the selfmanagement of chronic pain have been identified [28],
namely, treatment (a belief that pain-relief strategies are
ineffective), personal (challenges to controlling pain due
to disability, a lack of self-efficacy, and limited resources), mental health (the presence of depression,
anxiety, and fear of pain), and social barriers (a lack of
social support). Treatment and personal barriers are
overcome by transferring knowledge to the participants
in traditional pain education programs led by health care
professionals. In this study, the addition of PVs helped
to address the remaining barriers. PVs reinforced the
pain management knowledge of nursing home


residents, re-demonstrated nonpharmacological pain
management strategies, praised the residents’ accomplishments, shared personal experiences and developed
social bonds with them, and persuaded them to adhere
to treatment recommendations [29]. Our findings
showed improvements in the pain levels and physical
and psychological health of the participants, indicating
the feasibility of using PVs.

Previous studies showed that the use of peers in pain
education programs led to improvements in the
pain situation of the participants and increased their
pain self-efficacy [26] and functional capacity [15,27].
However, the content and duration of the intervention,
the instruments for measuring outcome measures and,
most importantly, the target population differed from
those in this study. Therefore, this study is the first to investigate the feasibility of using peers in a pain education program for nursing home residents.

The current study also indicated that peer support has
the potential to improve the psychological parameters of
the participants. Having a chronic pain condition can be
a lonely experience. A previous study demonstrated that
even those participants who described themselves as
possessing strong social networks reported feeling isolated and lacking in support for dealing with their pain
conditions [27]. General social support does not necessarily ensure the receipt of effective pain-specific support, which may be difficult for the family to provide, as
they lack the coping resources required to support a
person in pain. Therefore, peer volunteers with similar
experiences may provide pain-specific support and
emotional support, resulting in improvement in loneliness and happiness levels among nursing home residents with chronic pain. The positive outcomes of this
pilot study provide evidence of this. However, it should
be noted that the effects of peers on psychological parameters were examined over a short-term follow up;
whether the same effects can be sustained for the longer term when peer support is no longer provided is unknown. In addition, experimental group participants
received added attention, as a total of two sessions
were offered compared with only one session given to
the control group participants. Therefore, these psychological parameters may have improved when the nursing
home residents participated in more social activities rather than because of the use of peer volunteers.
Whether the findings can be attributed to the use of

peer volunteers or greater attention are not well known,
and further study with a strengthened study design is
required.

Although not investigated in our pilot study, another frequently mentioned advantage of the peer education
model is that it is a cost-effective way of delivering an
intervention, especially to those who may be unable to
afford professional fees [30]. Given that the global population is aging and the demand for health services is
increasing, using older volunteers is considered an alternative model of delivering services, particularly where
health systems are underfunded [13]. The current study
showed that pain management programs led by both a
research team and peer volunteers also improved the
pain situations and physical and psychological parameters of participants in a similar direction as the program
led solely by the research team. Therefore, it is worth
studying if the program led solely by peer volunteers
would be as effective as one led by health care professionals in a larger sample. Future study should also
compare the cost between PV-led and research team–
led pain education programs.


The benefits of using older volunteers are that they are
not constrained by time and are a readily available,
cost-effective labor resource [31]. However, it should
also be noted that time and cost are involved in recruiting, training, and retaining peer volunteers. From our
observation in this pilot study, recruiting and training
peer volunteers are important. There are more than
1000 members in the IAA pool, and within 100 of them
are active members. The research team spent about 1
month to recruit the PVs, and some eligible PVs who
were not able to complete the two training sessions
were excluded. The research team had provided two
sessions of training to PVs, with demonstration and redemonstration on the skills and knowledge in leading
the PAP. The cost to develop educational materials was
about HK$100 per session, and HK$20 per person was
required for the travelling. The cost and time of training
those PVs would be worthwhile when they could be
empowered and continue to contribute to society via
participation in the PAP. It should be emphasized that
regular meetings with nursing staff are important to ensure adherence and compliance with the content and
process of the protocol; therefore no conflict has been
observed in this pilot study. In addition, all the peer volunteers who were involved in this pilot study agreed to
assist in the future, indicating that the retention rate is
high and the trained peers can be used again in future
pain education programs. Therefore, drawing on them
to help older adults with chronic pain will help to reduce
health care expenditures.

One of the limitations of this study was the exclusive reliance on self-reports for the quantitative data that were
collected. However, it was assumed that people would
be as honest as possible to the extent that they were
aware of their own thoughts, feelings, and functional
abilities at the time of the collection of the data. Our


subjects were also mentally intact and oriented as to
time and place. It was recognized that some patients
with chronic pain may either exaggerate or minimize
their reports of pain. Nonetheless, it was assumed that
these reporting patterns would be consistent over time.
Given that the primary focus of this study was to document changes over time, it was determined that the
benefits of self-reported questionnaires provided adequate justification for their use [32]. In addition, data
were collected by individuals who were not responsible
for the intervention. Therefore, reporting biases were
minimized, as the subjects did not necessarily report
positive answers to please the researchers. Secondly,
no measure of residents’ pain knowledge was included
at baseline and post-intervention. Therefore, whether reduction in pain intensity was due to the addition of PVs
or pain knowledge of residents per se is not well known.
Another limitation of this study is that it was a pilot study
with a relatively small sample size, and therefore was
underpowered to determine effectiveness. The sample
was limited to two nursing homes, which limits the generalizability of the study’s findings. Moreover, the findings may be due to the fact that participants from the
experimental group received greater attention than the
control group participants rather than the inclusion of
peer support. However, this study has demonstrated
the feasibility of recruiting and retaining peer volunteers
and older adults for a peer-support intervention for nursing home residents with chronic pain. Future study with
a strengthened study design (i.e., the same intervention
duration for both groups, with one session led by PVs
for the experimental group and one session led by
trained research assistants for the control group) will be
required to consolidate the effectiveness of peer volunteers in pain education program.

Implications


Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults. This pilot
study supports the feasibility of using peer volunteers in
pain education programs for older adults. We believe
that peer support may be beneficial for older adults, and
there is a trend to incorporate peer support into elderly


Findings of this pilot study indicate that education on
pain self-management is essential. Although nursing
staff and other health care professionals are the major
sources of pain knowledge in nursing homes, studies
have found that their pain knowledge is not adequate

[33]. In addition, pain is a common problem in elderly
persons, especially those in nursing homes [33]. Due to
the limited health care resources and budgets, training
of laypersons provides an opportunity for them to transfer pain self-management knowledge to nursing home
residents. In the future, there is potential for the government to set up an accreditation scheme to enhance the
ability of well-trained peer volunteers to contribute to
pain management education for nursing home
residents.

Conclusion


-----

care. Therefore, future research involving a larger sample and a randomized controlled design is warranted to
shed more light on the effectiveness of using peer volunteers for managing chronic pain among nursing home
residents.
