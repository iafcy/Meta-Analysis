- ABSTRACT:

Pain is common in the aging population, particularly among older
residents of nursing homes. It has been found that 50% of older people
living in the community have been experiencing chronic pain, and the
number increased to 80% for older residents of nursing homes.
Exercise is an effective non-pharmacological intervention that can
reduce pain and improve physical and psychological functions. A
quasi-experimental study with a pretest–posttest control group designed was conducted to evaluate the effects of a physical exercise
program (PEP) on older residents of nursing homes who have chronic
pain. Three-hundred-ninety-six older residents with chronic pain
were recruited from 10 nursing homes run by non-governmental
organizations in Hong Kong. The average age of the older residents
was 85.44 ± 6.29. Five nursing homes were randomized to the experimental group with PEP (n 225, age 85.45 ± 6.25); the other five

nursing homes were randomized to the control group without the PEP
(n 171, age 85.44 ± 6.35). PEP was an eight-week training program

given by a physiotherapist and nurses once a week. It consisted of
warm-up exercises, muscle strengthening, stretching, balancing, and
self-administered massage to acupressure points. At the end of each
PEP session, pamphlets with pictures illustrating the ‘‘exercise of the
day’’ were given to the older residents of nursing homes as a tool to
enhance their self-management skills. The control group received no
training during the eight weeks. Upon completion of the PEP, the
experimental group experienced a significantly greater reduction in
pain intensity from 4.19 ± 2.25 (on an 11 point scale) to 2.67 ± 2.08, as
compared to the control group (p < .05). In addition, the

experimental group was significantly
improved (p < .05).

Management Nursing

Pain is common in the aging population, particularly
among older residents of nursing homes (Hollenack
et al., 2007). Most age-related diseases and illnesses
cause chronic pain and disability. Studies showed
that 50% of the community-dwelling adults aged
60 years or above had experienced pain, and the number increased to 45% to 80% in residents of nursing
homes (American Geriatric Society, Panel on Chronic
Pain in Older Persons, 1998; Chung & Wong, 2007;
Ferrell et al., 1990). Older residents of nursing homes
are also at a higher risk of their pains not being
assessed and the treatments they are receiving being
inadequate even though their pains are documented
(Achterberg et al., 2010).
Pain in the elderly is mostly degenerative and can
cause mobility decline, role changes, and psychological disorders. Pain results from acute or chronic conditions are associated with a decrease of physical and
social functions and quality of life, and it is seen as
a key indicator of physical impairment (Horgas et al.,
2008; Parker et al., 2013). The overall level of
physical activity in older adults with chronic pain is
significantly lower than their non-pain counterparts
(Stubbs et al., 2013).
The impact of pain is a cycle of disuse and inactivity
(Griffin, Harmon, & Kennedy, 2012; Martin, 2007). Pain
causes a decrease in muscle strength, mobility, and
physical fitness, which results in reduced functional
use. People who reduce their physical activities
experience more pain and disability in the long run.
Psychological effects of pain include misconceptions about pain, decreased self-confidence in one’s
ability to cope with pain, fear of causing harm, avoiding performing activities, less life satisfaction, and
worsening mood (Griffin, Harmon, & Kennedy, 2012;
Meredith, Strong, & Feeney, 2006; Sowden, Hatch,
Gray, & Coombs, 2006; Turk et al., 2003;).
Maintaining the functional capacity in older people is crucial for breaking the cycle of disuse and inactivity. Physical exercise is effective in improving
functions or delaying the functional decline in older
people (Binder et al., 2002; Rydwik, Kerstin, &
Akner, 2005). Exercise can significantly improve the
gait velocity and limb strength and decrease psychological disorders such as depression in older persons
(De Carvalho & Filho, 2004; Callahan, 2009).


Performing physical exercise can be seen as a skill
for pain management. It has been shown that physical
exercises, if performed regularly as a habit, can bring
health benefits such as pain relief and improved functional capacity for older people. Effective physical
exercise can be introduced as a self-management skill
to older residents of nursing homes who have chronic
pain.
The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a physical exercise program (PEP) in reducing pain, enhancing mobility, and improving
psychological function for older residents of nursing
homes. The authors hypothesized that the PEP would
significantly improve the outcomes in terms of pain intensity, physical mobility, quality of life, and psychological function.

#### METHODS

Design
It was a randomized-controlled study to explore the effect of an eight-week PEP for older residents living in
nursing homes in pain intensity, physical mobility,
quality of life, and psychological function. The study
was approved by the Human Subject Ethics Subcommittee of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
Ten nursing homes in Hong Kong, including Hong
Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories, were
recruited by convenience sampling. These nursing
homes were run by non-governmental organizations
and had similar social support, healthcare, and pension
policies. Among them, five nursing homes were randomized to the experimental group; another five nursing homes were randomized to the control group by
using a computerized randomization table. Participants in the experimental group received the PEP
while the control group received no treatment during
the study period (Figure 1).

Participants
Older persons who had suffered from musculoskeletal
pain six months prior to the study were recruited. A total of 396 older persons were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were aged 60 or above, able to communicate in
Chinese, and were oriented to time and place. Older
persons with a history of mental disorder or cognitive
impairment were excluded. Each participant gave written informed consent to participate.

Procedure
Demographic data, medical data, psychological parameter, and physical parameter were collected in both the
experimental and the control group two to three days
before the PEP and two to three days after the PEP.

The demographic data included age, gender, marital status, educational level, previous occupation, and
personal health condition. The medical data included
information on pain history, use of oral analgesic
drug, and non-drug methods for pain control. The psychological parameter included happiness, loneliness,
life satisfaction, depression, and quality of life. For
physical parameter, the authors assessed the range of
motion (ROM) of the participants, and the Barthel
ADL Index and the Elderly Mobility Index were used
to assess the activities of daily living and mobility.
Three research assistants with nursing background were on the research team. Training, as well
as demonstration and returned demonstration, were
given to prepare them to use various instruments.


One research assistant received training, demonstration, and return demonstration from a physiotherapist
to learn how to take pain history and use a protractor
to measure the ROM of the participants.

The Physical Exercise Program
The physical exercise program (PEP) was led by a physiotherapist and research assistants with nursing backgrounds. It was carried out in a multi-function room
of the nursing homes. The PEP was delivered to the intervention group one time a week for eight weeks.
Each session lasted for an hour.
The participants’ physical condition and capacity
to perform the exercises were carefully monitored
throughout the program. Continual encouragement

and reinforcement were given to the participants to enhance their performances.
The PEP was designed by a physiotherapist based
on his/her clinical practice on pain management and
health education experiences with patients. Each
session of the PEP was made up of a 15-minute
warm-up exercise and a 45-minute exercise training. Different types of exercises were offered in each session.
Examples included muscle strengthening using an elastic band, stretching, balancing, towel dance, and the
skill of self-administered acupressure and massage.
The 45-minute exercise training was designed to
help the participants to relieve their pain in the shoulder, neck, back, and knee areas. The theme of each PEP
session and the exercises performed are shown in
Figure 1. Upon completion of each PEP session, pamphlets with pictures illustrating the ‘‘exercise of the
day’’ were given to all participants to encourage them
to continue to practice the exercises by themselves.

Instruments
The 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was used to
assess the presence, location, and intensity of pain
among the participants. The scale was presented vertically, with 0 representing no pain and 10 the worst
pain imaginable. The Spearman’s correlation coefficient for validity was 0.74 (Lara-Munoz, De Leon,
Feinstein, Puente, & Wells, 2004).
The Barthel Index was used to evaluate the selfcare functional ability for the activities of daily living
(Mahoney and Barthel, 1965). The index consists of
10 items including presence or absence of fecal and urinary incontinence and independence in grooming, toileting, feeding, personal hygiene, transfers, walking,
dressing, climbing stairs, and bathing. The score varies
from item to item, and the maximum total score is 20,
which indicates total independence (Shyu, et al., 2008).
The Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS) was used to
assess the mobility of the participants. The scale consists of seven activities that evaluate an individual’s mobility independence including position changes and
walking mobility (Smith, 1994). The score varies
from item to item and the maximum total score is 20,
which indicates total independence (Proser, 1997;
Ng, Tong, & Li, 2008).
The range of motion (ROM) of the participants
was measured by the degree of movement from the
alignment of body, including left and right neck rotation, left and right shoulder flex, left and right shoulder
abduction, left and right knee flex, lumbar flex, left and
right lumbar rotation, and left and right hip flex. A half
circle protractor, which is made of transparent plastic
and marked in degrees (180[�]), was used to measure
angles.


Quality of life was measured by the Health Survey
Short Form questionnaire (SF-12), which consists of 12
questions to generate physical and mental component
subscale scores (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1996). Each
score ranges from 0 to 100, higher scores indicating
better health status. A Chinese version of the SF-12
was used which has been found valid and equivalent
for the Hong Kong Chinese (Lam, Tse, & Gandek,
2005).
The Chinese version of the Subjective Happiness
Scale was used to assess the happiness level of older
persons (Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999). The scale consists of four items rated on a 7-point Likert Scale. The
total scores range from 4 to 28 with higher scores signifying higher subjective happiness. The Cronbach’s alpha is 0.79 to 0.94. The test-retest reliability ranges
from 0.55 to 0.90.
The revised UCLA Loneliness Scale was used to
measure people’s loneliness (Russell, 1996). The scale
consists of 20 items to measure feelings of loneliness
and social isolation. A four-point Likert Scale with a rating 1 never, 2 seldom, 3 sometimes, and
¼ ¼ ¼
4 always was used. The range of total scores is 20
¼
to 80. Higher scores indicate greater loneliness. The
Chinese version of the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale
was used in this study with a Cronbach’s alpha of
0.90 (Chou, Jun, & Chi, 2005).
The Chinese version of the Life Satisfaction Index,
a form scale, was used. The index consists of 18 questions around five components: zest, resolution and fortitude, congruence between desired and achieved
goals, positive self-concept, and mood tone. Items are
scored 1 agree and 0 disagree (Chi and Boey,
¼ ¼
1992). Higher scores indicate greater life satisfaction.
The Cronbach’s alpha is 0.7 and internal consistency
is 0.62.
The Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression
Scale was used to measure depression (Mui, 1996;
Yesavage, Brink, Rose, & Lum, 1983). The scale
consists of 15 questions with a rating of 1 yes and
¼
0 no. Higher scores indicate more depression.
¼
Cronbach’s alpha of internal consistency is 0.89, and
the test-retest reliability is 0.85.

Statistical Analyses
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS,
version 17) for Windows was used for all statistical
analysis. Descriptive statistics calculated the means
and standard deviations. The authors used the Chisquare test to analyze the differences in the demographic data between the experimental group and
the control group. Changes in outcome measures
were regarded as the difference between pre- and
posttreatment (posttreatment minus pretreatment).

Independent t-test to analyze the between-group differences of the outcome variables was used. The significance level was set as p # .05.


#### RESULTS

Participant Characteristics
Descriptive characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. There was no baseline difference between the experimental group and the control group
in all demographic data, but there were significantly
more post stroke participants in the experimental
group. The scores in the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group in
most outcome measures (except the Barthel index
and EMS) (Table 1).


Pain Intensity
The baseline pain intensity among the participants was
4.10 2.20. After the completion of PEP, the partici�
pants’ pain intensity was reduced in both groups.
The pain score (as measured by VRS) in the experimental group was significantly lower than the control
group (PEP group 2.67 2.08 vs control group

3.29 2.24; Change of VRS: 1.70 2.53 vs
� � �
�0.69 � 2.45, t ¼ �4.164, p < .001) (Table 2). The
pain scores for each painful site are shown in Figure 2.

Physical Parameters
The experimental group had significantly higher
scores in the Barthel index and the EMS at baseline
than the control group (p < .01). Yet, no significant difference between the two groups regarding the score
changes in the Barthel index and the EMS upon completion of the PEP (p > .05) (Table 3). In the experimental group, the ROMs of the neck, shoulder, back,
hip, and knee joints of the participants had increased
significantly upon completion of the PEP (all
p < .001), as shown in Table 3.


Quality of Life
There was no significant change in the quality of life
(both physical and mental components) of the PEP
group and control group (Table 3).

Psychological Parameters
Score changes in the psychological measures (happiness, loneliness, life satisfaction, and depression)
were more significant in the PEP group than in the control group (all p # .05) (Table 3), which indicated participants in the PEP group had a higher self-perception
of happiness and life satisfaction and lower perception
of loneliness and depression after receiving the PEP.

management of chronic pain, and it is important to encourage older adults with chronic pain to remain active
(Griffin, Harmon, & Kennedy, 2012; Stubbs et al,
2013). The physical exercise in this study is
beneficial to older adults. The authors suggest that
the physical exercise program should be
implemented in nursing homes as a routine activity.
Moreover, older residents should perform this
exercise in their free time to relieve pain and
maintain their functions.
The score change in the Barthel index indicated
a statistically significant improvement in the participant’s physical capacity and no significant group difference in the Elderly Mobility Scale. This was possibly
due to the high physical functional capacity among
the enrolled residents (especially the PEP group) at
baseline. This might have caused a ceiling effect that
hindered satisfactory improvements in physical mobility of the participants.
The authors suggest that instruments such as the
Timed Up and Go test, the Timed Chair Stand test,
and the Gait Velocity test could be other effective outcome measures used for further studies in the evaluation of physical mobility (Csuka & McCarty, 1985;
Hayes & Johnson, 2003; Shumway-Cook, Brauer, &
Woollacott, 2000).
There were significant improvements in the psychological measures regarding the change in happiness, life satisfaction, loneliness, depression, and two
pain beliefs in permanence and self-blame in the PEP
group. Yet, the control group did not show any significant improvement, even tending to deteriorate in
those variables. The favorable improvements experienced by the PEP group were significant in enhancing
psychological well-being for older adults.
Indeed, the design of the PEP was an eight-week
program given by the research team, and the authors
could only deliver it once a week for eight weeks in
each nursing home. In future studies, it would be interesting to explore the effectiveness of a four- or sixweek dose. To focus developing exercise as a habit,
older adults were encouraged to perform exercises
on their own time. The study did not have a particular
measure on resident activity and exercise outside of
class, which would be a limitation of the present study,
and further study should include recording exercise activities beyond the PEP class.
The fact is that personal attention given to nursing
home residents during the PEP was not controlled for
among the experimental groups, and this constituted
a limitation of the present study. In the future study,

a nursing student could be assigned to sit with and visit
nursing home residents for the same period that the
PEP group gets their exercise program.

#### CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the eight-week PEP is effective in relieving pain and improving certain psychological functions
for older residents of nursing homes. The authors compared the physical mobility between the two groups after the PEP and found that the PEP group had
a significant improvement in the range of motion of
common painful joints.

By learning and self-practicing the physical exercises learned in the PEP, older residents persons are
more likely to have their pain reduced, their psychological well-being enhanced, and their joint mobility
improved to perform daily activities as well as a better
quality of life in the long run.
