Abstract This study examined whether training provided to adults age 60+ would
increase the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as
email and the Internet, and influence participants’ social support and mental health.
Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (n=45) or a control group
(n=38). The experimental group participated in a six-month training program. Data
were collected before, during, and after training on outcomes related to computer
use, social support, and mental health. Mixed regression models were used for
multivariate analyses. Compared to the control group, the experimental group
reported greater self-efficacy in executing computer-related tasks and used more
ICTs, perceived greater social support from friends, and reported significantly higher
quality of life. Computer self-efficacy had both a direct and indirect effect on ICT
use, but not on other variables. With appropriate training, older adults want to and
can learn the skills needed to use ICTs. Older adults with ICT skills can access
online sources of information regarding Medicare Part D options and utilize patient
portals associated with electronic medical records. Agencies may develop services
that build upon this technology sophistication, but policies also will need to address
issues of access to equipment and high-speed Internet service.

As the number of older adults in the population increases, the burden of loneliness
and depression on older adults, their families, and our health care system may
increase. Currently, about 40% of older adults experience loneliness (Weeks 1994)
and 8% to 16% of older adults suffer from clinically significant depressive
symptoms, with even higher rates among the very old (Alexopoulous 2005).
Loneliness and depression can lead to poor eating habits, weight loss, mobility
decline, drug and alchol abuse, and suicidal ideation (Blazer 2003; Fees et al. 1999).
Research indicates that social support reduces loneliness and depression among older
adults (Krause 2001), and recent literature illustrates the potential role of technology
in building social support (Selwyn et al. 2003) and reducing loneliness (Deollos and
Morris 2004). There are, however, no research-based intervention models to date
that incorporate information and communication technologies (ICTs) in building
social support networks for older adults. This study begins to fill this gap by testing
an innovative model in a community-agency setting.

Literature Review

ICTs include computer-based applications that enhance communication between two
or more people, regardless of physical distance. These applications include email,
the World Wide Web (or Internet), online chat rooms and discussion groups,
Internet-based support groups, and voice technology and Webcams (Blaschke et al.
2009). Email has the potential to improve communication with loved ones, including
the strengthening of intergenerational bonds (Adler 2006; White and Weatherall
2000). The Internet can be used by older adults as a source of information, to assist
in health management, and to provide tools for banking and shopping (Czaja et al.
2006), as well as to serve as a source for life-long learning, entertainment, and
hobbies (Slegers et al. 2008). Internet-based chat rooms, discussion groups, and
support groups can enhance communication and provide social support for a variety
of issues older adults face (Novak 2006; Pfeil et al. 2009). These tools can also help
older adults develop and sustain new friendships and provide a sense of community
or belonging (Pfeil et al. 2009; Russell 1999). Voice technology and Webcams add
audio and visual dimensions that enhance communication and support with family,
friends, and professionals (Marziali and Donahue 2006; Rodriguez et al. 2009).
Rates of ICT utilization by older adults vary widely from one country to the next.
Recent data from the Pew Internet and American Life Project show that rates of ICT
use by older adults in the United States are increasing, from 15% in 2000 (Fox 2004)
to 38% in 2009 (Fox 2010). According to the Commission of the European
Communities (2007), only 10% of older adults in Europe use the Internet regularly,
compared to nearly 50% of older adults in Japan (ABC News 2007). The best recent
data (United Nations 2008) indicate “older people are much less likely to use the
Internet, with rates of use dropping off sharply for the oldest group (those over 75)”
(p. 75). This is not surprising, as many older adults today left the workforce and
educational settings before ICT knowledge was essential (Hagberg 2004; Irizarry et
al. 2002; Selwyn et al. 2003). A study conducted in 2008 found that 70% of
Americans between 50 and 64 years of age are regular Internet users (Pew Internet
and American Life Project 2008). ICT use among older adults, therefore, can be


-----

expected to increase dramatically during the next decade as baby boomers enter
older age (Adler 2006; Morgan 2005). Even so, given the speed with which
technology is changing, this current cohort will find their skills quickly out of date
once they leave the workplace where they may currently be receiving training.
Discussions about the potential of ICTs frequently point to a wide range of
barriers to their use faced by older adults. One of the largest of these barriers is cost
(Blaschke et al. 2009; Manna et al. 2005). A study comparing computer users and
non-users over the age of 65 found that users are more likely to be younger, more
educated, and have a higher average income than non-users (Carpenter and Bunday
2007). According to the latest “e-Readiness Rankings” (The Economist 2008), the
cost of monthly DSL access amounts to 2.5% or less of the median household
income (the point considered ‘affordable’) in only 44 out of the 70 nations studied.
Wright and Hill (2009) found that income and education impact computer use and
Internet access, with poorer older adults being the least likely to use a computer. For
every year of education, older adults are three times more likely to use a computer
and/or access the Internet.
Other common barriers mentioned in the literature include age-related issues,
characteristics of the existing technology, attitudinal issues, and training and support
issues. Physical changes brought on by age can affect the ability to use ICTs.
Impaired vision, problems with manual dexterity and mobility, changes in memory
and cognition, and activities of daily living (ADL) limitations can pose serious
challenges (Czaja and Lee 2003; Fox 2004; Gilleard et al. 2007; Saunders 2004).
Characteristics of existing technology such as complex screens and small print, the
standard computer keyboard format, usability issues with system designs, computer
jargon, and the reality that some technologies simply do not work well or easily can
also be problematic for older users (Melenhorst et al. 2001; Osman et al. 2005).
According to Saunders (2004), many older adults fear that computers will be quickly
outdated. The increasing complexity of software can also be a barrier for many older
adults (Wright and Hill 2009).
Some of these characteristics of the technology can contribute to attitudinal
barriers. Many older adults report low confidence in their ability to handle
computers. The absence of perceived benefit, the perception that technology is
dangerous, too expensive, complicated and confusing, and that it is too difficult to
learn can negatively impact ICT use by older adults (Eastman and Iyer 2004; Manna
et al. 2005; Marquie et al. 2002; Morrell et al. 2000; Saunders 2004; Selwyn 2004).
Older adults who have a positive perception of ICT usefulness, ease of use, and
efficacy of the Internet or email use ICTs more often (Adams et al. 2005). According
to Melenhorst et al. (2001), “increasing the perceived benefits of new communication methods may encourage their use by older adults” (p. 221–222). Family
members can play an important role in this effort (Selwyn 2004).
Older adults also face challenges in accessing appropriate training. These include
financial barriers and the simple absence of training opportunities. Available training
is often not provided in settings with sufficient numbers of sensitive, caring trainers
needed to support the learning process for older adults (Czaja et al. 2006; Eastman
and Iyer 2004; Irizarry et al. 2002; Osman et al. 2005; Xie 2007). According to
Irizarry et al. (2002), an appropriate class size, an informal atmosphere in which
students have the freedom to ask questions, the skill of the teacher, and the


-----

availability of helpers are important factors in teaching older adults how to use ICTs.
Equally important are teacher enthusiasm and a caring attitude (Osman et al. 2005).
It is important for trainers to remember that teaching an older person requires extra
time and effort (vanBerlo and vanValen 1998). Motivation to learn can also be
enhanced by exploring with the older adults what they would like to do with the
computer and adjusting the training to meet their interests (Osman et al. 2005).
According to Czaja et al. (2006), it is important to use technology that allows older
adults to experience success so that they build up confidence in their abilities. There
is also a need to ensure that older adults are trained as individuals rather than as a
group, and if group training does take place, then it is imperative that each person
has access to a computer (Osman et al. 2005).
Contemporary literature offers many examples of the expected benefits of ICTs.
For example, they have the potential to positively impact the quality of life for older
adults (Czaja and Lee 2007; Eastman and Iyer 2004; Selwyn et al. 2003) by
improving social support and psychosocial well-being (Carpenter and Bunday 2007;
Pfeil et al. 2009; White et al. 1999). Carpenter and Bunday (2007) also found that
computer users reported fewer depressive symptoms compared to nonusers. The
Internet enhances communication between older adults and their loved ones (Adler
2006; Cutler and Hendricks 2001; Novak 2006; White et al. 2002) by allowing them
to communicate frequently, easily, and inexpensively with family and friends
regardless of the physical distance between them (Czaja and Lee 2003; Rodriguez et
al. 2009). It also provides an outlet to meet new people who have similar interests
(Blit-Cohen and Litwin 2004; White et al. 2002). For older adults who are
homebound, Internet access allows them to feel like they are out of the house
(Bradley and Poppen 2003), improves their connection with the outside world
(Nahm and Resnick 2001; Selwyn et al. 2003; White et al. 2002), and helps them
avoid or reduce feelings of social isolation (Blit-Cohen and Litwin 2004; Czaja et al.
2006; White et al. 1999).
A number of studies have examined various aspects of ICT-related training for
older adults. Conclusions were generally positive. Older adults are capable of
learning new technologies (Hickman et al. 2007), although this may involve
additional practice and support (Nair et al. 2007; vanBerlo and vanValen 1998).
Older adults felt less anxious about ICTs after training (Irizarry et al. 2002; Xie and
Bugg 2009), saw potential advantages and uses of the technology (Campbell 2004),
and reported an increased interest in computer use and efficacy (Xie and Bugg
2009). Older adults like learning online (Swindell 2000) and are eager to learn
(Sherer 1997), feeling that mastery of new skills lets them keep in closer contact
with family and friends (Namazi and McClintic 2003), and keeps them up-to-date in
the modern world (Clark and Straka 2000). Although none of the studies utilized
randomized clinical trials, taken together they dispel the notion that ICTs cannot
offer positive potential applications and rewards for older adults, or that older adults
are not open to learning how to use new technology.
The current project builds on this existing research using an experimental design
to determine whether training provided to adults age 60 and older would increase
participants’ use of technology and whether increased use of technology would
influence other areas of their lives. Specifically, we tested three hypotheses: 1)
participants in the experimental group will report increases in computer-related


-----

measures; 2) participants in the experimental group will report improvement in
mental health and social support related measures; 3) computer self-efficacy will
mediate the effect of the training on the use of ICTs and mental health and social
support outcomes.

Methods

Sample and Procedures

Participants for the Technology and Aging Project (TAP) were drawn from 348
respondents to a community-based survey of technology use distributed to adults age 60
and older in Otsego County, a rural county in northern Michigan. Survey respondents
who expressed interest in participating in future research on technology were contacted,
and those who agreed to participate were randomly assigned into an experimental group
(n=45) or a control group (n=38). The experimental group participated in a six-month
training program developed and implemented in partnership with the Otsego County
Commission on Aging, a community agency providing services to older adults
throughout the county. Data were collected from both groups at baseline, 3 months,
6 months, and 9 months (3 months after the end of the training).
The main goals of the training were to increase participants’ comfort with
technology, increase awareness of and knowledge about safety and security issues
related to the Internet, and introduce new tools for connecting with geographically
dispersed family and friends. Participants were divided into beginner and intermediate
groups depending on their baseline skill level and experience with computers.
Baseline skill level was assessed in several ways: a measure of computer self-efficacy
(described below), current use of ICTs, and participant’s self-assessment. While the
majority of participants were appropriately placed, there were some reassignments
during the first few weeks based on reassessment of skill level. Arrangements were
made for participants who needed computers, with costs based on ability to pay using
the community agency’s guidelines. Each group met every 2 weeks for a total of 11
classes, plus one additional tutorial session for beginners. Topics ranged from the
basics of using a computer and mouse and keyboard skills, to blogging, manipulating
photos, and using voice and video via the Internet (see Table 1 for complete class
schedule). Classes were taught in a computer-lab setting by the project coordinator,
as well as various volunteers from the community. Volunteers were also on hand
during class periods to work with individual participants.

Measures

Three main groups of variables were examined in this pilot study: computer-related
outcomes, social-support related outcomes, and mental-health related outcomes.

Computer-Related Outcomes

Computer self-efficacy (CSE) was measured using a scale based on 16 items adapted
from Murphy et al. (1989). Respondents were asked to indicate how confident they

felt completing certain tasks (e.g., escaping and exiting from software, sending and
receiving email) without any assistance, on a scale from 1 = very little confidence to
5 = quite a lot of confidence. Item responses were summed for an overall score
ranging from 16 to 80 (Cronbach’s alpha=0.96), with a higher score indicating a
greater level of self-efficacy. Participants also were asked to indicate how often they
use the Internet, send or receive email, get news online, send instant messages,
conduct banking online, play games, download music, download pictures, or gamble
online. Responses ranged from 0 = never to 3 = daily and were summed to create a
scale measuring information and communication technology use (range: 0 to 27,
Cronbach’s alpha=0.79). A higher score indicated more ICT use. Finally,
respondents were asked, as part of the social network measures described below,
to indicate how they communicated with each person in their social network and the
number of people overall with whom they used email, instant messaging, or Skype
were counted.

Social-Support Related Outcomes

Social network data were collected using an adaptation of Antonucci’s hierarchical
mapping technique (Antonucci 1986). Respondents were asked to list the first names
of individuals they would include in their network. For each person listed, data were
gathered on the respondent’s relationship with that person, how frequently they had
contact with them, and what ICT tools were used to stay in contact with them. The
total number of people in the respondent’s network was a count of the number of
people listed (range 1 to 20). The frequency of contact was measured on a 5-point
scale ranging from 1 = irregularly to 5 = everyday. Frequency for each network
member was used to calculate the mean frequency of contact across the network as a


-----

whole. Perceived social support was measured using the Multidimensional Scale of
Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) (Zimet et al. 1988). The MSPSS consisted of 12
statements to which respondents indicated how much they agreed on a scale ranging
from 1 = very strongly disagree to 7 = very strongly agree. The total score ranged
from 12 to 84 (Cronbach’s alpha=.92), with a higher score indicating greater
perceived support. The measure also included subscales for support from family,
friends, and a significant other.

Mental-Health Related Outcomes

Loneliness was measured using a six-item scale (De Jong Gierveld and Van Tilburg
2006). Respondents were given a series of statements such as, “I experience a
general sense of emptiness.” and, “There are plenty of people I can rely on when I
have problems.” and asked to indicate the extent to which each statement applied to
them (yes, more or less, no). Responses were summed with negative and positive
statements reverse coded from one another (range 0 to 6, Cronbach’s alpha=0.64). A
higher score indicated more loneliness and subscales distinguished emotional from
social loneliness. For quality of life, respondents were asked to indicate how
satisfied they were with 16 areas of their life (e.g., material comforts, health, close
friends) on a scale from 1 = terrible to 7 = delighted (Flanagan 1978). Responses
were summed for a total score ranging from 16 to 112 (Cronbach’s alpha=0.88),
with a higher score indicating greater quality of life. Finally, depressive symptoms
were measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Yesavage et al. 1982).
The GDS consists of 15 items. Respondents indicated by yes or no whether the
statement applied to how they felt during the past week. Positive and negative items
were reverse coded, and the number of responses indicating possible depression
were counted, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms (range 0 to
15, Cronbach’s alpha=0.71).
Data were also collected on age—measured in years (range 60–89)—and gender.
Socioeconomic status was indicated by a three-category measure of education (high
school or less, some college, two-year degree or higher), and a three-category
measure of household income (less than $25,000, $25,000 to $49,999, $50,000 or
higher). Dichotomous measures of marital status (married, not married) and living
arrangement (live alone, live with others) were also included.

Analytic Strategy

Bivariate baseline comparisons were made across all measures to determine the
extent to which the experimental and control group differed before the training.
Mixed regression models (MRMs) were used for multivariate analyses to estimate
change in outcomes over time and to compare the experimental and control groups.
Mixed regression models are useful for this type of analysis for several reasons
(Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondai 2005; West et al. 2006).
First, they do not require that subjects be measured on the same number of
timepoints. This is important because, as is to be expected with any longitudinal
study, there was some attrition in our sample. In particular, 76% of respondents
completed all four data points. Of those who did not complete all interviews, 10%


-----

missed only one data collection point and 5% missed two. Several of these were
participants who went to warmer climates for the winter months. An additional 10%
dropped out after the baseline data collection period. Most of these were in the
experimental group and most of them left for health or other personal reasons.
Second, with MRMs, subjects do not have to be measured at exactly equal time
intervals. Although every effort was made to interview participants at all time points,
there was some variation due to difficulties in scheduling. Third, MRMs permit
modeling of the effects of factors other than the treatment on the outcomes of
interest. This includes time-invariant covariates such as gender, and time-varying
covariates such as computer self-efficacy that was treated as both an outcome and a
predictor for other outcomes. Finally, in providing an estimate of the average change
over time in both experimental and control group subjects, MRMs can provide an
estimate of change for each individual as well as deviations from group trends.
Analyses were conducted using the xtmixed commands in Stata 10.1 (StataCorp
2001). For each outcome, we first fit the null model with the dependent variable only
to determine the level of between-person variance. Second, we ran the model
including fixed effects for whether the participant was in the experimental or control
group and time, as well as a random effect associated with the intercept for each
participant and a residual associated with each observation. If hypotheses 1 and 2 are
correct, we would expect not only a signficant coefficient for the variable indicating
which group respondents were in, but we would also expect the residual to drop with
the addition of this variable to the model. We then fit a third model including a
second random effect with an unstructured covariance matrix that allowed each
person to have a unique outcome at each time point. A likelihood-ratio test was
performed to compare these last two models; the model with the best fit was
retained. Thus, for some outcomes, time was reported as a fixed effect only, and
other outcomes included time as a random effect as well. To test the mediating effect
of computer self-efficacy (hypothesis 3), additional models were run for outcomes
for which there were significant differences between the experimental and control
groups, or a significant fixed effect for time with computer self-efficacy as a
predictor. An alpha of.05 was used as the cutoff for determining statistical
significance.

Results

Comparison of the experimental and control group participants show that there were
no significant differences between the two groups at baseline (Table 2). Overall, the
average age was 72 and the majority of participants (72%) were female. Almost half
(46%) had a two-year degree or higher, while 28% had some college, and 26% had a
high school degree or less. Roughly a third (34%) of participants had incomes less
than $25,000, 38% had incomes between $25,000 and $49,999, and 28% had
incomes of $50,000 or greater. Over half (62%) were married and 30% lived alone.
On average, participants scored low on the loneliness and depression measures and
high in quality of life and perceived social support. The average number of contacts
in the social network was nine and the average frequency of contact was 3.8 on a
scale ranging from 1 = never to 5 = daily, with a higher score indicating greater

frequency. Out of a possible 80 on an additive scale, the average computer selfefficacy score was 53. Most participants felt somewhat or very comfortable learning
new technology (87%) and over half (64%) reported that they were somewhat or
very knowledgeable about computer technology. The average ICT use was 7.89 at
the start of the program (out of a possible 27), and on average participants
communicated with about three network members using email, instant messaging, or
Skype.
Table 3 shows mixed regression models for computer-related outcomes.
Compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly greater
computer self-efficacy and used more ICTs. Furthermore, computer self-efficacy and
ICT use increased significantly over time for both groups. Although the residual
decreased for the use of email, instant messaging, or Skype with the addition of the
experimental vs. control group variable, there was no significant difference between
the two groups for this outcome. Use of these communication tools did, however,
increase significantly over time for both groups.
In terms of social support outcomes, there was no significant difference between
the experimental and control groups in the number of people in their social network
or in frequency of contact with their network (Table 4). There was a trend-level
difference between the experimental and control groups in perceived social support.
Analysis of the subscales for this variable suggest that this was driven by a
difference in perceived support from friends; however, there was no signficant
difference in this variable over time. The number of people in the social network did
significantly increase over time, and the drop in the residual with the addition of
group membership and time to the model suggests that the program may have some
influence on the number of people within each participant’s social network.
There was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups
in terms of loneliness or depressive symptoms (Table 5). The experimental group
reported significantly higher quality of life compared to the control group, and the
residual dropped compared to the null model, but there was no significant change
over time.
Table 6 shows results of models including computer self-efficacy as a mediating
variable for those outcomes for which there were significant differences between the
experimental and control groups or a significant change over time. Computer selfefficacy had both a direct and indirect effect on ICT use, that is, greater computer
self-efficacy increased ICT use and accounted for some of the difference between the
experimental and control groups. Furthermore, the increase in ICT use over time is
no longer significant. Computer self-efficacy significantly increased the number of
network members communicated with by email, instant messaging, or Skype, but it
did not affect the significant increase in the use of these tools over time. Computer
self-efficacy was also not related to perceived support from friends or quality of life;
although the coefficients for these variables decreased, there is still a significant
difference between the experimental and control groups. Furthermore, computer selfefficacy did not have a direct affect on perceived support or quality of life. This
suggests that participating in the training itself, rather than the skills or knowledge
gained from the training, may have contributed to these outcomes. Figures 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, and 6 depict the change over time for these variables and suggest that for several
of these outcomes, there is a drop off after the training ended (T4).

Discussion

The analyses presented above indicate partial support for the study hypotheses. To
the extent that computer self-efficacy and actual utilization of ICTs are worthy
objectives on their own, the data show that the ICT training received by
experimental group participants did indeed have an effect. Those who participated
reported increased competence with ICTs, which in turn led to increased use of ICTs.
This pilot project also showed that when ICT training incorporates strategies and
tools that reflect the needs and desires of older adults, they are willing to learn
computer skills and can learn these skills, despite stereotypes to the contrary. To be
effective, such training should incorporate a number of features.
First, hands-on learning for the trainees, with adequate opportunities for
supervised practice, enhances the ability of older adults to retain information and

successfully practice on their own at home. Second, one-to-one help with peers or
other volunteers available in the classroom provides additional help to those who
might otherwise fall behind the rest of the class. Third, it is essential to create a
learning environment where students feel comfortable stopping the presenter and
asking questions. This has the added advantage of slowing down the pace, which
also helps increase student learning. Informal conversations with participants
revealed that, in previous mixed-age classes they had taken, they were too
intimidated to ask questions and then fell behind the rest of the class. Fourth, clear,
step-by-step handouts that participants can take home and practice with facilitates
learning between classes. It is important, however, that handouts are not exhaustive,
but focus only on the key components of the lesson; too much information can
overwhelm older learners and keep them from practicing. Finally, dividing older
adults into groups with comparable levels of previous knowledge improves the
classroom dynamic. Of particular importance, true beginners should learn with other
beginners because the pace of their learning will be significantly different.

The results related to specific tools were interesting. For example, a greater
number of participants communicated by IM after the training, but the numbers are
very small and not reliable. Although the quantitative analysis showed no
statistically significant differences between the groups related to use of email,
instant messaging, or Skype, focus group and interview data present a different
picture. Based on respondents’ replies, it appears that participants placed a great
value on using Skype, especially for communicating with grandchildren through
Webcams.
Given the project’s intent to give participants tools to expand their social network
and improve other significant areas of life, the results of the project are decidedly
mixed. The study reports increased perceived support, particularly from friends, and
improvements in perceived quality of life. At the same time, there were no
statistically significant improvements in other social support measures or in
loneliness or depression. It may be that improvement in these outcomes will take
longer to appear. It is also possible that the ceiling effect resulting from the relatively
positive mental health for this group means no effects may be feasible.
For perceived social support and quality of life, the lack of either a direct or a
mediating effect of computer self-efficacy suggests that this increase can be
attributed to participation in the training itself. After the training ended, perceived
social support from friends declined. This finding suggests that at some level there

will be benefits from providing a forum for older adults to get together with others
who have similar interests, regardless of the topic. At the same time, tax preparation
and submission, Medicare Part D enrollment, and patient access to electronic
medical record systems with email-address requirements exemplify areas of life
where ICT use is important. For this reason, making technology the focus of these
face-to-face gatherings brings added benefits by reducing the digital divide for this
demographic group. With many commercial and government organizations using
ICTs for communication with stakeholders, training for older adults helps sustain
their capacity to participate in contemporary life.


Limitations

Although participants were randomly assigned into the experimental and control
groups, they were drawn from a convenience sample of community-survey
respondents who indicated an interest in participating and agreed to the possibility
of being assigned to the control group. Thus, the sample clearly consists of older
adults who self-selected as participants for the project. Comparisons of available data
from the community survey indicate that those who participated in TAP were
younger, had more education, and were already more frequent users of ICTs than the
survey sample as a whole.

This raises the challenge of how to engage those individuals who might benefit
from the training but who are not interested or not comfortable participating for any
of the reasons noted in the literature. People who are homebound, those with low
reading skills or visual handicaps, and other similar groups may in fact receive
greater benefit from the connections to information and social support that result
from developing ICT skills. Residents in the county have been expressing an interest
in participating in future ICT training because of local media coverage and word-ofmouth. It will be interesting to see if this publicity, particularly from older adult
peers, entices a broader range of potential participants.
Another limitation that resulted from this self-selection of a somewhat
homogeneous pool of participants is the ceiling effect on many of the dependent
variables. At baseline, both experimental and control group participants all scored
relatively low on depression and high on quality of life, and reported relatively
robust social networks. This limited the extent to which positive change was
possible, and thus perhaps understates the potential impact of the program on a
broader range of participants.


Implications for Policy and Practice

Any effort to implement a project aimed at improving ICT skills of older adults must
confront the reality that for many people in the target audience, access to high-speed

Internet service at home may be either unavailable or unaffordable, even for those
who own a computer. Without such access at home, participants will be unable to
utilize many of the ICT applications they will learn about in the training, making the
new information close to useless. Thus, in addition to the content of the ICT training
itself, program developers need to consider locating resources to cover both the cost
of computers and high-speed Internet access, when available. At the policy level,
this issue points to the question of advocating for improved access to affordable,
high-speed Internet service throughout our communities.
An additional financial issue related to establishing a program designed to address
larger numbers of participants is cost of the model as implemented. It was very
expensive to have a salaried, competent staff person design, coordinate, and deliver
the type of ICT curriculum presented to this small pilot group of 45 participants, and
the cost of expanding the model to cover larger numbers would be prohibitive for
most non-profit agencies. Given the positive outcomes described above, alternative
models for delivery will have to be developed and tested. One such alternative,
currently being tested by the authors, uses volunteer peer tutors to deliver most of
the training.
The results detailed above show that with age-appropriate training approaches,
older adults can and will learn a wide range of ICT skills that can be incorporated
into the services provided to them. As human-service agencies begin to recognize
the benefits of this integration and the associated need to provide appropriate
training and resources to clients, it is reasonable to expect that services building
upon this new technology sophistication will be developed. For example, an older
adult audience with ICT skills can receive training in using reputable online sources
of information regarding Medicare Part D options. Older adults with Web and social
media skills can be enrolled in programs that use Web-based tools to enhance
communication and joint decision-making with physicians, case managers, and
caregivers. It is already the case that emerging electronic medical records programs
require an email address as the starting point of entry for use of the program. Older
adults without ICT skills are essentially denied use of this potentially powerful tool.
To bring about some of these changes, it will inevitably be necessary to change
some aspects of the culture of health and social service delivery. Certain behaviors of
older adults and service professionals will also need to be modified. All groups will
require additional training in using ICT tools, along with a shift in thinking about
how services are provided and reimbursed. For example, physicians are not currently
reimbursed for time spent communicating with a client via email about blood sugar
levels recorded online. Using ICTs to record and transmit these levels, and then
using other ICTs to permit direct conversations between patients and physicians
without arranging a face-to-face meeting, would seem to be very cost-effective uses
of existing technology tools. How these tools are perceived, and ultimately how their
use is reimbursed, will greatly influence their future utilization in the lives of older
adults.
All of these developments are not without their challenges. One of the most
serious is the tension over how best to spend ever-more-limited agency resources.
Can an agency director justify using staff resources to direct and supervise a group
of peer tutors who are training other older adults in ICTs? Is it worth the opportunity
cost in terms of other work that the staff and volunteers could be doing? Do

programmatic cost savings result from providing older adults with the skills
necessary to access virtual resources? There are no easy answers, but further
research will shed light on this important issue of technology’s role in addressing
loneliness, depression, and other needs of older adults.
