#### Abstract

**Objectives:** To test effects of the Community of Voices choir intervention on the health, well-being, and health care costs of
racial/ethnically diverse older adults.
**Method:** Twelve Administration-on-Aging-supported senior centers were cluster randomized into two groups: the intervention group started the choir immediately and a wait-list control group began the choir 6 months later. The choir
program was designed for community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. The multimodal intervention comprises
activities that engage participants cognitively, physically, and socially. Outcome measures assessed these three domains as
well as health care utilization and costs. The intention-to-treat comparison was at 6 months.
**Results:** The sample (N = 390) had a mean age of 71.3 years (SD = 7.2); 65% were nonwhite. Six-month retention was
92%. Compared to controls, intervention group members experienced significantly greater improvements in loneliness
(p = .02; standardized effect size [ES = 0.34] and interest in life (p = .008, ES = 0.39). No significant group differences were
observed for cognitive or physical outcomes or for health care costs.
**Discussion:** Findings support adoption of community choirs for reducing loneliness and increasing interest in life among
diverse older adults. Further efforts need to examine the mechanisms by which engagement in choirs improves aspects of
well-being and reduces health disparities among older adults, including potential longer-term effects.

The United States’ population of adults aged 65 years and
older is increasingly diverse, with nearly 22% being from
racial/ethnic minority backgrounds (U.S. Census Bureau,
2017); by 2030, this percent will increase to almost one


third (Vincent & Velkoff, 2010). In addition, many older
adults face socioeconomic challenges, for example, more
than 4.2 million were below the poverty level in 2015
(Administration on Aging, 2016). Among older adults, the

poverty rate is higher for blacks (18.4%), Latinos (17.5%),
and Asians (11.8%) compared to non-Latino whites
(6.6%). Minority and lower socioeconomic status (SES)
older adults are at greater risk for poor health outcomes
(Louie & Ward, 2011).
Engagement in the arts is one novel approach to improve the health of diverse older adults. Arts-based interventions can be offered in the community, are relatively
low cost to deliver, are engaging, and can be culturally tailored (Macdonald, Kreutz, & Mitchell, 2012; Noice, Noice,
& Kramer, 2014; Castora-Binkley, Noelker, Prohaska, &
Satariano, 2010). Because music is integral to most cultures,
music interventions may provide opportunities for diverse
older adults to remain active and engaged (Johnson et al.,
2015). Community choirs are popular, with approximately
32.5 million adults singing regularly in choirs in the United
States. (Chorus America, 2009). Community choirs also
have few requirements in terms of musical ability because
basic singing abilities develop spontaneously during childhood (Trainor & Hannon, 2013). Choirs are multimodal,
defined as having cognitive, physical, and psychosocial engagement components. Participating in activities that involve
multiple engagement components in later life and that occur
in groups may confer more health benefits than activities
with only one component or done alone (Karp et al., 2006;
Menec, 2003).
There is a need to understand the potential health benefits of participating in community choirs in later life. Several
cross-sectional studies found that older adults who participate
in choirs report greater well-being (Clift et al., 2010; Gick,
2011; Johnson, Louhivuori, & Siljander, 2017). However,
these studies involved older adults who were predominantly
white and from relatively high SES backgrounds. The first
longitudinal study was nonrandomized and compared older
adults who participated in a 12-month choir to a usual activity group (Cohen et al., 2006). Participants who sang in
the choir reported better self-rated health, fewer doctor visits,
use of fewer over-the-counter medications, fewer falls, and
less decline in morale compared to the usual activity control
group. However, the groups were self-selected, bias due to
attrition was not considered, and the sample was predominantly white women. Recently, a randomized controlled trial
of a choir program for community-dwelling older adults was
conducted in England (Coulton, Clift, Skingley, & Rodriguez,
2015). The program involved singing 90 min a week for 14
weeks, and health and economic outcomes were evaluated at
the end of the intervention. At 3 months, the choir group had
significantly higher scores on a mental health-related quality
of life measure and lower depression and anxiety compared
with a usual activity control group. No differences were
observed on a physical health-related quality of life measure.
Participants were predominantly white women with high educational backgrounds. Although none of the studies reviewed
earlier examined cognitive outcomes, studies of piano training found improvements in cognition for older adults (Bugos,
Perlstein, McCrae, Brophy, & Bedenbaugh, 2007), and one


recent qualitative study reported improvements in cognitive function as a perceived benefit of choir singing (Fu, Lin,
Belza, & Unite, 2015). Additional review of choir studies are
in a prior article (Johnson et al., 2015). Thus, well-designed
studies are needed to determine whether choir singing might
have effects on multiple aspects of health and well-being for
more diverse samples.
This article reports the effects of a community choir
intervention designed to promote the health and well-being
of diverse older adults. The study used community-engaged
research methods (Napoles, Santoyo-Olsson, & Stewart,
2013) to design and implement a community choir intervention. To evaluate the choir intervention, we incorporated an
array of outcomes measuring physical, cognitive, and psychosocial aspects of health. Here, we report the main randomized intention-to-treat group comparisons at 6 months.
Compared to delayed intervention controls, we hypothesized that participation in a community choir program will
be associated with improvements/maintenance on the primary outcomes of executive function, depressive symptoms,
and lower body strength at 6 months. We also hypothesized
that, compared to delayed intervention controls, participation in a community choir program will be associated with
improvements/maintenance in the secondary outcomes of
cognition (attention and inhibitory control, memory), psychosocial well-being (sadness, positive affect, fear/affect,
loneliness, interest in life), physical (balance, gait speed),
and health care utilization and costs at 6 months.

#### Methods

The Community of Voices (COV; Comunidad de Voces
in Spanish) study was a multisite, cluster-randomized
trial conducted at 12 Administration-on-Aging-supported
senior centers serving racial/ethnically diverse communities
throughout San Francisco, CA (study enrollment February
2012–August 2015). Details about the study design, senior
centers, and recruitment methods are published elsewhere
(Johnson et al., 2015, 2017). Twelve Administration-onAging-supported senior centers were randomized to receive
the choir intervention immediately (intervention group) or
after a 6-month delay (wait-list control group). Although
each choir spanned 1 year (44 sessions), the main randomized intention-to-treat group comparison reported here
was at 6 months (after 23 sessions) because this coincided
with the start of the choir intervention for the control group.

##### Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria were being aged 60 years and older,
having sufficient visual and hearing acuity (with assistive
devices), and being fluent in English or Spanish (bilingual
and monolingual speakers). Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad because this was a community-based effectiveness trial. Exclusion criteria included having cognitive
impairment (Mini-Cog score <3 of 5; Borson, Scanlan,


-----

Brush, Vitaliano, & Dokmak, 2000), self-reported diagnosis of dementia, a serious medical condition, or plans to
move out of the area. Persons who were regularly singing
in a choir during the past 6 months (e.g., weekly) were
excluded. The study was approved by the University of
California, San Francisco’s Institutional Review Board
protocol number 12-09005, and written consent was
obtained.

##### Randomization Procedures

We used a two-arm cluster randomized trial design with the
12 senior centers serving as clusters. A restricted randomization procedure (Hayes & Moulton, 2009) allocated the 12
centers into 2 sets of 6 centers to optimize cross-set balance
of 78 center characteristics: 10 indicators of services/activities provided (e.g., meal service, transportation), 16 demographic indicators (e.g., proportional representation of age
strata, racial/ethnic groups, sex, functionally impaired), and
center readiness to implement the intervention. Afterward,
one set of six centers was randomly assigned to the intervention group (began choir immediately) and the other set
to the wait-list control group (waited 6 months to begin
the choir). Recruitment occurred in phases, one pair of
senior centers at a time, where each pair consisted of one
intervention and one wait-list control center. Once baseline
assessments were completed at a pair of sites, randomization assignment was revealed to study and senior center
staff, music professionals, and participants.

##### Intervention: COV Choir Program

The choir program was designed in collaboration with a
community music partner and the senior centers with the
goal of promoting the health and well-being of diverse, community-dwelling older adults. The theoretical framework
and rationale for the program content are published elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2015). Each choir session included
activities targeting three hypothesized pathways by which
a choir could promote health and well-being: cognitive,
physical, and psychosocial engagement. The approach to
the choir intervention across sites was standardized around
[these components and documented in a manual (https://](https://cov.ucsf.edu/)
[cov.ucsf.edu/). The choirs were led by professional choir](https://cov.ucsf.edu/)
directors and accompanists from local communities who
completed training on the intervention components prior
to starting the choir with one refresher training midway.
Choir directors identified music repertoire that could be culturally tailored for each site and was appropriate for older
adults with a range of singing abilities and experience and
challenging enough to facilitate growth and mastery over
time. The 90-min choir sessions took place at the senior
centers, and each choir met weekly for 44 weeks, including
3–4 informal public performances. Additional details about
the intervention are found in the online manual.


##### Fidelity for Delivery of Intervention

The music partner’s program manager helped supervise
delivery of the choir intervention. The principal investigator completed fidelity checks using a 23-item survey that
assessed three areas: implementation of the three choir
components (i.e., cognitive, physical, and psychosocial
engagement), leadership skills, and musicianship. Each item
was rated on a 4-point scale assessing the extent to which
the director met expectations (3 exceeded expectations, 2
met expectations, 1 below expectations, and 0 well below
expectations). Fidelity checks were completed 3 weeks after
the choir started, at 3 months, and at 6 months. If ratings
on any item were below expectations (0 or 1), feedback
was provided and a follow-up fidelity visit was completed
within 2 weeks. We report the percentage of items that were
rated as having met expectations (a rating of 2 or 3) for
each of the fidelity areas at all three time points.

##### Participant Adherence to Intervention

To assess participant adherence, attendance at each choir
session was recorded by the choir directors. Attendance
was calculated as the total number (and percent) of the 23
sessions attended and percent of participants who completed at least 50% and at least 75% of the sessions.

##### Assessments

In-person assessments were conducted at each of the senior
centers. We used the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
Assessment Center computer-based platform to collect
and manage all data and added several project-specific
instruments.

**Sample characteristics**
Demographic variables included age (years), sex (male/
female), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino or not), race (American
Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, black/African American,
Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, white, and other),
educational level, marital status, language of screening
interview (Spanish/English), and nativity. We assessed
financial hardship in terms of difficulty paying for food,
monthly bills, medical visits, or prescribed medications in
the past 12 months. We assessed health insurance (none,
public only, or any private), whether they previously sang
in a choir as an adult, and their overall music ability (poor,
fair, good, very good, or excellent).
Self-rated health was assessed using a standard item
with five response choices (excellent, very good, good,
fair, poor). We asked whether a health professional had
told them they had any of 11 chronic health conditions,
which were categorized into eight physical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancer, arthritis, and emphysema/bronchitis/asthma) and one mental health condition
(depression or anxiety).


-----

**Outcome measures**
As detailed elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2015), outcome measures were selected based on the hypothesized mechanisms
of action of the intervention by engagement domain: psychosocial, cognitive, and physical. We included measures
from the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological
and Behavioral Function (NIH Toolbox; Hodes, Insel, &
Landis, 2013) as well as several commonly used legacy
measures. For each engagement domain, we selected one
measure a priori as the primary outcome; other measures
of that category were secondary outcomes. Here, we briefly
describe each measure in terms of its content; details about
the response choices, scoring, and reliability are reported
elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2015, 2017).

_Psychosocial outcomes_
We assessed six psychosocial outcomes: depressive symptoms, sadness, anxiety, loneliness, positive affect, and interest in daily life. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009) assessing depressive symptoms was the primary psychosocial outcome and ranges
from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating more depression. The other five measures were drawn from the NIH
Toolbox. Three assessed psychological distress: Sadness,
Fear/Affect (symptoms of anxiety), and Loneliness. Two
measures assessed psychological well-being: Positive Affect
and Apathy (Interest in Life). We reversed and renamed
“Apathy” as “Interest in Life” because all items pertain to
interest in life (e.g., interested in things, got things done, did
interesting things, and was motivated). For NIH Toolbox
measures, we used T-scores scaled so that the means equaled
50 and the standard deviations equaled 10.

_Cognitive outcomes_
Three tests assessed memory and executive function. The
Trail Making Test (TMT) was the primary cognitive outcome. The TMT (Reitan, 1958; Strauss, Sherman, &
Spreen, 2006) parts A and B were used to assess the setshifting component of executive function. We allowed a
maximum time of 180 s to complete each part to reduce
participant burden (Tombaugh, 2004). The variable of
interest is time (seconds) to complete TMT-B minus time to
complete TMT-A, which is an index of executive function
that isolates the executive control component (SanchezCubillo et al., 2009). The NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory
Control and Attention Test was used as a test of attention
and inhibitory control. Participants completed 20 trials; the
final computed score reflects a combination of accuracy and
reaction time. A modified version of the NIH Toolbox Rey
Auditory Verbal Learning Test was used as a measure of
episodic memory. Fifteen unrelated words were presented
orally (via audio recording) over three consecutive trials.
After each presentation, participants were asked to recall
as many words as possible and again after a distractor trial,
which included 15 new words. Immediately after recall of
the distractor list, participants were asked to recall as many


of the original 15 words as possible (delayed recall, possible score 0–15), which was the variable of interest.

_Physical outcomes_
Three performance-based measures were used to assess
lower body strength, balance, and walking speed. Chair
stands from the short physical performance battery
(Guralnik et al., 1994) assessed the primary physical outcome of lower body strength. We recorded the time in seconds to complete five chair stands, allowing a maximum of
60 s. The NIH Toolbox Standing Balance measure (Reuben
et al., 2013) assessed static standing balance. Participants
were asked to maintain five poses ranging from standing with feet side by side to a tandem pose. Originally
we planned to use the ratio of poses 4:1, but laptop connectivity problems (i.e., transmission errors between the
accelerometer and the computer accessing the assessment
center) resulted in a large amount of missing data. Here, we
report results for the ratio of poses 2:1. The NIH Toolbox
performance measure of gait speed (Reuben et al., 2013),
which requires participants to walk 4 m at their usual pace,
was used as a measure of walking pace. The faster of two
trials was the variable of interest.

_Health care utilization and costs_
At baseline and 6 months, we collected self-reported health
care utilization over the prior 3 months, in person or by
phone using a modified measure from the Chronic Disease
Self-Management study (Lorig et al., 1996). We assessed
number of visits to a doctor, mental health provider (e.g.,
counselor, psychologist), and other health providers (e.g.,
home health nurse, physical therapist); number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations (number of nights
hospitalized); and number of outpatient surgeries over the
past 3 months. The mean cost per unit of utilization (e.g.,
doctor visit, hospital night) was obtained from an analysis
of the 2014 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey for adults
aged 65 years and older and multiplied by the number of
units used to obtain health care costs. By converting health
care utilization to costs, more weight is given to more costly
services (e.g., hospitalizations and outpatient surgeries) and
the substitution of cheaper services for more expensive services is taken into account.

##### Power Analysis

Original assumptions included intention-to-treat analyses,
80% power, two-tailed alpha of 0.05, _N = 450 enrolled_
patients across 12 senior centers, 80% retention at
6 months (n = 360), casewise deletion of missing data (for
power analysis, only), and linear mixed models of group
differences at 6 months. On the basis of our preliminary
data on choral groups, the largest intracluster correlation
(ICC) for any outcome equaled 0.015. Accounting for ICC,
cluster size, and attrition, the minimum detectable 6-month
standardized group difference, _d, equaled 0.35, which_


-----

compared favorably to effect sizes based upon the results
reported by Cohen and colleagues (2006) for overall health
rating (0.41) and depression (0.38) outcomes. We did not
make alpha adjustments for testing the set of clinically distinct outcomes pertinent to the hypothesized mechanisms
of this multimodal experimental intervention. Such adjustments presume a universal null hypothesis that holds for all
outcomes simultaneously but, because we cannot prespecify which outcome or outcomes may most influence subsequent COV-related policy decisions, the universal null is not
of primary interest (Cook & Farewell, 1996; Cox, 1965;
Perneger, 1998; Rothman, 1990). Instead, we specified a
test-wise error rate to allow marginal inferences. This, in
combination with the reported effect size estimates, should
allow readers to draw conclusions about the impacts of the
COV intervention on the modeled outcomes.

##### Data Analyses

The longitudinal data had a three-level nested structure:
senior centers, participants, and repeated assessments.
Linear mixed models with random intercepts of the cognitive, psychosocial, and most physical functioning outcomes
were fit to the baseline and 6-month outcome assessments
and tested intention-to-treat group, time, and group-bytime effects. The group-by-time interaction was the primary intervention effect test. Model-predicted means are
reported for the cognitive, psychosocial, and most physical
functioning outcomes. Total costs were modeled using a
generalized estimating equation negative binomial model
testing group-by-time interaction effects as the primary
intervention effect test.

#### Results

##### Recruitment and Retention
During the study design phase, 12 senior center clusters
were identified; all 12 clusters were eligible, agreed to participant, were randomized, and completed the study. Study
recruitment took place over 29 months, and details are
reported elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2017). Figure 1 shows
the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram
for participant flow. Briefly, six senior centers were randomized to the choir intervention group and six to the waitlist control group. Within those 12 centers, 636 individuals
began the screening process, and 390 (61%) enrolled in the
study (n = 208 in the choir intervention group and n = 182
in the wait-list control group). The study retention rate at
6 months was 90% for the intervention group and 93% for
the control group (91.5% overall).

Overall, the mean age was 71.3 (SD = 7.2) years; 76% were
female, and 65% reported being from nonwhite (minority)
racial/ethnic backgrounds. Forty-one percent of the sample
was born outside the United States. Approximately one
third was married or living with a partner. A range of education was represented. Financial hardship was reported
by 20%. Approximately 25% reported fair or poor health,
and 60% reported two or more chronic medical conditions. More than half (55%) reported that they had not
previously sung in a choir as an adult, and over half (56%)
rated their musical ability as poor or fair. Demographic
indicators were generally well balanced between groups.

##### Adherence to Intervention and Fidelity

During the first 6 months, participants in the choir intervention group attended an average of 15.4 (SD = 7.5) and
a median of 19 of 23 sessions. Seventy-three percent of participants attended half or more of the sessions, and 58%
attended three quarters or more of the sessions.
Fidelity checks found that the interventionists (directors) met expectations for 99% of musicianship items, 98%
of leadership/communication items, and 83% of intervention program components. Of these, ratings on the physical
engagement domain were lower than for psychosocial and
cognitive components.

##### Intention-to-Treat Results

Table 2 summarizes the intention-to-treat results for baseline and 6-month outcomes. There were no significant
group-by-time differences at 6 months on the three primary outcome measures: PHQ-8, TMT, or chair stands

(ps > .05). However, significant group differences were
found for two of six psychosocial outcomes. There were
significant group-by-time interaction effects for Loneliness
(p = .02; ES = 0.34 and Interest in Life (p = .008, ES = 0.39).
There was a decrease in Loneliness in the intervention group
from baseline to 6 months, whereas the control group did
not differentially change. Interest in Life increased in the
intervention group but not the control group. No significant group differences were observed for cognitive or physical outcomes (ps > .05).

ization and cost measures for the two groups at baseline
and 6 months. Although total costs were similar for the
two groups at baseline ($1,317 for the intervention group
vs $1,300 for the control group), the costs for most services
increased for both groups between baseline and 6 months.
Whereas health care costs for the control group nearly tripled and costs for the intervention group doubled over the
6 month period, the group-by-time interaction effect was
not statistically significant (p = .440).

#### Discussion

The COV trial represents the largest prospective rand

choir intervention on multiple domains of health and
well-being of diverse older adults. The choir intervention
improved two important factors affecting older adults’
well-being: It reduced subjective feelings of loneliness and
increased interest in life. However, cognitive and physical
outcomes and three other psychosocial outcomes (depressive symptoms, anxiety, and positive affect) did not differentially change. Although the control group had nearly
a 50% larger increase in health care costs than the intervention group, the difference was not statistically significant. A hallmark of the study was our ability to enroll and
retain a large sample of diverse racial/ethnic and low-SES
older adults who are typically underrepresented in health
research. Another defining feature of the study was the use
of community-engaged research methods whereby community partners were involved in intervention development
and delivery.
The fact that participation in a choir reduced feelings
of loneliness addresses a serious condition for older adults.
Loneliness, defined as subjective and distressing feelings of
isolation, less than desired amounts of companionship, and
not belonging (Peplau, 1985) is common in older adults
(Mezuk et al., 2016). It is well documented that older adults
who experience feelings of loneliness are at increased risk
for poor psychological well-being, cognitive decline, functional and motor decline, and death (Perissinotto, Cenzer,
& Covinsky, 2012). In our conceptual framework (Johnson
et al., 2015), we hypothesized that participation in a choir
could help reduce loneliness by providing a meaningful and
regular opportunity to meet new people, build social support, and increase one’s sense of belonging. Our findings are
consistent with recent reviews suggesting that opportunities
for building social networks and/or support in a group format, including the arts, could help reduce loneliness among
older adults (Cohen-Mansfield & Perach, 2015). What
remains unclear is whether group singing facilitates social
bonding above and beyond that conferred by other group
activities (e.g., yoga, dancing; Pearce, Launay, Machin, &
Dunbar, 2016). Future research should examine bonding in
group singing and its effects on feelings of loneliness and
isolation in older adults, particularly those from diverse
backgrounds who may have different social networks and
support systems (Smyth, Siriwardhana, Hotopf, & Hatch,
2015).
The COV intervention also increased interest in life
(or reduced apathy). In healthy, nonclinical populations,
apathy has been conceptualized as a reduction in goaldirected behaviors and loss of motivation (Bonnelle,
Manohar, Behrens, & Husain, 2016). This is relatively
common among community-dwelling older adults
(Brodaty, Altendorf, Withall, & Sachdev, 2010) and is
associated with incident cardiovascular disease, executive
dysfunction, and changes in frontal lobe brain connectivity
(Eurelings et al., 2014; Kawagoe, Onoda, & Yamaguchi,
2017). In our conceptual framework, we hypothesized that
singing in a choir could increase interest in life by having

for a regular activity. Several studies have found that participation in regular, structured activities as an older adult
is associated with a reduced risk for cognitive decline,
dementia, and functional decline (Stern & Munn, 2010;
Verghese et al., 2003), but only a few studies involve diverse older adults (Wilson et al., 2003). Several studies suggest that older Latinos and blacks engage less frequently
in activities than non-Latino whites (Herrera et al., 2011;
Marquine, Segawa, Wilson, Bennett, & Barnes, 2012). In
low-resourced communities, access to regular activities is
important for older adults to remain active and engaged in
their community, and participation in a choir could offer
such opportunities.
We did not find significant group differences on physical
or cognitive outcomes and discuss three possible explanations. First, it is possible that the physical and cognitive
outcome measures selected for the study were not sensitive
enough to detect change within the study follow-up interval
or were not measuring the types of physical or cognitive


changes that may have occurred as a result of the intervention. The outcome measures in the current trial were modeled after other behavioral trials for older adults, including
choirs. Second, participating in weekly 90-min sessions
may not be a strong enough “dose” to affect cognitive and
physical function of older adults, or it may take longer time
periods for choir participation to affect physical and cognitive domains. Although we designed the COV intervention
to be more engaging than typical choirs for older adults
(e.g., sing-alongs) by requiring activities that involved increasingly challenging engagement, it is possible that the
physical and cognitive engagement was not intense enough
to produce changes in these domains. Perhaps offering a
choir more than once a week along with daily singing tasks
would be sufficient to achieve cognitive and physical maintenance or improvement. Further, the prevention of cognitive and physical decline has been difficult to document, for
example, such as in studies of late-life engagement in other
activities (e.g., cognitive training, physical activity, piano


-----

playing; de Souto Barreto, Demougeot, Vellas, & Rolland,
2018; Butler et al., 2018; Schneider, Hunter, & Bardach,
2018). A third possible explanation is that the physical engagement activities, which were less familiar to music professionals, were the most inconsistently applied. Although
choir directors completed training on each of the choir
intervention components, more intensive training may be
needed on physical engagement components.
Other multimodal interventions have also been evaluated. The Experience Corps intervention was similar to
our choir intervention in that it aimed to simultaneously
increase the social, physical, and cognitive engagement of
the diverse older adults who volunteered in schools (Fried
et al., 2013). Compared to low-intensity volunteering,
older adults who were randomized to the intensive intergenerational volunteering intervention over two academic
years experienced short-term improvements in executive
function, increased walking activity, and enhancements in
perceptions of generative desire and achievement (Carlson
et al., 2009; Gruenewald et al., 2016; Varma et al., 2016)
Importantly, the intervention required 15 hr/week of
involvement over 2 years, which was more intense than our
choir intervention. Interventions combining components
such as physical activity, diet, and cognitive training have
also been examined, but a recent report concluded that
the evidence was insufficient to conclude that they benefit
cognition (Kane et al., 2017). However, a large, long-term
randomized multimodal intervention of diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk monitoring documented
cognitive improvements after 2 years in at-risk older adults
(Ngandu et al., 2015). It is possible that interventions aimed
at improving cognition require sustained training periods.
Regarding costs, similar to the study by Coulton and
colleagues (2015), we observed increased health care costs
over time in both the choir intervention and control groups.
It is difficult to know if rising costs reflect appropriate utilization (e.g., increased use and more intensive care because
of chronic disease progression) or more care regardless of
the need for care. Coulton and colleagues combined health
and social care costs and did not find group differences in
costs 3 months after their 14-week choir program ended.
There are some limitations of our study. Although the
randomization assignment was kept confidential until all
baseline assessments were completed at each pair of sites,
intervention group assignment was known once the intervention began. Similar to most other choir studies, our
study had a predominance of women. Further, our study
was one of the early adopters of the NIH Toolbox in both
Spanish and English, and we encountered some technical
challenges in collecting data at senior centers. Nonetheless,
its use resulted in more efficient administration because of
computer-assisted testing and item response theory methods and reduced time for data entry.
In addition to being one of the first arts-based randomized trials for older adults, our pragmatic trial represents a new direction in translational research designed


to address health disparities in which interventions are
designed and evaluated in community settings from the outset (Napoles et al., 2013). First, the intervention was delivered in the community (at senior centers) by community
music professionals. This approach optimizes the cultural
relevance of the choir at each site and increases the likelihood of sustainability given that the choir was embedded
in the community from the start. Second, study recruitment
was conducted entirely in the community at senior centers,
an approach that facilitated recruitment of an underrepresented population (Johnson et al., 2017), similar to other
studies (Napoles & Chadiha, 2011; Santoyo-Olsson et al.,
2011). Third, all study assessments were conducted at the
senior centers, making participation in the research convenient for participants and likely contributing to the excellent retention rate. These study methods can be a model
for future trials to engage and retain diverse older adults in
research. Conducting this trial in existing community settings moves the program further along on the translation
continuum.
Our findings that singing in a choir can reduce feelings
of loneliness and increase interest in life among diverse
older adults have important public health implications.
Community choirs are typically affordable, sustainable,
and accessible, and can be culturally tailored, making them
relevant and useful for helping to reduce health disparities
among diverse older adults who are more likely to experience financial hardship and live in low-resourced communities compared with white older adults. Future research
can focus on identifying novel mechanisms and measures to
assess more nuanced impacts of community choirs on older
adults’ well-being.
