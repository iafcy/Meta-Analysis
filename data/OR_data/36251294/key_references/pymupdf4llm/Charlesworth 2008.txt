##### NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme

he Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme, part of the National Institute for Health
Research (NIHR), was set up in 1993. It produces high-quality research information on the
## T
effectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide
care in the NHS. ‘Health technologies’ are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health,
prevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care.
The research findings from the HTA Programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee
(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that
they form a key component of the ‘National Knowledge Service’.
The HTA Programme is needs-led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are
three routes to the start of projects.
First is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the
NHS, the public and consumer groups and professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS trusts.
These suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service
users). The HTA Programme then commissions the research by competitive tender.
Secondly, the HTA Programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research
questions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.
Thirdly, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA Programme
commissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring
together evidence on the value of specific technologies.
Some HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They can
cost from as little as £40,000 to over £1 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence,
undertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.
The final reports from HTA projects are peer-reviewed by a number of independent expert referees
before publication in the widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment.


**Criteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series**
Reports are published in the HTA journal series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA
Programme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and editors.
Reviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed ‘systematic’ when the account of the search,
appraisal and synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the
replication of the review by others.

**Objectives: To determine whether a social support**
intervention (access to an employed befriending
facilitator in addition to usual care) is effective
compared with usual care alone. Also to document
direct and indirect costs, and establish incremental
cost-effectiveness.
**Design: The Befriending and Costs of Caring (BECCA)**
trial was a cost-effectiveness randomised controlled
trial. Data on well-being and resource use were
collected through interviews with participants at
baseline and at 6, 15 and 24 months.
**Setting: This research was carried out in the English**
counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, and the London
Borough of Havering. It was a community-based study.
**Participants: Participants were family carers who**
were cohabiting with, or providing at least 20 hours’
care per week for, a community-dwelling relative with
a primary progressive dementia.
**Interventions: The intervention was ‘access to a**
befriender facilitator’ (BF). BFs, based with charitable/
voluntary-sector organisations, were responsible for
local befriending schemes, including recruitment,
screening, training and ongoing support of befriending
volunteers, and for matching carers with befrienders.
The role of befrienders was to provide emotional
support for carers. The target duration for befriending
relationships was 6 months or more.
**Main outcome measures: Depression was measured**
by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
at 15 months postrandomisation. The health-related
quality of life scale EQ-5D (EuroQol 5 Dimensions) was
used to derive utilities for the calculation of qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs).


**Results: A total of 236 carers were randomised into**
the trial (116 intervention; 120 control). At final
follow-up, 190 carers (93 intervention; 97 control) were
still involved in the trial (19% attrition). There was no
evidence of effectiveness or cost-effectiveness from the
primary analyses on the intention-to-treat population.
The mean incremental cost per incremental QALY
gained was in excess of £100,000, with only a 42.2%
probability of being below £30,000 per QALY gained.
Where care-recipient QALYs were included, mean
incremental cost per incremental QALY gained was
£26,848, with a 51.4% probability of being below
£30,000 per QALY gained. Only 60 carers (52%) took
up the offer of being matched with a trained lay
befriender, and of these only 37 (32%) were befriended
for 6 months or more. A subgroup analysis of controls
versus those befriended for 6 months or more found a
reduction in HADS-depression scores that approached
statistical significance (95% CI –0.09 to 2.84).
**Conclusions: ‘Access to a befriender facilitator’ is**
neither an effective nor a cost-effective intervention in
the support of carers of people with dementia,
although there is a suggestion of cost-effectiveness for
the care dyad (carer and care recipient). In common
with many services for carers of people with dementia,
uptake of befriending services was not high. However,
the small number of carers who engaged with
befrienders for 6 months or more reported a reduction
in scores on HADS depression that approached
statistical significance compared with controls
(95% CI –0.09 to 2.84). While providing only weak
evidence of any beneficial effect, further research into
befriending interventions for carers is warranted. **iii**

###### Implications for healthcare
Volunteers can be safely involved in the provision
of emotional support for carers. When considering
commissioning support services for carers of
people with dementia, befriending schemes alone
should not be commissioned, and short-term
contracts should not be considered.

 Introduction


###### Background


This study was a response to a call for bids from
the NHS Health Technology Assessment (HTA)
Programme for research into ‘support for carers of
people with dementia’. The call was made in the
context of increased recognition of the needs of
carers and the associated UK government
legislation and initiatives such as the Carers
(Recognition and Services) Act 1995[1] and the
National Strategy for Carers,[2] and in the National
Service Frameworks for Mental Health[3] and for
Older People.[4] The needs of carers of people with
dementia were highlighted as a particular
concern, with there being perceived deficiencies in
the evidence base, especially in terms of evidence
on cost-effectiveness.

It is estimated that there are around 6.8 million
adult carers in the UK, with up to 1.5 million
people involved in caring for a relative or friend
with a mental illness or some form of dementia.[5]

Dementia is an umbrella term encompassing a
broad range of cognitive losses, usually including
multiple deficits in aspects of memory, expressive
and/or receptive language, perception and
executive function. Dementia is the consequence
of a large number of progressive brain disorders,
the most common being Alzheimer’s disease and
vascular dementias. The prevalence of dementia
depends greatly on the age structure of the
population and for UK the prevalence rates are
2% in the 65–70 age group; 5% in the 70–80 age
group and 20% in the over-80 age group
(Alzheimer’s Society, UK). It is estimated that
there are currently over 750,000 people in the UK
with dementia,[4] which may increase to 840,000 by
2026 and 1.2 million by 2050.[4]

Dementias are long-term, pervasive illnesses,
affecting all aspects of a person’s life. The person
with dementia (PwD) becomes increasingly
dependent on those around them, most usually
their spouse or other family members. It is widely
accepted that providing care for a person with
dementia is stressful and demanding, and research
has provided evidence on the poorer physical and
mental health of carers compared with noncarers.[6,7] In addition, there is some evidence that


carers who experience caring as stressful are at
higher risk of mortality than non-carers.[8]

###### Social consequences of caring

The association between social support and wellbeing is well established for both physical and
mental health,[9,10] with low levels of support being
associated with poorer health. Family carers can
experience a reduction in their social network
owing to a lack of opportunities to socialise and/or
the stigma associated with illness. Carers report
less social interaction and fewer friendships.[11,12]

The emotional and physical burden of caring can
result in family role conflicts that may reduce the
amount of emotional support available. A carer’s
family and friends may distance themselves
physically and/or psychologically from the carer
and care recipient, contributing to a reduction in
social support for the carer.[11–13]

Given the commitment involved in caring for a
relative with increasing levels of cognitive
impairment and dependency, carers of people
with dementia may be particularly at risk of social
isolation. Carers who experience social isolation are
more vulnerable to the negative impacts of caring.[13]

Social isolation is a risk factor for loneliness, and
loneliness has been associated with increased
mortality and morbidity, including psychiatric
morbidity. Protective factors are thought to include
companionship[14] and long-standing friendships,
especially for women, and where the friendship is
based on choice and not obligation.[15]

###### Support provision

Support provision for family carers in the UK is
part of a mixed economy of care in which
statutory, private and voluntary sectors provide
community services in addition to the support
given by family and friends. Britain has a long
tradition of voluntary action, and the emphasis on
partnership in recent government policies has
given voluntary, community and user organisations
a more central role in the delivery of services.[16,17]


###### 1


-----

At the same time, social service departments have
been encouraged to develop local markets in care
by providing fewer direct care services themselves
and commissioning independent service
providers.[18] Local authority welfare provision in
England is organised to prioritise instrumental
needs within a system of case management in
which needs are assessed, care packages are set up
and cases are discharged. Such procedure-based
care management systems prevent the formation
of sustained relationships.[19] As Community Mental
Health Teams integrate the working practice of
the NHS and Social Services and move towards an
‘assess and discharge’ model, it can be voluntary
and charitable sector workers who provide longterm support. For carers of PwD, emotional
support may have a greater influence on the
course of stressors than instrumental support.[20]

###### Psychosocial interventions

A range of psychosocial interventions has been
developed to support carers, including, but not
limited to, the provision of accessible and relevant
information on available services, education and
training programmes, access to support groups,
short-term breaks, and interventions targeted at
the whole family, such as family therapy and
family counselling.

Evaluations of carer interventions have been
extensively reviewed. Schulz and colleagues[21]

identified nine systematic reviews prior to their
own. The varying methodologies used for the
systematic review have led to significant
differences in conclusions about the quantity and
quality of research,[22] yet there is consensus that
carer intervention research has historically been of
questionable quality, and that poor study design
has contributed to inconclusive findings.
Interventions showing greatest impact have
generally been comprehensive and intensive.[23]

Cognitive behavioural interventions have been
shown to be effective in reducing carer stress,[24]


paraprofessionals, such as clergy and family
doctors, are roughly the same as those of
professional, formal helping, carried out by
psychiatrists and psychologists.

A range of social support interventions has been
devised and evaluated, but reviews of the evidence
base of social support interventions generally
highlight a lack of methodological rigour.[27–29]

Within the voluntary sector, a commonly used
model of social support is ‘befriending’. There are
many befriending schemes in the UK, most
particularly in the voluntary and charitable sector.
The role of befrienders varies widely from project
to project, and the characteristics of the
befrienders also vary, including both volunteers
and paid staff. Befriending has the potential to
foster friendship, with the reciprocities entailed in
this[30,31] and concomitant gains experienced by
peer-befrienders.[32] For befriendees, a volunteer
visit may be experienced as very different from
that of a professional, perhaps without fear of
institutional intervention in their family or care
choices, which may be especially welcomed by
older people trying to maintain their
independence. In addition, empathic, nondirective befriending was as effective as structured
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in the short
term for people with treatment-resistant
schizophrenia,[33] although CBT was superior at
9-month follow-up. An analysis of session content
indicated that the befriending was distinct from
CBT, and a conclusion was drawn that social
support is “no mere placebo”.[34]

During protocol development for the Befriending
and Costs of Caring (BECCA) project, a literature
search was undertaken for befriending schemes for
family carers of people with dementia. No
quantitative research trials were found for the use
of befriending volunteers to support carers. The
closest trial was Harris and colleagues,[35]

###### Cost-effectiveness of support for carers

The Carers Special Grant was established to
support the implementation of the National
Carers Strategy, with ring-fenced funding of £140
million made available to local authorities to help
them to develop a wider range of services to give
carers a break from their caring responsibilities.
However, there is evidence for managers wishing
to commission cost-effective interventions.


In an RCT, Patel and colleagues[39] evaluated the
cost-effectiveness of a training programme for
carers of stroke patients and found that costs were
significantly lower in the training group, while
improving overall quality of life of carers at 1 year.
Similarly, the economic evaluation of a training
programme for carers of people with dementia[40]

reported cost savings of Aus $7967 (US $5975) per
patient, with improved patient survival at home
and decreased carer morbidity. Drummond and
colleagues[41] evaluated a support programme for
carers (RCT) which showed improved quality of
life with incremental cost per quality-adjusted lifeyear (QALY) gained of Can $20,000. The
evaluation of a daily living programme (RCT) by
Knapp and colleagues[42] found that it was more
cost-effective than hospital-based care. Similarly,
Donaldson and Gregson[43] reported that a
community support intervention resulted in
prolonged life at home for the elderly and
concluded that the intervention will be costeffective if the cost of long-term institutional care
averted is included in the calculations. Payton and
colleagues,[44] in their cost analysis of a community
health information network for carers of people
with Alzheimer’s disease, concluded that it
provides social and economic benefit to their
users.

###### Economic methods in carer intervention evaluations

The cost-effectiveness literature for carers has used
a range of costing methodologies and there is
presently no consensus. Considerations include:
whether to cost for the carer, care recipient or
both; whether to take cross-sectional snapshots of
service receipt or try to build up a longitudinal
picture of costs; and costing informal care.

Options for costing informal care include: the
market price method, the contingent valuation
method and the opportunity cost method.[45]

Theoretical and practical challenges of evaluating


carer time have previously been acknowledged.[46]

Wimo and colleagues[47] recommend that the
valuation be based on the opportunity costs of
time sacrificed on each type of time-use. This
would necessitate data collection on the specific
nature of time sacrificed; for example, time spent
in caring, nursing and supervision; loss of time in
work; and impact on leisure activities.
Distinguishing between ‘care activities’ and
‘normal household duties’ can be especially
challenging for spouse carers where the carer is
also the person who has had a long-term
responsibility for the domestic household duties.

From a societal perspective, the value of informal
care may be recognised by considering the cost of
its replacement. Should individuals be unwilling
or unable to undertake the role of carer, society
would have little choice but to fund formal care.
This would involve diverting resources away from
other uses; the opportunity cost of those resources
– the forgone benefit – determines the cost of
informal care. The value of the resources diverted
is a measure of the cost of informal care and is
known as ‘replacement cost’. From the perspective
of the individual carer, the opportunity cost of
caring may be understood in terms of the
alternatives forgone as a result of taking on this
role, which may include employment
opportunities, other unpaid work, such as caring
for other family members, and leisure activities,
including holidays, social activities and relaxation.
Whether employment opportunities should be
valued is the subject of considerable debate and
scepticism,[48] as inclusion of economically active
individuals’ time will be valued more highly than
the time of those who are economically inactive,
and this may lead to an exacerbation of existing
inequalities in the provision of care or support.

###### Summary

Family carers of people with dementia report high
burden and stress. Demands of time and lack of
understanding among family and friends can lead
to reduced social contact and social supports. A
wide range of psychosocial interventions has been
devised, including one-to-one social support
interventions such as befriending, but no rigorous
studies of cost-effectiveness exist for befriending.

###### Aim and objectives


The aim of this report is to address this gap in the
evidence base by evaluating the cost-effectiveness **3**


-----

of befriending schemes for carers of people with
dementia alongside an RCT. The objectives of the
trial were as follows.

- To determine whether a social support
intervention (access to an employed befriending
facilitator in addition to usual care) is effective
compared with usual care alone, through
randomly allocating carers of people with


dementia to one of two groups (intervention
versus usual care control) and follow-up for
2 years postrandomisation.

- To document direct and indirect costs in both
the intervention and control groups, and to
establish incremental cost-effectiveness,
calculating the costs from the perspectives of
the statutory and voluntary sectors and from a
societal perspective.

 Methods


###### Design


An RCT design was used to compare usual care
plus a social support intervention [access to a
befriender facilitator (BF)] with control (usual care)
for carers of people with dementia. Data collection
points were at 6, 15 and 24 months from the date
of randomisation, with the main end-point being at
15 months. The primary perspective of the
economic evaluation was societal.

###### Ethics approval

A protocol was submitted for ethical scrutiny by
the multisite research ethics committee (MREC) in
2001. The submission described the methodology
approved by peer reviewers for the HTA
programme, and included a Zelen randomisation
procedure. The protocol was rejected on the
grounds of the Zelen design, and also concerns for
the safety of carers put in contact with lay
intervention providers. The proposed
methodology was revised to use a standard RCT
design, and with additional information on the
recommended good practice for the involvement
of volunteers in the provision of heath and social
care. Ethical approval was received in November
2001 with the proviso that a pilot be carried out in
not more than three local research ethics
committee (LREC) districts before the
implementation of the full trial. The aim of the
pilot was to ensure that procedures for the
research interviews and befriending scheme were
feasible and appropriate. LREC approval was
subsequently received from all five LRECs in
Norfolk and Suffolk, plus the London Borough of
Havering. Trust research and development (R&D)
approval was also sought where recruitment was
planned within secondary care, and from primary
care groupings that had R&D approval procedures
during the recruitment phase of the trial.

There were consent procedures for both family
carers and potential befriending volunteers. The
PwD was not involved in interviews and was not
the intended recipient of the befriending
intervention, and was not therefore involved in the
consent procedures.


###### Intervention and control conditions


The befriending schemes were organised and
administered separately from the research
interviews. The befriending intervention
comprised access to an employed BF, and the
offer of contact with a trained volunteer
befriender for the duration of the befriending
schemes. The expectation was that befriending
visits by the trained volunteer befrienders would
be weekly home visits (dose) for at least 6 months
(duration), with variations in location, duration
and frequency of contact negotiated as necessary
by each carer–volunteer pairing, overseen by
the BF.

The remit of the befriending volunteers was to
provide companionship and conversation. Their
role was to be a listening ear; that is, to provide
emotional support to the carer. Some
informational support or ‘signposting’ was also
permissible in appropriate circumstances. The
boundaries of the role specifically excluded giving
advice and carrying out practical caring tasks that
would otherwise be carried out by a paid worker
such as a nurse or home care worker. Further
details of the befriending intervention are given in
Chapter 3.

The intervention was offered as an addition to
usual care, and was not a replacement for any
other service (health, social or voluntary). In the
study areas, typical health services for the care
recipient included diagnostic clinics for memory
impairment and dementia (memory clinics) and
community support for challenging behaviours
through community psychiatric nurses (CPNs).
Typical social services for carers included shortterm and longer term respite in the form of day
centres and residential or nursing home stays,
and assistance with washing, dressing and eating
for more dependent care recipients. Typical
voluntary sector provision included carer
information and support groups, and luncheon
clubs. All carers randomised into the trial were
sent locally relevant information on services for
caring for people with dementia by the research
interviewer.

All recruiters were briefed on the inclusion and
exclusion criteria for the trial, and the importance
of avoiding inappropriate approaches (e.g. to
family members who are unaware of their
relative’s suspected diagnosis) was emphasised.
All used standard letters of invitation and
approved participant information leaflets.
Potential participants expressed their interest in
participating in the research by completing and
returning a response form in a prepaid envelope
to the researchers. Recruitment strategies were
kept under continuous review, including
monitoring of productivity.

Following receipt of a response form (expression of
interest), research associates made contact with
carers by telephone (or e-mail if this was requested)
to provide further information about the trial, and
where appropriate to carry out initial screening.
The purpose of the initial screening was to check
eligibility (see the section ‘Eligibility criteria’, p. 6).

For eligible carers who expressed continued
interest after this initial contact, arrangements
were made for a face-to-face interview. Times and
venues for face-to-face interviews were organised
as flexibly as possible to accommodate
interviewees’ caring responsibilities. All contact
with carers aimed to be sensitive to their needs,
and appropriately responsive to disclosure of
circumstances that present significant risk to the
well-being of the carer or care recipient (e.g.
abuse, suicidal or homicidal intent). Constraints
such as pressures on carers’ time and transport
difficulties were acknowledged. The importance of
considering transportation has also been
highlighted in previous recruitment literature. For
this project, it was anticipated that most carers
would prefer home visits, or interviews based at a
neutral location within their locality, rather than
travel to a research base. Therefore, the study
protocol and budget included transport costs for


###### Implementation
After obtaining informed consent and completing
a baseline interview, the interviewer put forward
the carer’s ID number to the trial administrator.
The administrator assigned the carer to **7**


interviewers to travel throughout the counties on a
regular basis. Interviewers endeavoured to meet
all carers’ preferences for days and times of day.

Once carers had contacted the research team
expressing interest in participation, they were
contacted by telephone, given the opportunity to
ask questions, and sent a full information booklet.
Written consent was taken at the first face-to-face
interview, after researchers had given an oral
overview of the trial and answered any questions
on the content of the information booklet.
Information about the trial clearly explained
randomisation, and made it clear to participants
that they were free to withdraw at any time without
giving a reason and without this affecting the
services available to the current or future carer, or
the care recipient.

###### Randomisation

 Sequence generation
Randomisation lists were drawn up by the trial
statistician. Randomisation was stratified by
kinship between carer and PwD (either vertical or
horizontal) and also by region of residence (urban
or rural). Blocked randomisation (block length of
six) was used. For the stratification by kinship,
spouses, long-term partners, cousins of the same
generation and siblings were designated a
‘horizontal bond’, whereas adult offspring (sons
and daughters) and sons- and daughters-in-law
were classified as having a ‘vertical bond’. It was
anticipated that this stratification for kinship
would increase the likelihood of the two groups
matching in terms of gender balance and age,
since adult children carers are more commonly
women, whereas there is a more even gender
balance among spouse carers. Urban and rural
areas were classified on the basis of population
density, with densities of 10,000 per km[2] and
above classified as urban.

related to caring (e.g. ‘It is physically tiring’, ‘The
person I care for can demand too much of me’).
Frequencies of experiences were indicated on a
three-point scale from 1 = never applies to me to
3 = always applies to me. Cronbach’s � was 0.89.

###### Relationship quality
The quality of premorbid relationship was assessed
using a single five-point scale (0 = very poor,
2 = neither good nor bad, 4 = very good), and
also with the ten-item Mutual Communal
Behaviours Scale (MCBS),[60] which measures the
responsiveness between the carer and care
recipient before the onset of illness. The frequency
of each behaviour was rated using a four-point
scale from 1 = never to 4 = always. A principal
components analysis for this study identified two
five-item factors (oblimin rotation) with
eigenvalues of 5.34 and 1.53, explaining 69% of
the variance. All items loaded highly, with factor
loadings of 0.7 and above. The first factor
contained the five items evaluating the care
recipient’s communal behaviour towards the carer
(e.g. ‘They seemed to enjoy responding to my
needs’, ‘They did things just to please me’) and
the second factor containing all items concerning
the carer’s communal behaviour towards the care
recipient (e.g. ‘If they were feeling bad, I tried to
cheer him/her up’, ‘When they had a need, he/she
turned to me for help’). Cronbach’s � for the two
subscales was 0.91 and 0.84, respectively.

Perceived loss of companionship was assessed
using a three-item scale by Aneshensel and
colleagues.[20] Each item (‘How much have you lost
being able to confide?’ ‘How much have you lost
the person that you used to know?’ ‘How much
have you lost having someone who knew you
well?’) was rated on a four-point scale from
1 = completely to 4 = not at all, giving a range of
3–12, with lower scores indicating the greater
perceived loss. However, for ease of interpretation
of results, items were recoded such that higher
scores indicate greater perceived loss. A principal
components analysis on data from carers in this
study indicated that all three items loaded heavily
on one factor (loadings ranged from 0.82 to 0.89)
and accounted for 73.5% of the variance.
Reliability of the scale, as indicated by Cronbach’s
� was 0.81.

###### Social support
The Practitioner Assessment of Network Type
(PANT) scale,[61] which consists of eight
items/questions (e.g. ‘If you have any children
where does your nearest child live?’ ‘How often do


you see any of your neighbours to have a chat or
do something with?’), was developed to identify
social support network type. The instrument has
been found to correlate highly with a range of
demographic variables, level of service use and
response to interventions. Items from the Network
Typology questionnaire were also used to construct
a social isolation index akin to that of Scharf and
Smith,[62] summarising contact with family, friends
and neighbours. The index provided a measure of
social isolation ranging from 0 = not isolated to
3 = extremely isolated (no contact with family,
friends or neighbours).

The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social
Support (MSPSS)[63] is a 12-item measure assessing
perceived social support. Each item is rated on a
five-point Likert-type scale ranging from
1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. The
scale was developed to assess perceived social
support in relation to the family (e.g. ‘My family
really tries to help me’, ‘I can talk about my
problems with my family’), friends (e.g. ‘I can
count on my friends when things go wrong’,
‘I have friends with whom I can share my joys and
sorrows’) and significant other (e.g. ‘There is a
special person who is around when I am in need’,
‘I have a special person who is a real source of
comfort to me’) source of support, which form the
three subscales of the measure. Strong
psychometric properties of the measure have been
documented previously, including test–retest
reliability, with correlation coefficients of r = 0.73
for the full scale, r = 0.73 for the friends subscale,
_r = 0.74 for the family subscale and r = 0.54 for_
the significant other subscale.[64] Cronbach’s � in
this study was 0.92, 0.89 and 0.87 for the family,
friends and significant other subscales,
respectively.


###### Coping
The Brief Coping Orientation for Problem
Experience (COPE)[65] is a 28-item measure for
multidimensional assessment of coping. Active
coping includes the subscales acceptance,
emotional support, religion, active coping,
planning and positive reframing. Avoidance
coping includes the subscales self-distraction,
venting, humour, denial, behavioural
disengagement and substance use. Items (e.g. ‘I’ve
been turning to work or other activities to take my
mind off things’, ‘I’ve been saying to myself “this
isn’t real”’) assess responses of individuals when
confronted with difficult or stressful situations and
are scored on a four-point Likert-type scale
ranging from 1 = don’t do this at all to 4 = do
this a lot. **9**

were organised, for example GP surgeries, health
centres, or voluntary-sector or university meeting
rooms. Where the carer moved away from the
catchment area after randomisation, a telephone
interview was developed for the resource-use data
collection, and psychometric measures were either
completed over the telephone, or posted to carers
with a return envelope. Over the course of the
trial, it became standard procedure for follow-up
psychometric questionnaires to be posted out to
participants with letters confirming the
arrangements for follow-up interview, thus giving
carers the option of precompleting all or part of
the questionnaire, or waiting to complete with the
researcher.

###### Data checking

Data were entered into the Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 12.0.2; SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA, 2003) and accuracy checks were
carried out. Subscale scores for psychometric
measures were both handscored and calculated by
SPSS as part of error checking. Other data checks
for the psychometric data included checks for outof-range values. A proportion of the resource-use
interview scripts was checked by the lead
economics researcher and a second researcher,
with any queries resolved with the main project
researchers.

###### Data analysis

 Missing data
The proportion of missing psychometric data was
generally low (less than 5%), with greater missing
data for earlier rather than later interviews. No
psychometric scale or subscale was missing for
more than 10% of data from interviewer
participants. Where individual items were missing
within scales or subscales, data were imputed
before calculation of the scale or subscale score.
For the resource-use data, where five or fewer of
the 136 cost data items were missing, or two or
fewer of the utility items were missing, data were
imputed using Rubin’s multiple imputation
method.[73]

###### Baseline characteristics
As is now recommended,[74] no formal tests were
carried out for significant differences in baseline
characteristics between the study groups. Data
were tabulated for intervention, control and whole
sample for both demographic and clinical
variables.


###### Primary effectiveness analysis
The psychometric data were transferred to SAS
software for outcome analysis. The intervention
group carers were compared with control on the
HADS depression scale at 6, 15 and 24 months,
using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.
Unadjusted analysis was based on a pooled t-test,
and the adjusted analysis based on a generalised
linear model (GLM) with baseline HADS depression
score and stratification categories (urban/rural
location; horizontal/vertical kinship) as covariates.

###### Secondary effectiveness analyses
The method used for the primary analysis was
repeated for the secondary measures of HADS
anxiety, loneliness, positive affectivity and the
global VAS of the EQ-5D. In addition, the
proportion of PwD still in home care compared
with those institutionalised was compared between
groups.

###### Subgroup analyses
The primary analysis was repeated on a perprotocol basis (i.e. removing those carers from the
intervention group who were not matched with a
befriender for at least 6 months and those carers
in the control group who ended up matched with
a befriender) and also looking at spouse carers
only (carers in a horizontal kinship relationship).

###### Economic analyses

 Valuing resource use
The chosen price year was 2005. Resource-use data
were multiplied by national unit costs obtained from
routine NHS and other data sources such as the
national schedule of reference costs. Drug prices
were obtained from the British National Formulary.
Where unit cost data were not readily available, costs
were obtained directly from the relevant agency or
estimated separately. Time spent by carers, friends
and family in caring for their relative was valued at
average UK gross income rates for 2005, derived
from Office for National Statistics (ONS). Unit cost
data are listed in Appendix 2.

###### Discounting costs
It is conventional to discount costs (and outcomes)
incurred more than 1 year in the future to their
‘present value’. However, it was not possible to
identify which costs in the 15-month follow-up
data set had been incurred after the 12-month
cut-off point. Not discounting costs incurred
between 12 and 15 months is unlikely to have a
great impact on the results of this analysis, and
therefore no attempt was made to do so. Costs **11**


-----

###### 12


incurred and QALYs accrued between 15 and
24 months were discounted at 3.5%.

###### Primary economic analysis
An economic evaluation was performed from the
perspective of society comparing costs with the
QALYs gained by carers in intervention versus
control after 15 months’ follow-up. The EQ-5D
health profiles were converted to utilities using UK
general population valuations,[75] and thence to
QALYs over the period measured.[76]

To compare costs and effects, an incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated,
comparing the difference (increment) in costs with
the difference in QALYs gained in each arm of the
study. The ratio states the cost of buying one
extra QALY by enacting the befriending strategy
compared with no befriending. Typically, the NHS
is willing to pay up to £20,000–30,000 for a
QALY.[77] Thus, if the ICER is below this threshold,
befriending may be considered good value for
money. If it is above this, it may be considered
poor value for money.

_C2 – C1_

ICER =

_E2 – E1_

where C2 is cost per carer–PwD in the befriending
arm, C1 is cost per carer–PwD in the control arm,
_E2 = QALYs gained by carer in the befriending_
arm, and E2 = QALYs gained by carer in the
control arm.

Mean costs and QALYs gained in the intervention
and control arms were calculated from trial
observations. A non-parametric bootstrap approach
of 1000 replications was used to construct
distributions around the mean costs and QALYs
gained in each arm. The simulations are used to
construct 95% confidence intervals (CIs) resulting
around mean difference in cost and QALYs
between the arms, and the ICERs used to construct
a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC).[76]

###### Alternative economic scenarios
Further analyses were performed to consider the
cost-effectiveness of the intervention within
different scenarios.

**_Varying the perspective_**
The base case was societal, but within that there
are different sectors:

- the statutory sector (NHS, social services and
other government-funded services)

- the voluntary sector

- the household sector.

### Chapter 3

 Intervention


n this chapter the development and
implementation of the befriending intervention
## I
are described in detail.

###### Definition of befriending

Befriending is a form of social support where a
supportive other is introduced to, or matched with
an individual who would otherwise be socially
isolated. The term ‘befriending’ has been used to
describe a range of interventions from emotional
support to tangible assistance. In the initial
protocol for this trial, befriending was
conceptualised as offering emotional,
informational and practical support. However,
through consultation with the potential local
providers, the definition of befriending and the
planned content of the intervention were
amended to focus on the provision of emotional
support and also, where appropriate, some
‘signposting’ to information and services. The role
did not encompass instrumental support (handson caring, DIY, shopping, etc.) or advice. That is,
befriending comprised companionship and
conversation rather than instrumental support or
activities that aimed to increase community
participation.

###### Development of the BECCA befriending schemes

The BECCA project was devised at the University
of East Anglia (UEA) in the city of Norwich
(population 120,000) in the county of Norfolk
(population 800,000), to take place in Norfolk and
the adjoining county of Suffolk (population
700,000). The physical size of the two counties
made it unfeasible to have a single scheme, and
there were no voluntary organisations spanning
both Norfolk and Suffolk that could support a
suitable befriending scheme. Discussions were held
between representatives of the research team (GC
and FP) and the Alzheimer’s Society’s national
office to determine ways in which the befriending
intervention could be set up and managed.
Various options were considered, and it was
decided that the only feasible option was for a


number of small befriending schemes to be set up
on a locality basis, with multiple BFs employed by
separate organisations, each of which had
experience of providing befriending services. As
Norwich and its surrounding areas had been
identified as the pilot area, further discussions
were held with community organisations within
the voluntary organisations in Norwich. It was
agreed that the first scheme would be hosted by
Norwich and Norfolk Voluntary Services (NVS),
and a contract was drawn up between UEA and
NVS. Following this agreement, and during the
process of recruiting to the post of BF, several
consultation meetings were held with key
stakeholders, with the remit of deciding the
appropriate policies and procedures for ensuring
the safe involvement of both carers and volunteers
in the befriending scheme. Once procedures for
recruitment, training and matching of volunteers
were in place in Norwich, the scheme was
extended to other areas of Norfolk overseen by
the same BF. In addition, two further schemes
were set up, one with Age Concern Suffolk (ACS)
and the smallest with Age Concern Havering
(ACH). Consistent with arrangements for the
initial Norwich scheme, the BFs were jointly
managed by the operations manager from the
‘host’ organisation and the BECCA grantholder
with responsibility for managing the befriending
intervention (designated ‘intervention manager’).

The contracted host voluntary organisations (NVS,
ACS, ACH) agreed to employ a part-time BF, and
jointly manage the post with the UEA-based trial
intervention manager; register all potential
volunteer befrienders in their area, taking
informed consent for the volunteers’ involvement
in the BECCA research trial; take up references;
facilitate Criminal Records Bureau (CRB)
disclosures; provide public liability and personal
accident insurance; provide BECCA training for
volunteers including details of the Code of
Conduct and Statement of Confidentiality; and
provide ongoing support for the BF and all
registered BECCA volunteers. They also had
policies in place for volunteer support,
complaints, disciplinary action, grievance and the
storage of information about volunteers under the
Data Protection Act.

expectations of befrienders. The meetings also
provided volunteers with an opportunity to meet
those involved in the befriending scheme and to
ask questions before formally registering their
interest.

**Read the information for potential befriending**
**volunteers and complete a befriender**
**registration form**
As the BECCA befriending schemes were part of a
research trial, the befriending volunteers were
considered a form of research participant.
Therefore, the information booklet included
MREC-approved information relevant to research
trial participants, and the registration form also
included MREC-approved statements akin to
those found on research consent forms. The
volunteer registration form was also used to record
information on existing skills (e.g. experience as a
family carer and/or caring experience, or from
training within the helping professions or as a
paid carer), and volunteers’ availability (weekdays
or weekends; daytime or evening) and preferences
for placements (e.g. no pets or smoking; local or
away from own community).

The information booklet and registration form
had been revised and amended in the light of
pilot work which identified the risk of dual roles
for befrienders and carers. It had been assumed
that all current carers would be too busy to be
considering voluntary activity; however, some
carers expressed an interest in being befrienders
themselves. Indeed, some misinterpreted the
carer information sheet used for recruitment of
family carers to the project to mean that they
were being asked to be befrienders, and they
engaged in the research interviews with this
express intent. To clarify literature, the
information sheets were amended, and some of
the terminology was changed to remove any
possible ambiguities. A procedure was devised
for ensuring that active carers were not taken on
as potential befrienders during their time as a
research participant, but to value their offer and
contribution during later phases of the trial,
once their research participation was complete.
It was noted that some carers saw themselves as
better equipped for the befriending role, and
not just in need of care. Feedback from pilot
work also showed that befrienders needed to be
aware of some aspects of the research design,
for example making it clear that carers had
contact with research interviewers before entry
into the trial, and that referrals could not be
taken for the befriending scheme except from
within the trial.


**Provide names of referees and complete a CRB**
**standard disclosure form**
Contact details were requested for two character
referees (not relatives), and references were taken
up by the BF. Potential volunteers were also asked
to disclose criminal convictions, including any that
were spent, as people over the age of 65 (which
many carers were) are considered vulnerable
people under the terms of the Rehabilitation of
Offenders Act 1974. During the start-up of the
project, procedures for police checks were being
transferred to the new CRB, and participants were
asked to complete the CRB disclosure form.
Assistance was provided by the BF where necessary.

**Attend the befriender training course**
The befriender training course consisted of six
2-hour modules, totalling 12 hours of learning
(further details on p. 16). The course was
compulsory and volunteers were able attend
sessions from more than one course as long as all
modules were covered. A record of attendance was
kept.

**Agree to abide by the Code of Conduct,**
**including the statement of confidentiality**
The Code of Conduct outlined the expectations of
the work that befrienders would do on the scheme’s
behalf. It included a statement of confidentiality, as
organisers had to be able to trust volunteers with
personal information about the carers who used its
services, and personal information about the caredfor PwD. Volunteers signed to say that they would
not pass on confidential information to anyone
other than their BF, or supporters nominated by
the BF. Volunteers could pass on confidential
information if they had been given the permission
of the person concerned. The statement of
confidentiality also emphasised situations where
safety took a higher priority than confidentiality,
for example in situations of suspected abuse.

**Availability**
Volunteers were asked to make a minimum
commitment to be involved with the scheme for
6 months, at an intensity of an hour per week plus
travel.

**_Exclusion criteria_**
The following exclusion criteria were applied:

- volunteers under the age of 18 years

- volunteers regarded as unsuitable in the light of
references or information from standard
disclosures from the CRB



- volunteers with special needs that could not
be catered for within the scheme, or which **15**


-----

might add to the caring burden of a
befriender



- volunteers who failed to declare convictions
which later came to light.

The above criteria were in line with the key
principles for the safe involvement of volunteers
with vulnerable clients.[78] In the event, no
volunteers were excluded on the grounds of any of
these criteria.

###### Befriender training programme

The training programme was developed
specifically for the trial, and delivered by the BFs
in conjunction with invited others. The aims of the
training were to equip volunteers for their
befriending role, and ensure that they were aware
of scheme boundaries and guidelines for safe and
ethical involvement with carers. Certificates of
attendance were provided on completion.


to highlight the impact of caring for a person
with dementia, to raise befrienders’ awareness
of needs that befriending can meet. The four
stages of the befriending relationship were
introduced, and skills developed in stages 1 and
2 (‘breaking the ice’ and ‘getting to know one
another’).

- _Unit 4: Working in other people’s homes: guidelines_
for health and safety when visiting carers at
home, including risk assessment, and what to
do in the face of incidents, accidents or
untoward situations.

information about dementia and signposted
volunteers to a variety of information resources
to assist in signposting.

- _Unit 6: Later stages of befriending, and looking after_

companionship (stage 3), including avoiding
miscommunication and troubleshooting.
Procedures for ending befriending relationship
(stage 4) were covered, and the importance of
ongoing self-care was emphasised.

introduce themselves, to answer questions on the
introductory leaflet and, where appropriate, to
arrange to visit the carer. At the initial face-to-face
meeting, the BF provided carers with a full
information booklet about using the befriending
scheme. Carers interested in participating at that
stage completed a registration form and those who
declined involvement were given an open
invitation to change their mind at any time during
the life of the project. In accordance with the
suggestions of the consultation group, the BF
maintained occasional contact with those carers
who were not initially interested in having a
befriender. The information booklet and
registration form for carers using the befriending
scheme corresponded to those used with the
befriending volunteers.

###### Befriender–carer matches
Matches were made by the BFs on the basis of
locality and knowledge of both the carer and
befriender. Information was used from the
registration forms, most particularly befrienders’
and carers’ preferences for time and location of
meetings. There were no requirements or
restrictions for matches relating to gender, current
circumstances or prior experience. The BF
organised an initial meeting to introduce the
befriender to the carer, to remind both parties of
the ground rules for the befriending partnerships,
and to set up an informal contract for meeting
location, duration and frequency.

###### Monitoring of matches
Both befriender and carer were reminded that the
BF would be contacting each of them individually
to review the partnership after 1 month, 6 months
and every subsequent 6 months, but that they
could contact the BF at any time in between.

###### Befriender support
Local peer-support group meetings were
organised for befrienders at a minimum of
6-monthly intervals. These provided opportunities
for volunteers to support each other on issues that
could be raised without breaching confidentiality,
and to have further training and topical
information about aspects of volunteering or carer
support, such as telephone support. Newsletters
were circulated, also at 6-monthly intervals, giving
information about the BECCA project, volunteer
recruitment and signposting issues. The BF
maintained individual contact with each volunteer
and carer between meetings, usually by telephone,
and 6-monthly reviews of the activity and the
quality of befriender relationship were routinely
carried out. However, both befriender and carer


were actively encouraged to contact the BF if they
had any concerns about issues within or relating to
the befriending activity.

Previous work has recommended that one fulltime befriending coordinator could only
successfully support 15–20 matched befrienders.[79]

Therefore, it was initially intended that the BF
would liaise with counterparts in relevant
organisations to identify potential befriender
contacts, and also work to develop a pyramid of
volunteer support in which more experienced
volunteers within a community take on the role of
local befriending contact, supporting and training
new recruits, matching befrienders with care dyads
and publicising the befriending scheme. For the
Suffolk and Havering schemes, the number of
matched did not rise above the recommended
ceiling. In Norfolk, the BF worked closely with
Alzheimer’s Society outreach workers, with some
aspects of the BF role delegated.

###### Ending of partnerships
At the start of their involvement with the scheme,
participating carers were told that they could use
the befriending scheme as long as there was an
appropriate BF. If the carer’s active caring
situation changed because the PwD had either
moved into long-term care or died, the carer was
then given the choice as to whether to continue or
terminate a befriending relationship. From the
start of the trial, the intervention manager and the
BFs worked towards an exit strategy to ensure that
ongoing matches could be supported beyond the
end of the trial-specific schemes.

###### Audit and data collection
Volunteer screening and training procedures were
audited by the BFs, in conjunction with the
intervention manager. Audit data and
demographic information on matched befriending
volunteers were collated by the BFs and sent to
the university-based research team in anonymised
format. Data included age and gender of
befriending volunteers, and whether or not they
had previous experience as a carer. Dates of
matches and partnership end dates were also
collated for use by the research team.


###### Volunteer flow
A total of 124 volunteers approached BFs across
the three schemes expressing interest in the
volunteer befriender role. Of these, 81 (65%)
completed a volunteer registration form, 75 (60%)
were screened using references and 64 (52%)
completed CRB disclosures. In total, 63 (51%)
completed the training programme, and 60 (48%) **17**


-----

met all four screening criteria of registration,
references, CRB disclosures and completion of
befriender training. In other words, two potential
volunteers had to be recruited to result in one
eligible befriender or, alternatively, one in two
potential volunteers was lost through the screening
and training process.

Previous descriptions of befriending schemes, for
example ‘City Support’ Case Study 6,[80] have found
that around 15% of befriending applicants may be
considered unsuitable for befriending within
healthcare. The BECCA scheme screening
procedures did not include any assessment of
‘befriender suitability’. Individual applicants were
encouraged to consider this for themselves during
the recruitment, screening and training process,
and it was indeed the case that some potential
volunteers withdrew as they decided for
themselves that the befriending role was not right
for them. In some cases, BFs were able to direct
volunteers to other volunteering opportunities.

Of the 60 volunteers who completed the screening
and training process, only 49 became befrienders.
As demographic data for volunteers were only
passed on to the research team for those who
became befrienders (i.e. matched with carers), no
information is available on potential differences
between those volunteers who become befrienders
and those who withdrew earlier in the recruitment,
screening and training process, or on those who
were eligible to befriend, but not matched.
Anecdotally, non-matching of eligible volunteers
was often due to mismatches in geographical
location between befriender and carer
recruitment.

###### Costing of befriending services

Each BECCA befriending scheme was set up
specifically for the trial in addition to existing
services, and therefore each service was uniquely
costed. Cost data were collected from the
beginning of the pretrial consultation to the end
of the financial year 2005/06. Costs collected
included set-up costs, training costs (for staff and
volunteers), staff salaries and travel, volunteer


time and travel, overhead expenses
(administration, stationery, telephone, postage,
insurance, CRB disclosures) and running costs
(ongoing and recruitment and publicity costs,
room hire for support groups).

Half-yearly budget statements were obtained from
the host organisations to collect details on staff
salaries, travel claims and all expenses related to
overheads and running expenses.

###### Record of activities
BFs kept accounts of their own work and budget,
and basic records of befrienders’ contact with
carers. They also collected the records kept by
befrienders and trainers of their time spent and
expenses. The precise quantities of befriender time
and expenses were recorded on monthly returns.
Time, out-of-pocket expenses, use of volunteers’
cars and organisational costs of running the
befriending service were all collected routinely.

###### Total cost of intervention
Intervention costs were calculated as a fixed and
variable component, specific to each of the three
centres (Norfolk, Suffolk and Havering). The fixed
cost was divided equally by centre among all those
in the intervention arm, and variable costs were
divided equally among those who actually received
befriending.

###### Protocol changes relating to intervention

As a consequence of ethical review, a limited-area
pilot phase was introduced to the project with the
aim of piloting procedures for the recruitment and
training of befriending volunteers. This had
implications for the wider trial timetable, leading
in part to the changes to the recruitment process
described in the section ‘Summary of changes to
protocol’ (p. 12). As a consequence of the pilot,
there were changes to the consent procedures for
carers, and associated changes to the information
and consent forms. At this time the opportunity
was taken to amend the terminology used in these
forms to conform to best practice, in a changing
field.

PwD.

Sixteen per cent of carers were caring for another
person in addition to a person with dementia and
16% were working, in full- or part-time paid
employment, or were self-employed (Table 4).
Eighteen carers (89%) identified themselves as
being full-time carers. The intervention and
control groups were notably similar in terms of
demographics, burden of caring and multiple roles.

###### Psychological well-being
The level of psychological morbidity for the
participating carers is shown in Table 5. In total, 40
carers (17%) self-reported case levels of depressive
symptomology (HADS depression score �11),
either with or without case levels of anxiety. This
proportion is in keeping with the expected
prevalence of clinical depression in family carers
of PwD (expected range 0.15–0.32[81]). The
proportion of carers expressing case levels of
anxiety (with or without depression) was higher,
with 63 (27%) scoring 11 or above on the HADS
anxiety scale. The mean scores on the HADS
depression and anxiety subscales are comparable
with those found in carers of PwD in day-hospital
settings or in contact with community mental
health teams (CMHTs).[82]

**_TABLE 4 Multiple roles: concurrent caring and paid employment_**


Baseline scores on other psychometric measures
are shown in Table 6. As for the baseline
demographics, the intervention and control
groups were similar on all measures.

###### Support in caring role
It was anticipated that the availability of support
for carers would depend in part on their social
network. There were participating carers in each
of the social network categories (Table 7), with the
largest category being ‘private restricted’. The
private restricted network type includes
individuals who have no local relative and have
very little local contact or informal support.

The network typology questionnaire was also used
to generate an index of social isolation based on
whether or not the carer has family, friends and
contact with neighbours, and whether they see any
of them (family, friends and neighbours) less often
than once a week. The index does not incorporate
information on proximity to family (nearest
family/child/sibling), frequency of interaction with
family, friends and neighbours, or information on
local social ties (participation in social clubs,
groups or religious meetings), but has the
advantage of creating an ordered scale. On the
Social Isolation Index, the carer population was
evenly spread across the no-isolation, low- and

(Table 24). However, these results are based on
only 61 observations (versus 218 in the imputed
data set), and are likely biased owing to potential
correlations between health status (and hence
resource use) and probability of providing
complete responses to all questions.

###### Incorporating PwD quality of life
When the quality of life of the PwD is taken into
account as well as that of the carer, the point
estimate ICER is £26,848, which is within the
conventionally accepted threshold of costeffectiveness (Table 25). Taking into account
uncertainty, the authors estimate a 51.4% probability
that the ICER is below £30,000 per QALY gained.
Therefore, when including PwD quality of life too,
befriending may be a cost-effective intervention.


###### Summary of cost-effectiveness analyses


###### 35


-----

The results from the voluntary sector perspective
are in contrast to other sectors, for which there is
an estimated 69.9% probability that the ICER will
be below £30,000. However, this is because the
voluntary sector bears only a small proportion of
the overall costs of caring for carers or PwD. [Note
that this analysis only includes direct costs borne
by the voluntary sector. The value of volunteers’
time in caring and befriending (indirect cost) is
incorporated in the societal perspective.] This
result underlines the importance of considering
cost-effectiveness from the societal perspective, as
an intervention can appear cost-effective to one
individual or sector, when in fact this is simply an
artefact of arbitrary budgetary boundaries.

From the household perspective, there is an
estimated 29.8% probability that access to a BF is
a cost-effective intervention (at a threshold of
£30,000 per QALY gained). It is questionable,
however, whether this is an appropriate analysis
for evaluating cost-effectiveness from a household
perspective. Cost–utility analysis is a useful tool to
assist population-level rationing decisions, and the
threshold is a general rule of thumb as to whether
the benefits (generating a statistical QALY) are
worth the cost, thus leading to more equitable
distribution of finite societal resources. An
individual’s willingness to pay for a QALY for a
named relative or friend is likely to be very
different. Furthermore, the relevant budget
constraint is the household’s, not a ‘community
chest’. The household may therefore value
health gains to a specific person much more
highly than those to society as a whole. Again,


this emphasises the need to consider the societal
perspective when making societal resource
allocation decisions.

As the time-horizon extended, the costeffectiveness deteriorated. Whereas the
intervention was in a dominant situation at
6 months (intervention appeared to result in
health-related quality of life gains and be less
costly), at 24 months the point estimate ICER was
£381,000 per QALY gained. The apparent
deterioration in cost-effectiveness is because the
costs were increasing at a faster rate than the
corresponding health gain; therefore, the costeffectiveness deteriorates.

Complete data were available for only 61 out of
218 care dyads included in the economic
evaluation. The results from this limited analysis
were strongly in favour of befriending; however,
the authors believe this to be a biased analysis as,
first, only a small proportion of the valid data was
used in this analysis and, secondly, the probability
of a respondent providing a complete data set is
likely to be related to the health status of the carer
and/or PwD. Therefore, the imputed data set is
likely to provide a more appropriate
representation of costs and outcomes.

When taking into account quality of life of the
PwD as well as the carers, the analysis found
slightly in favour of befriending: the point
estimate ICER was approximately £27,000 per
QALY gained, with a 51% probability of being
under £30,000.

### Chapter 6

 Discussion and conclusions


he BECCA trial evaluated the impact of access
to a befriender facilitator for family carers of
## T
people with dementia. The trial represents the
largest RCT of befriending for carers of PwD, and
involved an ambitious framework for costing care
for carers of PwD.

###### Main findings

The primary cost and cost-effectiveness analyses
did not show any benefit of intervention over
control in terms of psychological well-being or
cost. That is, at 15 months postrandomisation,
access to a BF in the context of usual care did not
significantly improve carer well-being as measured
by HADS depression, and was associated with a
trend towards higher costs to society. There was a
trend towards increased health-related quality of
life for those randomised to intervention, but this
was not statistically significant. In terms of the
main outcomes for the ITT analyses, therefore,
this is a strongly negative study.

Secondary analyses on measures of carer anxiety,
loneliness, positive affect and perceived global
health showed no significant benefits for
intervention over control, and similarly there were
no differences between intervention and control
on either a subgroup analysis with spouse carers or
a comparison of proportions of people with
dementia entering residential or nursing care.
Looking from alternative perspectives (statutory,
household and voluntary sector) did not offer any
convincing evidence for the value of the
intervention, and extending the time-frame
strengthened the evidence against the
intervention.

However, two further analyses that suggest the
negative findings may be due to methodological
limitations. First, a cost–utility analysis using the
QALYs for the PwD in addition to the carer
indicated that access to a BF may be a costeffective intervention. Given the importance of
care recipient well-being to family carers, it could
be argued that health economic analyses of
interventions for family carers should include care
recipient quality of life as part of the primary
analysis. Secondly, a per-protocol subgroup


analysis comparing control carers with the small
number of intervention carers who engaged with
befrienders for at least 6 months before 15-month
follow-up reported a difference in HADS
depression scores that approached statistical
significance in favour of the intervention. While
providing only weak evidence of any beneficial
effect, this finding indicates that if uptake can be
improved, positive findings in the ITT population
are more likely.

###### Implications for healthcare

 Should befriending interventions be withdrawn?
Given the largely negative findings, should
befriending still be provided as a support
intervention for carers? It should be emphasised
that the negative results reported here are for the
intervention ‘access to a befriender facilitator’ and
not ‘receipt of befriending’. Given that only
around half of the carers offered befriending
chose to take up the offer, should it be concluded
that befriending is not a service that carers want?
Lack of service uptake by carers is well known for
both standard services and research interventions.
Although awareness is a vital precursor to service
use,[83] awareness alone does not account for
whether or not carers uptake services. Other
factors include work status, socio-economic status
and level of burden.[84,85] Lack of time is associated
with non-uptake,[86] although increased burden,
depression or distress may increase uptake.[86–88]


It is apparent that no one service is appropriate
for all carers, and that each carer may have
differing needs over the years spent supporting
the care recipient. In their work on the ‘caregiving
career’, Aneshensel and colleagues[20] suggested
that different interventions are appropriate at
difference stages of the care recipient’s illness, for
example, before and after diagnosis, during inhome care, before and after admission of the care
recipient into long-term residential or nursing
care, and after the death of the care recipient.
This research had been expected to show that a
social support intervention would be of greatest
relevance to those carers for whom the demands
of caring had impacted adversely on their social
networks, but were still providing care for the PwD **37**


-----

at home. This study used the ‘time spent caring’
marker of 20 hours or more per week to increase
the chance that participants were immersed in the
caring role. Further analysis of the demographic,
psychological and social characteristics of carers
who did and did not take up the offer of
befriending may inform the inclusion or exclusion
criteria for any future research on befriending
interventions or referral criteria for befriending
services.


###### Is the cost of intervention data generalisable to locally commissioned schemes?
The mean cost of the intervention was £1138 per
carer at 15 months. Costs varied by scheme, with
the largest and longest running scheme having
lower costs per carer than the smaller schemes.
There are economies of scale for both fixed and
running costs, but once a scheme grows beyond
the size at which a BF can support the befrienders
and carers within it, additional staff costs will be
necessary.

decisions to minimise volunteer travel by mixing
face-to-face meetings with telephone befriending
or to meet fortnightly rather than weekly, but for
2 hours rather than 1 hour. This will also have
meant that initial face-to-face assessment and
introductory visits by BFs would have entailed
more travel than non-BECCA befriending schemes
might have entailed. For these reasons, costs for
the BECCA befriending service may have been
higher than in a more usual locally implemented
befriending service.

###### Is it safe to involve volunteers?
Overall, few risk issues arose. Active steps were
taken to follow guidelines on good practice in
supporting volunteers working in settings with
potentially vulnerable people.[90,91] A code of
confidentiality was maintained, risk assessments
carried out by BFs, and health and safety
guidelines were developed in partnership with the
voluntary organisations helping to provide the
befriending services. Written information and
training were provided to ensure that volunteers
were fully informed about these issues and about
how they needed to be applied in practice.

There were a few occasions where issues affecting
the safety of befrienders as well as the safety of
carers, people cared for or other family members
had to be explicitly considered and responded to
by the BF. These usually followed instances where
the carer sought to step outside the boundaries of
the befriending relationship in some way. These
were picked up at an early stage by the befriender,
who brought them to the attention of the BF.
It was found that the early development of a riskassessment procedure as well as befriender
training in risk management proved useful in
deciding how to respond to such incidents, and
responses ranged from BF reminders to the carer
involved about their agreement to respect
boundaries to changes in the terms of the
befriender arrangement. These, on two occasions,
included a change of befriender and type of
contact from face-to-face visits to telephone
befriending. In all such cases, good working
relationships were successfully maintained.

###### User involvement
The local consultation groups were formed to
support and develop the befriending scheme
intervention. However, their remit soon expanded
to include consultation on aspects of research
design and project literature. The authors would
strongly endorse the involvement of carers and
their representatives from the early stages of
project development, including opportunity to


comment on project information sheets and in
planning recruitment strategies. Consultation
groups can also suggest local links and small area
initiatives. Such microknowledge is useful in all
areas, but especially so in rural areas, where the
difficulties with disseminating information to
hidden communities has already been highlighted.


Reflecting on the recruitment activity, from the
identification of potential participants through to
randomisation, it appears that the recruitment
strategy that produced the highest number of
expressions of interest was not necessarily the most
productive strategy for identifying eligible
participants. Twenty-seven out of 54 GP practices
(20 out of 35 in Norfolk; seven out of 19 in
Suffolk) sent out a total of 484 standard invitation
letters and approved participant information **39**


###### Volunteer support
Many of the volunteers were above retirement age
and there were instances where befriending
arrangements needed also to take account of
volunteer health. Some had episodes of ill-health
which in some cases prevented them from driving
to visit carers or meant that they had to withdraw
from volunteering completely. Both volunteers
and carers were supported by the BF through such
episodes to maintain the continuity of the
befriending relationship according to the wishes of
the participants. Recent studies such as that of
older volunteers in Newcastle[92] have illustrated
how older people have valued their own
engagement as befrienders of frailer elders, in
which they were able to connect meaningfully with
previous roles in which they had been able to
make a contribution.

###### Factors to consider in carer support research

 Recruitment
Recruitment to the project was one of the main
challenges for BECCA, and led to both the
extension of the recruitment period and the
consequent changes in follow-up schedule. There
were considerable difficulties in recruiting only
through primary care, and the recognition of
carers in primary care is an ongoing area of
concern.[93] A move towards multiple strategies, as
recommended by Adams and colleagues[94] and
DiBartolo and McCrone,[95] improved overall
recruitment, but barriers remained, including
non-identification with the term ‘carer’, nonfacilitative gatekeepers, burden of written
information and a disperse client group.[96]

of the economic data for the COSID trial was
hampered by the non-return of the monthly
diaries, with 22% of participants failing to return
at least six out of 12 diaries over the course of
the year.[98]

###### Measures
The main quality of life measure for the trial was
the EQ-5D. Given the limited information on
reliability and validity of the EQ5D with the carer
population, and the measure being limited to
health-related quality of life, broader measures of
quality of life should be considered in any future
research. The HTA review panel recommended
use of the Carer Generated Index of Quality of
Life (CGI-QoL) as a user-defined outcome in
addition to a measure of health-related quality of
life. The CGI-QoL was still under development at
the start of 2002. Its use was piloted within the
BECCA project and found to be very timeconsuming, leading to interviewee burden. It was
therefore dropped from the interview schedule.
Health-related quality of life for the PwD also
relied on the EQ-5D, using proxy ratings by the
carer. Although the EQ-5D has better
measurement qualities than some other healthrelated quality of life measures when carers are
used as proxies,[99] proxy ratings are known to
differ from patients’ ratings.[99,100] Given the
suggestion that cost-effectiveness analyses should
take account of the outcomes for both the carer
and PwD, future carer intervention research
should include direct measurement of the clinical
characteristics of the PwD, including behavioural
and psychological symptoms.

###### Impact of interviewers
In carer intervention research, good relations
between the interviewers and carers were vital to
ensure completion of interviews at each timepoint, and retention in the study over time. In the
BECCA trial, many participating carers expressed
an appreciation of having the space to talk with
someone about their caring experiences. While
there are advantages to carers feeling positive
about their interview involvement, this also leads
to the potential narrowing of the difference
between intervention and control conditions in a
low-level social support trial.

###### Blinding
Although interviewers did not ask directly about
befriending, it was not possible for interviewers to
remain blind to group when carers specifically
commented on their befriending receipt.


###### Recommendations for future research


This research is strongly suggestive that further
research into access to a befriender facilitator is
redundant. However, the weak evidence of efficacy
in the analysis of befrienders receiving at least
6 months’ intervention may suggest that further
research into befriending as a form of carer
support is warranted. Based on the per-protocol
analysis, the effect size was 0.31. A future study
with 90% power at 5% significance would need
around 220 participants per group. In addition,
the befriending interventions could be used as a
control for more formal psychotherapeutic
interventions for carers.

Before undertaking further intervention research
on befriending, it would be of value to establish
the characteristics of carers most likely to take up
befriending and the befriender–carer
characteristics of successful matches. Information
relevant to these areas could be derived from
further analysis of the BECCA data.

Carer intervention research is complicated by the
wide range of services offered to and used by
carers over the course of the dementia. The
service receipt of carers is often not fully taken
into account, nor is the interplay between statutory
and voluntary support services and support from
families. Greater knowledge of the interaction
between formal and informal care is needed.[101]

The BECCA database could be exploited to
explore the interplay of statutory and voluntary
sectors and the family, and indeed a Small Grant
has been provided by the Economic and Social
Research Council (ESRC) to do so. A further
complication in carer intervention research is
assessing well-being in the context of receipt of
befriending and placement of the care recipient in
long-term residential or nursing care. The BECCA
trial completed follow-up irrespective of location
of the PwD, as carers were keen to see support
continue beyond their life as a hands-on carer.
Such ongoing support should be considered in
other carer interventions.

Future cost-effectiveness evaluations of carer
support should include outcomes for both the
carer and care recipient, and further work is
required on economic methods for carer
intervention research, including:



- explorations of the relationship between
health-related quality of life measures and
other outcome measures **41**


-----

- identification of methods for minimising work
for respondents and interviewers of resourceuse data collection in economic studies

- methods for measuring and valuing carer time
and other informal care inputs for economic
analysis

- additional work to confirm or refute the costeffectiveness of befriending from a societal
point of view.

###### Conclusions

Access to a befriender facilitator is neither an
effective nor a cost-effective intervention in the


support of carers of people with dementia,
although there is a suggestion of cost-effectiveness
for the care dyad (carer and care recipient). In
common with many services for carers of PwD,
uptake of befriending services was not high.
However, the small number of carers who engaged
with befrienders for 6 months or more reported a
reduction in scores on HADS depression that
approached statistical significance compared with
controls. Although this study provides only weak
evidence of any beneficial effect, further research
into befriending interventions for carers is
warranted.
