the extent to which social relations developed within both frequency of physical activity and changes in social
support play a role in changes over the 6-month intervention and the 6-month follow-up periods. That is,
individuals who exercised more frequently during the
exercise intervention, regardless of mode of activity,
and who realized greater improvements in social support over the intervention period had significantly
greater improvements in satisfaction with life. It is important to note that satisfaction with life remains relatively stable across age despite changes in physical and
material resources [45]. That physical activity participation might enhance what is considered to be a relatively stable, but important element of overall healthrelated quality of life is underscored when we examine
the pattern of relationships postintervention. As noted
earlier, satisfaction with life declined at follow-up, as
did the other elements of SWB. However, these declines
