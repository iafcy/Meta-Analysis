## INTRODUCTION

Elderly patients presenting to St. Vincent’s Emergency Department (ED) constitute approximately one third of all presentations. This situation is common
to metropolitan hospitals in Victoria, Australia and internationally, with those
aged 65 and over disproportionately represented. Specifically, while this age
group currently comprise 13% of the population in Australia, they account
for 33% of hospital admissions and 20% of ED presentations (Emergency
Demand Coordination Group, 2001). In addition, approximately 15.2% of
overall growth in demand on EDs within Australia stems from individuals within this age group (Emergency Demand Coordination Group, 2001).
Further, the number of individuals aged 60 and over within Victoria is
projected to increase from 1 million (19% of the population) in 2010 to
1.4 million (23%) in 2020 and 2.4 million (29%) in 2050 (Department of
Planning and Community Development, 2010). The aging nature of our
population emphasizes the importance of examining the aetiology of ED
admissions among the elderly and the patient experience of these presentations to ensure both positive health outcomes and a reduction in the
associated public health burden.
A significant proportion of elderly presentations to ED involve exacerbations or episodes of underlying or preexisting conditions. In older adults,
depression specifically is known to cause significant distress and disability,
which exacerbates, and is often exacerbated by, existing medical conditions (Frazer, Christensen, & Griffiths, 2005). However, depression in the
elderly is often characterized by different symptomatology from that seen
in younger adults. Specifically, depressed mood may be less commonly
reported by health care professionals and the presentation of somatic symptoms, including a loss of appetite, lack of energy, irritability, sleeplessness,
rumination, and physical pain may be more prominent (Frazer et al., 2005).
Within the cohort of patients aged over 65, depression has significant implications for psychosocial health and well-being and is associated with social

_J_

isolation, carer stress, and barriers to effective access of community resources
(Achterberg et al., 2003; Ell, 2006; Fessman & Lester, 2000; VanItallie, 2005).
Not surprisingly, depression in the elderly is also associated with increased
health service use, medical costs, and general health burden (Ell, 2006).
However, it is also often considered to be a normal response to aging,
physical deterioration, and other life events including the loss of loved
ones (Birrer & Vemuri, 2004; Frazer et al., 2005). Accordingly, depression
is often overlooked as a clinical diagnosis and, as a result, elderly patients
may not receive optimal treatment during, or following, hospital admissions
for depressive episodes (Ell, 2006; Koenig et al., 1992; Raj, 2004; VanItallie,
2005). For these reasons, recent research has investigated the efficacy of current treatment and management strategies for depression in the elderly in
both primary health and community settings.
International literature suggests that the appropriate management of
depression in the elderly, who present at the ED with complex care needs,
should involve an integrated approach across a continuum of care from
presentation to follow up with telephone tracking and supported linkages
established between primary care and community services (Aminzadeh &
Dalziel, 2002). Specifically, research has investigated the involvement of
general practitioners, geriatricians, and allied health in appropriate care of
the elderly, in conjunction with carers who are commonly the main source
of support for these patients (Jeon, 2004). Research has focused specifically on integrating internal liaison with effective networking within the
patient’s community to improve long-term outcomes (Spillane et al., 1997).
These studies have assessed the use of screening, geriatric and psychiatric
assessment, education, the promotion of self-care (Hendriksen & Harrison,
2001), rehabilitation services and counseling (Lee, Ross, & Tracy, 2001),
referral to appropriate community services (Aminzadeh & Dalziel, 2002) and
community–carer linkages (Jeon, 2004). Such research shows that collaborative, holistic care is effective in improving outcomes for elderly patients with
depression (Birrer & Vemuri, 2004; Frazer et al., 2005; Jeon, 2004; McGarry,
Hegarty, & Gunn, 2005; Raj, 2004).
In response to the increasing recognition of this best practice care for
elderly patients who present with depressive episodes, St. Vincent’s Health
in Melbourne undertook a recent analysis of elderly patients presenting to
the ED. The findings indicate that the majority of individuals live alone (44%)
with many more living with a primary carer (29%) (Joubert, Vale, Brock, &
Braddy, 2005). However, minimal attention was paid to carer liaison or the
linkages between primary health and community services. In response to
this discrepancy, and given international literature supporting continuums of
care for the elderly, St. Vincent’s Health has implemented three integrated
care programs under the Victorian Hospital Demand Management Strategy
to develop alternative treatment plans for elderly individuals whose conditions are chronic or complex and who present frequently to ED. These


-----

_g_ _y_ _f_ _y_ _p_

programs are of specific relevance to the elderly as their main purpose
is to increase linkages with, and the use of, primary health and community services in instances where presentation at ED could be prevented or
care more appropriately provided elsewhere. These programs are: ALERT
(Assessing, Liaison and Early Referral Team), HiT (Holding it Together), and
TRAAC (Treating the elderly in the right place: Facilitating appropriate community care). The directive of both the ALERT and HiT programs stipulates
the importance of risk management, screening, early discharge planning for
ED patients, and case management for patients who have complex care
needs. The major objectives are to: screen for high-risk patients at all stages
of care; coordinate a central referral process for sub-acute care; ensure early
communication with relevant community agencies and programs; follow up
with patients who are at risk of unplanned readmissions; ensure community
supports are in place prior to discharge; centralize and improve timeliness of the referral process; and avoid unnecessary duplication of services.
By contrast, the TRAAC program provides rapid assessment response and
short-term case management for older people living in the community or in
residential care settings. This service aims to prevent unnecessary ED presentations by offering alternative options where appropriate, through building
linkages with community-based services. Rather then establishing another
service structure, this model seeks to enhance existing services within the
community. These three projects have cut across professional and skill
boundaries and focus on an integrated systems approach to service delivery.
However, there are no screening tools or management guidelines for patients
who present with depressive symptomatology within the protocols of these
programs.
This study sought to evaluate the patient experience and the resulting
change over time in reported depression, quality of life, and social support
factors for patients who present to ED and receive intervention in accordance
with the ALERT, HiT, and TRACC programs, by comparison with those who
receive usual care. The objective of this study was to improve the identification of, and response to, depression in elderly patients, aged over 65 years,
who present with complex care needs, to improve health outcomes. The
specific aims of this project were twofold. The first was to implement and
assess the efficacy of a brief screening assessment for depression into existing protocols in the three integrated care programs at St. Vincent’s Health
and assess the efficacy of this assessment compared to standardized measures. The second aim was to develop a protocol for the identification and
management of depression in elderly patients based on assertive outreach
programs, linking patients and carers into existing integrated care programs
at St. Vincent’s Health and with primary and community care resources.
This project was undertaken with the vision of contributing to the evidence
base for best practice care with elderly patients presenting to ED and the
identification and management of depression in this population.

## METHODOLOGY


## Participants

The study was conducted at St. Vincent’s Health, an acute health care facility, in Melbourne, Australia. The participants for this study included male and
female patients aged 65 years and over who presented to the ED between
March 2005 and August 2005. The inclusion criteria for participation were
extensive due to the sensitive nature of screening for depression in elderly
patients who present to an ED. To qualify for inclusion, patients had to be
English speaking, have a nominated general practitioner (GP) in the local
community, and have no known psychiatric history and no identified medical issues that would hinder participation. Over the 6-month period, a total
of 771 participants aged 65 and over presented to St. Vincent’s Health ED.
Of these, 363 (47.08%) identified as non-English speaking and 126 (16.34%)
did not have a nominated local GP, 118 (15.30%) had an identified psychiatric history, and 99 (12.84%) reported medical problems that excluded
them from participating including profound deafness, dysphasia, and cognitive impairment. Therefore, in total, within this 6-month period, 66 patients
were determined eligible for participation in this study. The mean age of
these participants was 76.63 years (SD = 7.32) and 71% were female.


## Procedure

All 771 patients who presented during this time were screened during Phase
1 for depressive symptomatology using a brief version of the Geriatric
Depression Screening (GDS-15) tool. This allowed for the evaluation of the
efficacy of this tool in screening for depression in this patient cohort.
During Phase 2, the sample was refined based on the exclusion criteria described above and the remaining 66 patients were fully screened
for depression using the 15-item form of the GDS-15 tool (Sheikh &
Yesavage, 1986). The aim of this was to assess the efficacy and accuracy of the initial screen in the identification of depression. Using this
full screen, a total of 15 patients scored positively and the remaining
51 patients screened negatively. Of the 15 patients who screened positively
for depression, 7 refused to consent to participate in ongoing research. This
reflects complexities inherent to conducting research with elderly patients
demonstrating depression. During Phase 2, all participants who screened
positively and consented to ongoing participation were randomized into
control (n = 4) and intervention groups (n = 4). The characteristics of these
participants are presented in Table 1. Both groups then completed measures designed to assess depression (GDS-15), quality of life (Manchester
Short Assessment of Quality of Life), social support and social functioning
(Person-In-Environment Classification System and Medical Outcome Study

Social Support Scale), and patient experience using a semi-structured interview. These measures are described below. Following the completion of
these measures, the control group received usual care. The intervention
group received a comprehensive, integrated management plan in accordance with the ALERT, HiT, and TRACC programs. This involved assessment
outcome reports, patient education about depression in a one-on-one
session with a social worker at St. Vincent’s Health, emotional support, and
counseling utilizing a problem-solving framework. Contact was also made
with the participant’s GP who received assessment outcome reports and
links were established to community agencies for the provision of ongoing
monitoring and support.
During Phase 3, participants in both the intervention and control groups
were followed up with at 6 weeks post discharge from the ED. This follow up was conducted via phone to examine between-group differences in
depression, quality of life, social support and social functioning, and patient
satisfaction as examined in Phase 2.

## Measures


BRIEF GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCREENING TOOL

This tool was used during Phase 1 to screen elderly ED patients who had
depressive symptoms. It was adapted from the GDS-15 and consisted of four
questions. A score of two or more was indicative of depression.


GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE (GDS-15)

This measure has been used and validated extensively in past research to
examine depressive symptomatology, present during the past week, in older
patient populations and in primary and community health settings (Friedman,
Heisel, & Delavan 2005; Pomeroy, Clark, & Philp, 2001; Rinaldi et al., 2003;
Scogin & Shah, 2006; Sutcliffe et al., 2000; VanItallie, 2005; Watson & Pignone,
2003). It contains 15 questions (Sheikh & Yesavage, 1986) and evidence


-----

of acceptable but moderate internal consistency and reliability has been
found with the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the total scale previously
reported as 0.75 (Friedman et al., 2005). Construct validity for the assessment of depressed mood has also been determined (Friedman et al., 2005).
Participant scores of 0–4 are considered within the range of normal function,
dependant on age, education, and complaints; a score of 5–8 indicates mild
depression, 9–11 indicates moderate depression, and 12–15 indicates severe
depression. Within this study, participants who scored at or above a score of
five were categorized as a positive screen, whereas those who scored below
five were categorized as a negative screen.

MANCHESTER SHORT ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE (MANSA)


Quality of life was examined using the MANSA scale (Priebe, Huxley, Knight,
& Evans, 1999). This scale consists of 16 items comprising 4 objective
questions and 12 subjective questions examining satisfaction with life, job,
financial situation, friendships, leisure activities, accommodation, personal
safety, people, sex life, family, physical health, and mental health. Participant
responses are reported on a 7-point Likert scale. A higher score, calculated
as the mean scores of these scales, is indicative of a better reported quality
of life. Cronbach’s alpha for ratings using this measure has been reported at
0.74 and it has been found to be comparable to the Lancashire Quality of
Life Profile (Priebe et al., 1999).

PERSON-IN-ENVIRONMENT (PIE) CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM


The PIE classification system (Karls & Wandrei, 1994) is widely field-tested
and determines social functioning in four domains: role functioning, the
environment, mental health, and physical health. It has good reliability and
validity and assesses social functioning using a systemic model. The PIE
was used in this study to examine the contribution of social functioning to
depressive symptomatology, quality of life, representation rates at ED, and
the use of primary care and community resources (Karls & Wandrei, 1994;
Karls, Lowery, Mattaini, & Wandrei, 1997).

MEDICAL OUTCOME STUDY (MOS) SOCIAL SUPPORT SURVEY


The MOS social support survey allows for the examination of medical
events and other stressors by assessing the availability of perceived social
support in four categories including emotional/informational, tangible,
affectionate, and positive social interaction (Sherbourne & Stewart, 1991).
This self-administered scale uses a five-category Likert response for each of
19 items. Scores range from 0 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time) and
a higher score indicates greater social support. High internal consistency


-----

_g_ _y_ _f_ _y_ _p_

and reliability have been reported for this measure with Cronbach’s alpha
coefficients reported as 0.97 for the total social support scale (Sherbourne &
Stewart, 1991).


PATIENT SATISFACTION AND EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE

A semi-structured questionnaire was used to examine the needs of patients,
their perceptions of the ED experience, the lived experience of depression,
social supports and functioning, practical considerations including accommodation, transportation and financial concerns, and satisfaction with the
health care service.


## Data Analysis

Trends in quantitative results were examined as data could not be statistically compared due to a small sample size and the associated lack of
power. Qualitative results ascertained from the semi-structured interview
were analyzed using thematic analysis based on the framework of Grounded
Theory (Liamputtong & Ezzy, 2005). Two independent raters, who were
blind to the aims of the study, examined and coded qualitative data based
on the identification of recurrent words, phrases, patterns, and themes. These
categories were further refined to enable the formation of sub-categories as
defined by similar coding (Morse & Field, 1995). Inter-rater agreement was
established by comparing the coding of data and creation of sub-categories
between raters. Analyses were refined until agreement was reached about all
major coding categories and subcategories.


## RESULTS

During Phase 1, a total of 771 patients participated in this study. Based on
exclusion criteria, 66 patients were then fully screened for depression. Of these,
15 patients screened positively and the 8 who provided informed consent
were randomized into intervention (n = 4) and control (n = 4) groups.


## Depression

The overall mean score for depression screening during Phase 1 (n =
66), was 0.90 (SD = 1.08) (Figure 1). After randomization of the patients
who screened positively and consented to ongoing participation, the mean
screening score for the intervention group was 2.75 (SD = 0.43) and the
mean score for the control group was 2.00 (SD = 0.00).
By comparison, the overall mean score for the GDS-15 (n = 66) was
3.13 (SD = 2.56) (Figure 2) with 22.72% experiencing mild to moderate

both groups with a slight reduction in the average depression score observed
over time for the control group and a slight increase for the intervention
group (Figure 3).

## Quality of Life, Social Support, and Social Functioning


Trends in quantitative results compared at recruitment and 6-weeks post
discharge (Figure 4) indicate that quality of life scores remained consistent for both groups, with a slight decrease observed for the intervention
group. Social support and positive social interaction declined for the control
group and improved for the intervention group. Emotional support increased
slightly for the control group and remained relatively stable for the intervention group whereas affectionate social support improved for both groups.
Overall social functioning, as examined with the PIE classification system,
appeared stable for the control group but improved for the intervention
group over time.

indicate that participants reported multiple medical problems and frustration, primarily related to decreased mobility, as the most significant causes
for depressed mood, rather than psychological dysfunction. In relation to
reduced mobility, being unable to do what they would normally be able to
do, and prefer to do, was cited as the main reason for this frustration, noting that they would lead normal happy lives if they were mobile. In terms
of participants’ perception of their mood, they described their feelings as
“flat,” “down,”,/ “weak,” and “very bad” but never used the words “sad” or
“depressed.” In addition, no participants expressed a fear of dying in this
study, appearing instead to adopt an attitude of acceptance about the fact
that when their time comes, it comes, although this was not perceived as
giving up, but rather acceptance by participants. However, mixed feelings
of worthlessness and hopelessness were reported with 62.5% reporting not
feeling worthless but the same percentage (62.5%) reported feeling that their
situation was hopeless.

SOCIAL FUNCTIONING


Mixed reports of good and poor social supports from family and friends
resulted from this study. Those who lived alone tended to have less social
supports available to them in the community and were more isolated.

_g_ _y_ _f_ _y_ _p_

Overall, social supports appeared to be important in the management of
depression, although socializing outside the family was perceived as less
important to participants’ general well-being. Specifically, they noted great
joy in talking about their grandchildren.


PRACTICAL FACTORS

In general, all participants enjoyed being retired and reported high satisfaction with their accommodation. They also reported frequent use of
public transport, including buses, trams, and taxis and no reported problems relating to service accessibility. However, the majority of participants
noted dissatisfaction with their financial situation; with the common comments being that “it’s hard to make ends meet” and that “the pension doesn’t
go very far.” No problems in accessing health services were reported and
health care staff were generally rated as “wonderful,” although a minority
expressed a preference for the private health system over the public system.


## DISCUSSION

Depression is increasingly recognized as an important issue in the elderly
who present to ED, particularly in those with complex physical health and
social problems. This study aimed to examine depression in patients aged
over 65 years presenting to the ED at St. Vincent’s Health in Melbourne; to
examine the efficacy of a screening tool for the identification of depression
and a protocol for the management of depression utilizing linkages between
primary care and community care. The objective of this research was to
contribute to the knowledge base about appropriate care of elderly patients
who present with complex needs and depression, and to improve health
outcomes for these patients. The significance of this research is supported
by Highet, Luscombe, Davenport, Burns, and Hickie (2006) who assert that
although depression is commonly recognized as a mental health problem, it
is not yet considered a major general health problem throughout Australia.
This is despite evidence to illustrate the increasing public health burden
of depression in the elderly, particularly within the context of an aging
Australian population.
The results of this study indicate that the mean scores for the brief
screening tool and GDS-15 were comparable, with no clinical depression
evident in the majority of patients but approximately one in four patients
(22.72%) experiencing mild to moderate depression. This suggests that a
brief screening for depression is appropriate in the context of ED presentation within the elderly. The majority of patients, encouragingly, did not
feel worthless, but did report that their situation felt hopeless. According
to patient reports, lowered mood was most significantly attributed to the

presence of multiple medical problems and associated decreased mobility.
Although quantitative results in this study have to be interpreted with caution
due to the relatively small sample size obtained, differences in depression
scores between recruitment and 6 months indicate relatively stable scores for
both the control and intervention groups. This may support patient reports
that depression may largely reflect factors related to medical circumstance
and functionality, an assertion that is supported by Travis, Lyness, Shields,
King, and Cox (2004) who found that depressive symptoms were significantly
associated with functional impairment and disability. It may therefore be
hypothesized that as, over time, functionality increases or worsens in elderly
patients, depression similarly changes. This requires further investigation in
future research.
Like previous studies, this research also showed that the elderly will
often not talk about symptoms of sadness and depression but will rather talk
about ‘feeling weak’, or ‘very bad’. These terms may often disguise depression by making feelings of sadness appear to relate to persistent physical
complaints and health issues, rather than psychological dysfunction. This
is likely to exacerbate poor recognition and management of depression in
elderly patients (Ell, 2006; Koenig et al., 1992; Raj, 2004; VanItallie, 2005)
and suggests that the use of patient education about depression, as integrated into the three integrated care management approaches (ALERT, HiT,
and TRACC) at St. Vincent’s Health, is essential to engender change in the
perception and discussion of depression among the elderly to ensure early
intervention and appropriate management.
Within this study, the intervention group demonstrated the most notable
trends in increased social support and functioning between recruitment and 6weeks post discharge in areas of social support and positive social interaction
and social functioning, with the control group experiencing a reduction in
scores over time or no change. Emotional support was the only aspect of
social functioning that appeared to increase for the control group although
this remained stable for the intervention group. The experience of affectionate
social support improved for both groups. As iterated above, these results have
not been statistically compared and therefore must be interpreted with caution.
However, within this study, the qualitative reports of patients confirmed the
significance of social support to the management of depression, particularly
in relation to support received from family members. This is supported by
Jeon (2004) who illustrates that family caregivers play an essential role in the
care of elderly patients, particularly those engaged primarily in communitybased care. The improvement trends in several areas of social support and
functioning over time for the intervention group illustrates the importance
of integrated care approaches for the management of depression not only
incorporating patient education about depression but also promoting family
and community linkages to ensure adequate social support, consistency in
care, and the promotion of positive health outcomes for these patients.

The emergency health care environment can present challenges in
responding to the elderly with depression as it is a high-stress, high-volume
environment. Yet, it provides a window of opportunity. The use of screening tools for depression in elderly patients and the provision of integrated
care teams, such at those within the ALERT, HiT, and TRACC programs at
St. Vincent’s Health, provide the opportunity for assessing and responding to patients screening positively for depression within this environment.
This facilitates appropriate follow-up medical care with the general practitioner and supports the isolated elderly person with limited mobility to
access community resources and services. This is supported by research that
demonstrates that EDs in Australia are appropriate settings for the detection
of mental health problems as the prevalence is high and patients may not
present elsewhere (Kinner et al., 2005; Scogin & Shah, 2006; VanItallie, 2005).
This research also stresses the importance of appropriate screening, assessment, and referral processes to ensure adequate support within emergency
health to facilitate consistent patient assessment and ensure appropriate,
ongoing patient care.
There are limitations inherent to the nature of this study. These primarily
relate to complex factors related to the assessment of elderly patients who
present to ED, particularly those with depression. Within this particular study,
although 771 patients were initially screened for depression and 66 were fully
assessed, the rate of consent for the participation in ongoing research was
significantly reduced with a final sample of 8 participants. As discussed, this
significantly reduced the power of this study, particularly related to the use of
quantitative measures. However, the corresponding use of both quantitative
and qualitative measures in this study ensured that the results obtained holistically reflect the experience of the sample recruited, despite this reduced
power. Significant factors that contributed to the reduced number of participants recruited for this study included previous psychiatric history and
complex medical needs. This is an area that requires future research to
ensure that the identification of depression in primary care settings for such
patients is accurate and timely.
It was anticipated that the findings of this research would contribute to
knowledge about the psychosocial and cultural factors that may contribute
to the presentation of depression in this patient cohort and about the role
and function of practitioners in the management of depression. It was also
anticipated that this research would illuminate the key outcome indicators
that are significant in directing the most appropriate management of depression in elderly patients while taking into consideration the needs of the
patient, co-morbid health conditions, and the role of community services.
Most significantly, it was hoped that this research would improve care and
health outcomes for elderly patients. Through the indication of the importance of patient education and depression, physical mobility and functioning,
and social support, this research suggests that the use of integrated care

approaches to the management of depression in the elderly who present
to ED is essential. This is necessary to improve health outcomes within this
patient population and work to reduce the high associated public health
burden.
Stemming from this research is the recommendation of the need for a
controlled study, with adequate power, into the efficacy of integrated care
approaches to the management of depression in elderly patients presenting
to ED; especially those with multiple medical problems who are socially
isolated and, or, financially vulnerable. This intervention may involve the
four screening questions for depression and Geriatric Depression Scale as
part of routine protocols for integrated care services, in combination with an
immediate treatment response and referral to a general practitioner in the
community for further management. The importance of concurrent linkage
and telephone follow up to facilitate and reduce barriers to community social
supports and where possible, engagement of the carer in this process, cannot
be underestimated.
