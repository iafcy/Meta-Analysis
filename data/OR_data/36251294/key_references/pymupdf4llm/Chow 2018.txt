#### Abstract

**Background and Objectives:** To examine the primary and secondary outcomes of a theory-driven group bereavement intervention for widowed older adults through a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
**Research Designs and Methods:** Twelve community centers providing health and social services for elderly people were
randomly assigned to the experimental condition, the dual-process bereavement group intervention-Chinese (DPBGI-C)
and to the control condition, the loss-oriented bereavement group intervention-Chinese (LOBGI-C). Both interventions
comprised weekly, 2-hr sessions for 7 weeks followed by a 4-hr outing in the eighth week. Of 215 widowed older adults
contacted and assessed, 125 eligible participants were interviewed three times—preintervention, postintervention, and at a
16-week follow-up—to assess complicated grief symptoms, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and social support.
**Results:** Using intention-to-treat analysis, both interventions produced improvements in grief, depression, and social support, but effect sizes were larger with the DPBGI-C. The participants in the DPBGI-C condition also reported reduced anxiety, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness, whereas those in the LOBGI-C condition did not. There were interactions
between intervention type and time with respect to grief, anxiety, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness.
**Discussion and Implications:** Although traditional LOBGI-C can help to reduce grief and depression in bereaved older
adults, the DPBGI-C was found to be superior as it had a greater and more extensive impact on outcomes. This is the first
study of the effectiveness of this evidence-based, theory-driven intervention for widowed Chinese older adults and has
implications for theory building and practice.

Widowhood is a common life experience for older people.
In Hong Kong, about one in two women aged 65 years or
older is widowed; the ratio is lower for men, at 1 in 10
(Census and Statistics Department, 2017). Most bereaved
people come to terms with their loss without formal intervention, but recent research suggests that about 20%–30%
of bereaved persons need some additional support and


approximately 10% are at risk of persistent grief issues
and require professional bereavement intervention (Aoun
et al., 2015; Bonanno, Wortman, & Nesse, 2004). The
_Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th_
edition, American Psychiatric Association, 2013) proposed
a bereavement-related disorder to be called “persistent
complex bereavement disorder” in an appendix entitled

“Conditions for Further Study,” but it is not yet a recognized
diagnosis. Similarly, it has been proposed that the upcoming ICD-11 should include a new disorder identified as prolonged grief disorder (PGD; Maercker et al., 2013). Recent
studies suggest that approximately 7%–10% of bereaved
people experience PGD (Kersting, Brähler, Glaesmer, &
Wagner, 2011), with the prevalence being 14% among the
Chinese population (Li & Prigerson, 2016). Older adults
(variably defined as being from 55 to 65 years and older)
are more likely to suffer from PGD than younger adults,
with estimated rates of 9%–25% (Simon, 2015).
Bereaved older adults are at greater risk of emotional,
mental, and physical health problems if they are socially
isolated (Perng & Renz, 2018). Their poor health outcomes may be linked to a reduction in self-care abilities
or loss of motivation to live in the absence of their spouse.
The normal-aged related deterioration of daily functions
is believed to make widowed older adults more vulnerable than their younger counterparts. In later life, loss of a
spouse means the loss of a life companion and confidante.
The diminishing number of children per couple, increasing childlessness (Cheng, Chan, Li, & Leung, 2014), and
the great geographic mobility of adult children means that
familial support for older adults is weakening, thus they are
increasingly reliant on a spouse and this makes conjugal
bereavement in later life more challenging. The diminishing
of familial support also affects bereaved older adults. People
who are widowed in old age are more likely to experience
loneliness than their married peers (Dahlberg, Agahi, &
Lennartsson, 2018), yet loneliness is rarely measured as an
outcome of bereavement interventions (Currier, Neimeyer,
& Berman, 2008). Loneliness was found to be a common
challenge for bereaved older adults, but those who had
greater social support from friends were less affected (Utz,
Swenson, Caserta, Lund, & de Vries, 2014). Researchers
have argued that recent social and economic developments
in China have increased the likelihood of loneliness (Chen,
Hicks, & While, 2014), and Chinese older adults who grew
up in the traditional family-oriented culture find loneliness more devastating than their Western peers (Goodwin,
Cook, & Yung, 2001). Weiss (1973) suggested that two
types of loneliness could be distinguished: emotional loneliness and social emotional loneliness. The former refers to
the absence of a significant other or someone to whom one
has an emotional attachment whereas the latter refers to
the absence of a sense of belonging to a social network.
Similarly, Utz and colleagues (2014) differentiated between
“feeling alone” and “being alone.”
Bereaved older adults are forced to confront new
demands for adjustment from the world whilst dealing
with separation distress following the loss of their spouse.
Hahn, Cichy, Small, and Almeida (2014) found that widowed older adults have reduced resilience in the face of
problems of everyday life and more physical symptoms in
response to home-related stressors than before the death
of spouse. Traditional bereavement interventions that


emphasize psychological needs might not address the multidimensional needs of bereaved persons, including support
to cope with daily tasks.
In recent decades, various types of intervention have
been developed to ease the possible adverse consequences
of bereavement (e.g., normal or complicated grief, depression, symptom distress) and facilitate positive adjustment
(e.g., improve coping, social adjustment, quality of life)
(see reviews by Neimeyer & Currier, 2009; Waller et al.,
2016; Wittouck, Van Autreve, De Jaegere, Portzky, & van
Heeringen, 2011). The studies have examined a range of
therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, supportive therapy, family-focused grief therapy, and interpersonal
psychotherapy (Waller et al., 2016). There is considerable
variability in the focus and effectiveness of the different
interventions. First, the efficacy of grief and bereavement
interventions varies according to level of need and circumstances surrounding the death (Boelen, 2016; Schut &
Stroebe, 2005). For example, in individuals who are grieving normally, grief interventions may actually interfere
with the natural grief process and result in greater distress
(Schut & Stroebe, 2005). Interventions aimed at treating
bereaved people with severe grief symptoms have had positive outcomes (Neimeyer & Currier, 2009). Second, metaanalyses of the efficacy of bereavement interventions have
consistently shown that their effects are modest or minimal
(Currier et al., 2008; Neimeyer & Currier, 2009; Wittouck
et al., 2011), comparing with that of general psychotherapy. This indicates the need for development of an effective
psychosocial bereavement intervention.
Third, according to Waller et al. (2016), few of the studies of bereavement interventions published between 2000
and 2013 were of high methodological quality. These
identified studies, which were mainly on individual-based
interventions, were different in nature, and showed mixed
results. Since then, newer randomized controlled trials of
grief-specific cognitive behavioral interventions (Bryant
et al., 2014; Rosner, Pfoh, Kotoučov, & Hagl, 2014; Shear
et al., 2014) and internet-based interventions (Eisma et al.,
2015; Litz et al., 2014) have produced more promising
results in diverse settings and populations. In particular,
Shear et al. (2014) and Nam (2016) found differences in the
grief reactions and adjustment of older adults assigned to
a complicated grief treatment and those assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy or supportive counseling; however,
only 51% of the intervention group responded to treatment
(Shear et al., 2014). Other potential limitations of previous
intervention studies are the considerable heterogeneity of
the samples (e.g., diversity in the loss of relationship, cause
of death and bereavement period) and the fact that most
have been developed and validated in Western countries.
The extant evidence suggests that very few bereavement
interventions have any effect and those that do are all individual-based, but not group, interventions. Although grief
is a personal process it is affected by social context. In particular, loneliness is a major challenge for those bereaved in

later life (Tang & Chow, 2017). Supiano and Luptak (2014)
found that a group bereavement intervention including
complicated grief treatment was as successful at addressing
grief symptoms and was more time-efficient as the same
intervention delivered collectively. They further suggested
that group format might be beneficial in that they offer a
supportive environment and reduce social isolation, which
is particularly common in older adults. Overall, there has
been limited systematic research into group delivery of
bereavement interventions and most of the studies have
only examined grief and depression, not loneliness, social
support or anxiety. This study was a randomized controlled
trial of a theory-driven, group bereavement intervention,
examining a wider range of outcomes.

#### Theoretical Framework: The Dual-Process  Model


bereaved mothers effectively. Yet at a micro level, cultural
factors should be taken into account when exploring the
nuanced meanings embedded in the emotional and behavioral coping process. The content of restoration-oriented
coping in America that dealt with financial and legal issues
as well as social participation were not relevant to Hong
Kong Chinese situation as Chinese people rarely discuss
their financial situation with others. Chinese people tend
to be concerned about their health, particularly after the
death of a spouse, thus the themes of health-related topics
were added. The themes of attending to life changes and
household chores in the American model were kept as they
were universal. Moreover, rituals were usually used in the
Chinese funerals or bereavement groups for expressing
emotions in a structured way. A commonly used lettinggo ritual was included in the Chinese model. The participants released fishes into the wild, symbolizing the letting
go of pain and suffering attached to the bereavement. The
Taoist philosophy considers releasing animals into the wild
to be doing a good deed for the deceased. The length of
the intervention was reduced to eight sessions. The content was also reorganized and the between-session oscillations were replaced by within-group oscillations from the
third to sixth session. Lastly, as Chinese people are pragmatic, the last session included some practical cooking, to
help participants start putting what they had learnt about
nutrition and self-care into practice. The DPBGI-Chinese
(DPBGI-C) group faithfully kept the oscillations between
the loss-oriented and restoration-oriented coping, which is
the core essence of the model, though the length and part of
the content were slightly different from the American one.
The themes of loss-oriented coping in the American model
were also straightly followed. The DPBGI-C has already
been piloted in a sample of older Chinese adults in Hong
Kong and was found to be promising (Chow, 2015).
Based on the pilot study of the DPBGI-C, we hypothesized that at the end of the intervention and at a 16-week
follow-up, the DPBGI-C participants would exhibit
greater improvements in both the primary outcomes, grief
reactions, anxiety and depression and the secondary outcomes, loneliness and social support, than loss-oriented
bereavement group intervention-Chinese (LOBGI-C)
participants.

#### Methods


Stroebe and Schut (1999, 2015) introduced a dual-process
model of coping with bereavement that consists of three
elements: loss-oriented coping, restoration-oriented coping,
and oscillation. Loss-oriented coping involves dealing with
the loss experience. It includes grief work, or more generally
the appraising and processing of all the various aspects of
the loss experience. Restoration-oriented coping addresses
the life changes which may arise from bereavement, including adjustment to new roles, identities and relationships,
and new experiences. Oscillation refers to the inevitable
alternation between loss- and restoration-oriented coping
processes. Dynamic back-and-forth movement between
these two modes of coping predicts better mental and physical health outcomes in the bereaved.
In a departure from conventional bereavement interventions, which are loss-oriented and focus solely on separation distress, the American coauthors (M.C. and D.L.)
have paid extra attention to the handling of adjustment to
life without the deceased (Caserta, Utz, Lund, Swenson, &
de Vries, 2014; Caserta, Lund, Utz, & Tabler, 2016; Lund,
Caserta, Utz, & de Vries, 2010). A dual-process bereavement group intervention (DPBGI) was developed and tested
systematically. A novel feature of the intervention was that
oscillations between restoration-oriented and loss-oriented
coping were incorporated into the design of the intervention
(Caserta et al., 2016; Lund et al., 2010). The intervention
placed equal emphasis on loss- and restoration-oriented
coping and was delivered as a group intervention to facilitate mutual learning about restoration-oriented coping.
This intervention was used as a model for the intervention
described and evaluated here.
Although the expression of grief appears to be similar
in Western and Chinese cultures (Li & Prigerson, 2016),
there are sociocultural differences in the grieving process (Bonanno, Papa, Lalande, Zhang, & Noll, 2005). In
particular, Chen and colleagues (2017) found that dualprocess model, which was developed in Western countries, captured the overall coping mechanisms of Chinese


##### Research Design
The study was a single-blind cluster randomized controlled
trial with two arms. Cluster randomization randomizes
centers instead of individuals: all the people from a given
center are allocated to the same condition (Meurer &
Lewis, 2015). This method was used to avoid contamination of experimental and control group participants at the
same study sites. It was also administratively efficient as it
was easier to recruit adequate participants for one group
than for two groups.


-----

The experimental intervention incorporated restorationoriented and loss-oriented components as well as oscillations (i.e., DPBGI-C), whereas the control intervention was
a conventional loss-oriented intervention (LOBGI-C) comprising the loss-oriented component only, which is typical
of the standard of care in community-based bereavement
support groups. Both interventions involved weekly sessions over a period of 8 weeks, thus the “quantity” of intervention was the same in both conditions. Participants in
both conditions were assessed at three points (preintervention, postintervention, and 16-week follow-up) by trained
interviewers.

##### Recruitment and Power Analysis


Older adults (60 years or older) whose spouse had died
within the previous 2 years were recruited. As Neimeyer
and Currier (2009) suggested that it is more appropriate
to offer bereavement intervention to those showing intense
separation distress after their loss, we only recruited people
who scored with relatively high scores on a measure of complicated grief (i.e., > 22 on the Inventory of Complicated
Grief). The exclusion criteria were loss of a child or parent
in the previous 2 years, remarriage since the bereavement,
residence in a long-term care facility, receipt of psychiatric
treatment before the death of the spouse (excluding treatment for reactive depression), and impaired mental function sufficient to affect participation in interviews.
Participants were recruited from two types of study site:
medical service units (hospitals and geriatric clinics) and
social service units (district counseling and social centers
for elderly people). Study sites were stratified by nature and
type of service and randomized to the experimental and
control conditions in order to reduce biases due to differences in setting and service type.


##### Procedure

Twelve study sites participated: nine social service units and
three medical service units. As a number of service centers
declined to participate some types of referral source were
underrepresented. One of the centers that agreed to participate did not succeed in recruiting enough participants to
run a bereavement group. As the randomization of groups
was carried out independently for each center, there was
no guarantee that the size of the control and experimental
groups would be similar. Seven centers were assigned to
the intervention condition and five to the control condition
and the number of participants in the two conditions was
also uneven.
Staff at the study sites invited widowed older adults who
fulfilled the inclusion criteria to participate in the study.
Upon completion of the study all participants, received
HK$300 for participating. The University of Hong Kong/
Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster Institutional
Review Board and the Kowloon West Cluster Research
Ethics Committee approved the study (Reference Numbers:
UW 13–338 and KW/EX-14–167 [79-05]). All participants
provided written consent before taking part in the study.


##### Interventions

The experimental and control interventions both consisted
of eight sessions. The theme of each session is shown in
Table 1. The DPBGI-C integrated new cultural elements
into the original DPBGI. For example, dietary concerns and
Chinese ideas about health were added as restoration topics
and the therapeutic ritual of freeing of fish was introduced
in the last session. In addition, participants’ knowledge of
cooking and nutrition was tested through shared preparation of a meal in the final session of the DPBGI-C. These
modifications were intended to promote a continuing bond,

a cultural feature that is important to bereaved Chinese
people (Chow & Chan, 2006; Fong & Chow, 2018).
Two user manuals and two facilitator manuals were
produced for DPBGI-C and LOBGI-C, respectively.
Groups in both conditions were led by experienced
bereavement counselors who were mentored and supervised by the first author (A.Y.M.C.). Group leaders were
supported by an assistant facilitator from the center
which had recruited the participants so that someone was
available to handle any adverse or unexpected participant reactions.

##### Measurements

**Primary Outcomes**
Grief reactions were measured with the Chinese Inventory
of Complicated Grief which comprises 19 items on grief
symptoms relating to spousal loss. In a sample of older
adults, the Chinese version had an internal reliability of
Cronbach’s α = .92 (Chow & Fu, 2010).
Emotional reactions in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms were measured with the Chinese version of the
_Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Leung, Wing,_
Kwong, Lo, & Shum, 1999). Half of its 14 items measure
anxiety and the other half measure depression. Cronbach’s α
for the full Chinese-Cantonese version was .86; values for the
depression and anxiety subscales were .82 and .77, respectively.

control conditions.

Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24.0 software on the
basis of intention-to-treat. In other words, all 125 participants who consent to participate, met the inclusion criteria
and were allocated to one of the conditions at baseline were
included in the analysis, regardless of subsequent attendance
at intervention sessions (Armijo-Olivo, Warren, & Magee,
2009; McCoy, 2017). Missing data were handled by multiple imputation with fully conditional specification. Since
19.2% participants had missing data, 20 imputations (and
50 iterations) were conducted (White, Royston, & Wood,
2011). Background variables (i.e., participants’ age, gender,
education level, cause of bereavement, time since bereavement, and age of the deceased) and behavioral variables (i.e.,
grief, anxiety, depression, social and emotional loneliness and
perceived social support at all three time-points) were entered
into the model used to estimate the missing data. We then
used paired t tests to compare baseline values with postintervention and follow-up values to assess the direct changes
and long-term effects of both interventions. Pooled means
and standardized deviations were used to compute the effect
sizes of differences in Cohen’s d between the conditions for
repeated measures (Morris, 2008) (values of Cohen’s _d <_

mixed model was used to examine the longitudinal intervention effects. The model included one categorical random
effect (Participant), one categorical fixed effect (Condition:
DPBGI-C vs LOBGI-C), one ordinal fixed effect (Time: baseline vs post-test vs 16-week follow-up), and the Condition ×
Time interaction. Pooled results of F test by the fixed effect of
Condition × Time estimated the difference of effects between
the two intervention methods. Finally, we compared the magnitude of the two interventions by calculating the changes in
score between baseline and the post-treatment and follow-up
assessments for both conditions and assessing the difference
between the conditions using a one-sided, two-sample t test.
The sample of 101 participants who completed the three
time points of data collection (i.e., nonimputed data) was
included to evaluate the intervention effects in terms of
changes within the group over time and difference between
the changes of groups over time.

#### Results


##### Primary Outcomes
The intention-to-treat analysis showed that participants
in both groups had lower levels of grief reaction and


depression at the postintervention and follow-up assessments (Table 3). Effect sizes for changes in all primary
outcome variables were higher for the DPBGI-C than
the LOBGI-C, with the exception of grief at followup. Only the DPBGI-C produced a reduction in anxiety. There were Condition × Time effects for both grief
(F (2, 123) = 3.37, p < .05) and anxiety (F (2, 123) = 3.39,
_p < .05)._
The effect sizes for differences of the two groups in
change scores at postintervention and follow-up are
reported in Table 4. At the postintervention assessment,
DPBGI-C was found to have statistically significant better results than the LOBGI-C with moderate effective
sizes (Cohen’s _d ranged from 0.35 to 0.56) in all three_
primary outcome variables. At follow-up assessment,
DPBGI-C still had a statistical significant improvement
in anxiety than LOBGI-C, with a moderate effect size
(d = 0.41).
The findings were similar when only the nonimputed
data (N = 101) were analyzed. Thus, our first hypothesis,
that the DPBGI-C would produce a greater improvement
in the primary outcome variables than the LOBGI-C, was
supported.

##### Secondary Outcomes

DPBGI-C participants also experienced reductions in emotional and social loneliness, but LOBGI-C participants did
not (Table 3). There was a Condition × Time interaction for
both types of loneliness. LOBGI-C participants reported
higher levels of social support after the intervention, but the
change was smaller at the follow-up assessment, whereas
DPBGI-C participants reported a larger increase in social
support, which was sustained at follow-up.
The reduction in loneliness was greater in the DPBGI-C
condition than the LOBGI-C condition (Table 4). The effect
sizes for the differences between two groups in emotional
and social loneliness at postintervention were d = 0.39 and
_d = 0.50 respectively. The effect size for the difference in_
emotional loneliness increased to 0.63 at the follow-up
assessment.
Analysis of the nonimputed data produced similar
results with respect to the between- and within-condition
comparisons. In summary, the second hypothesis, that the
DPBGI-C would produce a greater improvement in secondary outcomes than the LOBGI-C, was also supported.


#### Discussion

The results of this trial show that DPBGI-C was statistically superior to the traditional LOBGI-C in reducing grief,
anxiety, and loneliness in widowed older adults. Although
the two interventions had the same (group) format and
similar levels of input, the DPBGI-C also proved superior
as a method of increasing participants’ perception of the
social support available to them. Currier and colleagues
(2008) concluded from an analysis of 61 outcome studies
of bereavement interventions that universal intervention
(for everyone) generally had no effect. There were only
mild effects for selective intervention (to high-risk groups)
or moderately large effect for indicated (to bereaved people
experiencing high distress) intervention. In contrast, both
interventions used in this study produced much higher
effect sizes in grief reduction relative to baseline, as shown
in Table 3. Similarly, both interventions also produced
reductions in depression that were of higher magnitude
than the reductions in the indicated interventions found in
the review of Currier et al. (2008). The reduction of depression in the DPBGI-C was found to be much larger than


-----

the LOBGI-C. The LOBGI-C focused on loss, whereas only
half the content of the DPBGI-C did so. It appears that
the restoration-oriented content included the DPBGI-C
provided additional benefits, which supports the idea that
restoration-oriented coping processes contribute crucially
to adjustment to bereavement (Stroebe et al., 1999, 2010).
Furthermore, the findings of our trial are consistent with
those relating to use of the original DPBGI in the United
States. The original DPBGI was found to contribute to
changes in grief and depression (Utz, Caserta, & Lund,
2013), but its effects were similar to those of a traditional
grief intervention. In contrast, our version of the DPBGI-C
did produce greater changes in grief than the traditional
intervention with which it was compared, indicating that
the feasibility and effectiveness of a bereavement care may
be improved by cultural adaptation.
The DPBGI-C reduced anxiety relative to baseline
both immediately after the 8-week intervention and at the
16-week follow-up, whereas the LOBGI-C did not affect
anxiety. As the restoration-oriented topics included guidance on practical coping strategies such as building social
relationships, following a healthy diet and taking care
of one’s health, it is plausible to suggest that such practical coping strategies account for the reduction in anxiety observed following the DPBGI-C, particularly anxiety
related to the challenges of facing life without the deceased.
These postintervention effect sizes of changes in bereavement outcomes were similar to the recent finding of comparing complicated grief treatment with interpersonal
psychotherapy (Glickman, Shear, & Wall, 2016).
The within group effects of the interventions were
smaller at the follow-up assessment than immediately after
the intervention, but still detectable. Again, our results are
better than those reported in the meta-analyses of the longterm effects of indicated intervention (Currier et al., 2008).
For between group analyses, the effect sizes in grief and
depression at the postintervention assessment were greater
than the average effect sizes reported for bereavement interventions in the earlier meta-analysis (Currier et al., 2008).
Although the between-condition differences were not statistically significant at the follow-up assessment, they were
still greater in absolute terms than the comparable differences calculated in the meta-analysis, which were also
statistically nonsignificant (Currier et al., 2008). Notably,
the between-group differences in the meta-analysis relate
to comparisons of an intervention with a no-intervention
condition (a waiting-list control group or placebo). We
compared our novel intervention with a traditional, grieffocused intervention and had therefore anticipated that
effect sizes would be much lower than in studies comparing
an intervention group with a no-treatment group.
This study investigated the impact of bereavement interventions on loneliness, a facet of bereavement that has generally been ignored in earlier intervention studies (Nam,
2016; Shear et al., 2014; Supiano & Luptak, 2014). The
superior effect of the DPBGI-C on loneliness is a surprising


result. Both interventions were delivered in a very similar
format—over eight sessions, with groups of similar sizes.
All the groups were facilitated by social workers with similar professional experience. There were also no differences
between the backgrounds of participants receiving the two
interventions. Therefore the difference in the content of
the two group interventions probably explains their differential effects on loneliness and perceived support. The
loss-orientation of the LOBGI-C may draw participants’
attention to their unique relationship with their deceased
spouse and is a more personal and internal process. In comparison, half of the time in the DPBGI-C is spent on restoration-oriented topics, which are more external and are
shared among the participants. We suggest that discovering common experiences and sharing restoration-oriented
coping processes helps to create a social support network
among a group receiving the DPBGI-C, as well as reduces
the loneliness. The LOBGI-C focused on the relationship
with the deceased. It is likely that simply sharing and thinking about the deceased without also working on restoration-oriented coping fails to address a bereaved person’s
yearning and has no effect on emotional loneliness. Only
the DPBGI-C reduced social loneliness and the reduction
was not maintained at follow-up. As the postintervention
evaluation took place a week after the eight consecutive
weekly meetings that comprised the interventions, the temporary reduction in social loneliness might reflect group
members’ sense of being part of a social network. As there
was no further contact among group members between the
postintervention and follow-up, this sense of being part of
a social network may have dissipated fairly quickly, leading to a rebound in social loneliness, although in descriptive terms social loneliness was still lower at the follow-up
assessment than at baseline.
This study has limitations. One would expect the decision by a number of service centers not to participate in
the study, the unequal number of intervention and control groups, and participant drop-out to have affected the
findings. However, there were no demographic or baseline differences between participants assigned to the two
conditions. Similarly, comparison of outcome measures in
the intention-to-treat and completed intervention analyses
revealed no differences. Thus, it appears that the impact
of these limitations was not as great as might have been
expected. It took an unexpectedly long time to recruit
adequate numbers of participants. All study participants
were widowed older Chinese adults and the majority of the
sample was women. We used stringent selection criteria,
including only those who reported high levels of grief and
had not lost another significant family member in the previous 2 years. Consequently, any generalization of the findings to other bereaved populations should be made with
caution.
A more rigorous study design would have included a
waiting-list control condition in addition to the two conditions compared here, but this was precluded by concerns


-----

that it would be unethical to place participants—especially
those display high levels of grief—on a waiting list for at
least 16 weeks, until all data had been collected from the
intervention groups. Ideally, another arm of comparison
with the original DPBGI will offer more insights about
the suitability of the translation. As this study is hoped to
provide evidence of effective bereavement intervention to
Chinese widowed persons, the commonly-used approach
in Chinese bereaved population was adopted instead. In
addition the centers would have refused to take part in
the study if it had included a 16-week waiting-list control
condition. Assessment after longer follow-up period would
reveal more information. The RCT study of treatment of
complicated grief in elderly persons by Shear et al.’s (2014)
randomized controlled trial of a 16-week intervention
used a 20-week follow-up and Bryant et al. (2014) used a
26-week follow-up when assessing a 14-week intervention.
Our use of a 16-week follow-up period for an 8-week intervention is in line with practice in other studies.
Despite these limitations, our study addresses a significant gap in the bereavement intervention literature. It
is a good example of the development of a theoreticallygrounded intervention and subsequent rigorous testing
via a randomized controlled trial using a traditional intervention as the control treatment. The experimental intervention is a scrupulous cultural adaptation of a model
developed in the West. Klass and Chow (2011) argued that
culture prescribes acceptable grief and affects how grief is
handled; nevertheless, here we have reported the successful
cultural translation of a bereavement intervention.
This study advances bereavement research methodology
in several ways. First, it extends the common outcomes of
grief and depression to include anxiety, loneliness and social
support. Second, the control condition involved a commonlyused bereavement-specific group intervention (i.e., treatment
as usual) of similar duration to the experimental intervention, whereas most previous studies of the efficacy of group
bereavement interventions used waiting-list controls or noncompatible control group interventions. Although a review
by Neimeyer and Currier (2009) noted the existence of a
very small population who experience “treatment-induced
distress,” a review by Waller et al. (2016) did not find any
group intervention that produced worse outcomes than a
no-intervention condition. Still, the inclusion of the commonly adopted intervention is more ethically appropriate.
Third, as Neimeyer and Currier (2009) concluded that
bereavement interventions have the greatest impact on
those showing the most distress; we offered our interventions as indicated interventions rather than as universal
interventions. This is in line with the suggestion that potential users of bereavement service services should be screened
(Aoun, Rumbold, Howting, Bolleter, & Breen, 2017) and
may partly explain why we observed bigger effects than Utz
et al. (2014). Moreover, we carried out both intention-totreat and completed intervention analyses and found that
the results were comparable.


This study provides empirical support for the dual-process
model of bereavement. It also sheds light on intervention
“dosage,” particularly in relation to loss-oriented coping techniques. Although the loss-oriented component of the DPBGI-C
took up only half the time of the LOBGI-C (which focused
exclusively on loss-oriented techniques), it produced greater
reductions in grief, depression, and loneliness in DPBGI-C,
leading to the somewhat surprising conclusion that in this
context, less is more. The introduction of restoration-oriented
components apparently played a crucial role in reducing
anxiety and emotional loneliness in DPBGI-C participants.
Further analyses will be undertaken to explore the mechanism
underlying the changes induced by the intervention.
The practical contribution of this study is that it demonstrates the effectiveness of a group bereavement intervention,
complementing existing evidence of the effectiveness of oneto-one complicated grief treatment (Shear et al., 2014, 2016)
and cognitive behavioral therapy (Bryant et al., 2014). This
study showed that the DPBGI-C is effective for bereaved
older Chinese adults experiencing particular difficulty in
coping with their loss. The better result might be partially
attributed to the collective nature of Chinese, which might
not be totally applicable to participants of other cultures
who favor individualism. Nevertheless, this group alternative may involve less input of professional resources for
each bereaved person, yet achieve the same, if not a better,
outcome. The group format is more resource-efficient than
one-to-one treatment and provides added value, as group
members form a social support network and realize that others share some of their experiences and feelings. Moreover,
because manuals have been produced for the DPBGI-C it
should be possible for others to deliver the intervention.

#### Conclusions


Based on systematic analysis of the evidence collected we
conclude that the DPBGI-C is more effective than traditional bereavement group interventions. Added to the
limited efficacy studies of bereavement intervention for
bereaved persons developed in the West, this study contributes evidence of bereavement intervention effectiveness for
Chinese bereaved persons. The adoption of the dual-process
model as the theoretical framework also allowed us to shed
light on the role of restoration in bereavement interventions.
