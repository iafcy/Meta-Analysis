Abstract
In the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) it was investigated whether single women, 55 years of age and older,
improved with regard to self-management ability, well-being, and social and emotional loneliness after having participated
in a newly designed self-management group intervention based on the Self-Management of Well-being (SMW) theory. The
expected mediating effect of self-management ability on well-being was not found. Although self-management ability,
well-being and loneliness improved significantly in the intervention group immediately after the intervention, and also
remained at this improved level after six months, there was also improvement in the control group after six months,
rendering the longer-term differences between the groups non-significant. It can, however, be concluded that, although the
longer-term effectiveness could not be proven, this SMW theory-based intervention seems to be useful in supporting older
women to improve their self-management ability and well-being.

Introduction


Since modern Western societies now provide us with
very good medical and social facilities, the lifeexpectancy of older people is increasing. At the same
time, more older people, and especially women,
are living alone. Additionally, sociological changes,
such as the individualization of society, changes in
social networks, and changes in health care systems
are forcing older people, and especially women, to
rely more on their own resources (Lewis, 2003).
This means that self-management abilities are
becoming more important. Until now, self-management interventions for older people have focused
primarily on changes in the life-style behaviour of
people with chronic conditions (Ersek, Turner,
McCurry, Gibbons, & Miller Kraybill, 2003; Lorig
& Holman, 2003; Van Eijken, Wensing, & De
Konink, 2004). Fewer self-management intervention
studies have focused on reducing social isolation, or
promoting well-being.
One of the main factors that contribute to social
isolation is loss (in many forms). Because loss is
often considered to be beyond a person’s control, it
is argued that it is very difficult to design successful


interventions to counter social isolation. Stevens and
Van Tilburg (2000) evaluated a friendship course to
promote well-being and to alleviate loneliness in
older women. They found a reduction in loneliness
not only among the women who participated in the
course, but also in the matched control group.
In a recent review of the empirical literature on the
effectiveness of interventions to reduce social isolation, Findlay (2003) concluded that, although
numerous interventions have been implemented
world wide, there is very little evidence showing
that they work (see also Andersson, 1998).
Moreover, the existing evaluations of effectiveness
are often flawed by weak methodologies, and only
a few have been performed in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs).
The aim of the present study was to design a short
group intervention for single women, 55 years of age
and older, and to evaluate its effectiveness in an
RCT. The aim of the intervention was to increase
well-being by improving self-management abilities,
and thus reducing social and emotional loneliness.
Social loneliness is characterized by a lack of social

integration and embeddedness (Weiss, 1973), and
emotional loneliness relates to the absence of a
reliable attachment figure, such as a partner (Van
Baarsen, Snijders, Smit, & Van Duijn, 2001).
How does the proposed intervention differ from
others? First of all, it is based on a theoretical
framework, whereas most interventions lack such
a basis. This framework is the Self-Management of
Well-being (SMW) theory (Steverink, Lindenberg,
& Slaets, 2005), which elaborates on the theory of
Social Production Functions (SPF) (Lindenberg,
1996; Lindenberg, 2001; Ormel, Lindenberg,
Steverink, & Verbrugge, 1999; Steverink &
Lindenberg, 2006; Steverink, Lindenberg, &
Ormel, 1998). The central assumption of the SPF
theory is that each individual strives to improve
overall subjective well-being by realizing physical
and social well-being, and that this is accomplished
by satisfying five basic human needs also known as
the basic dimensions of well-being: comfort and
stimulation (for physical well-being), and affection,
behavioural confirmation, and status (for social wellbeing). Comfort refers to the satisfaction of basic
physical needs, such as food, drink, rest, and the
absence of pain. Stimulation refers to challenging
and interesting events, and the absence of boredom.
Affection is the feeling that others care and one cares
for oneself. Behavioural confirmation is the feeling of
doing the right thing in the eyes of others and in
one’s own eyes. Finally, status refers to the feeling of
being better than others in the eyes of others and in
one’s own eyes (see also Steverink & Lindenberg,
2006).
The SMW theory elaborates on the SPF theory by
specifying a set of six core self-management abilities
which enable people to achieve and maintain the
resources that are needed to satisfy the five basic
needs (i.e., dimensions) of well-being. Take, for
example, the need for affection, which may be
satisfied by having friends (as possible sources of
affection). According to the SMW theory, the
following six self-management abilities are important. Prerequisites in achieving and maintaining
friends are the ability to take initiatives in making
friends, and the ability to be self-efficacious with
regard to one’s own behaviour in making friends and
being a friend. The maintenance of a friendship
furthermore requires the ability to invest in the
friendship, which again requires the ability to have a
positive frame of mind with regard to this friendship
in the future (necessary for investment behaviour).
Moreover, there are two additional self-management
abilities that help to maximize the achievement and
maintenance of friendship. The first is the ability to
find and maintain multifunctionality in a friendship:
a multifunctional friend is a person who can satisfy
one’s need for affection, but at the same time, for
example, supports the fulfilment of other needs,
such as the need for stimulation (e.g., participating
in interesting activities or sports) The underlying


Self-management of well-being in older women 477

assumption is that multifunctionality in friendship
yields more overall well-being than unifunctionality.
The final self-management ability is the ability to
take care of variety with regard to friendship: taking
care of variety simply means making sure of
more than one friend. ‘Variety’ will make one less
vulnerable for potential loss in the future, and is
therefore an important self-management ability in
the process of aging.
Therefore, according to this theory, there are at
least six self-management abilities that are important
for the optimal management of important needs and
resources during the process of aging (for details see
Steverink et al., 2005). Moreover, each of the
abilities is important in itself, but together they also
accumulate to produce higher levels of overall selfmanagement ability. Therefore, the abilities are
addressed separately, but also as a composite.
Previous intervention studies (RCTs) based on the
SMW theory have shown positive results: Frieswijk,
Steverink, Buunk and Slaets (2006) evaluated
a bibliotherapy for frail older persons and found
a significant increase in self-management ability and
well-being in the intervention group, compared to
the controls. Similar results were reported in the
evaluation of an individualized self-management
intervention among older hospital patients
(Schuurmans, 2004). So far, however, no group
intervention based on this theory has been evaluated.
The second difference between the intervention
evaluated in the present study and most other
interventions is that in the present study the framework that was used for designing the intervention
was also explicitly applied to the evaluation of the
effectiveness of the intervention. As Cattan and
White (cited in Findlay, 2003) argued, one of the
criteria for effective interventions is that the evaluation fits the intervention and includes a process
evaluation. For the present study this means, first of
all, that the six self-management abilities that were
addressed in the intervention were also measured
explicitly. Secondly, it means that their hypothesized
mediating function in increasing well-being was
evaluated explicitly (cf. Frieswijk et al., 2006;
Schuurmans, 2004).
Based on these considerations, a short theorybased group intervention was designed and evaluated in an RCT. It was expected that the women
who completed the intervention would improve
their self-management abilities and that, consequently their well-being would improve compared
to the women who had been randomly assigned to
a control condition. A decrease in social and
emotional loneliness was also expected for the
women in the intervention group. Moreover, in
order to investigate the extent to which such a short
intervention (only six sessions) could have longerterm effects, the effectiveness of the intervention was
evaluated again after six months

Methods

Sample and study design

Potential participants were recruited in 2004
through advertisements in local newspapers in two
regions of the Netherlands. Single communitydwelling women, 55 years of age and older, were
asked to respond by phone if they missed having
people around them, wished to have more friends,
participated in very few leisure activities, or had
trouble in initiating activities. Eligible women
received a booklet containing information about
the study and the course ‘Giving life more
LUSTER’, together with an application form. After
having applied, 142 women completed the pre-test
(T0) questionnaire, after which they were randomly
assigned to either the intervention group (n ¼ 63)
or the control group (n ¼ 79). The first post-test
questionnaire (T1, after about six weeks, when the
course ended) was completed by 119 women, and
the second post-test questionnaire (T2, after about
six months) was completed by 98 women.

Intervention

The course was supervised by two female leaders
and consisted of six meetings, each lasting 2½ hours.
The women met in groups of 8–12, for six
consecutive weeks. Guided by the SMW theory,
each meeting focused on one or more of the six selfmanagement abilities. The women were taught to
apply these abilities to the five basic needs (dimensions) of well-being, which were referred to with
the acronym GLANS, which is Dutch for ‘luster’
(G for Gemak [Comfort], L for Leuke bezigheden

[Stimulation], A for Affectie [Affection], N for
Netwerk [Behavioral confirmation], and S for
Sterke punten [Status]). During the first meeting
the ‘GLANS-plate with five slices’ was introduced.
This is comparable to the food plate with five slices
that is used in the Netherlands to stimulate healthy
eating habits. The women were then asked to
consider their own GLANS-plate and to ‘selfdiagnose’ their own situation: which aspects of the
plate they missed, or would like to change or to work
on. During the second and subsequent meetings
the women learned how to work with their own
GLANS-plate by adding activities and people to the
slices. In the third meeting the women learned how
to set goals for themselves (improving their ability to
take initiatives) and how to make these goals
realistic, taking small steps in order to be successful
in achieving these goals (i.e., be self-efficacious).
Making combinations between the slices (i.e., taking
care of multifunctionality) was the theme of the
fourth meeting, and in the fifth meeting it was
stressed that it is very important to have reserves in
each of the slices (i.e., taking care of variety) in order
to have some activities or people to fall back upon
when losses occur, in health, persons or activities


The sixth and last meeting focused on how to
maintain what has been achieved (i.e., investment).
Throughout the course a lot of attention was paid to
positive thinking (i.e., a positive frame of mind), by
challenging negative thoughts and replacing them
with positive thoughts. At the end of each meeting
the women were given homework for the next
meeting and a short summary of the meeting was
handed out. The paperwork could be kept in a ringbinder which the women had been given during the
first meeting.

Measures

Self-management abilities. Self-management abilities
were measured with the Self-Management Ability
Scale (SMAS-30, Schuurmans et al., 2005). This
scale consists of 30 items and six sub-scales, each
referring to one of the six self-management abilities:
taking initiatives, self-efficacy, investment behaviour,
positive frame of mind, multifunctionality and
variety (cf. SMW theory). Examples of items are:
‘Are you able to let others know that you care about
them?’ (self-efficacy); ‘The activities I enjoy, I do
together with others’ (multifunctionality); ‘Do you
have different ways to relax when necessary?’
(variety). Some sub-scales are scored on a fivepoint Likert scale, and others on a six-point scale.
All scores were transformed to a 100-point scale.
The internal consistency of the overall scale was
0.91. The scale has been tested in several studies and
has been found to have good psychometric properties (Schuurmans et al., 2005).

Well-being. The Social Production Function Index
Level Scale (SPF-IL, Nieboer, Lindenberg,
Boomsma, & Van Bruggen, 2005) was used to
assess well-being and its five dimensions. This scale
consists of 15 items (� ¼ 0.79), with five sub-scales:
comfort, stimulation, affection, behavioural confirmation, and status, each containing three items.
Examples are: ‘Are your activities challenging to
you?’ (stimulation); ‘Do you feel useful to others?’
(behavioural confirmation); ‘Are you known for
the things you have accomplished?’ (status). All
sub-scales are scored on a four-point Likert scale.
The scale has been extensively tested and has been
found to have good psychometric properties
(Nieboer et al., 2005).

Loneliness. Loneliness was measured according to
the scale developed by De Jong Gierveld and
Kamphuis (1985), which is an 11-item questionnaire
with five positive and six negative items. The positive
items assess a sense of belonging and the absence of
a discrepancy in the area of desired relationships
(social loneliness), for example, ‘I can rely on my
friends whenever I need them’. The negative items
measure emotional loneliness, for example, ‘I miss
having a really close friend’ There are five answering


-----

categories: ‘yes!’, ‘yes’, ‘more or less’, ‘no’, and ‘no!’.
Scores were dichotomized according to the procedure suggested by the authors of the scale, so that
the scores ranged from 0 (not lonely) to 11
(extremely lonely). The internal consistency of the
overall scale was 0.83. In the present study the entire
scale was analyzed, as well as the two sub-scales of
social and emotional loneliness. The scale is widely
used and has been found to be a reliable and valid
instrument (Van Tilburg & De Leeuw, 1991).

Other variables. Marital status, children, and
physical functioning were also investigated to find
out whether the groups differed on these measures.
Level of physical functioning was measured with the
six-item Physical Functioning sub-scale of the MOS
Short Form General Health Survey (Kempen,
Brilman, Heyink, & Ormel, 1995; Stewart, Hays, &
Ware, 1988). The total score was transformed to
a range from 0–100, a high score indicating better
physical functioning. The internal consistency of the
scale was 0.74. The scale meets the traditional
psychometric criteria for validity and reliability
(Stewart et al., 1988).

Results

Participants

The pre-test (T0) questionnaire was completed by
142 women, after which 63 women were randomly
assigned to the intervention group and 79 to the
control group. The first post-test (T1) questionnaire,
at about six weeks after T0 (i.e., immediately after
the end of the course), was completed by 46 women
in the intervention group and 73 in the control
group, and the second post-test (T2) questionnaire,
at about six months after T0, was completed by 36
women in the intervention group and 62 controls.
A total of 13 women dropped out before the end of
the intervention. The reasons for drop-out were
diverse. Some women felt that the intervention was
too much of a mental or physical burden; some felt
that they did not fit in with the group; and others felt
that they did not learn anything new from the
intervention. Four other women did not even attend
the first meeting. When they were phoned by the


Self-management of well-being in older women 479

researcher they were either ill, had doubts about
participation or were unable to schedule the intervention in their agenda. Another group of drop-outs
consisted of women who did not return the first posttest (T1) questionnaire (0 intervention, 6 controls)
or the second post-test (T2) questionnaire (10
intervention, 11 controls). The unequal drop-out
rates could have affected the reliability of the
statistical analysis. We therefore tested the equality
of variances. All values were non-significant, indicating that the unequal group-sizes were no problem.
Table I shows that there was no significant
difference between the baseline characteristics of
the 46 women who completed the intervention, and
also completed the T1 questionnaire, and the baseline characteristics of the 73 women in the control
group who were still participating at T1. Although
the controls tended to be somewhat older than the
women in the intervention group, this difference was
not significant, t(1, 117) ¼ 1.75, p ¼ 0.06. In addition, no significant differences were found with
regard to marital status, �[2] ¼ 5.08, p ¼ 0.17, children
(children or no children), �[2] ¼ 2.92, p ¼ 0.09, or
level of physical functioning, t(1,116) ¼ �1.00,
p ¼ 0.32.
Analyses of variance also showed no significant
differences in the scores for the SMAS-30, the
SPF-IL, or the loneliness questionnaire at T0
between the 98 women who completed all three
questionnaires and the 44 women who dropped out,
suggesting that there was no selection bias with
respect to these measures. Although the drop-outs
seemed to score somewhat lower (M ¼ 42.3) on the
SMAS-30, F(1, 137) ¼ 3.72, p ¼ 0.06 than those
who completed all questionnaires (M ¼ 46.6), this
difference was not significant.

Subjective evaluation of the intervention

The women who completed the intervention were
asked to answer a few evaluative questions immediately after the final meeting. Approximately 77%
indicated that they had enjoyed the intervention, and
approximately 84% felt that the intervention was
worthwhile. More than half of the women reported
that the intervention had met their expectations.

Some felt that six meetings were not enough,
whereas others felt that the number of meetings
was sufficient. They were also asked to evaluate
the intervention on a 10-point scale (0 ¼ very bad
to 10 ¼ very good). The mean score was 7.9. Six
months after the intervention all women (also the
controls) were asked to indicate whether they felt
that their lives had more ‘luster’, compared to six
months ago (before the intervention), whether they
participated in more activities, whether they had
more social contacts, and whether they felt that their
general health status had improved. However, at that
point there was no difference between the answers
given by the women who had completed the
intervention and the answers given by the controls.

The effect of the intervention: self-management ability

Mean sum-scores on the SMAS-30 (overall score
and the six sub-scales), the SPF-IL, and the loneliness scale (with two sub-scales) at T0 and at the
two post-tests (T1 and T2) are shown in Table II.
No significant differences in these measurements
were found at T0 between the intervention group
and the control group, indicating that the randomization procedure was successful.
In order to compare scores for self-management
abilities between the groups after the intervention,
univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was
performed, with SMAS-30 scores at T1 as the
dependent variable, group as the independent
variable, and SMAS-30 scores at T0 and marital
status as covariates. Marital status was included as
a covariate because the number of widows in the
groups differed (although not significant: 26.1%
versus 43.5%), and because this variable might be
associated with the outcome variables. As can be
seen in Table II, there was a significant effect of
group on SMAS-30 scores at T1, F(1, 108) ¼ 5.61,
p 5 0.05, indicating that the intervention group
increased significantly in overall self-management


ability after the intervention (at T1), compared to
the controls. With regard to the longer-term effects,
it was found that, although the intervention group
scored even higher on the SMAS-30 after six
months (at T2), the controls also had higher
scores, rendering the difference between the two
groups non-significant at T2, F(1, 88) ¼ 2.74,
p ¼ 0.10.
To investigate whether all or only some of the
six self-management abilities improved after the
intervention, several ANCOVAs were performed.
A significant effect of group was found for the subscales ‘taking initiatives’ F(1, 115) ¼ 5.93, p 5 0.05,
‘positive frame of mind’ F(1, 116) ¼ 15.77,
p 5 0.001, and ‘multifunctionality’ F(1, 114) ¼
4.82, p 5 0.05, indicating that the intervention was
effective for these self-management abilities.
However, no group effects were found for the subscales ‘self-efficacy’ F(1, 114) ¼ 1.08, p ¼ 0.30,
‘investment behaviour’ F(1, 115) ¼ 2.67, p ¼ 0.11,
and ‘variety’ F(1, 112) ¼ 0.07, p ¼ 0.80, indicating
that the intervention had no effect on these abilities.
When analyzing the differences between the groups
at T2, as compared to T0, no significant group
effects were found.
It can be concluded that the intervention was
successful in the short-term in increasing overall selfmanagement ability, and specifically the separate
abilities of taking initiatives, a positive frame of
mind, and taking care of multifunctionality.
However, although the intervention group scored
higher on all self-management abilities at T2
compared to T0, the controls in general also had
higher scores at T2 compared to T0 rendering all
differences between the two groups non-significant
in the longer-term.

The effect of the intervention: Well-being

Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to

well-being and the mediating effect of overall selfmanagement ability on well-being. First the shortterm effects (at T1) were analyzed. SPF-IL scores at
T0 were entered into the equation in the first step,
and accounted for a significant 43% of the variance
in SPF-IL scores at T1 (F change (1, 103) ¼ 78.23,
p 5 0.001). Higher scores on the SPF-IL at T0
resulted in higher scores on the SPF-IL at T1
(� ¼ 0.66, p 5 0.001). Condition (intervention or
control), entered into the equation in the second
step, contributed significantly to the model
(F change (1, 102) ¼ 7.90, p � 0.01), and yielded
an increase of 4% in explained variance. This
indicates that the women who completed the
intervention scored higher on the SPF-IL at T1
than the controls (� ¼ 0.20, p 5 0.01). Next, to test
the mediating effect of self-management ability on
well-being, SMAS-30 scores at T1 were entered into
the equation. This resulted in a significant increase
in explained variance (F change [1, 101] ¼ 17.60,
p 5 0.001). As shown in Table III, there was a
significant main effect of SMAS-30 scores at
T1 on well-being at T1 (� ¼ 0.30, p 5 0.001). Selfmanagement ability acts as a mediator to the extent
that it accounts for the relationship between condition (intervention or control) and well-being (Baron
& Kenny, 1986). Therefore, three conditions have to
be met. Firstly, condition has to account significantly for the variation in self-management ability,
and the results of the ANCOVA showed that this
condition was met. Secondly, variations in selfmanagement ability must account significantly for
variations in well-being. This was also found to be
true in the hierarchical regression analyses. Finally,
the relationship between condition and well-being
has to be reduced by self-management abilities.
As shown in Table III, this final condition has not
been met: the contribution of condition remained
significant, and the � changed from 0.20 in step 2 to
0.19 in step 3, indicating that there was a very small,
but non-significant reduction in the contribution
of condition to well-being after adding selfmanagement abilities to the equation. It can therefore be concluded that, although there was an
effect of the intervention on well-being, this effect


was not mediated by increased self-management
ability at T1.
To test whether the effect of the intervention
on well-being was still present after six months
(at T2) an identical hierarchical regression analysis
was performed, but with well-being at T2 as
the dependent variable. Condition, entered into the
equation in the second step, did not improve the
model (F change [1, 80] ¼ 0.02, p ¼ 0.90). Although
the well-being of the women who had completed the
intervention improved at T1, and remained at this
higher level at T2 (see Table II), they did not have
higher scores for well-being at T2 than the controls
(� ¼ 0.01, p ¼ 0.90). Unexpectedly, the well-being of
the controls also improved at T2. It must therefore
be concluded that the effect of the intervention on
well-being was no longer significant after six months.

The effect of the intervention: Loneliness

Due to non-normality of the data, Wilcoxon signed
rank tests were performed on the loneliness scores.
The loneliness scores of the women who completed
the intervention were significantly lower at T1
(Mdn ¼ 9) than at T0 (Mdn ¼ 9), T ¼ 89.0,
p 5 0.01, r ¼ �0.31. However, the women in the
control group also had significantly lower scores
for loneliness at T1 (Mdn ¼ 8), compared to T0
(Mdn ¼ 8), T ¼ 404.5, p 5 0.05, r ¼ �0.20. This
indicates that, although loneliness was reduced in
the intervention group, this is a non-significant
change, because it was also reduced in the control
group.
When considering emotional and social loneliness
separately, differential results were found (see
Table II). The women in the intervention group
had significantly lower scores for emotional loneliness at T1 (Mdn ¼ 5) than at T0 (Mdn ¼ 6),
T ¼ 24.0, p 5 0.01, r ¼ �0.32, but the controls also
had marginally significant lower scores for emotional
loneliness at T1 (Mdn ¼ 5) than at T0 (Mdn ¼ 5),
T ¼ 203.5, p ¼ 0.06, r ¼ �0.18. However, the intervention appeared to be effective for social loneliness.
The women in the intervention group had significantly lower scores for social loneliness at T1
(Mdn ¼ 4) than at T0 (Mdn ¼ 4), T ¼ 79 5,

p 5 0.05, r ¼ �0.19, whereas the scores of the
controls for social loneliness were not significantly
lower at T1 (Mdn ¼ 3) than at T0 (Mdn ¼ 4),
T ¼ 234.0, p ¼ 0.17.
With regard to the longer-term effects (at T2), the
results showed that, although the scores in the
intervention group were significantly lower at
T2 (Mdn ¼ 6) than at T0 (Mdn ¼ 9), T ¼ �3.38,
p 5 0.01, r ¼ �0.56, the scores in the control group
were also significantly lower for overall loneliness at
T0 (Mdn ¼ 9) than at T2 (Mdn ¼ 7), T ¼ �3.13,
p 5 0.01, r ¼ �0.40. This again renders the difference between the two groups non-significant. The
same applies to emotional loneliness and social
loneliness. The scores for emotional loneliness of
the women in the intervention were significantly
lower at T2 (Mdn ¼ 3.5) than at T0 (Mdn ¼ 5),
T ¼ �3.63, p 5 0.001, r ¼ �0.61, but the controls
also scored significant lower at T2 (Mdn ¼ 4) than
at T0 (Mdn ¼ 5), T ¼ �2.93, p 5 0.01, r ¼ �0.37.
The scores for social loneliness of the women in
the intervention group were not significantly lower
at T2 (Mdn ¼ 3) than at T0 (Mdn ¼ 4), T ¼ �1.67,
p ¼ 0.10, and the scores of the women in the control
group were also not significantly lower at T2
(Mdn ¼ 3) than at T0 (Mdn ¼ 4), T ¼ �1.38,
p ¼ 0.17.
It can be concluded that, although the scores of
the intervention group on overall as well as on
emotional loneliness improved immediately after the
intervention (at T1) and even more so after six
months (at T2), the scores on these outcomes of the
women in the control group were also improved,
rendering the effect of the intervention on overall
and emotional loneliness non-significant. With
regard to social loneliness, however, the intervention
proved to be effective at T1. Scores for social
loneliness were significantly lower in the intervention
group than in the control group at T1, but this
difference was no longer significant at T2, indicating
that the intervention was no longer effective after
six months.

Discussion

The main aim of the present study was to investigate
whether single women, 55 years of age and older,
improved on self-management ability, well-being,
and social and emotional loneliness after having
participated in a newly designed self-management
group intervention that was based on the SelfManagement of Well-being (SMW) theory. As
expected, after completing the intervention, overall
self-management ability and well-being improved in
the intervention group, but not in the control group.
These findings are in line with the results of
two other intervention studies based on the
same theory (Frieswijk et al., 2006; Schuurmans,
2004) However, it was found that the separate


self-management abilities were not influenced
equally by the intervention. Three of the six selfmanagement abilities improved significantly after the
intervention: ‘taking initiatives’, ‘positive frame of
mind’, and ‘multifunctionality’. The other three
(‘self-efficacy’, ‘investment behaviour, and ‘variety’)
showed a positive trend, but did not significantly
improve, compared to the control group. This is
a remarkable finding because in two other selfmanagement intervention studies based on the same
theory (Frieswijk et al., 2006; Schuurmans, 2004)
the two abilities ‘positive frame of mind’ and
‘multifunctionality’ were not affected by the
intervention, whereas all the others were. These
inconsistent findings are difficult to interpret, and
should be investigated further in future research.
A second aim of the study was to investigate
whether improvements in well-being in the intervention group could be attributed to increases in
self-management ability. However, this hypothesized
mediation effect was not found. This again is
unexpected, because the two other aforementioned
SMW theory-based intervention studies did find
evidence of these mediating effects (Frieswijk et al.,
2006; Schuurmans, 2004). Possibly the relatively
small sample size in the present study prevented any
evidence of this effect. This should be taken into
account in future research.
Another aim of the study was to investigate the
effect of the intervention on overall loneliness, and
on emotional and social loneliness. The results
showed that, although the women in the intervention
group were significantly less lonely after the intervention, these effects can not be attributed to the
intervention, because the controls also reported that
they were less lonely. It is possible that the extremely
high scores for loneliness in both groups at baseline
(cf. Van Tilburg & De Jong Gierveld, 1999) caused
a regression to the mean, resulting in improvements
in both groups. Comparable findings have been
reported in other studies focusing on loneliness
interventions (e.g., Stevens & Van Tilburg, 2000).
The fact that the intervention group improved on
social loneliness but not on emotional loneliness
(immediately after the intervention), may indicate
that social loneliness is easier to alleviate than
emotional loneliness. Emotional loneliness relates,
in particular, to the lack of an attachment figure,
which may be difficult for single older women to
resolve. Social loneliness, on the other hand, relates
to a lack of meaningful relationships and social
integration, which may be relatively easier to amend.
The present intervention focused on both forms of
loneliness, but due to the relatively short duration of
the intervention it may have been easier for the
participants to improve on social loneliness.
Although the present intervention consisted of
only six weekly sessions, and may therefore have
been too short to achieve permanent changes in
behaviour and habits, we still wished to investigate


-----

the extent to which such a short intervention could
lead to improvements in the longer-term. Overall,
the results were interesting in this respect. On all
main outcomes (i.e., overall self-management ability
and well-being) the improvements found in the
intervention group immediately after the intervention had been maintained after six months, but these
improvements were no longer significant because the
women in the control group had also improved on
these variables after six months. In other words,
although the intervention group improved on all
main outcomes, the longer-term effectiveness of
the intervention could not be proven, because the
control group also improved. This is a remarkable
finding, which often seems to occur in experimental
studies, and for which several explanations are
possible (see Becker, Roberts, & Voelmeck, 2003),
one of which is the Hawthorne effect. This refers to
the phenomenon that controls, although they do not
receive the intervention, behave differently simply
because they know that they are participating in
a study. Another explanation could be reactivity of
measurement, which refers to changes in participants’ answers to questions just because they are
being measured. For example, answering questions
about taking the initiative toward friends, may also
encourage controls to think about—and eventually
act upon—such behaviour, and thus to change their
behaviour. With such findings it seems important, as
recommended by Becker et al. (2003), to redesign
future research projects taking all these possible
explanations into account, rather than to abandon
a potentially useful intervention.
The present study may have some further limitations. One point of concern is the unequal rate of
drop-out in both groups. There were more drop-outs
in the intervention group than in the control group.
This could possibly be a result of the rather
unrestricted inclusion criteria, which implied that
women with serious problems, such as psychopathology, recent loss, or bereavement, could be
included in the intervention. These women may
have found it difficult to function in a group.
Moreover, the finding that the drop-outs tended to
have less self-management abilities than those who
completed the intervention, may indicate that
a group intervention is only suitable for women
who have a reasonable level of self-management
ability. An individual self-management intervention
might have been more appropriate for the drop-outs.
In future studies more specific inclusion criteria are
recommended, to achieve an optimal fit between
target group and type of intervention.
Another limitation, related to the above, concerns
the way in which the women were recruited. They
were recruited on the basis of self-selection, and
appeared to be extremely lonely compared to the
loneliness rates reported in other studies among
community dwelling older people (Kremers,
Steverink, Albersnagel, & Slaets, in press;


Self-management of well-being in older women 483

Tijhuis, De Jong-Gierveld, Feskens, & Kromhout,
1999; Van Tilburg & De Jong-Gierveld, 1999; Von
Faber et al., 2001). Consequently, selection bias
may have occurred. Also the finding that part of
the women reported that the intervention did not
quite meet their expectations, could have affected
the results. Future studies should reconsider the
methods used to recruit participants for such
interventions, to ensure that the target group is,
indeed, included.
As an overall conclusion, it can be stated that,
although there was no statistical evidence of longerterm effectiveness, the short-term findings support
the effectiveness of this SMW theory-based intervention in improving self-management ability and
well-being in single older women.
