ABSTRACT
Objectives: This study assesses the effects of an autobiographical memory intervention on the
prevention and reduction of depressive symptoms in older persons in residential care. Trained
volunteers delivered the intervention.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial was carried out with depressive symptoms as the primary
outcome. The experimental condition received the intervention Precious Memories one-on-one,
whereas the control condition had individual unstructured contacts with a volunteer. Participants
were 86 older persons living in residential care. There were three measurements: pre-intervention,
post-intervention (2 months after the first measurement), and follow-up (8 months after the first
measurement). Besides depressive symptoms, the retrieval of specific positive memories was
measured as a process variable. Anxiety, loneliness, well-being, and mastery were assessed as
secondary outcomes.
Results: Depressive symptoms improved equally in the intervention and the control condition at postmeasurement. Participants with clinically relevant depressive symptoms also maintained the effects at
follow-up in both conditions. The retrieval of specific positive memories improved more in the
autobiographical memory intervention, although this was not maintained at follow-up. Anxiety and
loneliness improved equally well in both conditions, but no effects were found for well-being or
mastery.
Conclusion: It is concluded that volunteers can deliver the intervention and contribute to the mental
health of this highly vulnerable group of older adults.

KEYWORDS
Depression; reminiscence
therapy; institutional care;
volunteers


Depression is a major problem in residential care homes, due
to the physical, mental, and social vulnerability of residents.
Estimates are that between 4% and 25% of residents suffer
from a major clinical depression, whereas 29-82% experience
minor depression or depressive symptoms (Seitz, Purandare,
& Conn, 2010). This shows the need for interventions that
help to prevent and reduce depressive symptoms in this population. The present manuscript describes a randomized controlled trial on the effects of such an intervention, based on
the retrieval of specific, positive autobiographical memories,
and carried out by trained volunteers.
Several meta-analyses have shown that reminiscence and
life review interventions that focus on the retrieval and evaluation of personal memories are successful in reducing depressive symptoms in older adults (Bohlmeijer, Smit, & Cuijpers,
2003; Pinquart et al., 2007; Pinquart & Forstmeier, 2012). Reminiscence therapy is recognized as an evidence-based intervention for depression in later life (Scogin, Welsh, Hanson, Stump,
& Coates, 2005). In recent years, such interventions have been
strengthened with insights from cognitive psychological
research on autobiographical memory (Westerhof & Bohlmeijer,
2014). A persistent finding is that depressed persons tend to
overgeneralize, i.e. they have difficulty activating episodic
memories of specific events that took place on a particular day
and place (Sumner, Griffith, & Mineka, 2010; Williams et al.,
2007). These findings apply to people with depressive


symptoms or clinical depression (Van Vreeswijk & de Wilde,
2004; Williams, 1996), also in later life (Serrano, Latorre, & Gatz,
2007). A recent meta-analysis shows that overgeneralization in
depression is particularly found with regard to positive memories (Ono, Devilly, & Shum, 2016). This finding matches earlier
research on mood congruence effects that has shown that
people in depressed mood recall fewer positive memories
(Bower, 1981; Miranda & Kihlstrom, 2005; Singer & Salovey,
1988). To conclude, the competence to retrieve specific, positive memories is compromised by depressive symptomatology.
Research shows that this competence can be trained
(Kremers, Spinhoven, Van der Does, & Van Dyck, 2006; Watkins,
Teasdale, & Williams, 2000; Williams et al., 2000). Serrano, Latorre,
Gatz, and Montanes (2004) developed a protocol, based on an
existing life review intervention (Haight & Webster, 1995), to
train the retrieval of specific positive memories in depressed
older adults. In a randomized controlled trial, they found that
the intervention showed larger effects on specific, positive memories and depressive symptoms than care as usual among older
users of social services. Goncalves, Albuquerque, and Paul (2009)
did a randomized study on the effects of the intervention
among older visitors of day care centers. They also found significant effects on memory specificity and depressive symptoms. In
a more recent study, Serrano et al. (2012) found significant differences in clinical depression, but not in memory specificity
among older adults with clinical depression.


-----

The present study extends previous research as it
addresses whether the intervention is also effective when
delivered by trained volunteers. The intervention is based on
reminiscence as a naturally occurring process in later life
(Westerhof, Bohlmeijer, & Webster, 2010). Volunteers can
therefore easily stimulate this process in conversations about
personal memories. Training in general counseling competences will aid volunteers in guiding the conversation. Following
a well-defined protocol, volunteers learn how to stimulate the
retrieval of specific, positive memories (Richters, Korte, Westerhof, & Bohlmeijer, 2015). There is no need for more professional therapeutic competences as in interventions that focus
on evaluating memories or changing negative reminiscence
styles (Westerhof et al., 2010).
An intervention that is volunteer-led has several advantages. Engaging volunteers fits current trends that ask for
more societal involvement in care for older persons. For care
institutes the delivery of the intervention will become more
cost-effective and easier to organize than care provided by a
professional psychologist (Richters, Schoonen, Korte, Bohlmeijer, & Westerhof, 2015). For older adults, an intervention
delivered by a volunteer will be less stigmatizing than care by
a psychologist, as volunteers provide a contact with society
rather than with health care professionals (Westerhof, Maessen, de Bruijn, & Smets, 2008). It is well-known that volunteering supports both the volunteer's mental health and wellbeing and that of the people they serve (Wheeler, Gorey, &
Greenblatt, 1998). The project suits both altruistic and self-oriented motivations of volunteers as it offers the possibility to
add value to the lives of older adults, while also learning new
competences in the training (Chen & Morrow-Howell, 2015;
Hwang, Grabb, & Curtis, 2005).
Besides the delivery of the intervention by volunteers, the
present study has some unique features in comparison to
existing research (Goncalves et al., 2009; Serrano et al., 2004,
2012). First, the intervention targets older persons in residential care, a group that is especially at risk for depression (Seitz
et al., 2010). Second, unlike earlier studies on the specific positive memory intervention, an active control condition is used
that consisted of unstructured visits from a volunteer. This
design allows controlling for the effects of social contact and
personal attention. Third, a follow-up assessment was carried
out that was missing in previous studies.
Our first expectation is that the intervention contributes
more to the prevention and reduction of depressive symptoms
than the active control condition, also at follow-up (Pinquart &
Forstmeier, 2012). Our second expectation is that the intervention will be more effective for people with clinically relevant
depressive symptoms, as this has also been found in the metaanalysis of Pinquart and Forstmeier (2012). Our third expectation is that the intervention increases specific positive memories
as the working mechanism of the intervention (Serrano et al.,
2004). Our fourth expectation is that the intervention also
affects anxiety symptoms, loneliness, well-being, and mastery as
secondary outcomes. Earlier studies showed that life review
affects these outcomes as well (Pinquart & Forstmeier, 2012).

##### Methods


intervention condition received the intervention âPrecious
Memoriesâ, whereas the control condition had individual
unstructured contacts with a volunteer. Randomization was
carried out after the baseline measurement, based on a computer-generated list of random numbers. There were three
measurements: pre-intervention, post-intervention (2 months
after the first measurement), and follow-up (8 months after
the first measurement). Risks were minimized by excluding
people with severe depression or at risk of suicide, and by
instructing volunteers to refer an older person to appropriate
care when depressive symptoms worsen (Richters et al., 2015).

##### Intervention condition


The intervention âPrecious memoriesâ is adapted from the
intervention that aims to increase specific positive memory
retrieval developed by Serrano et al. (2004). Serrano's intervention focused on four themes in four weekly sessions that
were guided by a psychologist: childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and summary. Fourteen questions (based on Haight &
Webster, 1995) were used to elicit specific positive memories.
The protocol was translated and adapted to the Dutch
context and an introductory session was added. The protocol
is described in a manual that is adapted to volunteers who
are not psychologists (Richters et al., 2015). The intervention
consisted of five individual sessions of 45 min between a participant and a trained volunteer. The volunteers arranged
with the participants that sessions took place weekly or
biweekly in a period of eight weeks maximum. The first session was used to get acquainted and to orient the volunteer
towards the general life story of the participant. This was
important to have enough contextual information for the following sessions. The second session addresses specific positive memories in childhood (0-12 years), the third session in
adolescence (12-18 years), the fourth in adulthood (18+
years). The last session covers the life story in general and
includes a closing of the intervention. For each session there
are fourteen questions that are used as prompts to elicit specific positive memories, such as âwhen you were a child, did
you have a friend you played with a lot; can you a remember
a nice moment of something you did together?â; âdo you
remember a moment in adolescence when you were passionate about a book, film, or person when you were a teenager?â;
âis there a particular place that meant a lot to you when you
were a young adult; which moment do you remember?â; âduring more recent years, did you make a trip or vacation that
you will never forget?â.

##### Control condition


##### Design

A randomized controlled trial with two parallel conditions was


In the control condition, volunteers visited a participant five
times across a maximum of eight weeks for about 45 min per
week. Each time the volunteer decided together with the participant what he or she liked to do. The volunteers reported
that they engaged in conversation, often about experiences
of loss or physical complaints. Sometimes they reported that
they played cards, went shopping, or, in a single case, visited
a museum.

##### Volunteers


Volunteers were recruited in two Dutch care groups through


-----

Requirements for the volunteers were an educational level of
at least middle professional education (15 or more years),
interest in older persons, being socially competent and flexible, and having time to visit at least one participant. Additional requirements for those volunteers who delivered the
intervention were being able to gain insight in the theoretical
background of the intervention and willingness to follow the
training. Requirements were checked in an intake session
with the volunteer coordinator in the care group, based on
self-reports of the volunteers.
Twenty-eight volunteers participated in the study. Their
age was mostly between 60 and 70 years with a range of 24â
84 years. Most volunteers were female (n = 24). There were
no significant differences in age and gender between the volunteers in the control and intervention condition.
Due to practical reasons of timely matching volunteers to
older adults, twelve volunteers participated in both conditions. Eight volunteers participated only in the intervention
and eight only in the control condition. Based on availability
of the volunteers, ten volunteers visited one participant,
seven visited two participants, and eleven visited more than 2
participants, up to a maximum of 13.

##### Training of volunteers


MINI module on depression; Sheehan et al., 1998), (4) having
started antidepressant medication in the past three months,
or (5) lack of command of the Dutch language.
The participants were on average 84.2 (SD = 8.5) years old,
ranging from 60 to 98 years. The majority was female (62%),
did not have a partner (86%), was living alone (89%), and had
lower education (84% less than 11 years). The mean score for
cognitive impairments (MMSE) was 25.7 (SD = 3.2). On average, participants needed help for 7.6 (SD = 5.1) out of 18 functional impairments.

##### Instruments


The training for the intervention âPrecious Memoriesâ is documented in a train-the-trainer manual (Richters et al., 2015). A
licensed health care psychologist trained all volunteers who
participated in the intervention condition. Volunteers who
only participated in the control condition did not receive this
training, but received a short instruction to familiarize them
with the goal of the visits. The learning goals of the training
are (1) gaining knowledge and insight in depressive symptoms and autobiographical memory in later life, (2) acquiring
general counseling competences (listening, providing empathy, structuring, probing, dealing with private information,
and referring to specialist care in case of complex problems)
and (3) developing specific counseling competences directed
at the retrieval of specific positive memories, such as probing
for more specificity of positive memories, or acknowledging
negative feelings before focusing on positive memories again.
The training consists of three elements with a total time
investment of 12 h. First, a workbook provided relevant information on depression, reminiscence, autobiographical memory, counseling competences as well as the protocol of the
intervention per session. Second, an online training tool was
developed with short informational clips as well as exercises
and questions. Third, there were two four-hour face-to-face
sessions. During the sessions, the psychologist instructed the
volunteers, but they could also pose questions, and practice
their competences through role-playing. The psychologist
checked successful completion of the training, and handed
out a certificate to the volunteers.

##### Participants


Inclusion criteria were (1) living in a care facility, (2) being
older than 60 years and (3) expressing their motivation to participate. Exclusion criteria were (1) severe cognitive
impairment (MMSE score of 18 or lower; Folstein, Folstein, &
McHugh, 1975), (2) a severe depressive episode (8 or 9 out of
9 possible indicators for depression on the MINI; Sheehan


Demographic variables were assessed with questions on age,
gender, marital status, living situation, and educational level.
Functional impairments were measured with the 18-item Groningen Activity Restrictions Scale (Kempen & Suurmeijer,
1990; Cronbach alpha in this study = .94).
The primary outcome is depressive symptoms, measured
with the Dutch version of the shortened Geriatric Depression
Scale (GDS-8; Jongenelis et al., 2007). The GDS-8 has 8 items
that can be answered with yes or no. Each item is scored with
a 0 for no depressive symptoms or 1 for depressive symptoms. The sumscore ranges from 0 to 8; a score of 2 or higher
is seen as an indication for clinically relevant symptoms. The
scale has a Cronbach alpha of .75 in the current study.
The process variable is specific positive autobiographical
memories. This is measured with a modified version of the
Autobiographic Memory Test (AMT; Williams & Broadbent.
1986). Ten positive items (like happy, interested, calm) are
used to assess the competence to retrieve specific positive
memories. The interviewer mentions the cue word and asks
the participant to react as quickly as possible. When no
response is given after 30 s, the cue word is repeated. When
no memory is produced after another 30 s, the code for âno
memoryâ is given. If a participant tells a general or repeating
memory the interviewer prompts the participant to become
more specific. When no specific memory is produced after
60 s, the code for âgeneral memoryâ is given. When a participant produces a specific memory of an event that happened
on a particular day and place, the code for âspecific memoryâ
is given. The number of specific positive memories across the
10 cue words is counted with a range from 0 to 10. The scale
has a reliability of .72 (Cronbach alpha) in the current study.
Secondary outcome measures are anxiety, loneliness, wellbeing, and mastery. Anxiety is measured with the anxiety subscale of the Dutch version of the Hospital Depression and
Anxiety Scale (HADS-A; Spinhoven, Ormel, Sloekers, &
Kempen, 1997; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983). Seven items ask for
symptoms of anxiety and are rated by the participant on a
four-point scale from ânot at allâ to âvery muchâ. A sumscore is
computed across the seven items and ranges between 0 and
21. The Cronbach alpha in this study is .75.
Loneliness is measured with the Dutch loneliness scale (de
Jong-Gierveld & Kamphuis, 1985). Eleven items are scored on
a five-point scale ranging from âno!â to âyes!â. Each item is
dichotomized and the sumscore across the eleven items is
calculated, resulting in a score between 0 and 11. In this study
the Cronbach alpha is .82.
Well-being is measured with the Dutch Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF; Lamers, Westerhof, Bohlmeijer,
ten Klooster, & Keyes, 2011). The scale consists of 14 theoreti

-----

and social well-being. Participants rate each feeling of wellbeing in the past month on a scale from ânot at allâ to âevery
dayâ. The mean score ranges from 1 to 6. The scale has a Cronbach alpha in the present study of .84.
Mastery is measured with the Dutch version of the Pearlin
Mastery Scale (PMS; Pearlin & Schooler, 1978). The scale consists of five items that are rated on a 5-point scale from âdisagree completelyâ to âagree completelyâ. The sumscore is
calculated across the five items, resulting in a score that
ranges between 5 and 25. The Cronbach alpha is .69 in this
study.

##### Procedure


Participants were recruited between April 2014 and May 2015
among older persons who received care from two Dutch care
groups. The researchers who carried out the study (JK & SE)
explained the study and its inclusion criteria to nurses who
were primarily responsible for the care of possible participants. The nurses identified possible participants, discussed
their participation in the study, and provided written information about the study. The nurses reported names of possible
participants to the researchers.
The researchers sent a third-year Bachelor student or a
Master student in Psychology to the possible participant for
an intake conversation. The main researcher (JK) trained these
students for half a day to administer the questionnaires. The
students explained the goal of the study and asked the participant again whether he or she wanted to participate. When
the participant agreed, he or she signed an informed consent
form. Next, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were checked:
a question was asked whether the participant started antidepressant medication during the past three months; a short
diagnostic interview (MINI; Sheehan et al., 1998) was conducted to exclude participants with a major depressive episode (8 or 9 of the possible 9 symptoms) or suicide risk; the
Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to exclude
persons with cognitive impairments (score of 18 or lower; Folstein et al., 1975). Last, all study variables were measured,
including demographic variables, functional impairment as
well as all outcome and process variables.
The questionnaires were handed back for a final check on
the inclusion by the researchers (JK & SE). After inclusion, they
carried out the randomization and matched volunteers and
participants on the basis of availability. They informed the
nurse about the results and the nurse arranged a first session
between the participant and volunteer. The volunteer visited
the participant five times, either giving the intervention or
unstructured visits. After that, trained third year Bachelor students and Master students carried out the post-intervention
measurement (two months after the first measurement) and
the follow-up (eight months after the first measurement),
again under supervision of the researchers.

##### Analyses


depressive symptomatology. As our study used an active control condition, we expected a lower effect.
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic characteristics and cognitive and functional impairments of the participants. Chi-square tests and t-tests were
used to check the randomization, i.e. whether the intervention and control condition differed in demographical variables, cognitive and functional impairments, and psychological
characteristics at pre-intervention. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to assess whether demographic variables, functional impairments and psychological characteristics
predicted drop out of the study. Missing values for the outcome scales were completely at random (Little's MCAR test
with ch2(47) = 34.2; p = .919) and imputed using the expectation maximization method in SPSS Missing Values Analysis.
Repeated measures MANOVAs were used to assess the
expectations concerning the differences between conditions
in primary, process, and secondary outcomes across time. The
condition (intervention vs. control) was the independent variable and each outcome measure across the three measurements was the repeated dependent variable. Simple contrasts
were used post-hoc to compare the post-intervention and follow-up measures with the pre-intervention measures. To
assess the second expectation, the presence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms (GDS-8> = 2; Jongenelis et al.,
2007) was added as a moderator to the repeated measures
MANOVA. Effect sizes at post-intervention and follow-up were
calculated as Cohen's d. Effect sizes between .56 and 1.2 were
interpreted as large, between .33 and .55 as moderate, and
below .33 as small (Lipsey et al., 1993). All analyses were done
on the intention-to-treat (ITT) sample and on completers only.
The ITT analyses are reported, but it is noted in the results section when there were different outcomes for the completers
only.

##### Results


A power analysis (using G*Power) revealed that 134 participants were needed, based on a t-test with a power of .80, an
effect size of .50, a one-sided alpha of .05 and 25% drop out
between the first and last measurement. We based the effect
size on the meta-analysis of Bohlmeijer et al. (2003) that
included only randomized controlled trials on life review


##### Preliminary analyses

Figure 1 shows the flow of participants. 306 persons were
approached of whom 81 (26%) participated in the study. This
is less than expected (81 instead of 134 participants). Possible
participants often reported a lack of motivation to participate
when they were approached. Twenty-three participants discontinued the intervention, about equally distributed across
both conditions. Three participants discontinued the intervention because they were not motivated and three because they
had an abundance of negative memories. Six participants in
the control condition discontinued the contacts, because
they had a lack of motivation. The drop out of the study was
higher than expected (37% at follow-up instead of the
expected 25%).
A randomization check showed that no significant differences existed between the intervention and control
condition on the demographic characteristics as well as
cognitive and functional impairments (chi-square tests and
t-tests with p > .05). T-tests showed that there were also
no significant differences (all p > .05) on most psychological characteristics before the intervention: depressive
symptoms, anxiety, loneliness, well-being, and mastery.
The only exception is the number of specific positive
memories (t(79) = 2.1; p = .038): the control condition

intervention condition (mean = 3.1; sd = 2.1). In the control condition there were 17 and in the intervention condition 19 participants with clinically relevant depressive
symptoms (score of 2 or higher on the GDS; chi[2](1) = .02;
p = .881).
No significant difference existed in drop-out at follow-up
between the intervention and control condition (chi[2](1) = 0.5;
p = .474). A stepwise logistic regression analysis with dropout at follow-up (0 = no; 1 = yes) as dependent variable and
condition, demographic variables, cognitive impairments,
functional impairments, and psychological characteristics at
pre-intervention as independent variables showed no significant predictors of drop-out. Hence, there were no systematic


Our first expectation was that the intervention contributes to
the prevention and reduction of depressive symptoms, more
than the active control condition, and also at follow-up. The
results of the repeated measures MANOVAs can be found in
Table 1. There is a significant difference in the primary outcome depressive symptoms across time. In both conditions,
the depressive symptoms decline at post-intervention, but
increase again at follow-up. The within-subject contrasts


differences between participants at follow-up and those who
dropped out.

show that the improvement for both conditions at post-intervention is significant (F(1,79) = 5.7; p = .020), but that the difference between pre-intervention and follow-up is no longer
significantly different (F(1,84) = 1.1; p = .295). The effects are
small (Cohen's d is .22 at post-intervention and .09 at followup).
To assess the second expectation about differences
according to level of depressive symptoms, we added the
presence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms as a moderator to the repeated measures MANOVA. We found a significant interaction between the presence of clinically relevant
depressive symptoms and time (F(2,76) = 5.0; p = .009). There
are no further significant interactions, so this finding is independent of the intervention or control condition. Those without clinically relevant symptoms showed no change (means
respectively 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5; standard deviations 0.5, 0.8, 1.0).
Those with clinically relevant symptoms showed a decrease in
depressive symptoms (means respectively 3.5, 2.5, and 2.9;
standard deviations 1.7, 1.9, and 2.0). The changes for those
with clinically relevant depressive symptoms are moderate at
post-intervention (Cohen's d = .56) and at follow-up (Cohen's
d = .33). We also tentatively used cognitive impairment
(MMSE score with a cut-off of 24) as a moderator, but found
no differences between more or less impaired persons in their
changes in depressive symptoms.
Our third expectation was that there would be a stronger
increase in specific positive memories in the intervention
than the control condition. The results for specific positive
memories indeed show a significant interaction between condition and time. The intervention condition improves in specific positive memories, whereas the control condition
decreases somewhat. The within-subjects effects show that
the effect is significant at post-intervention (F(1,79) = 12.2; p =
.001), but not at follow-up (F(1,79) = 2.2; p = .146). The difference in Cohen's d between the two conditions shows moderate effects at post-intervention (.77) and at follow-up (.38).
Besides depressive symptoms, we expected that the intervention contributes to anxiety symptoms, loneliness, wellbeing, and mastery. These secondary outcomes show a significant time effect on anxiety and loneliness for both conditions. There are no significant effects on well-being or
mastery. For anxiety, the within-subjects contrasts show no
significant effect at post-intervention (F(1,79) = 1.7; p = .202),
but a significant effect at follow-up (F(1,79) = 37.2; p <. 001).
The effect at follow-up is moderate (Cohen's d = .62). Loneliness decreases in both conditions with significant within-subject contrasts at post-intervention (F(1,79) = 7.4; p = .008) and


effects are small at post-intervention (Cohen's d = .32) and
moderate at follow-up (Cohen's d = .41). The analysis with
completers only showed a significant interaction effect for
loneliness (F(2,45) = 5.8; p = .006) that was not found in the
intention-to-treat analysis. Participants in the intervention
condition showed more decline in loneliness than participants
in the control condition at post-treatment, but not at followup.

##### Conclusion


The current study extended previous research on an autobiographical memory intervention that trains the competence to
retrieve specific, positive memories (Goncalves et al., 2009;
Serrano et al., 2004, 2012). Trained volunteers delivered the
intervention to a group at risk of depression: older adults who
live in residential care homes. The study expanded earlier
research as it used an active control condition as well as a follow-up assessment. Our first and second expectations were
not confirmed: depressive symptoms improved equally well
in both conditions. In both conditions, those without clinically
relevant depressive symptoms maintained their low level of
depressive symptoms, whereas those with clinically relevant
depressive symptoms improved during the intervention and
at follow-up. The third expectation on the process measure
was partly confirmed: the retrieval of specific positive memories was improved more in the autobiographical memory
intervention, although this was not maintained at follow-up.
The last expectation for the secondary outcomes was not confirmed: anxiety and loneliness improved equally in both conditions and no effects were found for well-being or mastery.
Our study is unique in that volunteers delivered the intervention. Both the intervention and the unstructured contact
with volunteers seem to have contributed to a reduction in
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. These findings match earlier research that volunteering contributes to
the mental health of those who are served (Wheeler et al.,
1998). The findings are even more remarkable, as a systematic
review concluded that depressive symptoms tend to be
chronic and persistent in nursing homes (Seitz et al., 2010)
and another review concluded that it is hard to change loneliness in older adults (De Jong-Gierveld, Fokkema, & Tilburg,
2011). This suggests that indeed the volunteer contact is
related to a decrease in symptoms and that these should not
be attributed to normal fluctuations in symptomatology.
Our study is the first that used an active control condition
to control for social contact and attention. There may be


-----

stronger decrease in symptoms than the control condition.
Volunteers in both conditions were selected according to similar criteria: socially competent volunteers with an interest in
older adults visited both groups. The majority of the volunteers only saw one or two participants in the intervention condition so that they did not gain much experience in delivering
the intervention. Furthermore, there might be a contamination effect as some volunteers served in both conditions. This
contamination effect is contradicted, however, by the finding
that the competence to retrieve specific, positive memories
increased more in the intervention than the control condition.
A post-hoc coding of transcriptions of the five sessions of four
randomly chosen volunteers showed that on average 4.25
positive memories were retrieved per session. This finding
also illustrates that the volunteers were successful in stimulating specific, positive memories. However, volunteers in the
control condition reported to have discussed life problems
such as loss of loved ones or illness and occasionally also discussed memories with the participants. This might also have
contributed to mental health. Hence, we conclude that there
is a need for further research addressing the specific processes by which volunteer contact might contribute to mental
health.
Another feature of our study is that we also assessed
effects at follow-up. This resulted in a rather differentiated
pattern of findings. The improvement in depressive symptoms persisted only at follow-up for older persons with clinically relevant depressive symptoms. The effects on
autobiographical memory were no longer significant at follow-up, whereas anxiety and loneliness were improved in
both conditions at follow-up. These findings suggest that the
intervention might be better targeted at persons with depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, the intervention needs to
be strengthened to maintain the effects on retrieving specific
positive memories for a longer time. This could be done by
adding sessions to the intervention to achieve a higher
impact and by using other and more tangible prompts like
photos, objects or sounds, to support the elicitation of specific
positive memories. Furthermore, one might think of keeping
the memories that were retrieved in a life-story book, so that
they can be more easily retrieved over and over again. Family
members or nurses could use the book to support participants in retrieving the memories. A less time consuming way
might be that the volunteer records the questions that were
successful in retrieving specific positive memories. Family,
friends, and/or staff could use these questions to repeatedly
elicit specific positive memories over a longer period of time.
The finding that changes in depressive, anxiety, and loneliness complaints are not mirrored in well-being and mastery
matches the findings of the meta-analysis by Pinquart and
Forstmeier (2012) who also found smaller effects of reminiscence and life review on well-being than on depressive symptoms. The finding also fits evidence that the absence of
complaints does not automatically imply the presence of positive functioning (Keyes, 2005; Lamers, Westerhof, Glas, & Bohlmeijer, 2015). Future research should therefore also address
how the retrieval of specific, positive memories can enhance
positive functioning in vulnerable older adults.
It was difficult to engage older persons in residential care
to take part in the study, and the drop-out was also larger
than expected. The lack of motivation to participate might be
related to the fact that this was a scientific study and not just

Although this might have inflated the power of the study, we
were able to detect an interaction effect for specific, positive
memories. Drop-out could not be predicted by the demographic characteristics, cognitive and functional impairments
or psychological characteristics. The results between the completers only and intention to treat analyses were also very
similar. Hence, the findings on the changes in both conditions
appear to be valid.
To conclude, the present study provides mixed findings on
the effects of the autobiographical memory intervention as
delivered by trained volunteers in a population at risk. The
competence to retrieve specific positive memories can be
trained, but the effect appears to be short-term. Effects are
found for depressive, anxiety, and loneliness complaints in
both kinds of volunteer contact, suggesting that simple visits
can have positive effects for older persons in residential care.
Our study also suggests that volunteers can successfully
deliver the Precious Memories intervention and contribute to
the mental health of this vulnerable group of older adults.
