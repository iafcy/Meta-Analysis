#### Abstract
Aim. To examine the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural strategies with/without
intense Tai Chi exercise in reducing fear of falling among community-dwelling
elderly adults.
Background. Fear of falling is a major health problem among community-dwelling
older persons. The prevalence of this fear ranges from 29% to 77%, indicating the
importance of developing effective strategies to reduce fear of falling among elderly
adults.
Methods. Data were collected from January to December 2007. A randomized
controlled trial with three groups (control, cognitive-behavioural and cognitivebehavioural with Tai Chi). Participants were assessed at baseline for demographic
data, falls-related history, and fear of falling. Data on these variables plus falls,
mobility, social support behaviour and satisfaction, and quality of life were also
collected at 2 and 5 months after interventions.
Results. Participants in the three groups differed significantly in both measures of
fear of falling (F = 20Æ89, P < 0Æ001; F = 6Æ09, P < 0Æ001) and mobility
(F = 30Æ33, P < 0Æ001), social support behaviour and satisfaction (F = 3Æ32,
P < 0Æ05 and F = 6Æ35, P < 0Æ001, respectively), and quality of life (F = 16Æ66,
P < 0Æ001). In addition, participants who received the cognitive-behavioural
intervention with Tai Chi had significantly lower fear of falling scores (P < 0Æ001)
and higher mobility (P < 0Æ001), social support satisfaction (P < 0Æ01) and quality
of life (P < 0Æ001) than the cognitive-behavioural alone and control groups at
5 months. The three groups did not differ significantly in falls.
Conclusion. The results of this trial suggest that the cognitive-behavioural intervention with Tai Chi exercise helped community-dwelling elderly adults to enhance
their mobility, to manage their fear of falling and to increase their quality of life.

#### Introduction

Fear of falling (FOF) is a major health problem among
community-dwelling older persons both in older persons who
have experienced a fall and those who have not (Scheffer et al.
2008). The wide range of prevalence estimates for fear of
falling (25–77%) may be due to differences between samples in
age, gender, functional status, history of falls, measures of fear
and other comorbidities (Howland et al. 1998, Friedman et al.
2002, Suzuki et al. 2002). In many respects, FOF is a
reasonable response to a probable and potentially risky event
and could be regarded as the first step for preventing falls.
While some level of FOF is reasonable and can promote
effective coping skills for preventing falls, too much fear may
compromise physical and mental well-being (Huang 2005).
The effectiveness of interventions to decrease FOF in older
persons was examined in a meta-analysis of six studies (Jung
et al. 2009). The results showed that FOF was significantly
decreased in interventions with the following designs: (1)
combination of exercise and education, (2) effects measured
after 4 months, and (3) setting is community or home based.
The first design had a mean weighted-effect size (MWES)
= 0Æ249 (P < 0Æ05) because FOF is impacted not only by
physical conditions but also by psychological and cognitive
issues; Therefore, the combination intervention is more
effective than either exercise or education programme alone.
The second design had a MWES = 0Æ240 (P < 0Æ05) because
interventions for FOF need some time to obtain their effects.
The third design had a MWES = 0Æ228 (P < 0Æ05) for
community-based and MWES = 0Æ418 (P < 0Æ05) for homebased (rather than facility-based) settings because older
residents of facilities may be frailer than those living in the
community. However, the effect of interventions was found to
be small (MWES = 0Æ21), and Jung et al. (2009) suggested
that FOF treatment interventions should involve cognitive
reconstructing and behavioural changes to reduce fear of
falling among the elders. No study was found that combined
cognitive-behavioural strategies and an exercise programme
for reducing FOF among community-dwelling elders.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown in
many randomized controlled trials to be an effective treatment for depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder, for
which CBT is recommended in evidence-based clinical
practice guidelines as a first-line treatment (Haby et al.
2006, Kushner et al. 2009, Stanley et al. 2009, Allen et al.
2010). CBT is an intervention modality for changing
dysfunctional cognitive schemas and faulty thinking tied to
FOF experiences (Haby et al. 2006). It is based on the
premise that sensory precepts, feelings and actions influence
the ways in which FOF is interpreted by the self and the rest


of the world. The goal of intervention is to attenuate
symptoms tied to automatic thoughts and emotions about
FOF. Counsellors arrange for specific learning experiences to
help those affected by FOF identify, evaluate and alter
automatic thoughts and emotions. Enduring improvement
from FOF thus results from modification of faulty thinking
and faulty beliefs tied to the faulty behaviour (Tennstedt
et al. 1998, Gitlin et al. 2006). Older adults need to feel
comfortable discussing their fears and learning to ask for
assistance in fearful situations (Legters 2002, Brouwer et al.
2003), thus creating opportunities to devise and carry out fall
and FOF prevention strategies. Physical fitness programmes
increase elders’ level of activity and reduce general physical
dysfunction (Li et al. 2008, Logghe et al. 2009). Tai Chi is
highly suitable for elderly people with limitations in balance
and mobility because it consists of a series of slow, rhythmic
movements that emphasize trunk rotation, weight shifting,
coordination and a gradual narrowing of lower extremity
stance. In addition to reducing risk of falls and FOF, and
improving balance, Tai Chi has benefits in physical and
psychological functioning (Sattin et al. 2005, Li et al. 2008,
Logghe et al. 2009). In fact, Tai Chi was found to reduce
FOF significantly more than other exercise programmes for
older adults (Sattin et al. 2005). Similarly, more than 94% of
the elders who participated in a 12-week Tai Chi intervention
improved their functional status and confidence (Li et al.
2008). Also, 100% of participants agreed that the Tai Chi
movements were appropriate and safe to perform, and they
intended to continue doing the activity and to recommend it
to others (Li et al. 2008).
Therefore, the FOF interventions implemented in this study
used two major strategies: Tai-Chi exercise and cognitivebehavioural (CB) intervention. Tai Chi focused on improving
lower extremity muscular strength and balance. The
CB intervention concentrated on improving awareness of
environmental hazards and medically related risk factors,
changing faulty thinking tied to FOF experiences, and selecting
useful management strategies and resources and improving
confidence.

#### The study

Aim

The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of
three interventions (control, CB alone and CB with Tai Chi)
on primary outcomes (fear of falling and falls), and secondary
outcomes [mobility (gait and balance), social support and
quality of life] of community-dwelling elderly adults over
5 months.

Design

This prospective, randomized control trial was conducted in
a rural area of northeastern Taiwan between January and
December 2007.

Sample

In view of general health promotion and primary prevention,
we targeted on community-dwelling elderly adults. The
sample size was determined based on outcomes of a previous
intervention study on FOF in frail elders (Zhang et al. 2006).
The mean score of the Fall Efficacy Scale (FES) (Tinetti et al.
1990) at pretest was 76Æ2 (SDSD = 5Æ2) and at post-test was 78Æ3
(SDSD = 4Æ0). To detect a between-group difference in FES
scores at 80% power, a = 0Æ05, and two-tailed test. Using the
model of N = [(r) (Z1-a/2+Z1-b)/(l�l0)]2 ([(4Æ0) (1Æ96+0Æ85)/
(78Æ3�76Æ2)][2] = 28) (Pagano & Gauvreau 2000), 28 patients
were needed in each group. After making allowance for
participants to drop out by 5 months, a larger sample was
needed.
Thus, the sample included 186 community-dwelling adults,
aged 60 and older. Participants were randomized to each of
three groups: cognitive-behavioural intervention, CB with Tai
Chi intervention, and the control group. Participants were
recruited from a randomly selected sample of 660 residents,
age ‡60 years, living in registered households of a rural
community in Yi-Lan county, northeastern Taiwan by
mailing an invitation and following up with a phone call.
Potential participants were screened over the telephone by
registered nurses. Inclusion criteria for participation were (1)
‡60 years old, mentally intact [Short Portable Mental Status
Questionnaire (SPMSQ) score >6 for illiterate individuals,
>7 for those with 6 years of education, >8 for those with
>6 years of education] (Pfeiffer 1975) reside in the community, and able to communicate in Mandarin or Taiwanese.
Participants were excluded if they had an artificial leg or leg
brace, had unstable health problems or were terminally ill.
Of the 660 invited to participate, 43Æ79% (n = 289) did not
respond, 2Æ88% (n = 19) were ineligible (nine for having not
being cognitively intact, and ten for not residing in the
community every day), 16Æ21% (n = 107) refused participation, and 9Æ94% (n = 59) had died or moved. The
non-participants (n = 474) and participants (n = 186) were
similar in age and gender (P > 0Æ05). A research assistant
(RA) obtained written informed consent for each participant.
Of 186 elderly adults recruited for this trial, 14 withdrew
during the 5-month study. Therefore, the final sample
consisted of 176 participants (Figure 1). The dropouts and
non-dropouts were similar in baseline data (Table 1).


Randomization

The first author used a computer-developed random table to
randomly assign patients to three intervention groups:
control, CB alone or CB with Tai Chi. Allocation was
concealed from the recruiting RA. The RA collecting data,
and the second author assessing and analysing outcomes were
blind to group assignment.

Intervention

At baseline, all three groups received a brochure explaining
how to prevent fall incidents.

Control group
The control group received no extra care; they could use or
apply for available services in the area as before participation
in the study.

CB group
The CB group received an intervention adapted from previous studies (Tennstedt et al. 1998, Zijlstra et al. 2005) and
the FOF management model developed by the first author
(Huang 2005). The CB interventions developed by Tennstedt
et al. (1998) and Zijlstra et al. (2005) include an introduction, older adults’ point of view of FOF, positive and negative
aspects concerning the topic, associations with falls or fear of
falling, and implementation in the older adult’s daily life.
The FOF management model (Huang 2005) describes and
explains how community-dwelling elders think, feel and act
when confronting FOF. FOF occurs in the context of believing
that falling is an inevitable part of aging. With these
misconceptions in mind, elders with FOF might pose a social
problem because they curtail their activities rather than
focusing on strategies to manage their FOF. The FOF model
suggests that community-dwelling elders manage FOF by
various strategies: developing psychosomatic symptoms,
adopting an attitude of risk prevention, paying attention to
environmental safety, and modifying behaviour. Finally, the
FOF model found that outcomes were influenced by three
interacting conditions: the management strategies used, satisfaction with strategies used, and the degree to which strategies
used were supported by resources. Elders who use more
negative strategies, have less satisfaction with their managing
strategies and minimal support from their family/significant
others, are more likely to suffer from FOF (Huang 2005).
The CB intervention consisted of 8-weekly sessions, lasting
60–90 minutes, and in groups of 8–12 participants. The main
strategy was restructuring misconceptions to promote a view
of fall risk and fear of falling as controllable. Each session

covered the following topics: (1) introduction; (2) associations with falls or fear of falling; (3) participant’s point of
view of FOF (positive and negative aspects about the topic);
(4) strategies to manage FOF and family support; (5)
implementation in the participants’ daily life; and (6)
problem-solving (during a fall learning how to fall, stand
up and call for help). Participants in this study needed to
complete all eight sessions of the CB intervention. Each
session was conducted by a trained facilitator, who was a
nurse qualified in geriatrics and community health nursing.

CB with Tai Chi group
Participants of this combination-intervention group received
the same cognitive-behavioural strategies as those in the CB
group in addition to Tai Chi exercise training. Two professional Tai Chi instructors, who were experienced in working
with older persons, gave the lessons using a predefined protocol. The core of the lessons consisted of ten positions derived
from the Yang style. Participants in groups of 10–16 had
lessons five times a week, for 8 weeks. Each session of Tai Chi
began with warm-up exercises (10 minutes), and was followed
by teaching and practicing individual forms of the Tai Chi


programme (45 minutes), and ended with cool-down exercises
(5 minutes). Participants in the CB with Tai Chi intervention
needed to complete the Tai Chi at least three times a week for
8 weeks, and the CB intervention all eight sessions.

Assessment

Data were collected from January to December 2007.
Participants in all three groups were assessed in their homes
for outcomes (see below) at baseline, 2 months, and
5 months by an RA blinded to their group allocation. Data
were also collected at baseline on participants’ age, gender,
education, marital status, living status, enduring diseases,
falls-related history and admitted FOF.

Outcomes
Primary outcomes: FOF and falls. Fear of falling was
measured by the Geriatric Fear of Falling Measure (GFFM,
Huang 2006) and FES (Tinetti et al. 1990). The 15-item
GFFM assesses participants’ fear of falling in three domains:
psychosomatic symptoms (four items), adopting an attitude
of risk prevention (five items), and modifying behaviours

(six items). Sample items for the three domains include ‘I
don’t sleep well because I worry about falling’, ‘I will sit on a
chair when bathing or hold onto a support’, and ‘I go out less
on rainy days’, respectively. Responses to items are indicated
on a Likert-type scale from 1 (not at all concerned) to 5 (very
concerned), with higher scores indicating greater concern.
The total score is calculated by adding all the item responses
(Huang 2006). GFFM scores are more strongly associated
with physical and psychosocial functioning than FES and
Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC, Powell &
Myers 1995) scores, suggesting that it is more appropriate for
studies on improving all aspects of fear of falling in community-dwelling elders (Huang & Wang 2009). Cronbach’s
alpha for the GFFM in this study was 88.
The FES (Tinetti et al. 1990) has been the tool most used in
the literature to measure fear of falling. Respondents rate their
confidence in conducting ten non-hazardous activities of daily
living that require transferring, bending, reaching, or walking
(Tinetti et al. 1990). Responses range from 1 to 10, with
higher scores indicating greater confidence in maintaining
daily living activities. The total score is calculated by adding all
the item responses. The Chinese version of the FES had a


2-week, test–retest reliability of 0Æ90 (Huang & Acton 2004).
Cronbach’s alpha of the Chinese FES in this study was 0Æ98.
Number of falls was recorded using the Falls Record
Checklist (Huang & Acton 2004), which has a calendar for
participants to circle dates when a fall occurred.

Secondary outcomes: mobility, social support and quality of
life. Mobility (gait and balance) was assessed using the
Tinetti Mobility Scale (Tinetti et al. 1986). This scale is
simple, requires no equipment and is quick and convenient to
use. Each participant took approximately 5 minutes to
perform the whole series of activities on the scale. The better
is a participant’s performance, the higher is the score. The
maximum scores for gait and balance are 12 and 16,
respectively. Balance and gait scores are summed to give an
overall mobility score. Low mobility scores (<14) have been
associated with recurrent falling (Tinetti et al. 1986). Gait
scores <9 and balance scores <10 were also independent
predictors for recurrent falls. Interrater reliability for assessing differences in balance and gait scores of ten participants
was <10% in all cases (Tinetti et al. 1986). Cronbach’s
alpha of the Tinetti Mobility Scale in this study was 0Æ89.

-----

Social support behaviours and satisfaction were measured
using the Chinese version (Huang & Lin 2004) of the
Inventory of Social Supportive Behaviors (ISSB) (Barrera
et al. 1981). The 13-item ISSB includes two subscales:
behaviour and satisfaction. Responses on the behaviour
subscale range from 1 (never) to 3 (always); responses on
the satisfaction subscale range from 1 (very unsatisfied) to 4
(very satisfied). A higher score indicates better behaviour and
satisfaction. Cronbach’s alpha of the ISSB in this study was
0Æ86.
Quality of life (QOL) was measured by the Taiwanese
version of the World Health Organisation’s WHOQOLBREF, a widely used, self-administered, reliable and valid
generic indicator of physical, psychological, social and
environmental relationships (Yao et al. 2002). This 28-item
scale has four subscales (physical health, psychological, social
relationship and environment) that measure different health
concepts. Responses to items range from 1 to 5. The total
score is calculated by averaging all the item responses, with
higher scores indicating better quality of life. Cronbach’s
alpha of the WHOQOL-BREF in this study was 0Æ88.

Ethical considerations

Approval for this trial was obtained from the Institutional
Review Board of the authors’ university. Each participant
was assured of confidentiality and the option to decline
participation or withdraw from the trial at any time.

Data analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSSSPSS 15.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Significance was considered
P < 0Æ05. Analysis of variance and chi-square statistics were
used to test for differences among the three groups at

Table 2 Intervention effects on falls for participants by group


baseline, 2 and 5 months after interventions. Changes in
outcome variables at various follow-up times were predicted
using a mixed model approach with an intent-to-treat
approach whereby all randomized participants were
included, and a mixed model was used to account for missing
follow-up data. Internal consistency was examined by Cronbach’s alpha.

#### Results

Comparison of three groups at baseline

Regardless of 186 participants at baseline or 176 participants
who completed this trial, the majority of participants were
65 years or older, female, with ‡6 years education, married
and half were living with their family (Table 1). More than
half of them had at least one enduring disease, with little
history of falls during the past year and some admitted fear of
falling (Table 1). These groups were well-balanced for
baseline demographic characteristics and falls-related history
(Table 1), and for falling (Table 2), fear of falling, mobility
(gait and balance), social support and quality of life (Table 3).

Impact of experimental programmes on outcomes

Elderly adults in the CB with Tai Chi group had significantly
better outcomes at 5 months than the control group for all
indicators, except for the average rate of falls.

Primary outcomes: fear of falling
GFFM scores. In terms of fear of falling, the average GFFM
scores for the CB and CB with Tai Chi groups decreased from
35Æ66 (SDSD = 11Æ60) and 35Æ82 (SDSD = 9Æ77) at baseline to 32Æ33
(SDSD = 11Æ14) and 30Æ30 (SDSD = 7Æ55), respectively 5 months
later, whereas scores for elderly adults in the control group

over the same period rose from 38Æ39 (SDSD = 12Æ06) to 42Æ00
(SDSD = 13Æ21) (Table 3). Differences among the three groups
were shown by mixed-model analysis to be significant
(interaction effect, F = 20Æ89, P < 0Æ001). These results
indicate that the decreased FOF of elderly adults in the two
experiment groups was significantly higher at 5 months than
that of the control group (F = 19Æ18, P < 0Æ001) (Table 3).

FES scores. Mean total FES scores for elderly adults in the
CB and CB with Tai Chi groups rose from 88Æ81 (SDSD = 17Æ40)
and 94Æ26 (SDSD = 16Æ71) at baseline to 90Æ88 (SDSD = 15Æ72) and
99Æ14 (SDSD = 11Æ66), respectively, at the 5-month follow-up,


whereas scores for elders in the control group descended from
90Æ39 (SDSD = 16Æ83) to 88Æ40 (SDSD = 18Æ71). FES among the
three groups was shown by mixed-model analysis to be
significantly different (interaction effect, F = 6Æ09,
P < 0Æ001). The mean FES score of the CB with Tai Chi
group was significantly higher than those of the CB and
control groups at the 5-month follow-up (F = 9Æ10,
P < 0Æ001) (Table 3).

Primary outcomes: falls

differ significantly among the three groups (F = 0Æ67,
P > 0Æ05) (Table 2). The rates of falls among elderly adults
post intervention were slightly lower than those at preintervention in the CB with Tai Chi group, but this difference was
not statistically significant (Table 2). Also, the fall rate
among the three groups was not significantly different during
the 3-month period after the interventions (v[2] = 2Æ52,
P > 0Æ05).

Secondary outcomes: mobility
Mobility among the three groups changed significantly over
time (Table 3) as demonstrated by mixed-model analysis
(interaction effect, F = 30Æ33, P < 0Æ001). The mean mobility score of the CB with Tai Chi group was higher than that of
the CB and control groups (P < 0Æ001) at the 5-month follow-up (Table 3). The gait scores among the three groups
changed significantly over time as demonstrated by mixedmodel analysis (interaction effect, F = 35Æ08, P < 0Æ001).
The mean gait score of the CB with Tai Chi group was significantly higher than that of the CB and control groups
(P < 0Æ001) at the 5-month follow-up (Table 3). Balance
among the three groups also changed significantly over time
as demonstrated by mixed-model analysis (interaction effect,
F = 25Æ22, P < 0Æ001). The mean balance score of the CB
with Tai Chi group was significantly higher than that of the
CB and control groups (P < 0Æ001) at the 5-month follow-up
(Table 3).

Secondary outcomes: social supports
The three groups were shown by mixed-model analysis to
be significantly different for social support behaviour
(interaction effect, F = 3Æ32, P < 0Æ05) and social support
satisfaction (interaction effect, F = 6Æ35, P < 0Æ001) (F =
6Æ67, P < 0Æ001). Elders who received the CB with Tai Chi
intervention reported significantly higher social support
satisfaction scores than the CB and control groups (F = 7Æ43,
P < 0Æ01) at the 5-month follow-up (Table 3).

Secondary outcomes: quality of life
Changes over time in total QOL and its subscales (physical
health, mental health, social relationships and environment)
for the three groups were significantly different at the
5-month follow-up as shown by mixed-model analysis
(interaction effect, F = 16Æ66, P < 0Æ001; subscales F =
17Æ14, 13Æ21, 3Æ39 and 8Æ80, P < 0Æ001 or 0Æ05, respectively)
(Table 3). The mean scores for total QOL and the four
subscales were significantly higher at the 5-month follow-up
for the CB with Tai Chi group than those of the CB and
control groups (P < 0Æ01 or 0Æ001) (Table 3).


#### Discussion

Study limitations

This trial had several limitations. First, participants were
recruited from only one community. The results from a multisite trial would be more generalizable. Second, participants
were followed up over a relatively short period. A longer
follow-up period would better estimate effects of intervention
on long-term management of FOF. Third, participants were
randomly allocated into three different groups, and a Tai Chi
only group was not included. Finally, it is unclear how much
additional time and costs were incurred by these two
individualized experimental approaches. A cost-effectiveness
study may be needed.

Discussion of results

This study is the first trial using a combined cognitivebehavioural strategy and Tai Chi intervention to reduce FOF
among community-dwelling elders. This trial demonstrated
that when community-dwelling elderly adults received CB
with Tai Chi exercise, they had less fear of falling, better falls
efficacy, better mobility (gait and balance), better social
support and better quality of life than elders in the control
group. Our findings confirm the results of a meta-analysis
(Jung et al. 2009), which found that fear of falling was
significantly decreased by interventions that combined exercise and education, measured intervention effects after
4 months and were community-based. Moreover, they found
that intervention effects were small, and suggested that
interventions to reduce FOF among the elders should involve
cognitive reconstructing and behavioural changes (Jung et al.
2009).
Our interventions adapted cognitive-behavioural strategies
from previous studies (Tennstedt et al. 1998, Zijlstra et al.
2005), and a FOF management model (Huang 2005). The
merit of our trial is that it involved two forms of intervention
used in everyday clinical practice. Cognitive-behavioural
strategies have been useful in programmes to manage fear
of falling (Tennstedt et al. 1998, Zijlstra et al. 2005,
Gitlin et al. 2006), but are inadequate substitutes for interventions that improve functional ability such as Tai Chi
exercise. Therefore, elderly adults in the combination group
had best outcomes at 5 months.
We chose Tai Chi as an exercise intervention in our trial
since it has been shown to be more effective than other
exercises for improving FOF and mobility in elderly adults
(Li et al. 2005, 2008, Sattin et al. 2005). As in our trial, that

#### What is already known about this topic

 - Fear of falling is a major health problem of communitydwelling older persons.

 - Few studies exploring Tai Chi or cognitive behavioural
strategies could reduce fear of falling among elders.

#### What this paper adds

 - This is the first trial using a cognitive-behavioural
strategy with Tai Chi exercise among communitydwelling older adults to manage fear of falling, and the
intervention reducing fear of falling effectively.

 - This trial helped community-dwelling elderly adults to
enhance their mobility and social support and to
increase their quality of life.

#### Implications for practice and/or policy

 - The findings of this study indicate that the cognitivebehavioural strategy with Tai Chi intervention is
effective for reducing fear of falling among communitydwelling older adults.

 - These findings can be used by community health
professionals to play an important role in decreasing
older adults’ fear of falling, and in promoting their
mobility, social support, and quality of life.

literature review found strong evidence for the effectiveness
of Tai Chi in reducing FOF. The Tai Chi interventions were
found to vary greatly in duration, frequency and intensity
(Harling & Simpson 2008). For example, in one study
(Li et al. 2008), the participants needed ‡75% attendance
rate of twice weekly 1-hour classes (40–45 minutes of 8-form
Tai Chi) for 12 weeks, and ‡30 minutes of in-home practice
per week. In another study (Sattin et al. 2005), two sessions
of Tai Chi were given per week, increasing from 60 to
90 minutes, excluding warm-up and cool down (progressing
from 10 to 50 minutes) for 48 weeks. In our combined
intervention, we gave 1-hour Tai Chi classes, five times a
week, for 8 weeks, which seemed to effectively reduce FOF
among community-dwelling elders. However, in this trial, we
did not have an experimental group that received a Tai Chi
intervention only; therefore, we are not able to distinguish the
effectiveness of this trial because of Tai Chi or the combination intervention.
On the other hand, our study found no significant
differences in falls among the three groups at the 5-month
follow-up. Our findings on falls are consistent with a
literature review that found weak evidence supporting the


effectiveness of Tai Chi in reducing the incidence of falls in
older adults (Harling & Simpson 2008). The follow-up time
may be too short to detect enough falls for analysis; also, in
view of the relatively health and young participants in this
trial.
The participants who received the CB with Tai Chi
intervention had better social support. This effect may have
been due to about half of the participants being single
(n = 83, 47Æ16%), and living alone (n = 86, 48Æ86%); thus,
participating in Tai Chi group exercise at least three times a
week might have created a sense of belonging. Our finding is
consistent with a previous report that social support was
positively associated with physical activity of older rural
women (Plonczynski et al. 2008).
All the participants in this group continued doing Tai Chi
after the intervention, consistent with previous reports that
100% of 140 community-dwelling older adults intended to
continue doing Tai Chi after a 12-week intervention (Li et al.
2008) and that peer groups are important to the well-being
of single elders (Gupta & Korte 1994). Similarly, elders’
well-being was found to be strongly related to a level of
social involvement and self-reported quality of social life
(Kunzmann 2008).
Our findings that the CB with Tai Chi intervention
improved multiple QOL domains of older adults should
indicate that this intervention is acceptable to them and that
they will adhere to it in the long term (Lin et al. 2007). Our
results reinforce the need to further examine the meaning of
QOL assessments in older adults. First, not all generic QOL
measures, usually developed for the general population, are
suitable for older people. However, the WHOQOL-BREF
has been determined as a reliable, valid and responsive
measure of the occurrence of falls in older people (Lin et al.
2007). Second, improvements in the physical and psychological QOL domains and mobility scores may have resulted
from improved functional status as a consequence of Tai
Chi exercise, peer support or the CB programme. Finally, a
meaningful interpretation of changes in QOL scores is
usually difficult, because the statistical significance of
changes in QOL scores implies little about their clinical
significance. If the QOL changes are related to more
familiar or objective measures, clinicians may more easily
grasp the anchor-based interpretation of clinical significance
in elderly populations. For instance, changes in scores on the
physical QOL domain in this study were significantly
correlated with those in balance (r = 0Æ66) and gait
(r = 0Æ59), and changes in scores on the psychological
QOL domain were significantly correlated with those in
fear of falling (GFFM and FES, r = 0Æ54 and r = 0Æ49,
respectively).

#### Conclusion

This is the first trial using a cognitive-behavioural strategy
with Tai Chi exercise among community-dwelling older
adults to manage fear of falling and promote their mobility,
social support behaviour and satisfaction, and quality of life.
This study gives evidence to support the CB with Tai Chi
intervention as an appropriate and effective programme for
reducing fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults.

Implications for practice and future research

The findings of this study indicate that the CB with Tai Chi
intervention is effective for reducing FOF among communitydwelling older adults. These findings can be used by
community health professionals to play an important role
in decreasing older adults’ FOF, and promoting their mobility, social support and QOL. Furthermore, implementing this
intervention with a sample of older community-dwelling
adults or those with admitted FOF may empower them to
deal with FOF. This intervention also needs to be tested on
hospitalized and institutionalized elders. Finally, to more
precisely study the effects of the intervention, a longer term
follow-up period will be needed.
