INTRODUCTION
Most cognitive abilities tend to decline with age (1). For
instance, Schaie (2) found almost linear negative differ

ences between several age groups, ranging from young
adulthood to old age, in inductive reasoning, spatial orientation, perceptual speed and verbal memory, but not in
numeric and verbal abilities. An important question, however, is whether this decline in many cognitive abilities is
reversible when potential causative factors are manipu-an
lated. Several studies have suggested that engagement inngagemgagemenent
cognitively challenging activities is associated with main-ssociatiateded with maimai

aged 75 and older, who engaged more often in activities
such as reading and playing games, demonstrated a lower risk of developing dementia (5). In other studies, more
general measures of activity, such as participation in everyday mental, social or physical activities, were found to
be associated with protection from cognitive decline
(e.g., 6, 7). These studies all suggest that intellectual and
cognitively challenging activities are related to the preservation of cognitive capacity.
Results such as those described above suggest that
cognitive functioning can be improved by promoting the
participation of older persons in cognitively challenging activities. This idea is in line with Swaab’s ‘use it or lose it’
principle (8), which is based on neurobiological findings in
animals that the use of neurons and neuronal networks
prolongs the efficiency of central nervous system (CNS) activity during life. According to Swaab, candidate factors to

stimulate the CNS may originate from within the organism, but also from the environment. When the notion of
‘use it or lose it’ is translated to a functional level, this
would imply that mental stimulation can counteract the reduced efficiency of higher brain functions that come with
age. This has actually been found in several animal studies in which enriched or challenging environments proved
to be beneficial to cognitive functioning in aged laboratory
animals (e.g., 9, 10). Such findings are not only consistent
with the ‘use it or lose it’ notion, but also to the concept
of cognitive reserve, which assumes that individuals with
more elaborate cognitive strategies are better protected
against symptom onset following brain damage (11).
Several examples of interventions that specifically target cognitive capacities of older adults have been described in the literature. Such studies involved memory
training (e.g., 12, 13) or mnemonic techniques (14, 15),
all of which had positive effects on memory performance
to a variable extent. Apart from memory, other cognitive
abilities, such as reasoning, spatial orientation and speed
of processing (15, 16) have been taught successfully and
shown to improve in older adults.
The studies cited above suggest that cognitive functions
in older adults can be improved with specific, dedicated interventions. However, in order to function independently in everyday life, multiple cognitive functions are drawnrawrawn
upon. For instance, a daily activity such as grocery shop-grg oceryery shopshopping involves planning (how to get to the grocery store),o thethe grogr ceryery ststore)ore),
memory (which items to buy), information processingbuy), informationmation proprocessingcessi

simultaneously may be called for (12).maymay bebe callcalleded foror (12)2)
The use of the internet may qualify as a candidate ac-thehe ininternternetet m
tivity in a multifactorial intervention. It provides an intel-ifacifactorii l
lectually challenging activity which is intrinsically rewarding, because internet-based services may have particular benefits for older persons (e.g., 17, 18). In order to
use internet services such as web surfing or e-mail, many
of the cognitive abilities that are drawn upon for everyday
functioning are recruited. Therefore, through the internet,
one may use the same cognitive functions that are required to execute everyday tasks (such as memory for remembering errands, attention to focus on a particular task,
etc.). In terms of “use it or lose it”, by using cognitive functions during computer and internet use, deterioration of
cognitive functions that are essential to everyday tasks due
to age-related decline may be prevented. For instance,
long-term or procedural memory is required to reproduce the routines needed to use a computer program, e.g.,
to launch a web browser, and to execute specific commands in that browser. Short-term memory, or working


memory, is activated to keep track of information already attended or to decide on the next action to take. Executive functions come into play in order to sort necessary
actions into the correct order. Visual search, information
processing and attentional processes are recruited in order
to find relevant cues, to evaluate which information on a
web page is relevant within a given context, and to focus
on those cues while ignoring or inhibiting irrelevant cues.
Furthermore, Stronge et al. (19) mention the importance
of problem-solving ability and concept formation, which is
essential for building a mental framework of computer-related knowledge representations. Spatial orientation is
also considered an important ability for web surfing, in order to keep track of one’s location in cyberspace (20).
Very few attempts have actually been made to study
the impact of computer and internet use on the cognitive
abilities of older adults. Several broader studies show
that psychosocial measures, such as self-confidence,den
loneliness, social interaction, satisfaction with life andwithth lifife a
depression, could improve as a result of learning to usesult off learlearningning toto us

games, and other educational and recreational applica-gamem
tions. Comparable results were found in a subsequent
study, in which 29 nursing home residents aged 50 and
older were divided into a computer training group and a
control group (matched in terms of ability to take care of
daily needs, cognitive functioning and depression level)
(22). Participants in the training group used the same online computer service as had been used in the previous
study, and those in the control group participated in
regular nursing home recreational and educational activities. After six months of using the computer service,
participants in the computer training group had improved in MMSE, ADL and depression scores, whereas
the control group remained unchanged. In sum, circumstantial evidence indicates that learning to use a computer
and the internet in later life may have beneficial effects on
the cognitive ability of older individuals. However, a
number of factors may affect the results of internetbased intervention studies such as described above. For instance, as participation in such an intervention is on a voluntary basis, selection bias may have occurred, i.e., the
fact that individuals are interested in information technology may affect the outcome variables of the study
for example, as a result of differences in motivation with


-----

respect to task performance. There may also have been
an effect of computer training apart from the actual subsequent period of computer use. Therefore, one should
account for both the effect of initial computer training and
participants’ interest in learning to use these facilities in order to be able to study exclusively the effect of using
computers and the internet for a period of time. To
date, systematic studies on this topic are not available.
Because many of the above-mentioned cognitive abilities needed to use the internet decline with advancing age
(for an extensive overview, see ref. 1) and as information
technologies are often unfamiliar to older adults, it is to be
expected that using the internet provides a cognitive
challenge to older people. We hypothesize that engaging
in such a cognitively challenging activity will stimulate older adults to develop more efficient cognitive skills and (alternate) strategies for daily life task requirements. If
proven successful, this study may support the notion
that age-related cognitive decline can be counteracted by
aspecific mobilization of cognitive resources.
We conducted a randomized controlled intervention
study to test the above-mentioned hypothesis. A large
group of participants with interest in computer usage
was recruited from the general population and randomly
assigned to three conditions in which a cognitive challenge
(an intervention consisting of computer and internet useet use
for twelve months) was present or not present. In addition,t. In adddditionition,

METHODSS
_Participants_
For the present study, we aimed at recruiting 240 participants in four separate groups. Invitation flyers were
randomly sent to older adults from the Maastricht city
register. Participants were included in the study if they
were aged between 64 and 75, considered themselves to be
healthy, and were sufficiently mobile to travel independently to the research center. Exclusion criteria were prior
experience with any of the neuropsychological tests used in
this study and general mental functioning in a range suggesting possible cognitive disorder (score below 24 on the
MMSE) (23). Also, participants were to have no prior active
computer experience and be willing to refrain from computer use or computer lessons for the duration of this
study (i.e., twelve months). Both participants with and
without interest in learning to use computers and the internet were asked to respond to the flyer by returning an ap

plication card for more detailed information. On this card
they could indicate by ticking one of two options whether
they were interested in learning to use the internet or not
(but were willing to participate). All participants signed a
form stating that they would refrain from any self-initiated
computer use during the study, and signed an informed consent form. The Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University Hospital approved the study.
It was decided that exposure to the intervention was to
be compared with three control groups. Two groups
consisted of individuals with interest in learning to use the
internet, as was the case with individuals in the intervention group. One of these two groups received the
same training as those in the intervention group. The other group was not trained in computer or internet skills.
These two control groups made it possible to control for
training effects. The third control group consisted of individuals without any interest in computers or internet use,et
but who were willing to participate in the study. Partici-study.d PaPart

one to two weeks in between) was applied to minimize procedural learning of the tests during the intervention period.
Cognitive data from the first baseline measurement were
discarded. One hundred and twenty-six people (34.4%)
were excluded from the study because of: computer experience, n=54; health-related problems, n=14; experience
with tests from the test battery, n=11; they were not willing to refrain from computer use during the study, n=4; no
cable TV connection at home (required for the internet connection) or lack of space for a personal computer, n=2; or
no specific reason, n=41. After the first baseline administration, four participants dropped out of the study due to
health problems, being ‘too busy’, put off by the test procedure, or a score of below 24 on the MMSE. The test battery was administered again after four and twelve months,
with parallel test versions. A questionnaire was also administered on all three test occasions.
Initial recruitment did not yield sufficient participants for
the control group, so again an invitation was sent to
585 new people from the municipal registry to recruit only additional participants who were not interested in
computers and the internet. After these two recruitment
procedures, the number of participants in the control

group after baseline was kept at 45.
Participants who were interested in learning to use
computers and the internet (n=191) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: two-thirds of the participants (n=123, 64.4%) received brief training; and
one-third (n=68, 35.6%) did not receive this training
and were assigned to the No training/No intervention
Group.
Participants in the training condition were scheduled for
three four-hour training sessions over a period of two
weeks. In these sessions, a maximum of six participants
were introduced to and could practice with, a personal
computer (Apple) and its operating system, customary
software applications (e.g., a word processor), and several
internet applications (e.g., an internet browser and e-mail).
The training sessions were supervised by two teachers with
high levels of proficiency in internet applications, the
system software, and providing technical support. Each
teacher hosted one specific session for each training
group (either focusing on the computer operating system
and software skills or on internet applications). The
teachers alternately supervised the final practice session.
Participants received general information and were instructed on how to perform basic computer and internet
assignments from a custom-made course book. Ample
time was available at each meeting to practise with severaleveral
applications according to participants’ own aspirations. Af-pirationstions. AfAf-f

respect to training activities.
After training, individuals in the Intervention Group received a personal computer with a broadband internet
connection in their homes. They were instructed to use it
according to their personal needs. These needs were
not specified or assessed. In training, participants received demonstrations of several purposes for which the
internet could be used (e.g., e-mail contact with family and
friends, finding hobby-related information, finding opening hours, public transport time schedules, phone numbers, etc.). Internet-related assignments (once every two
weeks in the first four months; once every month in the
remaining period of the study) and a helpdesk were
used to motivate participants and to stimulate computer
use. Table 1 shows the 16 assignments participants received by e-mail. They were asked to respond to them by
replying to the e-mail. These assignments were thuse t

purposes of this study. First, the difference between the
median response times of the second and first conditions
was used as an indication of response selection. Secondly, a measure of inhibition of a prepotent response
(29) was provided by the difference between the third and
second conditions.
General cognitive speed. The Letter-Digit Substitution Test (LDST) (30) was used to measure the speed of
processing general information. This test is a modification
of the Symbol-Digits Modalities Test (31). A code is provided at the top of a sheet of paper that couples the numbers 1 to 9 with random letters. Participants were asked
to fill in on the rest of the sheet as many corresponding
numbers as possible in boxes that contained only letters
in 90 seconds.
Cognitive flexibility. The Concept Shifting Test (CST)
(32) was used to measure cognitive flexibility. This test
consists of three sheets of paper with 16 small circles that
are grouped within a larger circle. On the first sheet, numbers appear in the small circles in a fixed random order.
Participants are asked to cross out these numbers in the
right order as fast as possible. Instructions for the second
sheet were identical to those for the first, except that now
letters appear in the circles. On the third sheet, participants had to alternate between numbers and letters. The
time needed to complete each of the sheets was record-cordcorded. The mean of the scores for the first and secondandd secondsecond

two cards as an indication of simple speed, and the difference between the score for the third card and the
mean of the scores for the first and second cards (interference score) was used as a measure of the capacity to inhibit a habitual response (reading the word), which reflects
selective attention.
Cognitive failures. The Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) (34) was included to measure subjective cog

nitive functioning. It has been validated and adapted for
the use in a Dutch population (35). This questionnaire
consists of 25 items that measure the frequency of failures
within several cognitive domains (e.g., attention, memory and planning) rated on a five-point scale. The sum of
the scores for these items was used as the dependent variable, a higher score indicating more cognitive failures.
Measures of computer use. To measure the actual
involvement of individuals in the Intervention Group in
computer-related activities at both the 4-month and 12month follow-up moments, participants were asked to indicate how many hours per week they had used the
computer and the internet. These questions were asked
retrospectively at the end of the follow-up tests. That is,
participants were not asked to keep a continuous record
of their computer use because this might have intruded
with their experience of normal computer use. We chose
to rely on self-report data instead of logging participants’pa
computer use for two reasons. First, without asking par-ut askingasking p

(ag(age, sex, education and income as a measure of socio-age

four groups. General Linear Model (GLM) with repeated
measures analysis of variance was used to study the effect
of the intervention. Analyses were conducted with group
as between-subject variable (four levels: Intervention,
Training/No intervention, No training/No intervention,
Control Group) and time as a within-subject variable
(three levels: second baseline, 4-month follow-up, and 12month follow-up). Contrasts were defined to compare
changes in performance over time (between the three
measurements) of the four groups. Age, level of education,
sex, and monthly income were used as covariates. We
were especially interested in the interaction of time and
group, as this interaction shows whether the groups differed from one another with respect to changes in the dependent variables, for example, as a result of the intervention. The data of participants who completed all
measurements of the particular test were included in the
analyses. Therefore, the number of complete cases is not
exactly identical for all measures. All analyses were repeated with only the individuals in the Intervention Group,
to account for the extent of computer use. In these analyses, the between-subject variable ‘extent of computer use’

had two levels: light and heavy. This variable was calculated by a median split method on the number of hours
per week participants said they used their computers at
the 12-month follow-up. In this case, the median was 7.5
hours, so that participants who reported using their com

puters 7 hours per week or less were labeled ‘light users’
and those who reported using them 8 hours per week or
more were ‘heavy users’. All variables included in the analyses were first checked for normal distributions, missing
values and outliers. Distributions were considered suitable

extreme values by the highest value in the normal range.
All statistical analyses were performed with p=0.05 as significance level.

RESULTS
_Baseline comparisons_
At baseline, the four groups did not differ with respect
to age, sex, level of education, monthly income or MMSE
score. When participants who were interested in the intervention were compared with participants who were not
interested, differences were found with respect to the
MMSE scores (F(1,231)=4.321, p=0.04) and the CFQ
(F(1,226)=4.118, p=0.04): interested participants had
lower MMSE scores but reported fewer cognitive failures. These differences were not found in analyses in
which participants who dropped out had been removed
from the sample.
Baseline comparisons of participants who dropped
out of the study at some point with participants who
completed all test administrations showed differences in
level of education (F(1,229)=4.129, p=0.04) and the
MMSE score (F(1,234)=4.097, p=0.04) Participants
who dropped out had lower levels of education and a lower MMSE score.

_Effects of intervention_
Table 2 gives an overview of the main effects of group
on the three measurements and of the interaction between
group and time. The main effects of group were found for
the summed score on the first three trials of the VVLT,
the flexibility score of the CST, and the simple speed measure of the SCWT. Pairwise comparisons revealed that
participants in the Intervention Group showed higher
total scores in the VVLT (p<0.01) over time than those in
the Training/No intervention Group. Also, participants in
the Intervention Group showed better flexibility scores in
the CST compared with the Training/No intervention
Group (p<0.01). Lastly, participants in the Training/No
intervention Group were faster in terms of the simple
speed measure of the SCWT compared with the Inter

vention (p<0.01), the No training/No intervention
(p<0.01) and Control Groups (p=0.01). A group x time
interaction was only found for the verbal learning variable
of the VVLT (F(6,178)=2.196, p=0.04). Post-hoc analyses showed that both Training Groups showed an increase in the verbal learning variable from baseline to 4month follow-up measurements, whereas neither No
training Groups showed a decrease (see Fig. 2). The difference between the Intervention and the No training/No
intervention Groups was significant (p=0.04). No statistically significant main effects of group or significant
group x time interactions were found on any of the other cognitive measures, nor on the CFQ.
Repeating all analyses with exclusion or replacement of
extreme values did yield comparable results. Also, all
analyses were repeated with only baseline measurements
and 12-month follow-up measurements, as six participants
were not available for the 4-month follow-up (and there-th
fore not included in the original analyses). These analysesTheheses ananalysaly
again yielded comparable results.

(F(1,41)=5.425, p=0.03) and interference score on the

their computers more often remembered more words
on the first trial and on the summed score of the first three
trials of the VVLT, and needed less time to inhibit a habitual response in the SCWT. Instead, participants who
used their computers less often showed higher verbal
learning capacity in the VVLT. In other words, the difference between the maximum number of immediately recalled words and the number of recalled words in the first
trial of this group was higher than this difference in the
group of heavy computer users in the Intervention Group.
An interaction effect between the extent of computer
use and time was found for the summed scores of the first
three trials of the VVLT (F(2,46)=3.533, p=0.03), showing that, in the first four months of the intervention, the
summed score of heavy computer users decreased, whereas that of light users increased (p=0.02). The same was
found for the delayed recall score in the VVLT
(F(2,46)=4.885, p=0.01). Here, the difference in change
between light and heavy users was significant, both between the 4-month follow-up and baseline measurements
(p=0.02) and also for the period between the 12-month

DISCUSSIONDDISCUSCUSSISSIONON
The main question addressed in this study was whethere main resseded in thithis ststududy
an intervention for older adults - in which learning to user olderlder adultsdu - in whh
a personal computer and several internet services followedmpmputeruter andand seseveve
by the subsequent use of these applications for one yearentn use

- has an impact on our measures of cognitive abilities. No
effect of intervention was found on almost all these measures. A difference in change over time between the
groups was actually found on only one cognitive measure,
i.e., the learning variable of the VVLT. However, this interaction effect between group and time was quite random
and did not appear to be caused by the intervention.
There were also some main effects of group membership
over time but, since no interactions with time were
found, these effects cannot be attributed to the intervention.
We did find some interaction effects when the Intervention group was split into light and heavy computer
users. Again, these effects appeared to be quite random
and could not be attributed to the extent of computer use.
The main effects of group (light vs heavy computer
users) over time indicated that participants who used their


computers 8 hours or more per week had better scores
in trial one of the VVLT, summed score of the VVLT,
and interference score of the SCWT. In other words, participants with better verbal memory and better capacities
to inhibit a habitual response (which is an attentional process) used their computers more extensively. Instead, participants who used their computers less than 8 hours per
week showed better verbal learning scores. This was
probably a result of the fact that these participants remembered fewer words in the first trial of the VVLT and
could thus improve more in the following trials, compared
with heavy computer users. These results suggest that
there is a relationship between computer use and cognitive abilities in older adults. However, as the differences
between light and heavy computer users did not change
over time, the intervention did not have an impact on
these cognitive abilities. Rather, it seems that older
adults with better cognitive abilities tend to use a com-a c
puter more extensively. This relationship between com-betetween coco
puter use and cognitive abilities was also reflected in thes also refeflelecteted inin thth

er studies targeting cognitive functions in older adults,s tarargegetining cognititivi

which showedwhich showed that these functions improve as a result ofowed thahat thth
trtrainingtraining or intervention (12, 15, 16, 36). One major dif-ing oror inti

ference between these studies and our study which mayfeferenen
have caused differences in findings concerns methodological issues. Many studies on cognitive training or interventions have methodological limitations, such as absence of control groups, small sample sizes and thus low
power, or flaws in the design or psychometric instruments (37). We tried to overcome these flaws by using a
large sample size and a randomized design. Such a design
has major advantages. For example, by including three
control groups, it was possible to study not just the effect
of the intervention. We were also, at least theoretically, able
to distinguish this effect from the effects of training and of
participants’ interest in computers and the internet. It is
possible that individuals who enrolled for the intervention
differ from those who were not interested in the intervention with respect to uncontrolled characteristics that
may also have had an effect on the outcome of this study
(e.g., eagerness to learn, need for social contacts). Our design made it possible to conclude that finding no effect of
the intervention was unrelated to potential confounders
such as computer training or interest. Also, because of our
design, we were able to control for the social attention to
which the participants of intervention studies are exposed. Since social interactions during training sessions


-----

may have had an effect that is not related to the actual intervention, we included a control group that received the
same training as the Intervention Group.
Our findings do not differ only from findings in studies
targeting specific cognitive functions. There are also a few
earlier studies showing that computer-based interventions similar to ours to some extent did yield positive effects on several psychosocial (17, 18, 21, 22, 38, 39) and
cognitive measures (21, 22).
There are a number of differences between our study
and the limited number of studies that found effects of an
intervention on cognitive ability measures. The first major difference is the study population. Both of the abovementioned studies included residents of care facilities,
i.e., not older adults living independently, whereas the participants in the present study were. It may be that our
community-dwelling participants had less to gain from the
intervention. Since similar interventions do yield improvements of the cognitive abilities of care facility residents, it is possible that individuals who have functional
limitations may improve as a result of learning to use computers and the internet. Older adults with such limitations,
that is, individuals with a reduction in reserves and an increasing number of losses amongst others within the
cognitive domain, may have more potential to improve
with respect to these losses. For instance, older adults withs withwith
memory deficits may improve more as a result of trainingult off trainingtraining
memory functions than older adults with normal or highwithith nonormalmal or highhigh
memory functioning. This is a research topic that could beresearch topitopic thathat couldcoul beb

A second major difference between our study andjoj r didifferencfferen e betwbetw
earlier studies using computer-based interventions con-usining cocomputmput
cerns the measures of cognitive ability. Both of theasuasures
above-mentioned studies (21, 22) used a rather general
measure of cognitive ability, the MMSE. In our study,
more specific measures of cognitive functions that tend to
decline with age were included. Because of this, we were
able to study the impact of our intervention on many more
aspects of cognitive functioning compared with the general measures used in previous research. Not only did
these objective measures of cognitive abilities not change
as a result of the intervention used in this study, but we did
not find any effect of intervention on reported cognitive
failures, which is a more subjective measure of cognitive
functioning.
Apart from the advantages of the design and methodology described above, there are also some limitations to
this study. One explanation for the lack of an effect of our
intervention on cognitive ability is that the intervention did
not challenge the cognitive capacity of our participants suf

ficiently. This explanation seems less plausible though. The
participants in this intervention study had no prior experience with using computers and the internet. According to the literature and the self-reports of our participants, older adults experience quite some difficulty
in mastering computer skills and using computers and software applications. They are slower, make more errors,
and need more steps to reach their goals than individuals
who are younger (e.g., 40). Thus, learning to use computers and the internet requires considerable cognitive effort from older adults. Another reason why it is not very
plausible to assume that our intervention did not change
the level of cognitive activity of the participants is the fact
that the participants in the Intervention Group used their
computers quite frequently, with an average of more
than 8 hours per week at the end of the intervention period. Also, they were encouraged to use the internet by
regular e-mail assignments of increasing difficulty through-rou
out the study period. Overall, we do not believe that theelieveev thahat t
intervention was insufficient in providing a true cognitivevidingg a trtrueue cogniognititiv

Lastly, despite a very strict study design, we were not
able to account for some aspects that might have influenced results. For instance, we cannot rule out the possibility that the follow-up period of our study was too short
to detect differential changes in cognitive measures over
time. A period of one year may be insufficient to detect
differences in aging patterns, although it does seem to be
long enough to detect differential improvement, as supported by other cognitive intervention studies with similar
or shorter follow-up durations (e.g., 12, 15, 16, 36).
Another related issue which we are not able to resolve
here, but which may be very relevant for the independent
functioning of older adults, is that older individuals who
have learned to use a computer and the internet have better strategies to cope with (cognitive) limitations they
may encounter in later life. As personal computers and the
internet have several promising functions in this respect
(e.g., providing reminders for people with memory problems, easy contact with health care providers, ordering
groceries for people with mobility restrictions, providing
day schedules, including reminders, for people with declined executive functions, etc.), it is perfectly possible that
older adults who master computer skills have more op

portunities to compensate for future age-related limitations. Future studies could address this issue in more detail, although this type of research is sometimes not very
feasible because of problems such as high expenses and
attrition.

CONCLUSIONS
We did not find any influence of learning to use computers and the internet on a broad range of cognitive ability measures in a healthy group of independently living
older adults with no prior computer experience. The results of this study do not support the notion that stimulating the cognitive skills of older community-dwelling
adults actually increases their cognitive abilities. However, the question whether persons with more evident cognitive impairments have more to gain from such interventions, if they are able to master the routines that are
necessary for successful computer use, remains unresolved. Lastly, another question that remains interesting for future research is whether older adults who have
received timely training in using computers and internet
services remain independent longer when functional limitations start to emerge.
