Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can impair language, but active music therapy (AMT) and memantine (M) can improve communication.
This study aimed to clarify whether adding AMT to M may improve language in comparison with drugs alone in patients with
moderate AD on stable therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchEI). Forty-five AD patients treated with stable dose of AchEI
were randomized to receive AMT plus M 20 mg/day or M 20 mg/day for 24 weeks. The Severe Impairment Battery-Language (SIB-l),
SIB, Mini Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Lubben Social Network Scale, Activities of Daily Living, and
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks assessed language (primary variable) and overall
cognitive, psycho-behavior, social, and functional aspects (secondary variables). The SIB-l showed a stabilization of the baseline
condition in both groups, in the absence of between-group differences. The NPI depression and appetite scores significantly improved
in the M-AMT group. Moreover, significantly less patients in the M-AMT group than those in the M group showed worsening of the
NPI total score. Daily activities, social relationships, and overall cognitive performance did not deteriorate. In patients with moderate
AD, AMT added to pharmacotherapy has no further benefits for language in comparison with pharmacotherapy alone. However, this
integrated treatment can improve the psycho-behavioral profile.

Impaired verbal communication is a distressing manifestation
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1]. Frequent language defects
include anomia, altered comprehension, paraphasia, empty
speech, decreased verbal fluency, and digression from the topic [2], impacting mood and quality of life (QoL) of patients
and caregivers [3].
Cholinesterase inhibitors (AchEI) and memantine (M)
(an uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist) are pharmacologic options [4]. M demonstrated safety and efficacy in monotherapy [5] or in combination with
AchEI [6, 7] and, in a meta-analysis collecting 1826 patients with moderate or severe AD, it resulted more effective than placebo on global health, cognition, function,
and behavior [8]. In patients with mild to moderate AD,
treatment with AchEI and M resulted in significant but
clinically marginal improvement of cognition, behavior,
or functionality [9], while M alone did not relate to any


-----

significant changes [10]. AchEI and M are indicated in
mild-to-moderate and moderate AD, respectively, but almost 50% of patients with mild AD have been receiving
M [11]. In this regard, Schneider et al. [11] completed a
meta-analysis of clinical trials, stating that there was
scarce evidence for benefits of M in mild to moderate
AD and posed indications to prospective trials of M either
alone or in combination with AchEI in this condition.
Overall, treatment with AchEI and M resulted in small
cognitive and functional improvements, but outcome assessment did not comprehend any measures of communication,
social life, progression of disability, or caregiver burden.
In patients with severe AD, M improved language and
communication [12], but there are no information concerning
patients with less serious forms of AD.
Music therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention
with theoretical and operational bases that applies the effects of sound, music, and sound-movement integration
on cognition and behavior, stimulating interpersonal relations and non-verbal communication, as well as personal
expressions, creativity, and emotions [13–15]. In patients
with AD, active music therapy (AMT) involving sound
and music playing resulted in improved coordination, attention, and memory [16]. Furthermore, AMT can facilitate communication [17] and improve language [18] and
determine positive effects on emotions, mood, and social
behavior [17, 19, 20] and QoL [16], and may enhance the
effects of drugs for dementia [17]. Patients with mild to
moderate AD undergoing AMT for 3 months showed a
mild decline of initiative and episodic memory and a significant decrease of anxiety and depression [21]. In patients with chronic vascular encephalopathy, AMT may
improve executive functions and mood [22]. To our
knowledge, no randomized clinical studies have compared
the effects of pharmacological treatment using M or
AchEI and AMT on language in AD patients.
Given the positive influence for AMT on language and
communication [17, 18] and that these effects were also
documented with M [12], and AMT may also contribute
to stabilize initiative in patients with not serious cognitive
decline [22], the question has been risen whether the addition of AMT to a pharmacological treatment may give
additional benefits compared to drug therapy alone in patients with moderate AD. The primary objective of this
study was to determine the effect of an integrated approach on language in comparison to M added to stable
AchEI treatment. Secondarily, we evaluated the influence
of such an approach on global cognitive functioning,
psycho-behavioral and social aspects, and daily activities.
We hypothesized that, in comparison with pharmacotherapy alone, combining AMT and pharmacotherapy may
contribute to stabilize language and improve psychobehavioral aspects.


## Method

### Patients

Patients with probable AD were selected in one center according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
IV TR [23] and NINCDS-ADRDA revised criteria [24].
Patients followed up at the hospital outpatient clinic for cognitive disturbances were contacted to participate to a
prescreening evaluation and to receive information about the
trial. Six to 8 months after the prescreening, consenting patients underwent the baseline assessment and were randomly
assigned to a study group. At baseline, overall cognitive functioning (as expressed by the Mini Mental State Examination,
MMSE) [25] indicated a moderate cognitive decline in all of
the patients. The MMSE mean scores decreased from
prescreening (mean ± SD: M-AMT group, 17.86 ± 5.53; M
group, 17.48 ± 5.54) to baseline. The adjusted mean changes
from prescreening to baseline in the M-AMT group (− 1.27,
95% CI − 2.31 to − 0.24, p = 0.018) did not significantly differ
from those observed in the M group (− 1.24, 95% CI − 2.16 to
− 0.32, p = 0.011). Eligible patients were on stable treatment
with AchEI for at least 4 weeks and had impaired language

[2]. Gate imbalance, extrapyramidal signs, seizures,
neurovegetative failures, and severe psychiatric conditions
(major depression, psychosis, bipolar disorders) preceding
cognitive decline were exclusion criteria.

### Interventions

M 20 mg/day was added to AchEI. AMTincluded twice weekly sessions, each lasting 40 min, conducted by a music therapist. A non-verbal approach and free sound-music interactions, using rhythmical and melodic instruments, were
adopted. The sound-music interaction involved cognition
and emotions, stimulating interpersonal adaptation. Each session began with musical improvisation inviting patients to
choose an instrument and to play using a free technique.
Patients contemporarily listened to other patients playing,
freely searching an interplay. No music knowledge was required [13, 18]. The equipment included xylophones, glockenspiels, triangles, wind chimes, maracas, small woods,
guiros, and ethnic percussions. The sessions were
videotaped. The interventions lasted 24 weeks.

### Randomization and blinding

The randomization was made using a computer-generated list
of random numbers, assigning the patients to treatment with
M or M plus AMT (M-AMT). Figure 1 shows the participant’s flow through the study. The patients were evaluated
blindly by a neuropsychologist at baseline and at weeks 12
and 24.

### Outcome measures

Excluded from analysis (n=0) Excluded from analysis (n=0)


The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to
week 24 of the Severe Impairment Battery Language (SIB-l)
subscale score [26]. The SIB-l, included in the Severe
Impairment Battery (SIB) [27], includes 24 items evaluating
naming, reading, writing, and repetition (maximum score 46,
the higher the score, the better the language). The secondary
efficacy endpoints were the SIB [27], Activities of Daily
Living (ADL) [28] and Instrumental Activities of Daily
Living (IADL) scales [29], Neuropsychiatric Inventory
(NPI) [30], MMSE [25], and Lubben Social Network Scale
(LSNS) scores [31] at 12 and 24 weeks. The SIB [27] is a 40item, 100-point scale that assesses, in addition to language,
social interactions, memory, orientation, attention, praxis,
visual-spatial ability, and orientation, with lower scores indicating greater impairment. The ADL [28] measures independence in daily activities (bathing, dressing, toileting,


transferring, eating, and the use of incontinence materials),
with a score ranging from 0 (total independence) to 6 (total
dependence). The IADL [29] assesses eating, dressing,
sphincter control, house works, cooking, using telephone,
using money, and outside movement, with scores ranging
from 0 to 8 (complete independence). The NPI [30] assesses
psychic and behavioral symptoms in individuals with dementia, using a caregiver’s interview. It evaluates delusions, hallucinations, depressed mood, anxiety, agitation, euphoria, apathy, irritability, inhibition, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavior disturbances, and eating behavior changes, for
which the frequency and severity are rated 1–3 (higher numbers indicate greater frequency or severity); a score for each
symptom is computed by multiplying the frequency by the
severity. The LSNS [31] evaluates the perceived social support received by family, friends, and neighbors. It is a selfreport 10-item scale; each item is rated 0–5 (higher scores
indicate better social support). The MMSE [25] is based on


-----

questions testing five cognitive functions (orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, language), giving a 0–
30 total score (the higher the score, the higher the cognitive
level).

### Data analysis

Previously published data of patients with moderate to severe
AD [12] were taken into consideration to determine baseline
SIB-l total score, but preliminary assessment of patients did not
support such a comparison. In particular, the MMSE scores indicating moderate cognitive impairment did not match to moderate to comparable impairment on the SIB. Therefore, the sample size was determined according to an observational design of a
naturalistic condition, prospecting 20 patients in each group.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS
Inc., Cary, NC) and all statistical tests were two-sided. All subjects who received at least one dose of M were included in the
data analysis (intention-to-treat population). Descriptive statistics
for demographic and other baseline characteristics, efficacy, and
safety variables was expressed as mean ± SD for continuous
variables and as frequency and percentage for categorical variables. The paired t test was used to assess the changes from
baseline to 12 and 24 weeks. An ANCOVA model including
the baseline values as covariate was used in the comparisons
between groups. Unpaired t test was also used in the comparisons
between groups of subscales scores. A χ[2] test compared between
groups the rates of patients with worsening in NPI total score
from baseline to week 24.

## Results

### Patient’s disposition and baseline characteristics

Forty-five patients (31 females; mean age 73.2) were randomly
assigned to the M-AMT (n = 23) or M group (n = 22). One patient in each group did not perform the post-baseline visits and
was not evaluable for assessment of treatment effects. Table 1
shows the demographic and other characteristics of patients at the
baseline and week 12 and week 24 visits. The comparisons between groups did not show statistically significant differences for
all examined parameters, except in mean NPI total score
(p < 0.001), which was significantly higher in the M group than
in the M-AMT group.

### Effects of the treatments

Table 2 shows the results of SIB total score and subscales in the
two groups at baseline and 12- and 24-week follow-ups. The
mean SIB-l score significantly decreased from baseline to week
24 in the M-AMT group (adjusted mean change − 4.70; 95% CI
− 8.16 to − 1.23), compared to a small decrease in the M group


(adjusted mean change − 2.46; 95% CI − 6.01 to 1.09), with no
between-group differences. Both groups showed no relevant decreases from baseline to week 12.
In the M-AMT group, the SIB total (adjusted mean change −
10.65; 95% CI − 17.50 to − 3.80) and memory scores (adjusted
mean change − 2.40; 95% CI − 3.88 to − 0.93) decreased significantly from baseline to week 24. In the M group, the SIB social
interactions score decreased significantly from baseline to week
24 (adjusted mean change − 0.46; 95% CI − 1.09 to 0.17), compared to a small decrease in the M-AMT group (adjusted mean
change − 0.15; 95% CI − 0.76 to 0.46).
ANCOVA showed no significant between-group differences
and the baseline value was a significant predictor of results at
24 weeks for the SIB total [F(1) = 10.61, p = 0.002] and SIB-l
scores [F(1) = 8.28, p = 0.006].
Table 3 shows the ADL, IADL, and LSNS scores. The ADL
score significantly decreased from baseline to week 24 in the MAMT group (p = 0.039). The IADL score significantly decreased
from baseline to week 24 in the M-AMT (p = 0.005) and M
group (p = 0.001). At week 24, the adjusted mean changes from
baseline of the ADL score were − 0.61 (95% CI − 1.07 to 0.15)
in the M-AMT group and − 0.27 (95% CI − 0.74 to 0.20) in the
M group, while the corresponding values for IADL in the two
groups were − 1.05 (95% CI − 1.75 to − 0.34) and − 1.48 (95%
CI − 2.20 to − 0.75), respectively. No significant between-group
differences were found for ADL and IADL in the ANCOVA
model. The baseline value of ADL resulted in a significant predictor of values at week 24 [F(1) = 9.11, p = 0.004]. The baseline
IADL value also predicted the IADL score at week 24 [F(1) =
81.25, p < 0.001].
In the M-AMT group, the LSNS total score decreased from
baseline to weeks 12 and 24, while the Relatives and Neighbors
scores, but not the Friends score, decreased at week 24. In the M
group, all scores decreased except for an increase of the Relatives
score. However, no significant changes within-group or
between-group differences were observed. ANCOVA showed
that the baseline LSNS total score was a significant predictor of
results at 24 weeks [F(1) = 6.21, p = 0.017].
The NPI total, Depression (mean change ± SD − 1.77 ± 3.78;
p = 0.039), and Appetite disorders scores (mean change ± SD −
1.68 ± 2.82; p = 0.011) decreased significantly in the M-AMT
group at week 12. The mean change in NPI total score from
baseline to week 24 was advantageous for the M-AMT group
(− 0.55 ± 20.64) but not for the M group (6.29 ± 17.78). The
between-group difference in mean changes from baseline of the
NPI total score was not significant (p = 0.253). However, the
rates of worsened/no worsened patients at week 24 differed significantly (p = 0.048) due to a lower rate of worsened patients in
the M-AMT group (7 patients, 31.8%) than in the M group (13
patients, 61.9%). Between-group comparisons showed a significant difference for depression at week 24 due to a decrease from
baseline in the M-AMT group and an increase in the M group
(mean ± SD difference between groups, − 2.87 ± 1.25; 95% CI −

moderate probable AD on stable therapy with AchEI, combined treatment with AMT and M was associated with improvement in depressive symptoms and stabilized psychiatric
health status compared to M monotherapy.


Eight adverse events (AEs) were reported in 5 patients
(21.8%) in the M-AMT group and 17 AEs were reported in
11 patients (50.0%) in the M group. The most common AEs
were somnolence (six patients in the M group), insomnia (two
patients in the M-AMT group, one in the M group), and

## Discussion

We investigated the effects of M plus AMTon verbal communication and, secondarily, on daily living, psycho-behavioral
aspects, social relations, and global cognitive functioning in
patients with moderate AD on stable treatment with AchEI.
The baseline SIB-l mean score of the two groups of intervention indicated a mild to moderate language impairment
and hence a small probability of detecting differences between
baseline and follow-up. Indeed, the probability of achieving a
clinically relevant language improvement related to the SIB-l
baseline score, with lower scores corresponding to greater
improvements [12]. As further confirmation of the importance
of the extent of baseline impairment, ANCOVA showed that
the baseline SIB total and language scores predicted the results
at 24 weeks. Significant effects of the baseline values were
also observed for ADL, LSNS, and NPI.
The primary variable (SIB-l) and other SIB scores showed
an overall stabilization over time of the baseline condition up
to the end of the 12-week treatment phase.
The NPI total and subscale scores revealed significant benefits in the M-AMT group for Depression and Appetite disorders after 12 weeks of treatment, and a significant betweengroup difference for Depression at week 24, due to an improvement from baseline in the M-AMT group and a worsening in the M group. The rates of worsened/no worsened patients at week 24 also showed a significant difference in favor
of the M-AMT group. In both groups, the other secondary
variables (ADL, IADL, LSNS, MMSE) showed no substantial
deterioration from baseline to week 24.
Worth noting, M-AMT was associated with improved psychiatric symptoms compared to drug therapy alone. Moreover,
there was an advantage on the social interactions SIB subscale
in the M-AMT group compared to the M group. This extends
previous findings concerning a positive influence for AMTon
mood and behavior [19, 32–34]. The activations of the emotions and memory circuits may explain the psycho-behavioral
effects of AMT in dementia [35].
According to the cognitive reserve model, the variability in
the clinical manifestation of a neuropathology reflects individuals’ ability to use cognitive strategies [36]. Cognitive reserve
can be continuously modified by experience even when the
brain is already affected by pathology [36]. Education and
personal experience can enhance cognitive reserve, contrasting the clinical AD manifestations [37, 38]. The capacity of
the baseline SIB total, SIB-l, ADL, LSNS, and NPI scores to
predict the results at week 24 suggests that cognitive reserve
may enhance the effects of the treatment [39]. This extends the
spectrum of non-pharmacological treatment, which may be


comprehended in a wider range of palliative care for chronic
neurological disorders [40].
The small sample size, mild language impairment, and high
variance of baseline data may have compromised the possibility of observing between-group differences in the outcome
variables.
To conclude, in patients with moderate AD, an association
of AMT added to pharmacotherapy has no further benefits for
language and verbal communication in comparison with pharmacotherapy alone. However, this integrated approach can
improve the psycho-behavioral profile.
