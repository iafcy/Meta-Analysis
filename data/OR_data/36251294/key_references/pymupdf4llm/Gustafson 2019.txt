**Abstract.**
**Background: Family members absorb much of the care of dementia patients. The burden of care substantially impacts**
caregivers’ health, further straining our healthcare system. By 2050, the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease will more than
double, increasing the numbers of family caregivers proportionally. Interventions that reduce their burden are needed to
preserve their health as well as the viability of the healthcare system.
**Objective: This paper reports on the development and feasibility testing of a computer-based system intended to improve**
the lives of caregivers. D-CHESS (Dementia–Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System) allows users to obtain
information, communicate with other caregivers, get help with care decisions, and share information with experts.
**Method: Thirty-one caregivers were randomly assigned to an intervention group receiving D-CHESS for 6 months or to**
a control group receiving a caregiving book. Surveys at 0, 2, 4, and 6 months evaluated caregiver burden, family conflict,
satisfaction with decisions, social support, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and coping competence.
**Results: Survey findings suggest D-CHESS participants may perform better on measures of social support, anxiety, loneliness,**
and coping competence; the groups were equivalent on caregiver burden, decision satisfaction, and depression, and the control
group reported less family conflict than the intervention. D-CHESS use data suggested enhancements to system design and
content to increase awareness and use of various features.
**Conclusion: This study suggests that D-CHESS has potential to positively impact family caregivers and that the system**
merits further development and investigation with a full-scale clinical trial.

an aging Baby Boomer population, and the increasing
incidence of the disease as people age [1]. The implications for the U.S. healthcare system are sobering,
not only because of the rise in incidence but also the
rising cost of care for each patient. Annual healthcare
and long-term care payments for a person age 65+
with dementia ($48,977) total more than three times
the payments for a person age 65 + without dementia
($13,976) [1]. By 2050, the national cost of care for
those with dementia, if left unchecked, will increase
from the current $290 billion to an untenable $1.1
trillion [1].
A large portion of individual care is absorbed by
unpaid family caregivers. In 2018, 16.2 million family members provided 18.5 billion hours of care, or
an average of 22 hours per week [1]. In addition, they
paid an average of $11,233 from their own resources
for out-of-pocket expenses [1]. The cost savings to
the healthcare system in terms of labor and expenses
is significant, amounting to $234 billion in 2018

[1], but the cost to caregivers themselves is a crisis in its own right. In addition to strains on time
and financial resources, caregivers are often coping
with serious threats to their quality of life, including loneliness, isolation, depression, and problems
with employment, sleep, other family relationships,
and susceptibility to disease [1–4]. The practical,
emotional, and physical burdens of caring for loved
ones with dementia far exceed the burden of care for
non-dementia patients on every measure [1]. These
burdens translate to greater healthcare needs on the
part of caregivers themselves, costing an estimated
$11.8 billion in 2018 and further straining the system
for all [1–3, 5, 6].
A number of recent studies have examined caregiver burden and how it may be reduced. Wawrziczny
et al. suggest support programs with “preparedness,
dyadic, and family modules” [7]. Schreve et al. recommendinformationtechnology-basedinterventions
aimed at “alleviating the psychological burden and
social isolation” of caregivers and “providing access
to information and resources” [8]. In a review of
existing interventions, Gitlin and Hodgson identify
three elements common to those that are most effective: 1) the caregiver is actively involved with the
intervention; 2) the intervention adapts to the needs
of the family as the illness progresses; and 3) the
intervention helps both caregiver and patient [9].
Overall, extensive research indicates that caregiver
outcomes improve when caregivers have programs
and tools that incorporate long duration [10, 11],
assertive outreach [12], monitoring [13–15], prompts



[16–18], action planning [19–21], case management

[22–24], and peer [25–27] and family [28, 29] support. In this article, we report on a pilot test that
studied the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention employing these elements in addressing the
psychological, social, and practical needs of family
caregivers of patients with dementia.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

_The intervention: D-CHESS_

A family of eHealth systems known as CHESS
(Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System) has been developed over the last three
decades by researchers in the Center for Health
Enhancement Systems Studies at the University of
Wisconsin–Madison. These systems employ webbased or mobile technologies to improve health and
well-being, and several have been proven effective
in randomized trials supporting patients with various
conditions and diseases. Specifically, improvements
have been shown in: 1) quality of life and costs of care
for people with HIV [30], 2) quality of life and selfefficacy for women with breast cancer versus control
and internet groups [31–33], 3) asthma control for
young children [34], and 4) risky drinking among
alcoholics [35].
Other versions of CHESS have aimed to support
the caregiver rather than the patient. CHESS Lung
Cancer (CHESS-LC) supported family caregivers
of lung cancer patients by providing: 1) information, motivation, and skills training to support the
caregiver from diagnosis through the first year of
bereavement; 2) collection of health status data on the
patient and caregiver; 3) alerts for the clinical team
if a patient’s symptom exceeded preset thresholds;
4) access to new information; and 5) mechanisms
for engaging family and friends. Results showed not
only reduced caregiver emotional burden but also
improved response to treatment, quality of dying, and
length of patient survival [36].
Another earlier CHESS system was developed
to support caregivers of dementia patients. Funded
through grants from the Alzheimer’s Association
and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, that system offered detailed information about dementia,
personal accounts of how other caregivers coped,
descriptions and locations of services that caregivers
may need, and links to vetted online resources. Users
could anonymously pose questions to experts, receive
suggestions of resources for help, communicate


-----

_D.H. Gustafson et al. / Computer-Based System for Family Caregivers_ 3


with other caregivers through facilitated discussion
groups, and use decision aids to work through key
issues. Caregivers (n = 18, all age 65+) who tested
that early system indicated it provided needed information, peer support, and relief from isolation [37].
D-CHESS (Dementia–CHESS) is a website for use
on computers or tablets that evolved from these earlier CHESS systems for caregivers. D-CHESS was
designed to help with motivation, decision making,
stress reduction, and access to services by allowing
caregivers to obtain information and support without
concern for location, distance, time, confidentiality,
or education. Its development was informed by feedback from multiple focus groups held with caregivers
of Alzheimer’s disease patients and one-on-one needs
assessments with individual caregivers. Among the
many insights provided by this information was how
new tracking and motion-sensing technologies might
assist in reducing caregiver burden.
Table 1 describes the services provided by
D-CHESS as well as external sensors offered to this
study’s participants. D-CHESS may be used as the
disease progresses, for as long as needed, an element
of successful tools for caregivers [10, 11]. In addition, D-CHESS services offer other elements proven
effective in caregiver programs, such as assertive outreach, action planning, and peer and family support,
as well as quality informational resources such as
expert advice and vetted articles and websites.

_Participants_

Participants were unpaid family caregivers of
patients with Alzheimer’s disease. To be eligible, a
caregiver needed to be: 1) an unpaid family member
who was 2) the primary caregiver for a patient with
dementia, 3) providing care in the patient’s home,
and 4) able to read English. We aimed to recruit
30 participants, following recommendations by Hertzog [38], and achieved a total of 31. All reported
being white/Caucasian; their other characteristics are
reported in Table 2.
As a measure of severity of dementia, Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR) scale scores were obtained
at baseline from the subject database of the NIHfunded Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center (WADRC) Clinical Core at the University of
Wisconsin–Madison. CDR scores can range from 0
to 3 (0 = normal, 0.5 = very mild dementia, 1 = mild
dementia, 2 = moderate dementia, 3 = severe dementia) and are based on semi-structured interviews with
the patient and caregiver or other reliable source [40].


CDR data were missing from the WADRC database
for one person in the D-CHESS group.

_Procedures_

An initial invitation letter was sent to caregiver
partners of subjects with dementia in the Wisconsin
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center Clinical Core
study. The caregivers also received in-person invitations during their annual visit for the WADRC study.
Interested caregivers could fill out and return a form
or call CHESS research staff directly.
Eligible caregivers were sent the consent form and
baseline survey with instructions to call CHESS staff
once they received the documents. During that call,
staff went through the consent form and answered
any questions. If caregivers agreed to take part, they
signed the consent, completed the baseline survey,
and mailed both back to CHESS. When the consent and baseline surveys were received, participants
were randomized to either the D-CHESS intervention(n = 16)orthecontrol(n = 15) group.Participants
were mailed subsequent surveys at 2, 4, and 6 months,
for a total of four surveys.
From the original group of 31 participants, three
did not complete the study because one patient was
placed in memory care and two other patients died.
In addition, two participants completed only two of
the four surveys. Thus, 26 (83.9%) of the original
31 completed all surveys. Subsequently, one participant in the control group was a significant outlier on
five of the eight outcome variables; this participant
was removed from all analyses [39]. Therefore, final
group sizes for analyses were 14 D-CHESS and 11
control participants.
The intervention group received access to the
D-CHESS website for 6 months. These participants
were also offered the use of three commercially available sensors: a Bluetooth tracker, a GPS location
tracker, and a motion sensor. The Bluetooth tracker
would help locate lost items such as keys; the GPS
location tracker could be carried by a patient, allowing the caregiver to monitor the patient’s location; and
the motion sensor could be used to alert a caregiver
if the patient entered specific areas of the home that
could be hazardous. Four of the 15 caregivers chose
to use one or more sensors.
These three sensors were included in the study as a
result of feedback from focus groups with caregivers,
who described situations for which they wanted
help. We chose these particular devices because they
address the largest number of scenarios mentioned

CHESS staff.
If caregivers scored above 10 on a depression
assessment [41] in the paper survey (range = 0–27;
higher scores signal greater depression), or if through
D-CHESS they requested contact with a Wisconsin
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center information
specialist, a specialist would give them a call.
The control group received a limited intervention
consisting of a book for family caregivers of dementia patients, The 36-Hour Day [42]. The book was
mailed to the control group, and no other training
was provided.

_Ethics_

Compliance with guidelines on human experimentation as well as study protocols were approved by
the Institutional Review Board at the University of
Wisconsin–Madison (submission ID 2016-0366). To
protect confidentiality, only the project director had
access to participants’ names and addresses.

_D-CHESS use_

D-CHESS automatically collected use data,
including: number of participants logging on, number of page views, specific services used, discussion
group posts, data input to decision aids, and private


messages sent to the Alzheimer’s disease information specialist at the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center.

_Outcome measures_

To test the impact of D-CHESS, we measured
caregiver burden, family conflict, satisfaction with
care decisions, social support, anxiety, depression,
loneliness, and coping competence. Table 3 presents
baseline outcome scores on the following measures
for participants in both groups who completed all
surveys.

_Caregiver burden_
A caregiver load scale [3] assessed objective caregiver burden with six items on a 4-point Likert scale
(0 = don’t have to do it, 3 = difficult, I need more help
from others). The items incorporated both challenging behaviors and help needed with activities of daily
living, including instrumental activities. A subjective
burden question from the Caregiving Appraisal Scale

[43] was added (“I can fit in most of the things I
need to do in spite of the time taken by caring for
this person”), measured on a 5-point Likert scale
(0 = disagree a lot, 4 = agree a lot). All scores were
recoded to a 10-point scale to equalize weight across
scales, and an average was then calculated, reversing
the subjective burden item. Higher values indicate
more burden.

participants who completed surveys at 0, 2, 4, and 6 months

Outcome D-CHESS Control
(n = 14) (n = 11)
M (SD) M (SD)

Caregiver burden[a] 3.36 (1.53) 3.36 (1.17)

Depression 0.52 (0.44) 0.54 (0.54)
Coping competence 1.82 (0.44) 1.66 (0.42)

Higher scores indicate higher levels of the named outcome,
whether positive or negative (e.g., more burden, more social support). [a]Scores have been converted to 0–10 for analysis.

_Family conflict_
Twelve questions adapted from Aneshensel et al.

[44] assessed family conflict on a 4-point Likert scale
(0 = no disagreement, 3 = quite a bit). The Aneshensel
et al. scales are based on surveys, observations, and
interviews tapping stress across multiple dimensions
of life, including family conflict, seeking help, and
emotional support. An average score was calculated;
higher scores indicate more conflict.

_Satisfaction with care decisions_
Satisfaction was assessed using the Satisfaction
with Decision Scale [45], containing six items on
a 5-point Likert scale (0 = strongly disagree,
4 = strongly agree). An average score was calculated.
Higher scores indicate more satisfaction.

_Social support_
Caregiver’s social support was assessed using the
MOS Social Support Survey [46], consisting of 14
items on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never, 4 = most of
the time), with higher scores indicating more social
support. In addition, seeking help was assessed using
an adapted version of Aneshensel et al.’s [44] survey
questions. This consisted of two items asking how
much help caregivers received and how satisfied they
were with the received help, both measured using 5point Likert scales (how much help: 0 = no help, 4 = a
lot of help; help satisfaction: 0 = not at all satisfied,
4 = very satisfied). The responses to all 16 questions
were averaged to yield a single social support score.
Higher scores indicate more social support.

_Loneliness_
Caregiver’s loneliness was assessed using the
UCLA Loneliness Scale [47], consisting of 20 items


on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = never, 3 = often). This
scale was chosen for its brevity, the non-pejorative
tone of the items, and its well-documented use with
a broad age range, including the elderly. An average score was calculated, with items 1, 5, 6, 10, 15,
16, 19, and 20 reverse-coded. Item 9 (“How often
do you feel outgoing and friendly?”) was removed
due to lack of variance in participants’ answers, with
over 54% of participants responding “often.” Higher
scores indicate more loneliness.

_Anxiety_
Caregivers’ anxiety was assessed using multiple
measures: 1) The Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale

[48], consisting of seven items on a 4-point Likert
Scale (0 = not at all, 3 = nearly every day); 2) two
questions from Lawton et al.’s [43] subjective burden
scale (“No matter how much I do, somehow I feel
guilty about not doing enough for this person” and
“Taking care of this person gives me a trapped feeling”), assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = disagree
a lot, 4 = agree a lot); and 3) a question assessing
difficulty functioning (“If you checked off any problems, how difficult have these made it for you to do
your work, take care of things at home, or get along
with other people?”), using a 4-point Likert Scale
(0 = extremely difficult, 3 = not difficult at all). All
scores were recoded to a 10-point scale to equalize
weight across scales, and an average was then calculated, reversing the difficulty item. Higher values
indicate greater anxiety.

_Depression_
Caregiver’s depression was assessed using the
eight-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire [41]. Responses were given on a 4-point Likert
scale (0 = not at all, 3 = nearly every day). An average
score was calculated for all items. Higher scores indicate more depression symptoms.

_Coping competence_
Ability to cope with the stress of caring for a family
memberwithdementiawasassessedwithnineactionoriented items (e.g., “Made a plan of action and
followed it”) from Lawton et al.’s caregiver appraisal
scale [43]. Responses were scored on a 5-point Likert
scale (0 = never, 4 = most of the time), and an average
score was calculated, with higher scores indicating
greater coping competence.

_Analysis plan_

A 2 (time: baseline, month 6) 2 (study group:
×
D-CHESS, control) repeated measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the
effect of study group across time on each outcome
separately. Therefore, eight 2 2 repeated measures
×
ANOVAs were run in total, one for each outcome.

**RESULTS**


_Outcome measures_

As expected due to the small sample size, all findings were nonsignificant (p > 0.12), but the effect
sizes hint at what might be revealed with a sufficient
sample size. Descriptive statistics and effects sizes for
each outcome are reported in Table 4. Specifically,
they suggest that the current version of D-CHESS,
relative to the control group, may be associated with
improvements in social support, anxiety, and coping competence and with preventing the worsening
of loneliness.
However, the other four outcomes were not associated with practical improvement for participants in
the D-CHESS group, relative to the control. Caregiver burden, depression, and satisfaction with care
decisions worsened for everyone over the 6 months,
regardless of study group. For family conflict, the
small effect size indicates that the control group is
associated with feeling less conflict after the 6-month


period while D-CHESS participants did not report
any change (see Table 4).

_D-CHESS use_

Overall, participants continued to access
D-CHESS throughout the study, with 100%,
50%, 71%, 71%, 57%, and 64% logging on during
months 1 through 6, respectively (see Table 5).
As shown in Table 6, Support was the most visited
area of the system, with 919 total pages viewed. This
area showed the greatest decline in visits over time
but still remained the most popular, logging the most
pages viewed in the final month. Support was followed by Tools and Thought of the Day for amount
of access. In terms of both number of visitors and
pages viewed, use of Tools and Thought of the Day
sustained or actually increased over the 6 months.
These results are noteworthy because drop-off is typically a significant problem with online health tools

[49–54].


**DISCUSSION**

This pilot study raises interesting hypotheses for
future research and suggests changes for improving D-CHESS in preparation for a larger, controlled
trial. For example, we expected a positive impact
on decision satisfaction as a result of D-CHESS’s
decision-making and planning services, but found
reduction in satisfaction over time in both groups.

Higher scores indicate higher levels of the named outcome, whether positive or negative (e.g., more burden, more social support). [a]Change (�) was calculated as 6-month scores minus baseline scores. [b]Change in
standard deviation was calculated using SDchange = sqrt(SD12 + SD22 – (2*corr*SD1*SD2)). [c]Eta squared was
converted to Cohen’s d using d = 2*(sqr (eta[2]/(1 - eta[2]))). [d]Scores have been converted to 0–10 for analysis.

System use data indicate that the Tools area, where
these services reside, was the second-most visited
area of the site and that use actually increased
over time, suggesting strong interest in or desire for
help with decision making. User studies could help
determine how D-CHESS’s decision-making content
could be more effective (e.g., more specialized, comprehensive, or in-depth).
With regard to family conflict, there are several
family relationship and communication services on
D-CHESS, but those services are located in the Reading Room and Finding Help areas, the two least
accessed areas of the site. It is possible that revisions
designed to enhance discoverability or encourage
interest in these services, such as navigation changes
and prompts, could increase visits to those services,
which in turn could lead to improvements in family
conflict outcomes.
That D-CHESS had no discernible effect on
depression is consistent with results of other CHESS
studies. The previous studies do show changes in
quality of life, social support, and other dimensions
that would lead us to expect depression to improve.
It may be the case, however, that relieving depression requires more (e.g., medication, role playing
and other components of one-on-one psychotherapy) than an online support system can provide

[55].
We found a small trend toward reduction in
caregiver burden over time for both groups, with
D-CHESS performing better, but the effect size difference is close to zero and probably due to chance.
Development aimed at this outcome might focus on
peer support, which is shown to relieve burden [56].


The Caregiver Tips and Personal Stories services,
where D-CHESS users could exchange practical
ideas and share experiences with one another, are
located in the Reading Room, one of the least visited
areas of the site. Moving these services to the Support
area may increase their visibility and use, potentially
helping to reduce burden. In addition, use of all peer
support resources might be increased with, for example, system prompts and other marketing and design
changes.
The Support area, with peer-led discussion groups
(typically the most frequently used service in CHESS
systems), logged the most use but declined over time.
Voice-controlled access via smart speakers and smart
displays, a focus of our current efforts with CHESS
systems,mayhelpsustainuse[57,58].Thatsaid,with
only 14 participants in the intervention, the sample
size was too small for the discussion group to reach
critical mass, the number of participants needed to
produce enough comments to keep a social network
active [59, 60]. Lack of use of Caregiver Tips and
Personal Stories may also be due, at least in part, to
insufficient sample size.
In a larger study, where critical mass will be reachable, we predict higher use rates. Nevertheless, with
somanyservicesonD-CHESS(15,notincludingsensors), marketing, tutorials, and prompts to less-used
but evidence-based services such as journaling (My
Journal) [61] and cognitive behavioral therapy (Easing Distress) [62] are needed. Future development,
incorporating artificial intelligence, will include features and functions that alert and remind users of
underused services and provide automated training.
D-CHESS has the potential to be smarter in other

ways, too. Other CHESS systems use data collected
on caregiver and patient status as well as natural
language processing of user-entered text, such as discussion group posts and journal entries. Using these
data appropriately, the system may be designed to
detect and address caregivers’ concerns before they
become crises.
The design of the study itself appears practical
and useful for a large-scale investigation. However,
future research might employ a full or partial factorial
design to further explain which D-CHESS services
have the most impact.

_Technology advancements_

Survey feedback from participants also suggests
valuable changes to the technology platforms. First,
the D-CHESSsystemwetestedwasoptimizedforuse
on desktop and laptop computers. In our next round
of development, we would adapt it as an app 1) for
smartphonesandtablets,forgreaterportability,and2)
for voice-activated smart speakers or smart displays,
technologies currently being adopted at unusually
high rates, including among the elderly and disabled

[57, 58].
Second, we would include sensor technology with
the D-CHESS system rather than offer sensors as separate products, so caregivers would not need to make
additional decisions for or against. Although every
caregiver in the D-CHESS group was offered the sensors, only four accepted them. Those who declined
did so because they did not want the added burden
of learning another technology, not because they did
not see potential benefit.
Of the four who used them, three reported positive
results. Caregivers who used the Bluetooth tracker
to find lost items reported a reduction in both their
own stress and patients’ agitation. One patient frequently misplaced the TV remote and insisted the
caregiver stop everything to find it. Another patient
often lost keys. By affixing the tracker to the items,
caregivers could instantly locate them by pushing a
button on their phones and activating a sound from
the tracker. The caregiver who used the GPS location tracker also reported reduction in stress. Her
husband, in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease,
took a bus to local events where he volunteered as
a security guard. This level of independence was
important to him. When he carried the GPS tracker in
a pocket, the caregiver could see where he was at any
moment, reducing her worry that he might get lost.
The caregiver who tried the motion sensor sought to


use it as an alert if her husband attempted to enter
the basement, where he had previously been injured.
The implementation was not successful, because the
family lived in a rural setting, where signal quality
was unreliable. However, she understood its potential and was disappointed not to be able to benefit
from it.

_Limitations_

Pilot studies, including this one, cannot test for statistical significance between groups in that they are
underpowered, but they can help determine in a costeffective way the feasibility of a larger study [63].
This pilot is valuable in that it explores the potential
of a theory-based support system for caregivers of
Alzheimer’s disease patients, highlighting technical
and practical issues for further development in preparation for more definitive study. We found moderate
effect sizes for several outcomes, but a large randomized trial is needed to test significance between
groups.
A further limitation concerns the demographics of
the participants, who represent a fairly narrow swath
of the population. In a full-scale study, we would aim
for much greater diversity with regard to race and
ethnicity, education, and gender.
Finally, in its current version, D-CHESS does not
incorporate several potentially beneficial technologies. First, the platform used (computer laptops) did
not take advantage of smartphones, smart speakers, or
smart displays, each of which offers capabilities that
could increase the effectiveness of D-CHESS. Second, only a small number of participants were willing
to try sensors; as a result, data were insufficient to
assess the practical utility of those devices.

_Conclusion_

Despite its limitations, this pilot test hints at the
potential value of D-CHESS to caregivers, which was
expected given the findings from other CHESS studies [29, 30, 32]. At the same time, the results point to
possible development with regard to site design, content enhancements, and technological advances that
could strengthen the system.
Perhaps most important is the potential for DCHESS to provide social support and ameliorate the
isolation and loneliness present in caregiving roles

[64]. Through discussion groups, caregiver tips, and
personal stories, D-CHESS currently offers ways to
emulate the support achieved in traditional support

group settings—settings that are often inaccessible to
caregivers because of their patients’ constant needs,
which make getting away for an hour or more difficult. Indeed, very few caregivers in this pilot attended
support groups regularly, while they often reported
anxiety and frustration as their loved ones’ disease
progressed. Having access to trusted peers and advisors through an online support group could increase
knowledge, reduce feelings of isolation, and reduce
stress, to the benefit of caregivers and patients alike

[4, 65]. Accordingly, we aim to boost D-CHESS’s
support services in the next phase of development
with enhancements such as prompts, online training,
and improvements to site organization.
Overall, this pilot test suggests that D-CHESS may
have the potential to help ease the stress of family
caregivers, with positive implications for their own
health. As our population ages and the incidence of
dementia increases, straining both the healthcare system and our national economy, the need for solutions
becomes increasingly urgent. Further development
and investigation of D-CHESS with a full-scale clinical trial is merited.
