#### Abstract
Title. Effects of psychosocial group rehabilitation on social functioning, loneliness
and well-being of lonely, older people: randomized controlled trial.
Aim. This paper is a report of a study to explore the effects of psychosocial group
nursing intervention on older people’s feelings of loneliness, social activity and
psychological well-being.
Background. Older people’s loneliness is associated with low quality of life, and
impaired health, increased use of health and social services and increased mortality.
Previous intervention studies have achieved quite modest results.
Method. A randomized controlled trial was conducted between 2003 and 2006
using a group intervention aimed at empowering older people, and promoting peer
support and social integration. A total of 235 people (>74 years) suffering from
loneliness met 12 times with professional leaders in groups. The UCLA Loneliness
Scale and Lubben’s Social Network Scale were used at entry, after 3 and 6 months.
Psychological well-being was charted using a six-dimensional questionnaire at
baseline and 12 months later.
Findings. A statistically significantly larger proportion of intervention group participants had found new friends during the follow-up year (45% vs. 32%, P = 0Æ048), and
40% of intervention group participants continued their group meetings for 1 year.
However,no differenceswerefound in lonelinessor social networks between the groups.
Psychological well-being score improved statistically significantly in the intervention
groups[+0Æ11,95%confidenceinterval(CI):+0Æ04to+0Æ13],comparedwiththecontrols
(+0Æ01,95% CI: �0Æ05to+0Æ07, P = 0Æ045).Feeling neededwas statisticallysignificantly
more common in the intervention groups (66%) than in controls (49%, P = 0Æ019).
Conclusion. New sensitive measurements of loneliness and social isolation are needed
to measure fluctuations in feelings of loneliness and in social isolation.

#### Introduction

Loneliness is common among older people (Routasalo &
Pitkala 2003). It is a distressing feeling leading to impaired
quality of life (Jakobsson & Hallberg 2005), cognitive decline
(Tilvis et al. 2000, Fratiglioni et al. 2004), poor subjective
health (Tijhuis et al. 1999), disability (Bisschop et al. 2003),
increased use of health and social services (Geller et al. 1999,
Tilvis et al. 2000) and increased mortality (Penninx et al.
1997, Herlitz et al. 1998, Tilvis et al. 2000).
Loneliness has been defined as a subjective experience of a
lack of satisfying human relationships (Andersson 1998). The
terms ‘loneliness’ and ‘social isolation’ are often used
interchangeably, although they are distinct but interrelated
concepts (Routasalo & Pitkala 2003, Routasalo et al. 2006).
Social isolation relates to the number of contacts and the
integration of an individual into the surrounding social
environment (Cattan et al. 2005). It has been suggested that
an older person’s feeling of loneliness is not associated with
the frequency of contacts but that expectations of and
satisfaction from these contacts predict loneliness (Routasalo
et al. 2006).

#### Background

Loneliness has received little attention in intervention
research but the results of earlier intervention studies have
been quite modest (Findley 2003). Some researchers have
performed randomized controlled intervention studies to
alleviate older people’s loneliness and/or social isolation
(Arnetz & Theorell 1983, Andersson 1984, 1985, Stevens &
van Tilburg 2000, Wikstro¨m 2002). In Sweden, Andersson
(1984, 1985) aimed to alleviate loneliness by using group
meetings and discussions about health themes for lonely older
people. An important problem was the large number of dropouts. In another Swedish study (Wikstro¨m 2002), art experiences and discussions were offered to lonely older people.
Social interaction and physical health improved among those
who took part in the groups. Results have also been
encouraging in studies in which participants are supported
to participate in various activities (Arnetz & Theorell 1983,
Stevens & van Tilburg 2000), and Cattan et al. (2005) found
that group-based, goal-oriented interventions in which the
participants are allowed to influence the content of the
intervention are the most effective in alleviating loneliness.
The theoretical framework of our intervention was based
on the Geriatric Rehabilitation Nursing Model (Routasalo
et al. 2004), in which the aged person and professional
actively work in a close, equal interaction. The results of the
interaction depend on the person’s commitment to the goals


and the professional’s commitment to support the person to
achieve the goals.

#### The study

Aim

The aim of the study was to explore the effects of psychosocial group nursing intervention on older people’s feelings of
loneliness, social activity and psychological well-being. We
hypothesized that, by including the effective elements from
prior intervention studies (group-based intervention, participants influencing the contents of the intervention, goaloriented work) psychosocial group rehabilitation could
alleviate loneliness and improve older people’s psychological
well-being.

Design

We performed a randomized controlled trial in 2003–2006
with 235 older people suffering from loneliness. The intervention group (n = 117) was offered a 3-month psychosocial
rehabilitation group intervention.

Participants

Sample size was based on the feasibility of the postal questionnaire in identifying volunteer participants with an interest in
the particular group content available in their community. The
participants were recruited using a postal questionnaire, which
was sent to randomly selected aged, home-dwelling people

[n = 5722, response rate 72% (n = 4113)] in six communities
in Finland. The questionnaire enquired about demographic
variables, suffering from loneliness, psychological well-being
and social interaction (Savikko et al. 2005, Routasalo et al.
2006). To those respondents who reported suffering from
loneliness at least sometimes (n = 1541, 39%), a second postal
questionnaire was sent to examine more accurately their
interests and activities (Savikko 2008).
The inclusion criteria for the group intervention were age
‡75 years, subjective feeling of loneliness and willingness to
participate in the intervention. The exclusion criteria were
moderate or severe dementia [Mini Mental State Examination
score <19 points (Folstein et al. 1975) or Clinical Dementia
Rating Scale score >1 (Hughes et al. 1982)], living permanently in institutional care, blindness, deafness or inability to
walk independently. For exercise and discussion groups (see
below), New York Heart Association Classification (Fisher
1972) classes three and four constituted additional exclusion
criteria. These exclusion criteria were set to ensure group

members’ equal participation and to support social activation
(Savikko 2008).
Respondents who expressed their willingness to participate
in the psychosocial group rehabilitation and who met the
inclusion criteria were contacted and invited to an interview
with a Registered Nurse. The randomization was performed
in blocks of 16 people using a computer-generated random
numbers centre. After interviewing and assessing the participants for one week, the study nurse ended up with a list of 16
eligible participants in the order they had been assessed. She
telephoned to the randomization centre and read the names
from a paper list in the order which they appeared in her list.
The person at a randomization centre did not know the
identities of potential participants. Participants were then
randomly assigned to intervention or control (continuing
with usual community care).

Intervention

The intervention was carried out in seven centres and six
communities. Each group consisted of 7–8 participants. The
groups met once a week for 3 months (12 times). The group
meetings were goal-oriented and closed, so that once the group
was formed no new member could join even if someone
dropped out. Each session included breakfast, lunch, coffee
and group activities, and all this was free of charge for the
participants. Transport to the group sessions and back was
organized using minibuses.
Each group had two professional group leaders (n = 14)
who had a long experience of working with older people.
One was a specialist Registered Nurse and the other was an
occupational therapist or physiotherapist. They were carefully educated about psychosocial group intervention of
lonely older people (Pitkala et al. 2004a) and were tutored
alongside the group meetings.
The principles of psychosocial group intervention were the
same in all groups, irrespective of the programme content.
This was ensured by the common training of the group
leaders, who promoted security and equal communication in
the groups. By taking advantage of group dynamics and the
normal maturation of group life, they aimed to empower
participants and promote friendships, working more as
facilitators than as active leaders. The idea of the intervention
was that group participants would share their feelings of
loneliness with people of their own age who were having
similar experiences, receive peer support, and develop feelings of solidarity. This would in turn lead to empowerment,
better mastery over their own lives, and support for their selfrespect. The details of intervention are described elsewhere
(Savikko 2008).


The psychosocial groups consisted of three types of
activities, depending on the interests of the participants: art
and inspiring activities (AIA), group exercise and discussions
(GED), and therapeutic writing and group therapy (TWGT)
(Savikko 2008). In the AIA groups, various artists visited the
meetings, the participants visited cultural events and also
actively produced their own art. In the GED groups,
participants performed various exercises (senior dancing,
swimming and walking in the countryside), and discussed the
health themes that interested them. In the TWGT groups,
participants wrote about their own past lives, experiences
and loneliness at home and then discussed their writing in the
groups. Participants could influence and modify the group
programmes according to their interests, which in turn
supported their empowerment.

Instruments

The first postal questionnaire consisted of background
information, such as age, gender, marital status, education
and living conditions. Loneliness was assessed with the
question, ‘Do you suffer from loneliness?’ (1 = seldom or
never, 2 = sometimes, and 3 = often or always). The second
structured questionnaire was aimed at finding people who
would voluntarily participate in the psychological group
intervention and inquiring about their interests, with the
purpose of placing them in a group with matching content.
The survey and recruitment process have been described in
other papers (Savikko et al. 2005, Savikko 2008).
At baseline assessment, participant demographics were
confirmed and health status was assessed. Cognition was
assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
(Folstein et al. 1975) and depression was evaluated by
Montgomery–A[˚ ]sberg Depression Scale (Montgomery &
A[˚ ]sberg 1979).
The study nurse interviewed and assessed participants three
times, at baseline, 3 and 6 months, using the UCLA Loneliness
Scale (Russel 1996), and social network with Lubben’s Social
Network Scale (LSNS) (Lubben 1988). In addition, participants were assessed using a postal questionnaire at baseline
and 12 months. This questionnaire charted psychological
well-being using six questions used in our previous studies
since 1989 (Tilvis et al. 2000). These six questions show good
test-retest reliability (Savikko et al. 2006) and statistically
significant prognostic validity (Pitkala et al. 2004a), and
inquire about (1) life satisfaction (yes/no), (2) feeling needed
(yes/no), (3) having plans for the future (yes/no), (4) having zest
for life (yes/no), (5) feeling depressed (seldom or never/
sometimes/often or always) and (6) suffering from loneliness
(seldom or never/sometimes/often or always). Their content

validity is good because these questions represent areas
considered important in psychological well-being (WHO
2003). We created a well-being score from these questions,
where each question represented 0 (‘no’ in questions 1–4,
‘often or always’ in questions 5 or 6), 0Æ5 (‘sometimes’ in
questions 5 or 6) or 1 (‘yes’ in questions 1–4, ‘seldom or never’
in questions 5 or 6) point. The score has shown good
concurrent validity with the RAND-36 instrument (Huusko
et al. 2006) and was created by dividing the total score by the
number of questions the participant had answered. Thus, a
score of 1 represented the best well-being and 0 the poorest.
At 1 year, participants received a postal questionnaire, and
their social activity and psychological well-being were measured. Whether they had made new friends during the past
year, if they had met their group members after the official
group meetings had ceased, and whether their group had
continued meetings on their own as a group after the official
part was over were also assessed by the questionnaire.

Ethical considerations

Approval to conduct the study was obtained from the
appropriate ethics committee. Informed consent was
obtained from all participants.

Data analysis

For continuous variables, descriptive values were described by
mean with standard deviations, interquartile range (IQR) and/
or range. For variables with a normal (Gaussian) distribution,
statistical comparison between groups was made using the
t-test or analysis of covariance with baseline scores used as
covariates. If the variables had a non-normal distribution or
were at ordinal level, statistical comparison between groups
was made using the Mann–Whitney test, permutation test with
Monte-Carlo P-value and Hodges-Lehmann estimate of
median difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) to show
changes in the outcome variables. Measures with a discrete
distribution were expressed as percentages (%) and analysed
by chi-square or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate. The most
important descriptive values were described by 95% CI).

#### Results

Baseline data

The intervention and control groups were comparable at
baseline (Table 1). The participants were old (mean age
80 years), female, widowed, and lived alone, and their
physical functioning was fairly good. The proportion with

impaired cognition (MMSE-score <24) was 11% in both
groups. LSNS scores were fairly low (25–26), and 67%
scored <30. On the Loneliness scale all participants scored
more than 34, indicating at least a moderate degree of
loneliness, and 49% scored 50 or over, indicating a moderately high or high degree of loneliness. The median baseline
psychological well-being score (PWS) was 0Æ56 (IQR: 0Æ29,
0Æ67) in the intervention group and 0Æ56 (IQR: 0Æ33, 0Æ67) in
the control group.

Effects of intervention

Participants in the intervention group had found new friends
statistically significantly more often than the controls (45%
vs. 32%, chi-square test, P = 0Æ048). Furthermore, 40% of
the intervention group members continued their group
meetings at 1 year, and 72% had met the members of their
own group after the intervention. However, there were no
differences in the changes in the UCLA-scale between the
groups at 3 or 6 months (Figure 1). Also no differences were

found in the changes of LSNS between intervention group

[�0Æ3 (95% CI: �1Æ7 to 1Æ1)] and control group [�0Æ3 (95%
CI: �1Æ6 to 0Æ9), ANCOVAANCOVA, P = 0Æ50]. PWS improved in the
intervention group (+0Æ11, 95% CI: +0Æ04 to +0Æ13) but
remained virtually unchanged in controls (+0Æ01, 95% CI:
�0Æ05 to +0Æ07, permutation test, P = 0Æ045). Of the six
dimensions of psychological well-being, feeling needed was
more common in intervention participants (66%) than in
controls (49%, chi-square test, P = 0Æ019).

#### Discussion

The psychosocial group intervention affected participants’
lives in many ways. Several measurements showed that they
had become more socially active: 40% continued their
meetings throughout the year, 45% had found new friends,
and experiences of feeling needed had increased. However,
the formal scales indicating loneliness or social isolation did
not show any changes. Intervention participants’ psychological well-being scale showed improvement at 1 year compared with the controls.
The intervention improved participants’ social functioning
by increasing their initiative to make new friends and


encouraging them to continue their group meetings. In
addition, in the previous paper reporting participant feedback
(Savikko 2008), it is showed that almost all those in the
intervention group said that their loneliness had been
alleviated during the intervention. Active social participation
and collaboration with people of one’s own age group
prevent loneliness (Jylha¨ & Aro 1989, Dugan & Kivett
1994), and peers of the same age group are very important in
relieving loneliness (Bondevik & Skogstad 1996). Intervention participants were encouraged to start new friendships
with their group members and continue their group meetings
on their own.
However, the UCLA Loneliness Scale did not show any
effects. This scale has been shown to be a valid measurement
tool (Russell 1996) and has been used in several earlier
intervention studies (Evans & Jaureguy 1982, Arnetz &
Theorell 1983, Andersson 1985, Tesch-Ro¨mer 1997,
McAuley et al. 2000, White et al. 2002). However, in none
of these studies was it possible to show statistically significant
differences in changes in scores between intervention and
control groups. The scale may be a good screening measure
but is probably insensitive to change.
There may be also other reasons for difficulties in showing
the alleviation of loneliness. First, loneliness is a somewhat
unstable concept (Jylha¨ 2004). Second, the response to the
question ‘Do you suffer from loneliness?’ depends on the
context in which it is asked, who is asking and how
(face-to-face or questionnaire) (Andersson 1998). Third,
loneliness is often a shameful thing to expose (Rokach &
Brock 1997). It may be that after 3 months of discussing
issues related to loneliness, our participants became familiar
with it and more willing to acknowledge that they did feel
lonely. Control group participants did not have this group
experience, and it is possible that they were more reluctant to
admit their loneliness.
Neither was a difference found in median changes on the
LSNS between the intervention and control groups after the
intervention. It seems that this scale is also not very sensitive
to change. Half (five) of the items in the LSNS inquire about
aspects that were not expected to change in our intervention,
such as living alone, relationships with relatives or receiving
help with activities of daily living. Only the other five items
were potentially sensitive to changes as a result of the
intervention.
A statistically significantly larger proportion of the intervention than the control group reported feeling needed after
the intervention. In an earlier study, feelings of being needed
proved to be a statistically significant prognostic factor for
survival in an aged population during 10-year follow-up
(Pitkala et al. 2004a). Being needed by someone is closely

connected with intimate relationships and gives meaning to
life. It may also mean having a meaningful role in life. Our
intervention supported participants’ mutual relationships and
thus feeling needed by each other. It also supported meaningful roles and active agency by giving participants power in
decision-making and by listening to their wishes. During the
intervention, participants changed from bystanders to active
agents in their lives (Savikko 2008).
Social isolation and feelings of loneliness reduce psychological well-being, quality of life and cognition and may lead
to deteriorating health, increased use of healthcare services
and mortality (Prince et al. 1997, Ellaway et al. 1999, Tijhuis
et al. 1999, Savikko et al. 2005). It is difficult to show exactly
how the intervention affected participants’ loneliness or
social isolation. It is possible that it actually had an impact
on aspects which work as transmitter mechanisms between
loneliness and well-being. In other words, empowering older
people may not be enough to alleviate deep, existential
loneliness but may be enough to improve mastery over their
own lives and initiative to break social isolation and improve
psychological well-being (Figure 2).
Our results are in line with those of previous intervention
studies showing the favorable effects of group intervention on
psychological well-being (Toseland et al. 1989, White et al.
2002). Other researchers have noted that the key point in
successful intervention is less its content than the effects of
group cohesion and peer support (Toseland 1990), of
participants having control over the implementation of the
group programme (Cattan et al. 2005), and of empowerment
and enhanced feelings of mastery (Stevens & van Tilburg
2000). Our intervention principles were in line with these
earlier findings. Randomized controlled studies have also
shown that interventions based on one-to-one contacts or


visits by professionals have been ineffective (Clarke et al.
1992, Van Rossum et al. 1993, Cattan et al. 2005).
The Geriatric Rehabilitation Nursing Model (Routasalo
et al. 2004) worked well as the theoretical framework.
According to this, commitment to action and equal interaction are necessary elements to achieve results. In our study,
both the older participants and leaders were very committed
to the intervention and its goals, contrary to earlier studies
(Andersson 1985, White et al. 2002). The leaders’ commitment was supported by tutoring them during the whole
process, and they supported participants’ commitment by
giving them opportunities to influence the content and
progress of group meetings. Both the leaders and participants
knew the aims of the meetings: to empower participants and
promote friendships.
The strength of the study lies in the careful selection of the
lonely participants, their randomization, and a very carefully
planned and implemented intervention. The randomization
succeeded, in that the intervention and control groups were
very similar at the baseline. The experienced, well-trained
professionals (Pitkala et al. 2004b) planned and carried out
the interventions in cooperation with participants. Their
success in this was seen in the commitment of participants.
Only 2Æ5% of intervention participants did not complete the
intervention. Several studies with lonely older people have
encountered problems with high numbers of drop-outs
(Andersson 1985, White et al. 2002).

Study limitations

The limitation of this study is the problematic concept of
loneliness and its measurements, which did not seem to be
sensitive enough to show changes. The participants were

self-awareness, mastery, increasing feelings of being a passive outsider and not having meaningful roles. Psychosocial group rehabilitation may have
more effect on these transmitting mechanisms and social isolation and via them on psychological well-being and less on loneliness.

#### What is already known about this topic

 - Loneliness and social isolation are common among
older people and reduce their well-being.

 - Loneliness has been defined as a subjective experience
of a lack of satisfying human relationships.

 - Loneliness has received little attention in intervention
research, and the results of earlier intervention studies
have been quite modest.

#### What this paper adds

 - Well-planned and professionally led psychosocial
group rehabilitation intervention activates lonely,
older people socially.

 - The psychological well-being of older people suffering
from loneliness can be improved by client-centred
psychosocial group interventions.

 - New sensitive measurements of loneliness and social
isolation are needed to measure fluctuations in feelings
of loneliness and in social isolation.

#### Implications for practice and/or policy

 - The experience of loneliness among older people is
common leading to impaired quality of life and
weakening their living at home.

 - With a well-planned client-centered psychosocial
group intervention it is possible to alleviate loneliness
and so to improve quality of life of older, homedwelling people.

 - Clinet-centered psychosocial group intervention for
lonely older people demands well-educated nurses,
who appreciate older people.

selected through a process involving many steps, and such a
long procedure cannot take place in real life. The intervention
was conducted in ideal circumstances: participants suffered
from loneliness, they were willing to participate, and the
group leaders were experienced professionals who were
trained especially for this intervention.

#### Conclusion

With a well-planned and professionally led psychosocial
group intervention, it is possible to empower and to socially
activate lonely, older people and to strengthen their wellbeing. By using the key elements (taking advantage of group
dynamics, goal-oriented working, giving the participants


power in decision-making and supporting their commitment),
this intervention could be successfully implemented in various settings.
