Abstract

Background: Clinical care alone at the end of life is unlikely to meet all needs. Volunteers are a key resource,
acceptable to patients, but there is no evidence on care outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether
support from a social action volunteer service is better than usual care at improving quality of life for adults in
the last year of life.
Methods: A pragmatic, multi-centre wait-list controlled trial, with participants randomly allocated to receive the
volunteer support intervention either immediately or after a 4 week wait. Trained volunteers provided tailored
face-to-face support including befriending, practical support and signposting to services, primarily provided
within the home, typically for 2–3 hours per week. The primary outcome was rate of change of quality of life at
4 weeks (WHO QOL BREF, a general, culturally sensitive measure). Secondary outcomes included rate of change
of quality of life at 8 weeks and Loneliness (De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale), social support (mMOS-SS), and
reported use of health and social care services at 4 and 8 weeks.

Results: In total, 196 adults (61% (n = 109) female; mean age 72 years) were included in the study. No significant
difference was found in main or secondary outcomes at 4 weeks. Rate of change of quality of life showed trends
in favour of the intervention (physical quality of life domain: b = 3.98, CI, –0.38 to 8.34; psychological domain: b
2.59, CI, –2.24 to 7.43; environmental domain: b = 3, CI, –4.13 to 4.91). Adjusted analyses to control for hours of
volunteer input found significantly less decrease in physical quality of life in the intervention group (slope (b) 4.
43, CI, 0.10 to 8.76). While the intervention also favoured the rate of change of emotional (b = –0.08; CI, –0.52 to 0.
35) and social loneliness (b = –0.20; CI, –0.58 to 0.18), social support (b = 0.13; CI, –0.13 to 0.39), and reported use
of health and social care professionals (b = 0.16; CI, –0.22 to 0.55), these were not statistically significant. No
adverse events were reported.

Conclusions: Clinicians can confidently refer to volunteer services at the end of life. Future research should focus
on ‘dose’ to maximise likely impact.

Background
In 2013, over half a million people died in England and
Wales, mostly from long-term conditions such as cancer
(29%) and circulatory (28%) and respiratory (15%) diseases that are known to be life limiting [1]. For deaths
that can be anticipated, providing excellent care at the
end-of-life that is responsive to need is critically important. Compassionate support in the last year of life cannot be the responsibility of health and social care
professionals alone and requires a public health response
involving the wider community [2, 3], recognising the
importance of social networks and social capital [4].
Proponents of these approaches argue that a primary
focus on biomedical and physical aspects of end-of-life
care ignores the social context within which dying takes
place. Social relationships and networks can buffer the
effects of crisis associated with dying, provide a framework that may prevent family carer burn out, and demonstrate the importance of supporting social contexts

[5–7]. Effective personal network support can substitute for formal care and reduce health service utilisation costs [8].
Individual and community networks and relations of
support can, however, be inadequate to meet care needs

[5]. Demographic changes such as increased female employment, delayed childbearing, geographical mobility,
divorce rates, and longer working lives all potentially impact on the availability of traditional family support. Social isolation on itself also has a major influence on
health, comparable with well-established risk factors for
mortality [9].
To supplement both clinical and community care
many services are using volunteers as a critical part of
the multi-disciplinary care offered at the end of life

[10, 11]. Volunteers are important to care, and indeed
42% of the adult population volunteer formally [12],
with an estimated 3 million in health and social care

[13] and 125,000 within hospices [14]. The Department
of Health commitment to end-of-life care specifically
recognises that such care is not simply ‘medical issues
with medical solutions’, and pledges to developing the
work of end-of-life care volunteer networks [15].
It is known that people are happy with volunteer support at the end of life [16–20], but there is little evidence of their effect on care outcomes. Evaluation in
well-designed comparative studies is therefore recommended [11]. This is particularly apt in palliative and
end-of-life care, where the effectiveness of many interventions are not evaluated using robust designs; this is
potentially wasteful of resources and could lead to
poorer or unintended outcomes. This is the first randomised trial of volunteer delivered support services at
the end of life to evaluate the effectiveness of such
interventions.


Methods
Design
This study was a pragmatic, randomised, prospective
open wait-list trial. The protocol for the study is published [21]. The trial used a wait-list design to randomly allocate participants on a 1:1 basis to receive the
intervention either immediately or after a 4 week wait

[22–24]. A wait-list approach, where consented participants are allocated to either receive an intervention immediately or after a defined period on a waiting list
during which they receive usual care is regarded as
more ethically defensible in end-of-life care, and allows
a valid comparison between the experimental and control arms at the time when the delayed intervention
starts [23–27].

Participants and setting
Participants in the trial include people anticipated to
be in their last year of life and their self-identified informal carer. Very low numbers of carers were recruited and there is insufficient data to report.
Inclusion criteria were broad to include typical participants of such services.
Patient inclusion criteria:

1. Those eligible to be referred to an end-of-life care
service determined by the referring organisation/
individual. They should be able to answer ‘no’ to
the ‘surprise question’: ‘Would you be surprised if
the patient dies within a year?’
2. Able to give informed consent.

Patient exclusion criteria:

1. Age < 18 years.
2. Those who only understand or speak a language in
which our main outcome measure (the World
Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Scale
(WHOQOL-BREF)) is unavailable.
3. Those with an anticipated prognosis of < 4 weeks.

Setting
Eleven English providers of end-of-life home care
services (nine hospices, one alcohol and substance
use charity, one NHS Trust), funded to provide the
intervention through competitive tender with the UK
Cabinet Office. The intervention was provided in
community settings, primarily in participant’s own
homes.

Intervention
Volunteers provided face-to-face individual support to
people anticipated to be in their last year of life.
Volunteer-provided services are a mode of support


-----

hypothesised to be distinctive from, but supplementary
to, usual forms of health and social care, with an effect on domains of quality of life, loneliness and social support. In this pragmatic trial services had
flexibility to deliver the intervention in a locally responsive manner within agreed parameters. Key elements of the volunteer-provided support intervention
include its delivery by trained volunteers who were
matched to individuals by a volunteer co-ordinator,
and provided care tailored to the needs of the individual but offered from a suite of options including
befriending, practical support and signposting, which
could differ at each visit. Volunteer support was typically provided face-to-face, one-to-one, in the home,
but telephone contact and meeting outside the home
were possible. Most contacts were befriending visits
in the home. The frequency and length of contact
was individually determined according to negotiated
participant preference and service availability, but was
typically a visit once a week for 1–3 hours. The service could continue as required after the study, but
study participants were followed up for 8 weeks post
intervention commencement. Volunteers could be any
age (18+), sex or ethnicity, and all received basic
training on boundaries, communication skills and organisational policies according to the requirements of
the organisation providing the intervention at each
site. Data captured the type, length and frequency of
each contact between participant and volunteer.
Participants continued to receive all usual care during
the study.

Objectives
The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of receiving care from a social action volunteer
befriending service plus usual care at 4 weeks at improving quality of life compared to usual care alone for
adults in the last year of life.
The secondary aims were to:

� Explore whether the social action volunteer
befriending service affects quality of life at 8 weeks.
� Explore whether the social action volunteer
befriending service reduces loneliness and affects the
perception of social support for adults at 4 and
8 weeks.
� Examine whether informal carers for those receiving
care from a social action volunteer befriending
service experience less carer burden at 4 and
8 weeks.
� Determine whether receiving care from a social
action volunteer befriending service can affect
participant’s use of other health and social care
services at 4 and 8 weeks.


Trial outcome measures:

� Quality of life: WHOQOL-BREF Scale, a short
(26 item) non-disease-specific, validated measure of
quality of life and wellbeing, having wide breadth
and available in many languages [28]. Data are
reported across the physical, psychological,
environment and social relationship domains which
were considered likely to be important outcomes for
this intervention. Cronbach’s Alpha (α) (Physical
0.714, Psychological 0.776, Environment 0.712,
Social Relationships 0.461). The low Cronbach’s
Alpha for social relationships reflects that this is a
3-item subscale, with an item which had many
missing values in this study.
� Loneliness: De Jong Gierveld 6-item Loneliness Scale,
a short, well-used, reliable and valid measurement
instrument for overall (α 0.374), emotional (α 0.678),
and social loneliness (α 0.846) [29].
� Social Support: 8-item modified Medical Outcomes
Study Social Support Survey (mMOS-SS), a short
validated scale covering two domains (emotional (α
0.859) and instrumental (α 0.892) social support,
total α 0.910) designed to identify potentially
modifiable social support deficits [30].
� Self-reported contact with health and social care
services over the previous 2 weeks.

The primary outcome was rate of change of quality of
life at 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the rate of
change of quality of life at 8 weeks, and loneliness, social
support and reported use of health and social care services at 4 and 8 weeks. A short time period was chosen
for the primary outcome as any end-of-life care intervention needs to work rapidly to be worthwhile. No data
were available to predetermine intervention length, but
follow-up for 8 weeks facilitates understanding of any
persistence of effect.
Socio-demographic data (age, sex, disease diagnosis,
education, marital status, living status, spirituality and
ethnicity) in the form of a self-completed questionnaire was collected from both patients and informal
carers at baseline. At baseline and subsequent time
points, patient participants were asked to indicate the
number, type and frequency of contact they have with
networks of others.
The schedule of data collection is presented in Table 1.
Time periods were necessarily short to reflect the possible prognosis of participants.

Sample size
Trial power was estimated using a worst case scenario
assuming 5% attrition at primary outcome measure.
With 350 or more participants per arm power exceeded

0.80 to detect difference in change over time corresponding to an effect size of f = 0.10 between the intervention and wait-list groups. This power model uses
alpha = 0.05, two tailed, and uses a conservative correlation of r = 0.6 for scores lagged 4 weeks, and r = 0.5 for
12 weeks.


Randomisation and study procedures
Participants were those referred to participating services
following eligibility, information and informed consent
procedures. Baseline data were collected and participants randomly allocated (1:1 allocation ratio) to either
the intervention or the wait-list arm of the trial. Site


-----

coordinators contacted a randomisation line at Lancaster
University, and the next sequence in the allocation
(stored in sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes) was revealed. The randomisation sequence was
computer generated, with rebalance in the arms after
10 randomisations. Blinding of site staff and patient
participants was not possible due to the nature of the
intervention. Data collected at 4, 8 and 12 weeks
were coordinated by the research team and sent by
post to patient and carer participants for selfcompletion. Data were returned directly to the research team.

Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22.
The primary outcome was rate of change of quality
of life at 4 weeks (WHOQOL-BREF). Basic exploratory and descriptive statistical tests (e.g. t and χ[2]

tests) were conducted at the α = 0.05 individual level
of significance. Confidence intervals were reported at
the 95% level. Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM)
used the full intention-to-treat sample over all available assessments with the aim of differentiating treatment effects from natural trajectories. The HLMs
compared primary and secondary outcome scores (e.g.
WHOQOL-BREF) between the immediate and waitlist groups. A piecewise model was specified to index
change from baseline to week 4 (Phase 1), and change
from week 4 to week 12 (Phase 2). Restricted maximum likelihood estimation was used, and fixed
slopes and random effects of each time predictor
were assessed to determine the most appropriate
model. Final models were specified with intercepts as
random effects to account for correlations among observations at different time points from the same participant. Treatment condition, time and interactions
between treatment condition × time were specified as
fixed effects.
With the interaction term, we tested whether there
was a significant difference in rate of change between
treatment groups before and after week 4. Secondary
analyses were conducted by testing the same HLMs
described with treatment completers. In the immediate arm, treatment completers were those who received any intervention before 4 weeks, and who
returned baseline and week 4 data. In the wait-list
arm, treatment completers were those who did not
receive any intervention before the return of week 4
data. Finally, sensitivity analyses on primary outcomes
were conducted to consider of the amount of volunteer input people received in the initial 4-week
period. Models were therefore specified using hours
of input and controlling for site.


Results
Recruitment and flow through trial
Figure 1 outlines the flow of participants in the trial. Recruitment took place from June 2015 to January 2016,
with data collection to March 2016. Of 329 eligible
people approached to participate, 196 consented. Reasons for the 133 not participating included not wishing
to receive the service (n = 46), they died or moved away
(n = 38), or they did not wish to take part in research
(n = 30). One participant died between consent procedures and randomisation, thus 195 were randomised,
100 to receive the intervention immediately and 95 to
the wait-list control group. At each time point, missing
data were noted, but participants continued to be enrolled in the study unless advised otherwise, as data sets
could be and often were returned at subsequent time
points. Around 40% of those in the immediate arm received no volunteer intervention before week 4 assessment due to lack of volunteer availability and matching,
and some in the wait-list arm received the intervention
at or after 4 weeks, but prior to completing their week
4 assessment. Few carers (n = 33) entered the study and
hence their data are not given here. A total of 20% of
enrolled participants (39 of 196) died during the study.

Baseline characteristics
Participants were recruited from all 11 sites (range 3–40
participants per site). Participant mean age was 72
(range 37–92), and 60% were female. No significant differences on demographic aspects between randomised
groups were observed (Table 2). No adverse events were
reported.

Primary outcome
The greater estimated difference in slopes between treatment conditions was 3.98 points on the WHOQOLBREF Physical subscale at week 4 (95% CI, –0.38 to
0.34). While this difference was not statistically significant, a clear trend was observed, showing that those in
the immediate group did not deteriorate at the same rate
as those in the wait-list group (b = 0.84, 95% CI, –2.24 to
3.92 vs. b = –3.14, 95% CI, –6.23 to –0.05) (Table 3).
Furthermore, after the wait-list group received the intervention following week 4, it was observed that the difference in rate of change between groups over the followup period was reduced from 3.98 to 1.12 (95% CI, –2.93
to 5.19), mainly explained by a reduction in the rate of
deterioration previously observed in the wait-list group
(from –3.14 to –0.15; 95% CI, –2.22 to 1.92). Estimated
means are presented in Table 4.
Similar reductions from Phase 1 to Phase 2 were observed in the wait-list group when WHOQOL-BREF
Psychological and Environmental subscales were primary outcomes. Per protocol analyses showed no

difference to intention-to-treat analyses and were therefore not reported.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to take into account the amount of volunteer input people received
(“number of hours of contact”) in the initial 4-week
period. After controlling for site, the estimated difference in slopes between treatment conditions was 4.43
points on the WHOQOL-BREF Physical subscale at
week 4 (95% CI, 0.10 to 8.76). This significant difference reflects that those in the immediate group did not
deteriorate at the same rate as those in the wait-list
group (Cohen d effect size = 0.27) (Table 5, Fig. 2). In
terms of trajectories over the follow-up period, the


pattern described above was replicated, where a reduction in the deterioration of WHOQOL-BREF subscales
in the wait-list group between Phase 1 and 2 were
observed.

Secondary outcomes
Loneliness (De Jong Gierveld Scale [29]), social support
(mMOS-SS [30]), and contacts with health and social
care professionals were assessed as outcomes, where
treatment effect was evaluated testing the interaction between treatment and time. No significant differences between treatment groups were found (Table 6).

found that there was a statistically significant difference
on the physical domain of quality of life, but not in other
domains. There was a pattern of deteriorating levels of
quality of life in the wait-list group, a decrease not observed in the immediate group, and which tends to disappear when all receive the intervention. Trends in the
data are in favour of the intervention, but the effect is
small, and related to reducing the rate of decline rather
than improving outcomes.

Strengths and limitations of the study
This is the first reported trial of volunteer support at
the end of life, and provides important information on
the outcomes of these commonly provided services, effect size and study parameters. Its particular strength is
its pragmatic design, particularly as the intervention design and participants reflect the ways these services are
provided and used in clinical practice rather than artificially constraining or limiting the way the intervention
was provided.
Limitations include study power, blinding, missing
data, attrition and intervention fidelity. Fewer service referrals were received than sites expected, although recruitment was steady over the trial period, and required
numbers would have been reached with a longer recruitment period. The recruitment period was constrained by
governance and contractual delays and time limited
funding, which also meant alternate designs such as
stepped-wedge would not be feasible [31, 32]. Our
planned effect size was small, and the effectiveness of
volunteer services remain unknown because of these issues with study power, and questions about choice of
outcome measures. The WHOQOL-BREF was specifically chosen for its wide usage, relevance and cultural appropriateness [33–35], but there were issues with
completion of the short social subscale. It may be that
end of life specific quality of life scales could be appropriate and well completed [36, 37], but these were not
chosen because many are disease specific, focus more on
physical symptoms, flag serious illness in a way which
may not be appropriate, and are not available in the
same range of languages as the chosen measure. The
lack of blinding could be viewed as a limitation, but it
was not practical to blind patients, volunteers or site
staff to treatment allocation. The amount of missing data
and attrition were as expected for a study with participants at the end of life [38], and robust arrangements
were in place for data cleaning and error checking (error
rate 0.56%). Whilst the intervention was flexible and
data were collected on its provision, not all participants
received the intervention as planned. Whilst per protocol analyses revealed no difference to intention-to-treat
analyses, greater fidelity in a powered trial may be


The WHOQOL-BREF comprises four individually scored domains. Domain scores
are calculated by computing the mean scores within the domain, noting that
negatively phrased questions are reverse scored. Domain scores are transformed
to a 0–100 scale according to the formula in the WHOQOL Manual. Lower scores
indicate a worse quality of life

Discussion
This study found no statistically significant difference in
effectiveness between volunteer provided support and
treatment as usual in people anticipated to be in their
last year of life. We saw that the rate of reduction of
quality of life, loneliness and perceived social support
was less steep in the intervention group, but this did not
reach statistical significance. When we controlled for the

Comparisons with other studies
No other trial of the outcomes of volunteer-provided
support at the end of life has been conducted, although
other trials are underway of volunteers building end-oflife networks [39] or supporting people with advanced
dementia [40]. Previous studies of volunteer-provided
services in the last year of life have been descriptive, addressing issues such as patient and volunteer experience,
acceptability, facilitators and barriers [10, 11, 16, 17, 19,
41–43]. These studies have shown that volunteer provided services are seen as complementary to clinical services, and their intuitive appeal means that services are
currently recommended and increasingly commonly

provided by those providing a range of end-of-life care
services [14].
Clinical services are known to be less accessed by
those who are older, with non-malignant conditions,
from ethnic minority communities or who are socioeconomically disadvantaged [44–49]. Those accessing
this volunteer provided service were less likely to have
cancer than clinical service norms [49], and volunteer
services may therefore be an access point to clinical
end-of-life care services, although they did not facilitate
access for those who were from black and minority ethnic communities.
Study participants had worse baseline scores for quality of life and loneliness when compared to studies of
the general population or those with early stage disease

[50–52], and comparable to those with similar disease
stages or using clinical end of life care services [53, 54].
Together with data on deaths during the study, it is clear
that those accessing a volunteer provided service are not
restricted to those who are considered relatively well.

Implications of the study for clinicians and policymakers
Clinicians often deliver palliative care within and across
generalist and specialist multi-disciplinary teams, although referrals between providers can appear sparse or
inequitable [44, 55, 56]. This research shows that doctors
and other clinicians can confidently refer people in their
last year of life to volunteer services for support which
complements the clinical care offered. Clinicians should
consider referring patients in the last year of life who
have high social needs, and potentially those who live
alone. They can expect that these services may slow a
person’s decline in quality of life.
Policymakers should continue to promote the involvement of volunteers in end-of-life care. The most recent
commitment from the UK government on end-of-life
care emphasises community and voluntary involvement

[15], building on the recognition of volunteers within
the end-of-life care strategy [57], and the present

research supports this policy direction. Policymakers
should pay attention to making evidence-based recommendations about the amount of volunteer support provided, as a dose effect is possible.

Future research
Further work is needed to further interrogate the effect
of these interventions in powered trials, especially in determining key patient or service characteristics, and their
interrelationship with services focusing on clinical needs.
Important service characteristics that should be studied
include the role of the volunteer as a direct supporter or
in mobilising networks of support [39, 58], in the frequency and amount of support provided, and the type of
person supported. Further work to determine the outcome measures best used to assess volunteer interventions is also recommended.


Research should take account of our finding that the
impact is in reducing rate of decline, and rate of change
should be considered as an important outcome measure
in palliative and end-of-life care research.

Conclusions
More hours or increased frequency of contact with a
volunteer has a statistically significant effect on the rate
of decline of physical quality of life at the end of life.
Other measured outcomes of the volunteer provided
support showed no statistically significant benefit over
usual care, although a trend in favour of the intervention
can be seen. This may have been due to the study being
underpowered. This is the first trial of volunteer provided support in the last year of life and provides an
emergent answer to questions of whether volunteer support should be used at the end of life; however, future
