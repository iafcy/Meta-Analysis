# Pain Management for Older Persons Living in Nursing Homes: A Pilot Study

  - - #### Mimi M. Y. Tse, RN, PhD, and Suki S. K. Ho, RN, BSN

- ABSTRACT:

Because the prevalence of chronic pain among the elderly in nursing
homes is high and decreases their quality of life, effective nonpharmacologic pain management should be promoted. The purpose of this
quasiexperimental pretest and posttest control design was to enhance
pain management in nursing homes via an integrated pain management program (IPMP) for staff and residents. Nursing staff and residents from the experimental nursing home were invited to join the 8week IPMP, whereas staff and residents from the control nursing
home did not receive the IPMP. Baseline data were collected from
nursing staff and residents in both groups before and after the IPMP.
The IPMP consisted of eight lectures on pain assessment, drug
knowledge,and nondrug strategies for the nursing staff, and 8 weeks
of activities, including gardening therapy and physiotherapy exercise,
for the residents. There were 48 and 42 older people in the experimental and control groups, respectively. No significant differences
were found in their educational level, sleep quality, bowel habits, past
and present health conditions, pain conditions and psychologic wellbeing parameters (p > .05) at baseline. After the IPMP, the experimental nursing staff showed a significant improvement in their
knowledge of and attitudes to pain management (p < .05), and the
experimental residents reported significantly lower pain scores and
used more nondrug strategies for pain relief compared with the control group (p < .05). Moreover, the psychologic well-being parameters, including happiness, loneliness, life satisfaction, and geriatric
depression, had significantly improved among the experimental residents (p < .05). The IPMP was effective in enhancing the knowledge
and attitudes of nursing staff, as well as reducing pain conditions and
enhancing psychologic well-being for older persons in nursing
homes.

With the increase in average life expectancy, the impact of disease, and the increase in the prevalence of disabilities (LEGCO Panel on Welfare Services,
2005), older adults are in increasing need of some form of accommodation

and/or residential care facilities (Sandberg et al., 2001).
In Hong Kong, 13.5% of people aged $65 years need
institutionalized care, and 95% of institutionalized
older people have one or more chronic diseases
(Census and Statistics Department, 2004).
Nursing homes serve the needs of disabled older
people who are unable to function independently
and who will benefit from 24-hour access to personal
and professional care from nursing staff. Yet life in
nursing homes can mean very limited physical and social activity, leading to a further decline in function for
many older people (Lassey & Lassey, 2001). Pain is
common in our aging population and even more common among older adults living in nursing homes: Onehalf of community-dwelling adults aged 60 or over have
been found to experience pain, and this number increases to 45%-80% in the nursing home population
(American Geriatric Society Panel on Chronic Pain in
Older Persons, 1998; Donald & Foy, 2004; Ferrell
et al., 1990; Ferrell, 1991; Soldato et al., 2007; Won
et al., 2004). Pain disrupts and influences daily lives
to a greater extent in older age (Reyes-Gibby et al.,
2002; Won et al., 2004). Pain is often ineffectively
managed, especially among older adults (Herr, 2010).
The present paper reports the pilot phase of a research
study attempting to explore the effectiveness of an integrated pain management program (IPMP) in enhancing the knowledge and attitudes of nursing staff
regarding pain management and relieving pain and enhancing psychologic well-being for older persons in
nursing homes.

#### BACKGROUND

The establishment of nursing homes serves older individuals who are unable to function independently
(Lassey & Lassey, 2001). Moving to and living in a nursing home is a difficult experience for many people. Indeed, it represents an alteration of living environment,
leading to reduced socialization with family and
community, a decrease in physical activity, and an
increased perception of loneliness (American
Geriatric Society Panel, 2002; d’Amico-Panomeritakis
& Sommer, 1999). Nursing home residents have
expressed loss of freedom, loss of control, feelings of
unhappiness, loneliness, depression, and a sense of
failure at having to stay in nursing homes (Kellett,
1999, Tse, 2007). Living in a nursing home is
regarded as ‘‘living in a jail’’ (Tse, 2007, p. 913), where
there is no freedom of movement, a lack of privacy, and
a loss of control over many things (Thompson &
Gessert, 2006; Wilson, 1997). Such negative feelings
about life in a nursing home have detrimental effects
on their health status, leading to a poor quality of life.


In addition, nursing home residents suffer from
pain. It has been found that 49%-84% of older people
living in nursing homes had suffered from pain of moderate to severe intensity over the previous 3 months
(Tse et al., 2005; Won et al., 2004). In Won et al.’s
(2004) study, a total of 21,380 nursing home residents
were examined, 10,372 (48.5%) of whom had persistent pain. The prevalence of persistent pain was very
high in those with musculoskeletal pain and those
with a history of falls, fractures, or surgery. Pain in
older adults tends to be constant in nature, moderate
to severe in intensity, and lasting for several years.
Chronic shoulder pain, low back pain, and knee
pain predominate as the causes of chronic pain
(Baumann, 2009). As a result of chronic pain, activities
of daily living are hindered, and older persons have less
desire to participate in exercise and social events. Unrelieved chronic pain may lead to decreased physical
activity, depression, anxiety, and even suicidal
thoughts (Fisher et al., 2001; Tang & Crane, 2006;
Smith et al., 2004).
In spite of the severity of the pain, the majority of
older people choose not to take any oral medication for
pain relief (American Geriatric Society Panel, 2002;
Ferrell et al., 1990; Tse et al., 2005; Schofield,
2007; Won et al., 2004), and there is a reluctance
among physicians, nurses, and older people to use
prescription drugs in chronic pain management. Of
the 50% of nursing home residents with persistent
�
or recurring pain, 38% received opioids, 37%
received nonopioid analgesics, and 25% did not
receive any analgesics (Won et al., 2004).
It has been suggested that health care providers believe that older people are less sensitive to pain than
their younger counterparts (Gagliese & Melzack,
1997), leading to undermedication, which in turn contributes to inadequate pain management (Eun-Ok
et al., 2007; Melzack, 1990). Physicians are often
reluctant to prescribe adequate analgesics due to
knowledge deficits and poor attitudes to pain
management (Carr, 2007; Elliott et al., 1999; von
Roenn et al., 1993). Nurses in Hong Kong, like their
counterparts in the USA, Australia, and Finland, are
found to have inadequate knowledge of and negative
attitudes toward pain management (Brown et al.,
1999; Carr, 2007; Dalton et al., 1996; Lui et al., 2008;
McCaffery et al., 1990; Tse & Chan, 2004; Vortherms
et al., 1992). To make matters worse, nursing home
staff are mainly composed of health workers and
personal care workers who receive minimal education
and training regarding pain education and pain
management in client care.
Alternative therapies for pain management, including the psychologic, social, emotional, and


-----

spiritual areas, can be explored for older people in
nursing homes and in the community (Schofield,
2008). Indeed, it is vital to consider all psychosocial
and cultural factors related to pain in the older population, so that appropriate interventions, including
cognitive-behavioral strategies such as hypnosis, relaxation with guided imagery, distraction, the use of support groups, and physical exercise, can be delivered
accordingly (Bruckentbal, 2010; Kwekkeboom, 1999;
Schofield, 2008; Tsai, 2009).

Schofield and Bryn (1998) defined the use of the
sensory environment for the management of chronic
pain as snoezelen, a term that is reportedly a contraction of two Dutch words meaning ‘‘to sniff’’ and ‘‘to
doze.’’ Thus it was a place for interaction within an engaging environment, which can facilitate rest and help
to overcome fatigue (Schofield, 1996). The original
concept was developed using simple effects, such as
colored paper and light bulbs with tin foil, music and
textures such as a heated waterbed, a ball pool and a vibrating massage bed designed to stimulate all of the primary senses—vision, hearing, touching, taste, and
smell—simultaneously. These approaches can create
a peaceful and tranquil experience for the elderly, encouraging them to feel safe (Kewin, 1991). There has
been widespread interest in the use of snoezelen to enable relaxation, psychologic promotion, and pain reduction (Schofield & Hutchinson, 2002).
Indeed, pain is a complex experience that is made
up of physical, psychologic, social, and spiritual components, i.e., the total pain experience introduced by
Dame Cicely Saunders (Clark, 1999; International
Association for the Study of Pain, 2009). The new
paradigm for the care of older people focuses on
the primary and secondary prevention of functional
morbidity and premature mortality, as well as
enhancing the quality of life for older people (Gill &
Kurland, 2003); as such, pain management and social
support networks are important initiatives for older
adults living in nursing homes.
In Hong Kong, the prevalence of pain was 50%
among older adults (Chung & Wong, 2007), and 80%
for older adults living in nursing homes (Tse et al.,
2005). Therefore, the purpose of the present pilot
study was to explore the effectiveness of an IPMP.
The additional aims of were to relieve pain and enhance psychologic well-being for older persons living
in nursing homes. This pilot study reports the implementation of the IPMP in two nursing homes. The objectives of the present study were: 1) to increase
knowledge of and attitudes to pain management
among nursing staff in nursing homes; and 2) to reduce
pain and enhance psychologic well-being for older persons living in nursing homes.


#### METHODS

Design, Sample
This research was a quasiexperimental pretest and
posttest control group study design. After gaining approval from the Ethics Committee of the university,
we approached two private nursing homes and invited
them to participate in the study; they were randomized
into an experimental group with the IPMP and a control group with regular care but without the IPMP.
The control group was similar to the experimental
group regarding patient-to-staff ratio, spacing, overall
layout of the nursing home environment, and its facilities. The staff and residents were recruited by convenience sampling.
Written consent was obtained from all participants. All staff from nursing homes in the experimental
group were invited to attend the IPMP, including registered nurses, enrolled nurses, and personal care attendants. As for residents, the inclusion criteria were
being $60 years old, being able to communicate in
Cantonese, and being oriented as to time and place.
Those who were bed bound and those with a history
of mental disorders were excluded from the study.

Procedure
The demographic data, pain situations (including pain
site, severity, use of nonpharmacologic methods for
pain relief), activities of daily living, and psychologic
parameters of the older persons were collected from
the two nursing homes before and after the IPMP.
Also, staff from the experimental nursing home were
invited to complete a survey to learn about their
knowledge and attitudes to pain management before
and after the IPMP.

Intervention: Integrated Pain Management
Program
The IPMP consisted of two target groups (nursing staff
and older persons) in the nursing homes; activities
were carried out simultaneously for the nursing staff
and the older persons.
For the nursing staff, an 8-week pain education
program was conducted as shown in Table 1. The
pain education program was offered twice per week
(about 1 hour per session), an identical session being
conducted within the same week to provide the maximum chance of attendance to nursing staff who were
mainly on shift duty in the nursing home. Details of the
teaching are given in Table 1.
The older persons received instruction in gardening activities and physiotherapy activities for 8 weeks,
as shown in Table 1. Various types of plants and seedlings that were suitable for gardening activities in the

nursing home environment were introduced. There
were tomato, chili, Chinese choi sum, hyacinth, mint
plants, and lettuce seedlings, from which the participants could choose two for their own planting. Each
participant’s plants were placed along the window
side of the multiple function room, and each participant was responsible for his or her own planting, while
the research team facilitated and discussed the proper
care of the plant, preparing the soils, watering, and
adding fertilizers. The older persons were reminded
to keep their plants sheltered from strong winds
and heavy rainfall, and this was accomplished with the
help of the nursing home staff. They were encouraged
to smell the plants, such as the mint leaves, which gave
off a pleasant and refreshing aroma. Photos of residents
with their plants were taken at the end of each week.
The older persons were also invited to join an
8-weekphysiotherapyprogramconsistingof1hourofinstruction per week conducted by aphysiotherapist.Each
week,there were 15 minutes of warm-upexercises atthe
beginning, followed by muscle strengthening and
stretching, balance, acupressure, and massage. There
were specific exercises to help older adults to relieve
painconditionsby themselves,includinginthe shoulder,
neck, back, and knee areas.

Instruments
Nurses’ Knowledge and Attitude Survey Regarding Pain–Chinese Version (NKASRP-C). The demographic data of the nursing staff were recorded.
Also, a self-administered questionnaire was used to
measure the knowledge and attitudes of nurses in
pain management. The Nurses’ Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (NKASRP) questionnaire
was developed by McCaffery and Ferrell (1987). Testretest reliability was established (r > 0.80) by repeated
testing in a continuing education class of staff nurses
(n 60). Internal consistency reliability was estab¼
lished (alpha r > 0.70) with items reflecting both
knowledge and attitude domains.
Used with permission (Tse & Chan, 2004), the English version of the NKASRP was translated into Chinese and then back-translated into English by an
experienced nurse and a Chinese nurse with a degree
in translation. The translated English version was compared with the original and all inconsistencies in meaning and grammar discussed and resolved. The two
English versions were compared to establish uniformity and consistency. To address the content validity
among Hong Kong Chinese nurses, five experts including nurse specialists in a hospice unit, a pain clinic, and
an oncology unit, an anesthesiologist, and the physician in charge of the pain clinic reviewed the Chinese
version of the NKASRP. Fourteen items regarded as not


representing the clinical practice of nurses in Hong
Kong were deleted after the expert review of the survey questionnaire.
The Chinese version of NKASRP (NKASRP-C) consists of 25 items about general pain management, pain
assessment, and the use of analgesics. Items 1-16 are
‘‘true or false’’ questions that assess general knowledge
of pain, its manifestation, and treatment. Items 17-25
are multiple-choice questions that deal primarily with
pharmacotherapeutics. One mark is gained for one corrected answer. Total maximum score is 25. Higher
marks indicate better knowledge of and attitudes to
pain management. The content validity was 0.87.
Also, the test-retest reliability of NKASRP-C was established (r ¼ 0.812) by repeated testing among 20 registered nurses in Hong Kong. There were 678 nurses
being studied using the NKASRP-C (Tse & Chan,
2004). The percentage of correctly answered questions was 44%. There was statistical significant in educational preparation and clinical experiences with
correct scores. The findings of that study support the
concern of inadequate knowledge and attitudes in relation to pain management. NKASRP-C was also studied
among 143 nurses and deficit in knowledge and attitudes regarding pain management were reviewed
(Lui et al., 2008). Those with a higher percentage of
correct scores in NKASRP-C were those having more
clinical working experiences and able to apply knowledge of pain in their daily work (Lui et al., 2008).
Pain and Psychologic Well-Being for Older
Persons. Demographic data were collected, including age, gender, educational level, past health, and
length of stay in nursing homes. In addition, pain situations and psychologic well-being were measured before and upon completion of the IPMP for older
persons. Pain situations were measured by Geriatric
Pain Assessment, which included assessing pain intensity using a 0–10-point scale, pattern and location of
pain, exacerbating and relieving factors, sleep quality,
and bowel habits (American Geriatrics Society Panel,
2002). The psychologic well-being of older persons included happiness (assessed by the Subjective Happiness Scale, life satisfaction (assessed by the Life
Satisfaction Index–A form), loneliness (assessed using
the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale), and depression
(assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale). The number of nondrug methods used were counted.
The Subjective Happiness Scale (Lyubomirsky &
Lepper, 1999) consists of a 4-item measure of global
subjective happiness. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale with different descriptors for each item. The
Cronbach alpha was 0.79-0.94 (Lyubomirsky &
Lepper, 1999). The test-retest reliability ranged from
0.55 to 0.90. The total range of the scores was 4-28,


-----

with higher scores reflecting greater happiness. The
Chinese translation of the Subjective Happiness Scale
was developed (Chen et al., 2008) with a Cronbach alpha of 0.69 for reliability (Chen et al., 2008). Tse et al.
(2010) used the Chinese version of the Subjective Happiness Scale to measure the happiness level of older
persons living in nursing homes.
The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, version 3, is
a standard scale for measuring loneliness (Russell,
1996). The scale consists of 20 items assessed using
9 positively worded items and 11 negatively worded
items to measure the feelings of loneliness and social
isolation of the participants. Interviewees are asked
to rate how frequently they feel as described, from
‘‘never’’ to ‘‘often.’’ Each of the 20 items is rated on
a scale of 1 (never), 2 (rarely), 3 (sometimes), and 4 (often). After reverse-scoring appropriate items, loneliness scores are calculated by summing all of the
items. The range of possible scores is 20-80, with
higher scores signifying greater loneliness. Scores
from 30 to 40 are considered to be a normal experience of loneliness, and scores >60 indicate that a person is experiencing severe loneliness. Reliability
testing has indicated that the scale has an internal consistency ranging from 0.89 to 0.94 and a test-retest reliability of 0.73. Convergent validity has been
demonstrated by a significant correlation with the
NYU Loneliness Scale (0.65) (Rubenstein & Shaver,
1982) and the Differential Loneliness Scale (0.72)
(Schmidt & Sermat, 1983). A Chinese version of the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale was validated (Chou et al.,
2005) and used, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.90 (Chou
et al., 2005).
The Life Satisfaction Index–A (Neugarten et al.,
1961) form consists of 18 questions related to five different components: zest, resolution and fortitude, congruence between desired and achieved goals, positive
self-concept, and mood tone. Items score 1 point for
agree and 0 for disagree. Reverse-scoring of appropriate items provides a score range of 0-18, with the highest scores indicating the greatest satisfaction. A
Chinese version of the Life Satisfaction Index–A form
was developed by Chi and Boey (1992), with a Cronbach alpha of 0.7 for reliability and split half-value of
0.62 for internal consistency (Chi & Boey, 1992). The
Chinese version of the Life Satisfaction Index–A form
was used.
The Geriatric Depression Scale was used to measure depression in the older adults (Yesavage et al.,
1983). The scale consists of 15 yes/no questions asking
the participants how they feel using a yes/no format. A
‘‘yes’’ response for a negatively phrased question is
given 1 point, as is a ‘‘no’’ response for a positively
phrased question, with higher total scores indicating


more depression. The Cronbach alpha of internal consistency was 0.89, and the test-retest reliability was
0.85. Those who reported #4 fewer symptoms were
considered to be normal, those with 5-9 symptoms
mildly depressed, and those with $10 moderately to
severely depressed. A final Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale was developed in Hong Kong
(Chiu et al., 1994). It was internally consistent, with
Cronbach alpha of 0.92. The Guttman split-half reliability was 0.89. The test-retest reliability was r ¼ 0.84.
The Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale
was used (Chan, 1996; Mui, 1996).
Use of Nonpharmacologic Interventions. An information sheet was used and the older persons were
asked the frequency of use and the different types of
nonpharmacologic interventions used to relieve pain.

Data Analysis
Several statistical methods were used in data analysis.
Descriptive statistical analysis of the quantitative data
was conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 13.0. Chi-squared tests were used
to determine any differences between the experimental and control groups, and the paired-sample t test and
independent-sample t test were used to examine differences in pain scores and psychologic well-being parameters within groups and between groups over
two occasions. A p value of <.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.

#### RESULTS

Demographic Data
There were 33 nursing staff in the experimental group
who joined the IPMP. All were female, and their average age was from 36 to 45 years. The nursing team
was mainly composed of personal care workers
(60.6%), health workers (24.2%), enrolled nurses
(6.1%), and registered nurses (9.1%). Around 50% of
them had been working for 6-10 years in nursing
homes. Regarding educational qualifications, only 3%
had a bachelor’s degree, and 15.2% had attended
courses related to pain management (Table 2).
The study recruited 90 older people to participate, 48 in the experimental group and 42 in the control group. Table 3 shows the demographic data. The
ages ranged from 60 to >80 years, with the median
age >80-89 years. Their major underlying medical
problems included hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
history of stroke, and heart disease. No significant differences were found in the educational level, sleep
quality, bowel habits, and characteristics of the
older persons in the experimental and control groups
(p < .05).

Nursing Staff: Improvement of Knowledge and
Attitudes in Pain Management
At baseline, the knowledge and attitudes in pain management in the experimental and control groups
were similar, with mean NKASRP-C scores of correct
responses 8.7 4.03 and 8.4 4.03, respectively
� �
(p < .05); staff in the experimental group received


the IPMP, and staff in the control group did not receive
the IPMP. On completion of the IPMP, there was a significant increase in the mean score of correct responses
to the NKASRP-C, from 8.7 4.03 to 19.9 3.68
� �
(p < .05), in the experimental group, but no such
increase in the control group. Nursing staff showed
a positive attitude and more confidence in pain management and the use of nonpharmacologic interventions. The concept of pain as a subjective experience
had been wrongly answered by the majority of participants at baseline, but on completion of the IPMP
they all agreed with the subjective experience of
pain and that they had to listen to what the client
said. Correct responses regarding knowledge of nonpharmacologic treatment—‘‘Nonpharmacological interventions may decrease the need for analgesics’’
and ‘‘the combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods of pain control yields the most effective pain relief for the elderly’’—were increased.
However, little improvement was noted in the pharmacologic knowledge after the IPMP.

Pain Scores and Uses of Nonpharmacologic
Methods in Pain Relief
Table 4 shows the pain scores of the experimental and
control groups at baseline and after IPMP. The common
pain locations among both groups were the shoulders,
back, knees, and hips. At baseline (week 1), the pain
scores were 3.66 1.74 and 4.92 2.94 among the ex� �
perimental and control groups, respectively, and there
was no significant difference (p > .05). On completion
of the IPMP (week 8), there was a reduction of pain
scores to 2.88 2.02 in the experimental group,
�
whereas the control group showed an increase in pain
scores to 5.31 2.31. After IPMP, there were significant
�
differences in the pain scores among the experimental
and controlgroups (p < .05), and older personsinthe experimental group reported significantly lower pain
scores compared with the control group.
In terms of the use of nonpharmacologic methods
in pain relief, as shown in Table 5 there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in the number of participants using
nonpharmacologic interventions as pain relief at baseline (p > .05). On completion of the IPMP, there was
a significant difference between the groups, with participants in the experimental group using more nonpharmacologic interventions (p ¼ .05).
As for the total number of nonpharmacologic
methods used by the two groups of older persons, a significant increase was found in the experimental group
(p < .05) in week 8 compared with the control group,
and the total number of methods used by the control
group actually decreased.

#### DISCUSSION

The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of
the IPMP in enhancing the knowledge and attitudes
of nursing staff in pain management. Pain scores
were also reduced significantly, and the older persons
were happier, more satisfied, and less lonely and depressed. Indeed, the present study was a pilot study
to test the feasibility, protocol, and implementation
of the IPMP, which will be used in more nursing homes
in the main study.

The finding of the present study regarding knowledge and attitude scores among nursing staff was low
(only 8.7 correct responses) compared with local and
overseas studies (Liu et al., 2008; Tse & Chan, 2004;
Wilson, 2007). Nevertheless, it was consistent with
literature that reported inadequate knowledge and
poor attitudes in pain management among nursing
staff (Liu et al., 2008; Wilson, 2007) Health workers
and personal care workers are the key nursing staff
providing direct care for the elderly in nursing homes
in Hong Kong. Indeed, given their educational level
and lack of relevant in-service training and education,
it was not surprising to find such a low mean score
at baseline. However, it was encouraging to find that

the postintervention score was significantly increased,
that all the nursing staff expressed more confidence in
caring for older clients in chronic pain and that they
would use more nonpharmacologic interventions in
the course of their care.
As for the residents in nursing homes, it was found
that all of the psychologic parameters in both groups
were below the cutoff points at baseline. Also, the
pain scores of 3.66-4.92 (on an 11-point scale) were
considered to be moderate. These findings were consistent with the literature regarding the prevalence of
pain and poor psychologic status among older persons
living in nursing homes. On completion of the IPMP, it
was encouraging to find that pain scores were decreased significantly, and that almost all psychologic
parameters had been improved; the older persons in
the experimental group were happier, more satisfied,
less lonely, and less depressed.
In the present study, the gardening program provided benefits for the older participants in coping
with pain. In the process of growing their plants,
they watched the colorful flowers and leaves, touched
and felt the plants, were encouraged to smell the odor
of mint and other plants, and consumed the vegetables
they grew. This created a sensory environment that
provided stimulation to the older persons. It was
Schofield et al. (1998) who pioneered the use of a multisensory environment for treating elderly people with
chronic pain. This concept will help to refine the IPMP
in future studies. Indeed, the use of multisensory therapies as a nonpharmacologic pain management ap

proach was proven to be effective and less expensive
(Keefe et al., 1992).
The older people chose to use more nonpharmacologic interventions as pain relief. Examples included
listening to music, reading, watching TV, the use of hot
and cold pads, resting, deep breathing, and talking to
friends. They were also very positive about participating in the exercise program. Indeed, the therapeutic effects of exercise programs on pain relief are well
documented (Hernandez-Molina et al., 2008; Moseley,
2002; O’Reilly et al., 1999; Ross et al., 1999).

#### CONCLUSIONS

The total pain concept as introduced by Dame Cicely
Saunders described the physical, psychologic, social,
and spiritual components of pain. Given the moderate
to high prevalence of pain among older persons living
in nursing homes, and the longevity of the older population, the new paradigm for older people’s care should
focus on holistic approaches to pain management and
recognize that an integrated pain management program is important to both staff and older persons in
the nursing home environment.
