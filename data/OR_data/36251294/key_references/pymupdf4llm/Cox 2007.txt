Purpose: The primary goal of the Care-Receiver Efficacy
Intervention (CREI) was to increase the capacity of
cognitively able elderly care receivers to effectively
manage their own care and optimize relationships with
caregivers. To accomplish this, two forms of the CREI
were created: an individual and a small-group form. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of these
two CREI forms when compared to a case management
approach. Design and Methods: Utilizing a quasiexperimental design, between January 2002 and
August 2004 we collected data from 177 elders at
three time points: pretest, 2 months following the last
session, and 12 months following the last session. The
Care-Receiver Efficacy Scale and the Philadelphia
Geriatric Center Morale Scale–Revised were the outcome measures. Results: We found significant effects
favoring the CREI for relationship with caregivers, selfcare strategies, loneliness, and quality of life. Effects
were strongest for the small-group form of the CREI.
Overall, the care receivers in both forms of the CREI
showed improved self-performance, with small-group

Elder care has become an issue of critical dimensions
in the United States and around the world, as more
individuals live longer lives that often include varying
degrees of disability requiring personal care. Research,
policy, and intervention programs targeting caregivers
have proliferated during the past three decades.
Caregiver intervention programs have included educational programs, social support groups, and a number
of other psychosocial interventions. Researchers have
represented the caregiver/care-receiver relationship as
an important component of the caregiving process
(Ingersoll-Dayton & Raschick, 2004; Lyons, Zarit,
Sayer, & Whitlatch, 2002; Whitlatch, Schur, Noelker,
Ejaz, & Looman, 2001), as well as central to the
perceptions of caregivers and care receivers (Pillemer &
Suitor, 2006; Tetz et al., 2006; Thompson, 2004).
Scholars have given far less attention to the carereceiving role faced by older individuals or to the policy
and intervention strategies suggested by the nature of
this role. The challenges of being a care receiver and the
attitudes, knowledge, and skills that facilitate strong
and effective participation of care receivers in their care


CREI participants showing remarkable improvement
related to quality of life. Implications: The results of
this research suggest that care receiver intervention can
be effective in improving the care process.

Topic Objective

1. Introducing the program and the roles of the To help participants explore their roles as caregivers and care receivers
care receiver within the United States (exploring expectations, values, etc.).
2. Learning to use health and social services To encourage participants to familiarize themselves with appropriate
health and social service resources and to explore self-advocacy.
3. Caring for yourself To explore what ‘‘being in charge of your own health care’’ means
to each participant.
4–5. Adjusting to being a care receiver To encourage the exploration, evaluation, and potential for change in
attitudes and beliefs about being a care receiver.
6. Being a good communicator To introduce care receivers to the concept of purposeful communication
and related knowledge and skills.
7. Building your social support network To help participants think about their current social support networks
and their role in maintenance and expansion of support networks.
8. Looking at the past and planning for the future To assist participants in identifying their strengths and defining quality
of life.
9–10. Joint meeting with care receivers and caregivers To help caregivers better understand the perspective of the care
receivers and their potential role in the care process.


process have not been a primary focus of gerontological
research, even though there is an increasing consensus
that care receiving plays a major role in late-life tasks.
There is a growing recognition in the health care field
regarding the patient role of care receiver as being of
critical import to mental health and physical health
(Berman & Iris, 1998; Kempen et al., 2003; Li, Fisher,
Harmer, & McAuley, 2005; Maddux, Brawley, &
Boykin, 1995). Care receiver interventions are a key
next step with respect to the consumer-directed care
movement fostered by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation (Polivka & Salmon, 2001).
The primary goal of the Care-Receiver Efficacy
Intervention (CREI), the effects of which we report
herein, was to increase the capacity of elderly care receivers to effectively manage their own care, including
optimizing their relationships with caregivers. More
specifically, this intervention was designed to reduce the
sense of powerlessness and increase the sense of efficacy
of care receivers as partners in their care process by
increasing their knowledge and skills to cope with and
overcome challenges associated with the care-receiving
process, thereby decreasing caregiver stress. Two different forms of the CREI were created to accomplish
this goal: a small-group and an individual approach.
Many elderly care receivers cannot, or are unwilling
to, participate in small-group interventions due to isolation, lack of transportation, or physical conditions.
Geographic location of residence (such as a senior
housing facility) can be a key factor in developing group
interventions. Consequently, the availability of both a
small-group and an individual intervention was deemed
important to meeting the needs of elderly care receivers.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the CREI. To accomplish this, we compared
the two forms of the CREI to a case management
approach.

#### Background and Description of the CREI


The CREI was based on studies regarding the ways
in which elders of diverse ethnic backgrounds experi

ence and define their role in the care process, as well as
the perceptions of caregivers (Cox, 1999; Cox &
Dooley, 1996; Cox, Parsons, & Kimboko, 1998). These
studies, combined with extant literature regarding
caregiver challenges, led to focusing this intervention
on the following themes: (a) psychosocial coping with
increased dependency; (b) participating in self-care
education and activities; (c) communicating with
personal and professional caregivers; (d) finding,
assessing, and managing the use of formal health and
social services; (e) sustaining and developing late-life
social support networks; (f) caring for and working
with one’s caregiver; (g) maintaining quality of life; and
(h) making end-of-life decisions.
Project staff prepared structured educational material for the CREI for each session. Gerontological social
workers, trained by project staff with regard to the
empowerment-oriented intervention approach and
specifically the CREI intervention process, provided
the intervention, pretest, and post-test data collection.
Both the small-group and individual interventions
consisted of 10 biweekly sessions of 1.5 to 2 hr in
length related to the themes listed in the preceding paragraph and 2 review sessions with caregivers present. A
typical session included (a) assessment of issues by the
individual/small group and values clarification processes; (b) sharing of strategies from research on individuals in similar situations and from the participant’s
perspective; (c) sharing of related educational material,
such as mediation and conflict management skills, communication skills, how to access and manage formal
agency care, and advanced directives; (d) engaging in
mutual support and self-help activities; and (e) taking
part in social action strategies if indicated by issues
that arose. Table 1 describes the 10 session topics and
objectives.
To summarize, the CREI was designed to initiate
care receiver involvement in increasing knowledge
and skills related to the role of care receiving and in
assisting others through sharing in the group or
allowing their ideas and knowledge to be added to the
materials utilized by the project. (For more informa

#### Comparison Group Intervention


Members of the comparison group received a standard case management intervention modeled after
the services of case management agencies that receive
state contracts to provide this service for home- and
community-based service recipients. This service included (a) a comprehensive needs assessment, using
Colorado’s standardized multidimensional long-term
care assessment tool; (b) referral and assistance, with
access to all appropriate long-term-care services; (c)
monthly follow-up to determine changes in needs; and
(d) ongoing telephone assistance at the request of the
participant.

#### Methods


#### Research Design

In order to determine the effectiveness of the CREI in
its two forms, we created three groups: two treatment
groups, representing the small-group and individual
intervention; and a comparison group, consisting of
persons receiving the case management intervention. Eligibility for the small-group or individual
CREI depended upon the person’s ability to access
and participate in a group model. We assigned all smallgroup-eligible intervention participants to the smallgroup treatment. We assigned all individual-eligible
intervention participants randomly to either the CREI
individual treatment or the case management/comparison intervention.
For all three groups, we collected data at three time
points: Time 1 (pretest), Time 2 (2 months following the
last session), and Time 3 (12 months following the last
session). We collected pretest data between January 2002
and July 2003; we collected final data by August 2004.


referral, agency staff contacted potential participants to
determine their willingness to participate in the program. Clients then contacted the project’s research
staff. Elders received no payment other than the opportunity to participate in an intervention.
A total of 177 participants from the Denver,
Colorado, metro area were recruited. One individual
younger than age 55 was selected for participation due
to a severe disability, need for care, and initial confusion about her age.
The mean age of participants in Time 1 data was
78.42 years (SD ¼ 9.78), with ages ranging from 51 to 96.
Most of the participants were female (76.3%), Caucasian (78.5%), and widowed (51.4%). The modal
residential location was an independent retirement
community (40.7%), with 27.1% in assisted living,
24.9% in their own home, 5.6% in a relative’s home, and
1.7% in a skilled nursing facility. The self-reported
health status of most participants was fair or good
(39.5% in each category), with 13.0% in poor and 7.3%
in excellent health. The modal annual income category
was $4,860 to $11,064 (42.9%), with income categories
ranging from $0 to $4,860 (6.8%) to more than $45,000
(2.3%). Table 2 provides information on demographic
characteristics of the sample by treatment group.

#### Instruments


#### Participants

Elders who were selected for this project met the
following criteria: (a) were 55 years old or older, (b)
required a minimum of 6 hr of personal care per
week, and (c) were cognitively able to participate in the
intervention as determined by the mini-mental status
screen from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Folstein,
Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) and the decision of a
clinical social worker (a few applicants did not respond
well to the mini-mental status screen but were determined by gerontological social workers to be able to
make decisions for themselves and discuss carereceiving concerns). The participants included primarily individuals with disability related to one or more of
the following conditions: stroke, heart disease, osteoporosis, mild dementia, cancer, and severe arthritis. All
participants required assistance with one or more activities of daily living (e.g., dressing, bathing, feeding).
Recruitment was accomplished with the assistance of
agencies throughout the Denver metropolitan area,


We administered two measures via one-to-one
interviews. The Care-Receiver Efficacy Scale (CRES:
Cox, Green, Seo, Inaba, & Alyla Quillan, 2006) was
created specifically for this project and therefore was
anticipated to be the most sensitive to the study’s theme
of efficacy. The other was a published measure, the
Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale–Revised
(PGCMS; Lawton, 1975). In total, we used 8 subscale
and 1 total measure scores.

CRES.—The CRES (Cox et al., 2006) consists of 48
items comprising five subscales, with a 5-point response
scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). The five
subscale names, number of items, and the internal
consistency ranges over the three data collection time
points in this study were as follows: Self-Care Strategies
(15 items, .89–.91), Relational Coping With Caregivers
(10 items, .82–.84), Perceptions of Dependence (5 items,
.67–.69), Performance-Related Quality of Life (10
items, .86–.88), and Accepting Help (8 items, .64–.71).
Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy on all
subscales except Perceptions of Dependence, where
higher scores indicate stronger perceptions of dependence. The CREI was designed to directly affect selfcare strategies and relationships with caregivers. (See
Cox et al., for complete item text by subscale.) We
anticipated that all CREI subscales except Perceptions
of Dependence would be significantly affected by both
the small-group and individual CREI.


PGCMS.—The PGCMS (Lawton, 1975) consists of
17 items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of morale.
This scale assesses three factors related to aging. The

subscale name, number of items, and the internal
consistency reliability ranges over the three measurement points were as follows: Agitation (6 items, .73–
.77), Attitude Toward Own Aging (5 items, .55–.68),
and Lonely Dissatisfaction (6 items, .68–.72). We also
used a total score reflecting global life satisfaction (17
items, .81–.85). We used all four scores (three subscale
scores and the total score) in this study. Although the
CREI did not directly address morale, we anticipated
that the interventions would affect the care receivers’
loneliness and global life satisfaction.

#### Procedure


Project staff gave participants a general description
of the project at the first contact, often by telephone. At
this time, if the individual wished to participate, the
contact site was determined. The first in-person contact
typically occurred at the participant’s home, but
occasionally participants chose the home of relatives,


a senior center, health care facility, or another site. At
this point, project staff assigned participants to the
appropriate form of intervention. One-to-one interviews, administered to all participants, allowed staff to
complete the consent form and the study instruments at
each of the three time points. Individuals trained in
social work and gerontology conducted the interviews.
The project employed Spanish- and Russian-speaking
social workers as needed to conduct interviews as well
as provide the interventions in linguistically and
culturally appropriate ways. During the interviews,
all items from the three outcome measures were read to
the participants and answers recorded. Interviewers
administered the items to 177 care receivers three times
between January 2002 and August 2004: Time 1 data
were collected between January 2002 and July 2003.
Two months after the participants completed baseline
administration, Time 2 data were collected. Twelve
months after completion of the interventions, Time 3
data were collected.

#### Analyses

We used repeated measures analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) to assess overall treatment group differences
using Time 1 measures as covariates. Prior to this analysis, we conducted several preliminary assessments.
First, we evaluated group differences on Time 1 measures and on demographic variables to assess group
equivalence prior to treatment. Second, we evaluated
group differences in attrition from baseline to Time 3
to assess whether there was differential attrition by
treatment. Third, we assessed ANCOVA assumptions.
In the case of ANCOVA assumption violations, we
employed an alternative analysis.
We tested the following planned hypotheses: (a)
Combined CREI group means will be significantly
higher than the case management group mean at Time
2 and Time 3 (Hypothesis 1); (b) The mean for the
small-group CREI will differ significantly from the
mean for the individual CREI (Hypothesis 2; there were
no a priori expectations regarding direction of effect);
and (c) There will be a significant interaction between
group and time, suggesting a statistically significant
increase over time for both CREI versions, but not for
the case management group (Hypothesis 3).

groups by type of residence, we conducted exploratory
analyses with treatment group, time, and type of
residence as factors.
We found no statistically significant Time 1 group
differences on the PGCMS total score or subscales or
on any of the CRES subscales.

#### Differences in Attrition by Group and by Demographic Variables


#### Results

 Group Differences at Time 1


We found no statistically significant differences (p,
.05) among the three groups for age, marital status,
gender, ethnicity, income, or health status. We found
statistically significant differences for type of residence
and living status. Case management group participants
were more likely to live in assisted living facilities than
CREI participants, who were more likely to live in their


Sample sizes for the three groups at Times 1, 2, and
3 were as follows: individual treatment—49, 41, 35;
group treatment—71, 62, 51; and case management
group—57, 51, 44. We found no statistically significant
association between group and attrition. Participants
dropped out because of death (15), illness (19), move
(10), or no desire to be in the study (3).
There were no statistically significant associations
between attrition and type of residence, marital status,
gender, ethnicity, or health status. There was a statistically significant association between income level and
remaining in the study. Those participants in income
categories $11,064 and above were less likely to remain
in the study, whereas those participants in income
categories below $11,064 were more likely to remain in
the study, v[2] (3, N ¼ 147 ¼ 9.47, p ¼ .024.

We used repeated measures ANCOVAs to assess
significance of the main effects of time, group, and the

assumptions were met, but no statistically significant
effects were found for the CRES subscales Perceptions
of Dependence or Accepting Help, or for the Agitation
and Attitude Toward Own Aging subscales of the
PGCMS. Assumptions were met and main or interaction effects statistically significant at p, .05
were found for the CRES Relational Coping With
Caregivers and the PGCMS Lonely Dissatisfaction
subscales. Table 3 provides an abbreviated ANCOVA
summary table and also displays the unadjusted and
adjusted means and standard deviations by group for
Times 1, 2, and 3 for measures yielding statistically
significant effects. Figures 1 and 2 present the results by
group by time. Covariate-adjusted CREI group means
increased, whereas case management means decreased
or remained the same. CREI group means exceeded case
management group means at Time 3, indicating overall
gains for Relational Coping With Caregivers and the
PGCMS Lonely Dissatisfaction subscale for the treatment groups but not for the case management group.

#### Repeated Measures Analyses of Variance


Performance-Related Quality of Life but not for the
PGCMS. Table 4 displays the abbreviated analysis of
variance summary table and provides the means and
standard deviations for group by time. In these analyses, the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and
sphericity (Greenhouse–Geisser epsilon . .80) were
upheld. Figures 3 and 4 present results by group by
time. CREI group means increased over time, whereas
case management means decreased, indicating overall
gains for treatments groups in Self-Care Strategies and
Performance-Related Quality of Life with decreases for
the case management group.

#### Hypothesis Test Results


The assumption of homogeneity of regression was
violated for the CRES subscales Self-Care Strategies
and Performance-Related Quality of Life and for the
PGCMS total score. Therefore, we conducted an
alternative analysis, a repeated measures analysis of
variance (Keppel & Wickens, 2004).
We found a statistically significant Treatment
Group 3 Time interaction for Self-Care Strategies and


Hypothesis 1.—The complex comparison of combined CREI approaches (small group and individual) to
the case management approach yielded statistical
significance (p, .05) at Times 2 and 3. At Time 2,
we found statistically different differences between
CREI and case management conditions for Relational
Coping With Caregivers and Performance-Related
Quality of Life. The combined mean for the treatment
groups exceeded the mean for the case management
group. At Time 3, for Self-Care Strategies, Relational
Coping With Caregivers, and Performance-Related
Quality of Life, the combined mean for the treatment
groups exceeded the mean for the case management
group. Hypothesis 1 was partially supported, with
significant advantage to treatment for Relational

Hypothesis 2.—We found a statistically significant
difference (p, .05) between means for the small-group
versus individual CREI at Time 2 for Perceptions of
Dependence, with the mean for the small-group CREI
participants exceeding the mean for the individual


CREI participants (Mgroup ¼ 3.77, Mindividual ¼ 3.31),
indicating stronger negative views of dependence for
the small-group participants. This difference was also
significant at Time 3, with the small-group mean again
exceeding the mean for the individual CREI (Mgroup ¼
3.80, Mindividual ¼ 3.29). At Time 3, we found
a statistically significant difference between means for
the small-group versus individual CREI for Relational

(Mgroup ¼ 4.10, Mindividual ¼ 3.82). Comparisons
between the individual and small-group interventions
that yielded statistically significant results favored the
group form of the CREI except that the small-group
participants held more negative views of dependence
than the individual CREI participants.

Hypothesis 3.—We found statistically significant
(p, .05) Treatment Group 3 Time interactions
for Lonely Dissatisfaction, Self-Care Strategies, and
Performance-Related Quality of Life, yielding support
for Hypothesis 3 for those measures. Follow-up simple
effects analyses indicated statistically significant differences of time only for the CRES subscale PerformanceRelated Quality of Life (g[2] ¼ .06) for the individual
form of the CREI. For the small-group CREI, we found
statistically significant differences by time for the CRES
subscales Self-Care Strategies, Relational Coping With
Caregivers, Performance-Related Quality of Life, and
Accepting Help. Means increased from Times 1 to 3 for
Self-Care Strategies, g[2] ¼ .14; for Relational Coping
With Caregivers, g[2] ¼ .10; for Performance-Related
Quality of Life, g[2] ¼ .13; and for Accepting Help
(MTime1 ¼ 3.75, MTime2 ¼ 3.88, MTime3 ¼ 3.95; g[2] ¼ .04).
(Means by group by time are in Tables 3 and 4 or are
provided above.) We found no statistically significant
simple effects of time for the case management group.
In all cases of a significant Group 3 Time interaction,
the pattern of change over time favored the CREI


groups, whereby the means increased relative to stable
or decreasing means for the case management group.

#### Exploratory Analyses


Due to small cell sample sizes resulting from
crossing the factors time, treatment group, and type
of residence (cell ns ranged from 8 to 24), these analyses
are tentative. We gave primary attention to the threeway interaction term to see if treatment effects over
time varied by residence type. We found one statistically significant (p, .05) three-way interaction for
Performance-Related Quality of Life, with g[2] equal to
.079. Although we again found gains for the CREI
groups and not for the case management group, the
pattern of gains differed for individuals receiving care
at home, in a facility, or in their retirement community.
We found the greatest gains for CREI group participants who received care at home, whereas CREI
individual participants’ gains were greatest in a retirement community setting. Both CREI forms were
equally effective for persons in a care facility.
We conducted one further analysis with gender as an
added factor. We found no statistically significant
three-way interactions between gender, time, and
treatment group.

#### Summary of Results


We used eight subscale scores and one total score as

significant effects of the interventions for five of these:
the PGCMS Agitation and Attitude Toward Own
Aging subscales, the PGCMS total score, and the CRES
Perceptions of Dependence and Accepting Help subscales. We found statistically significant effects for the
remaining four measures: CRES Relational Coping
With Caregivers, Self-Care Strategies, and PerformanceRelated Quality of Life subscales; and PGCMS Lonely
Dissatisfaction subscale. In all cases, differences favored
the CREI—small-group and individual forms—with
moderate to large effect sizes (g[2] ¼ .05–.11). The
strongest effects of the CREI (both versions) were on
Relational Coping With Caregivers and PerformanceRelated Quality of Life. Exploratory analyses resulted
in a significant three-way interaction between type of
residence, treatment group, and time with PerformanceRelated Quality of Life as the dependent variable,
suggesting the potential for varying efficacy of CREI
form depending upon residential setting.
We found some differences between the two forms
of the CREI. In the small-group version, participants
(a) were somewhat, but not significantly, more likely to
be living in a retirement community than at home; (b)
reported significantly stronger perceptions of dependence; but also (c) had significantly more positive
scores on Relational Coping With Caregivers than did
participants in the individual version.
Differences over time indicated positive change, with
a large effect size for both forms of the CREI for
Performance-Related Quality of Life. The care receivers in the small-group CREI also demonstrated


The absence of significant effects of treatments on
two PGCMS subscales and the CRES subscale Perceptions of Dependence were in line with expectations.
Significant effects were anticipated but not found for
the PGCMS total score and for the CRES subscale
Accepting Help. The reliability of Perceptions of
Dependence and Accepting Help were lower than
reliabilities for other CRES subscales, which may
have contributed to the lack of significant findings
with respect to those two measures. Lack of significant
findings for those subscales may also simply reflect the
difficulty inherent in aging and in losing one’s independence to become dependent on others. The
PGCMS total score had adequate reliability, but it
was generated by adding scores on three subscales. For
two of those subscales, we had not expected to find any
effects; hence, we should have anticipated failure to
find significance with the total score.
We found significant effects for the CRES subscales
Relational Coping With Caregivers, Self-Care Strategies, and Performance-Related Quality of Life. With
respect to the specific objectives that guided intervention creation, the study demonstrated success
with respect to all objectives except lack of effects


significant positive change over time for the other
CRES subscales (excluding Perceptions of Dependence); and again, effect sizes were large.

#### Discussion


-----

intervention seemed successful in moving participants
toward positive action but not toward any positive
attitude toward dependence. That goal may be unrealistic.
Overall, as shown in the figures, both forms of the
CREI were effective in enhancing elderly care receivers’
self-care strategies, performance related to quality of
life, and late-life satisfaction (i.e., resulted in less
loneliness). In particular, the small-group CREI was the
most effective at improving care receivers’ self-efficacy
in the areas of relational coping with their caregivers
and performance related to quality of life. The significant differences between the outcomes of the smallgroup CREI and individual CREI were not anticipated
but were encouraging in that the group intervention is
more economical to provide. The strong effect of group
support and sharing of common issues and coping
strategies appeared to be an important factor. Twelve
months after the intervention ended, scores for the
small-group CREI showed a more positive increase
than we had expected. We had anticipated that scores
would level off or even decline, but scores for the smallgroup CREI continued to increase.
A number of limitations of this study need to be
addressed in future studies. First, the quasi-experimental
design used in this study was necessitated because some
individuals simply could not attend group meetings.
Thelimitations placedon randomassignmentresulted in
a difference in residence type across groups. Although
too small a number of cases was available in this
study to provide an adequate test, analyses indicated
that residence type may have differentially affected
outcomes of the two forms of the CREI. Future study
would ideally employ a randomized design, with sufficiently large samples to investigate the effects of factors
such as residence type, extent of need for care, length of
time care has been needed, and availability of family
member support.
A quantitative instrument to assess caregiver perceptions is needed. One overall goal of the CREI is to
improve caregiver as well as care receiver experiences.
The findings of this study, coupled with the qualitative
responses collected from participants and their caregivers, call attention to the potential of care receiver
interventions to improve quality of care as well as to
alleviate stress of caregivers. More resources and attention should be directed to assisting care receivers with
the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to be
active partners in their care. Further intervention
research is needed to implement, evaluate, and modify
the CREI with more culturally diverse care receivers,
and to more effectively address care receivers’ skills
in coping with increasing dependence. Overall, efforts
need to be made to increase policy and program


well as caregivers to enhance effective partnerships as
they engage in care process interventions. The CREI
group method can be especially effective in senior
housing facilities, senior centers, senior health clinics,
and other settings that allow easy access to older adults
who are experiencing disability and a need for personal
care. The CREI individual method can provide outreach to persons unable or unwilling to access group
settings.
