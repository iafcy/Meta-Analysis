**Background: Older adults are more vulnerable to health risks than younger people and may get**
exposed to various dangers, including elder abuse. This study aimed to design and implement
an empowerment educational intervention to prevent elder abuse.
**Methods: This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2014–2016 for 18 months**
on 464 older adults aged above 60 years who visited health houses of 22 municipalities in Tehran.
Data were collected using standard questionnaires, including the Elder Abuse-Knowledge
Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Behavior Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II,
Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle, Perceived Social Support, Perceived Self-Efficacy, Loneliness
Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the
SCARED (stress, coping, argument, resources, events, and dependence) tool. The interven­
tion was done in twenty 45- to 60-minute training sessions over 6 months. Data analysis
were performed using χ[2] tests, multiple linear and logistic regression, and structural equation
modeling (SEM).
**Results: The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support and health**
promoting lifestyle before the intervention was similar in the two groups. However, the fre­
quency of high knowledge of elder abuse (94.8% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the
control group), high self-efficacy (82.8% and 7.8%, respectively), high social support (97.0%
and 10.3%, respectively) and high health promoting lifestyle (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively)
was significantly higher (P,0.001) and the frequency of elder abuse risk (28.0% and 49.6%,
respectively) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention. SEM stan­
dardized beta (Sβ) showed that the intervention had the highest impact on increase social support
(Sβ=0.80, β=48.64, SE=1.70, P,0.05), self-efficacy (Sβ=0.76, β=13.32, SE=0.52, P,0.05)
and health promoting behaviors (Sβ=0.48, β=33.08, SE=2.26, P,0.05), respectively. The effect
of the intervention on decrease of elder abuse risk was indirect and significant (Sβ=-0.406,
β=-0.340, SE=0.03, P,0.05), and through social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting
behaviors.
**Conclusion: Educational interventions can be effective in preventing elder abuse.**
**Keywords: elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support, health promotion, health education**

## Introduction
The world’s population is rising, and the population of older adults is increasing rapidly
as well, and their health and well-being require more attention.[1] Due to physiological
and anatomical changes caused by aging, the increase in physical and mental illnesses,
social isolation due to retirement and disconnection with colleagues and friends,
reduced social activity, low income, death of relatives and friends, and being away

from children due to a number of factors, the older adults feel
more lonely and depressed than other age groups.[2] As a result,
they are more vulnerable and subject to risks. One of these
risks is elder abuse.[3] Elder abuse, along with other indices
such as life expectancy, is among the indicators of longevity
and health.[4] The World Health Organization describes elder
abuse as any action or lack of appropriate action that causes
injury or distress to an elderly person.[5,6] Elder abuse is an
indirect cause of death, and its evaluation is difficult.[7] Elder
abuse has many systemic and individual effects. Any injury
or distress to elders can result in worsening of their health
and well-being. Even minor injuries can have serious and
permanent effects on their health.[8] Elder abuse has different
forms.[9] While most people think that elder abuse is physical,
there are other types of elder abuse: psychological, financial,
and sexual abuse. Other types of harassment, such as exploi­
tation, abandonment, and neglect, have also been raised.[10]

In some forms of elder abuse, the older adults have little
or no insight into this problem or are unaware/unable to take
care of themselves.[11] Factors that affect elder abuse are sex,
age, education level, marital status, housing status, lifestyle,
social network and support, financial status, nutritional
behavior, physical activity, sleep, leisure time, and recre­
ation.[12] Some of these factors can be controlled, and some
are uncontrollable. Adopting health promoting behavior and
implementing changes in lifestyle are feasible and have an
impact on quality of life.[13]

Population aging is now an important public health issue
in Iran.[14] In the near future, Iran will face a high proportion
of elders in its population. It is estimated that the popula­
tion over .60 years in Iran in 2021 will be .10%; by
2025, the proportion aged .65 years will be 10.4%; and by
2050, this will become .20%.[15] This increase in the elder
population can cause a health crisis that the nation should be
prepared for. One crisis may be elder abuse. Elders should
be empowered against abuse by education.[13] Empowerment
is a health promotion concept and one of the strategies for
healthy aging. Research has shown that if the elderly can
equip themselves with skills and abilities that empower
them, then they can protect themselves from health threats,
including elder abuse.[16]

There is a view that empowerment education should
focus on social support, self-efficacy, and health locus of
control.[12] Social support is one of the main health indica­
tors of healthy aging and has a protective effect on disease.
Self-efficacy is also an effective factor in healthy aging and
can prevent elder abuse, along with other health promoting
behavior and social support.[2,17,18] Studies have confirmed


the importance of self-efficacy as a determinant of health
promoting behavior,[19,20] while others have confirmed the
relationship between social support and health promot­
ing behavior[20–22] and between self-efficacy and social
support.[20,23,24] The overall aim of this study was to design
and evaluate the efficacy of an educational intervention for
empowerment of the older adults, focusing on self-efficacy,
social support, and health promoting behavior, in order to
promote healthy aging and prevent elder abuse.

## Purpose
The educational intervention in this study was designed
focusing on older adult empowerment, and then its impact on
self-efficacy, social support, health promoting behavior, and
risk reduction was investigated. In addition, we investigated
relationships among demographic, socioeconomic, and life­
style factors, perceived health status, feelings of loneliness,
severity of depression, knowledge of elder abuse, health
information sources, health barriers, health locus of control,
and health promoting behavior, social support, self-efficacy,
and level of elder abuse. The main hypothesis was to find out
if the older adults that have social support and self-efficacy
have more ability to adopt health promoting behavior and
protect themselves from abuse.

## Methods Trial design
This study was a parallel randomized controlled educa­
tional trial study done on older adults. The study lasted for
18 months and was conducted in 2014–2016.

## Participants
This study was conducted on 464 older adults aged .60 years
who visited health centers in 22 municipalities of Tehran.
Inclusion criteria for the participants were being .60 years of
age, ability to speak Persian, lack of mental and psychological
problems, and being aware of place and time. People were
excluded if they did not want to participate in the study.

## Sample size
The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
education on health promoting behavior. Each relationship’s
correlation coefficient was calculated, and the number of
samples was determined based on the correlation coefficient
matrix. The weakest significant correlation was 0.2. The
sample size was determined based on Equation 1, assuming
_r=0.2, α=0.05, and β=0.2. The initial size was 193 in each_
group. Participants were selected from Tehran municipality

health centers, and the elders of each health house had some
correlated responses; therefore, the number of samples was
multiplied by 1.2. We also considered a 15% chance of loss, so
a total sample of at least 464 participants was calculated:

eight questions. This asked about transportation, linguistic,
cultural and belief barriers, health insurance, cost of living,
dependence on others, knowledge about health resources, and
preference for traditional or modern medicine. The score
range for each question was from 1 to 4. A score .20 was
considered high, and a score #20 was considered low. The
validity and reliability of this questionnaire were evaluated
and approved by the authors before use. Cronbach’s α for
this questionnaire was 0.78.

#### Health promoting lifestyle profile II
This was designed by Walker et al and comprised six
dimensions: physical activity, nutrition, spiritual growth,
interpersonal relationships, stress management, and health
responsibility.[54] The HPLP II is made up of 52 questions and
scored based on a Likert scale.[30] In this study, based on the
median score, each health promoting behavior was divided
into “desirable” and “undesirable” categories. This tool has
been translated into various languages, including Persian.
The con­tent, construct, and criterion validity of this ques­
tionnaire have been approved in Persian and the Cronbach’s
alpha was reported to be 0.84.[20,21] In this study, this validated
questionnaire was used and based on the median score, each
health-promoting behavior was divided into desirable and
undesirable categories.

#### Personal resource questionnaire 85 – part 2
This was based on Weiss et al’s social protection theory[31]
and was used to measure perceived social support. The tool
has five dimensions: intimacy, assistance, social integration,
affirmation of worth, and nurturance. It comprises 25 items
on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from “I strongly disagree”
to “I strongly agree”. The total score can be 25–175. This
tool has been translated into Farsi, and its validity and reli­
ability have been confirmed (Cronbach’s alpha =0.81).[22]
This validated questionnaire was used in the present study
and the perceived social support score was divided into two
desirable and undesirable categories based on the median
cutoff point.

#### Schwarzer & Jerusalem general self-efficacy scale
This was used to measure perceived self-efficacy.[32,33] The
questions are answered on a 4-point Likert scale: “Not
entirely correct”, “Rarely correct”, “Somewhat correct”,
and “Completely correct”. The total score can be 10–40. A
score of 10–20 indicates low self-efficacy, 20–30 average
self-efficacy, and 30–40 high self-efficacy. This questionnaire
has been translated into Persian and is valid and reliable to


## Randomization
In this study, participants were selected by two-stage clus­
ter sampling. Based on the register of health houses in the
22 districts of Tehran, of 375, 44, ie, two health houses from
each area, were selected randomly: one for the intervention
group and the other for the control group. In each health house,
from their list of older adults, 10–12 people were randomly
selected (five men and five women or six men and six women).
Eventually, 232 people were allocated to the intervention
group and 232 to the control group. The intervention and
control groups did not have any contact with each other.

## Instruments
The following questionnaires were used to gather informa­
tion in this study.

#### Demographic characteristics questionnaire
This included age, sex, marital status, education, type of
housing, financial status (stable, unstable),[25] type of health
insurance, history of chronic disease, perceived health status
(“How do you assess your overall health at the moment?”),[26]
and life companions (“Who do you live with now?”).

#### Elder abuse knowledge questionnaire
This measured the level of knowledge of participants
about elder abuse and comprised 10 questions. This was a
researcher-made questionnaire, based on Gironda et al’s[27]
and Almogue et al’s[28] questionnaires. The validity and reli­
ability of this questionnaire was evaluated and approved by
the authors of this study before use. Cronbach’s α for this
questionnaire was 0.84. The maximum score was 30. A
score #15 was considered low knowledge, and a score .15
was considered good knowledge.

#### Health barriers questionnaire
A researcher-made questionnaire was drawn from the
Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle Questionnaire[29] and comprised

use in Persian and its Cronbach’s alpha was reported to be
0.82. This validated questionnaire was used in this current
study; however, low and average self-efficacy groups were
merged and responses were divided into “desirable” and
“undesirable” categories.

#### Loneliness scale
This questionnaire was created by the University of California,
Los Angeles,[34] and consists of 20 questions. Each question has
three options: “never”, “sometimes”, and “often”. A score,35
in this questionnaire indicates a low sense of loneliness,
35–49 indicates a moderate sense of loneliness, and .50
indicates an intense sense of loneliness. This tool has been
translated and validated in Persian by Pasha and Ismaili in
2007 and its Cronbach’s alpha was reported to be 0.75.[35] This
validated questionnaire was used in the current study.

#### Geriatric depression scale
This was used to measure depression in the older adult.[34] The
questionnaire includes 15 questions with yes/no answers. A
score,5 indicates no symptoms of depression, 5–10 indi­
cates somewhat depressed, and .15 indicates moderate and
severe depression.[26 ]This questionnaire has been translated
and validated in Persian by Malakouti et al in 2006 and it
Cronbach’s alpha was reported to be 0.90.[36] This validated
questionnaire was used in the current study.

#### Health locus of control scale
This is used to measure people’s beliefs and thoughts about
the locus of control for health.[33] It examines the health locus
of control at three levels – internal, external, and chance
control – with three types: A, B, and C. In this study, type A
was used. This scale has 18 questions, of which six questions
measure internal locus of control, six questions measure
external locus of control, and six questions measure chance
locus of control. A higher score in external control and
chance control means that the individual sees his/her health
more due to chance and external factors.[33 ]Type A is used
for healthy people, and its psy­chometric properties have
been approved for use in Iran.[37] The Cronbach’s alpha of
the internal health locus of control (0.68), powerful others
health locus of control (0.72), and chance health locus of
control (0.66) subscales were moderately acceptable.[37] This
validated questionnaire was used in this study.

#### Assessment of elder at risk for abuse tool
This is a type of screening tool for identifying aged people at
risk of elder abuse and determining that risk (vulnerability) of
abuse. This tool was designed by the University of Ontario. It


consists of six questions, each measuring one construct. These
are stress level, coping, argument, resources, events, and depen­
dence (SCARED). The total score can be 6–18. A score,7
means less vulnerable, 7–11 means somewhat vulnerable, and
12–18 means highly vulnerable to elder abuse.[38] The authors of
this study translated and retranslated the original questionnaire.
The face validity and content validity of the questionnaire were
determined by expert opinion. In order to determine the internal
consistency and reliability of the questionnaire, the authors
asked 110 people to complete the questionnaire. Cronbach’s
_α for the SCARED questionnaire was 0.74._

## Data collection
A briefing was held beforehand for interviewers about how
to complete the questionnaires. The questionnaries were
completed before and after the intervention by trained
instructors through face to face interviews and were com­
pleted simultaneously in both intervention and control
groups. The questionnaires were kept confidential.

## Intervention
The educational content for reducing the risk of elder abuse
was designed based on results of the preintervention stage,
opinions of health education experts, and a health promotion
literature review. The older adults themselves also helped
design the training program and were actively involved in
setting up the program and implementing it.

The content of the educational interventions was based
on the dimensions of health promoting behavior and com­
prised physical activity, recreation and entertainment,
sleep, nutrition, interpersonal relations and social support,
responsibility for health, mental health, and older adult
stress management. These interventions were designed to
improve and identify ways to strengthen self-efficacy, raise
knowledge about elder abuse, its outcomes, risk factors,
and causes, ways to reduce and combat abuse, benefits of
health promoting behavior, barriers to conducting health
promoting behavior, methods for removing barriers, iden­
tifying sources of support, and ways to receive support. In
preparing this educational content, factors such as being
easy, comprehensive, applicable, creating motivation, and
acceptability for the older adult were considered. For each
session, a particular topic was considered. Educational
technology methods, such as lecture, question and answer,
and problem-solving, were used.

The contents of the training were provided as CD,
booklet, and pamphlet to the participants. A few short films
provided by the Iranian Health Policy Council, Ministry of
Health and Medical Education tailored to the content of the


-----

educational intervention were displayed. A number of edu­
cational messages were designed and sent to participants by
text message. The official sources used for health promot­
ing interventions included the Ministry of Health’s Healthy
_Lifestyle for Seniors: Principles of Healthy Aging booklet[39]_
and elder abuse prevention protocols.[38]

After the educational package had been finalized, the
educational intervention was performed. For each health
house, at least 20 training sessions lasting 45–60 minutes
were arranged. The total educational program took 6 months.
In total, 600 hours’ training was provided for each person.
Training was provided by health care professionals, and
classes were held in health houses. Training was based on
an adult education strategy.[17] Three months after training
was finished, the questionnaires were again completed by
the two groups.

## Outcomes
The effects of demographic factors, social support,
self-efficacy, health status, information resources, source
of control, perceived barriers, loneliness, and severity of
depression on health promoting behavior were investigated,
and then the effect of health promoting behavior on the risk
of elder abuse was estimated.

## Statistical methods
Data analysis was done using χ[2] tests using multiple regres­
sion methods. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was


also used to find direct, indirect, and total effects of each
path, as well as standardized effects. In this analysis, fit­
ness indicators – including the comparative fit index and
goodness-of-fit index (GFI) – indicating the suitability of
the model were calculated. These indicators should be .0.9.
In this research, the model for preventing the risk of elder
abuse was obtained based on the results of the initial data
analysis (Figure 1). Data were analyzed using SPSS 21 and
AMOS software, and the level of significance was,0.05.

## Ethical considerations
The project was approved by the ethics committee of the
Tehran University of Medical Sciences (code 19230)
and was registered in the Iranian Clinical Trials registry
(IRCT2013070813904N1). Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. All information remained con­
fidential. Participants were able to withdraw at any time.

## Results
The mean age of participants was 65.9±3.6 years. The major­
ity were married (57.3%) and had an educational degree
less than a high school diploma (75.2%). Also, 57.3%
(266 people) lived with their spouse and children. Regarding
the question “How do you assess your health in the present?”,
most reported that their health status was excellent (63.4%).
The distribution of the demographic, social, economic, and
clinical characteristics of the intervention and control groups
was similar before the intervention (Table 1).

The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy,
social support, health promoting behavior, and risk of elder
abuse before the intervention was similar in the two groups.
However, frequency of these variables in two groups was
significantly different after intervention (P,0.001). Most
of those in the intervention group received a more favorable
score than the control group after intervention (Table 2).

The effect of educational intervention on self-efficacy,
social support, and health promoting behavior (after inter­
vention) and after control for variables before the interven­
tion (sex, age, marital status, educational level, housing
ownership, financial status, life structure, history of chronic
illness, insurance, date of last referral to a physician, health
status, information resources, health barriers, depression rate,
loneliness, health locus of control, and amount of knowledge
of elder abuse) was estimated using backward logistic and
linear regression analyses.

The results of logistic and linear regression showed that
there was a significant relationship between self-efficacy
and health promoting behavior (after the intervention) with

receiving the intervention, age, and education. Also, in the
logistic model, social support (after the intervention) showed
a significant relationship with intervention, sex, and health
status (Table 3). These significant variables entered SEM. As
such, the primary model of self-efficacy, health promoting
behavior and social support in preventing the risk of elder


abuse was modified (Figure 2). For each path, the unstan­
dardized coefficient was calculated. Positive and negative
signs for each path indicated that for a 1-unit increase in each
variable, the other variable’s score increased or decreased.
The GFI of the original SEM model was tested. GFI of 0.79
and incremental fit index of 0.78 indicated the fitness of
the model. The standardized coefficients (Sβ) of the model
showed that the effect of the intervention was primarily
on social support (Sβ=0.80, β=48.64, SE=1.70) than on
self-efficacy (Sβ=0.76, β=13.32, SE=0.52) and ultimately
health promoting behavior (Sβ=0.48, β=33.08, SE=2.26)
(Figure 2).

The adjusted SEM model for the prevention of elder
abuse was fitted again after removing insignificant variables.
The final SEM model is presented in Figure 3. The GFI of
the final model was tested, and the indicators GFI of 0.9 and
incremental fit index of 0.91 showed good fit. The results of
the final model showed that receiving intervention, perceived
health status, educational level, social support, and selfefficacy had an indirect effect on the risk of elder abuse. The
intervention did not directly affect the risk of elder abuse, but
this variable directly affected self-efficacy and social support,
and these affected health promoting behavior. The effect of
intervention on decrease of elder abuse risk was indirect and
significant (Sβ=-0.406, β=-0.340, SE=0.03, P,0.05), and
through social support, self-efficacy, and health-promoting

## Discussion
Various types of interventions have been designed and
implemented with a variety of strategies, including edu­
cational, supportive, and legal strategies, for addressing
the problem of elder abuse.[40] In general, interventions in
the area of primary or secondary prevention of elder abuse
are divided into two broad categories. The first of these
is interventions that are aimed at reducing the burden of
abuse on the older adults and improving their health. These
interventions are known as “elder-centered” strategies for
empowering the elderly by using health promoting strategies,
such as social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting
behavior. The focus of this current study was on the design


and implementation of these interventions. The second cat­
egory of interventions is empowerment of the staff of health
centers and organizations related to the health of the older
adults in the area of primary prevention, in order to reduce
the risk of elder abuse.[41]

The focus of this current study was on the design and
implementation of the first category interventions. In this
study, knowledge in the field of elder abuse, self-efficacy,
perceived social support, and health promoting behavior
significantly improved in the intervention group. The results
of this study are consistent with other studies that showed
that educational interventions can be effective in improving
elders’ abuse-related knowledge,[27,28,42–45] and intervention
programs for prevention of elder abuse can lead to short-term
improvements in the level of knowledge of the older adult
in the field of elder abuse.

In this study, the self-efficacy score in the intervention
group significantly increased, though self-efficacy scores in
the two groups were mostly at an undesirable level before
the interven­tion. Self-efficacy was used to increase health
promoting behavior and to develop behavioral changes in the
prevention of elder abuse in the target group. Self-efficacy
directly promotes health promoting behavior through effi­
cient expectations and indirectly affects planned behavioral
change by influencing perceived barriers.[46] Self-efficacy is an
important factor in interventions aimed at changing unhealthy
behavior and creating and maintaining healthy behavior.
A person can make a behavioral change only if they believe
that they are able to change.[19,47]

Score for perceived social support for elder abuse risk
reduction increased in the intervention group. These results
are consistent with other studies that showed that educational
interventions are effective in improving perceived social
support for the older adult.[47,48] Social support is the strongest
coping force to successfully cope with chronic diseases and
stressful living conditions.[48,49] Social protection has two
levels: understanding support and getting it. Among older
people, understanding social support is more important than
getting it. In many cases, there are social support resources,
such as the family and the community, but the older adults do
not receive favorable support for a variety of reasons, as they
do not realize that they need help and should get help from
someone. Several factors, such as cultural beliefs and elders’
beliefs, affect the understanding of their need for social sup­
port. Thinking about having independence and not imposing
oneself on others are among the mental beliefs of the older
adult and the most important obstacle to understanding their
need for social support. If elderly people find themselves in
situations requiring support and seek social support, then
they will suffer less, because social support reduces their
stress and improves their mental health.[50,51] Research has
shown that older people with more social support have better
mental health.[12]

Health promoting behavior in terms of decreasing the
risk of elder abuse was significantly higher in the group that
received intervention. Health promoting behavior is among
the major determinants of health and is directly associated
with the prevention of disease.[12] In order to cope with elder
abuse, the elderly must have physical, psychological, and
social well-being. In numerous studies, it has been proven
that the adoption of health promoting behavior increases the
quality of physical and mental health and reduces susceptibil­
ity to elder abuse.[12]

The intervention caused a significant increase in selfefficacy, social support, and health promoting behavior.


The SEM showed that the effects of educational interven­
tions on perceived social support, self-efficacy, and health
promoting behavior were not the same. Interventions had a
greater impact on social protection than self-efficacy or health
promoting behavior. This finding is very important, because
it shows that in designing interventions to create behavioral
changes, perceived social support and self-efficacy should
be considered as important factors.

The final SEM model also showed that people with
higher self-efficacy had a higher chance of understanding and
gaining social support, and this resulted in more behavioral
changes. The results of this study are consistent with other
studies[13,31] that showed that those who had more efficacy and
perceived and received social support were more likely to
change behavior. Another finding from the present study was
that interventions are effective in reducing the risk of elder
abuse in the older adult, and the risk score among the older
adult in the intervention group decreased after the interven­
tion. The coefficients of SEM showed that the path coefficient
of health promoting behavior to elder abuse risk was -0.01;
and for every 1-unit increase in health promoting behavior
score, the average risk of elder abuse decreased by 0.01.

The SEM model showed that the effect of interventions
on elder abuse was indirectly and significantly determined
through social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting
behavior. However, the impact of health promoting behavior
on the risk of elder abuse was direct. In other words, older
adults can protect themselves against the threats of elder
abuse if they have health promoting behavior and the older
adults who take care of their health and get through life better
than others. This conclusion is consistent with the findings
of other studies.[52,53]

The results of this study show a model for prevention of
elder abuse. The GFI of the model was also tested statisti­
cally and showed its relevance. Most likely, this is the first
research to use SEM to reduce the risk of elder abuse. The
use of conceptual frameworks and planning to understand the
factors associated with reducing the risk of elder abuse plays
an important role in improving the quality of interventions.
A limitation was that there was no follow-up to examine
the long-term effects of the intervention on quality of life
or health status of the target group. Other limitations of this
study are lack of blinding, probable social desirability bias,
volunteer bias, selection bias, and limited international and
external validity of the findings.

## Conclusion
The increasing number of older adults and changes in cul­
ture, household structure, and lifestyle have increased the


-----

incidence of misconduct and elder abuse. Therefore, we
need more understanding of the reasons for elder abuse and
accurate planning for preventing it. In Iran, due to the cultural
and religious context in which respect for older adults is
emphasized, families are the most important and the original
providers of emotional and psychological care for the older
adult. For this reason, it is likely that in the absence of gov­
ernment attention and support, families are under pressure
and experience trouble, which may increase the likelihood
of elder abuse. The results of this study indicate a positive
and significant effect of intervention based on empowerment
of the elderly in improving health promoting behavior and
reducing the risk of elder abuse. Therefore, organized and
short-term training courses on elder abuse, risk factors, and
methods for reducing it for all age groups can be effective
in preventing this phenomenon. It is recommended that
educational interventions for the prevention of elder abuse
be started before reaching an advanced age. In addition,
interventions focusing on the health system should be con­
sidered, in order to empower employees of health centers
and organization in preventing elder abuse. Interventions
focused on the health services system can sensitize health
care providers, encourage them to do routine examinations,
and design and implement management protocols for the
older adult.
