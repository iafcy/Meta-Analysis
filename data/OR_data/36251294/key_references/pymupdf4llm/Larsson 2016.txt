### Abstract Introduction: Restraints and changes in social activities might contribute to loneliness and health decline for older adults. To
reduce loneliness and support activities, social internet-based interventions are indicated to be effective. The aim of this study was
to evaluate the effects of a social internet-based intervention for older adults who are vulnerable to loneliness.
### Method: An explorative, randomised, crossover study with an AB/BA sequence was completed. The intervention was conducted
over a period of three months. Thirty participants were included (24 women and six men, 61–89 years old) and allocated to two
groups. Data were collected at three time points. The primary outcome was the UCLA loneliness scale, and the secondary outcomes
were satisfaction with social contacts and social interaction skills. Statistical analyses were conducted with the paired t-test,
Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test and repeated-measures analysis of variance.
### Results: Loneliness was significantly decreased in both groups post intervention, and satisfaction with social contacts online
significantly increased in one group. Significant treatment effects were detected for all outcomes.
### Conclusion: The results of the social internet-based intervention programme are promising, but further evaluations are needed.

## Introduction

Health decline among older adults can originate from
experiences of loneliness (Adams et al., 2004). Loneliness
is evident for older adults in the Western world, and influenced by cultural differences (De Jong-Gierveld and
Havens, 2004). In Sweden, the prevalence of reported loneliness is more than 7% among older adults, and it increases
with age (Yang and Victor, 2011). Considering loneliness as
an actual threat to health, the exploration of intervention
programmes with the potential to reduce or prevent loneliness is critical (O’Luanaigh and Lawlor, 2008). Research
has shown that older adults perceive that their social contacts and participation in activities can be supported and
improved by social internet-based activities (SIBAs;
Larsson et al., 2013; Nyman and Isaksson, 2015).

## Literature review

Loneliness can emanate from several restraints or
alterations in social contacts and activities such as becoming a retiree, living alone (Mullins et al., 1991), entering
widowhood (Dahlberg et al., 2015) or being afflicted by
reduced mobility and social interaction skills (CohenMansfield and Parpura-Gill, 2007). As the restraints and


alterations in social contacts are experienced differently by
individuals (Stanley et al., 2010), loneliness is defined as a
subjective experience of lacking satisfying social contacts
(Peplau and Perlman, 1982).
Accordingly, it is indicated that participation in
internet-based activities and the use of SIBAs in interventions for older adults might reduce experiences of loneliness (Ballantyne et al., 2010; Cotten et al., 2013; Tsai and
Tsai, 2011). SIBAs could be used to include seniors in the
internet-based society, to support online social contacts
and to complement social contacts outside the internet
(Lelkes, 2013). However, to reduce loneliness more

effectively using SIBAs and the internet, research has
emphasised the importance of using individual adapted
programmes (Aarts et al., 2014), rather than general, predefined internet introduction programmes. Consequently,
the intervention programme should be client centred
(Hammell, 2001) to support older adults more efficiently
to be active and independent in preventing loneliness
(Stanley et al., 2010). However, such a programme for
older adults has not yet been sufficiently explored in previous research.
Therefore, a multiple case study was conducted prior
to this study in order to explore a social internet-based
intervention programme (Larsson et al., 2013) for socially
vulnerable older adults (vulnerability is understood as
self-reported loneliness, reduced social contacts and/or
social activities). The results show that the intervention
programme is promising for reducing loneliness and supporting participation in social activities. More research is
required to determine the intervention effects of the social
internet-based intervention programme. Therefore, the
aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a social
internet-based intervention for older adults who are vulnerable to loneliness.

## Method

The method follows the CONSORT (2010) statements for
non-pharmacological treatment interventions, and a modified CONSORT flow chart (Figure 1) shows the crossover
design of the study.

## Study design

An explorative study with a two-period crossover design
(AB/BA) was conducted. The crossover design traditionally includes a washout period in which the participants
are observed until measures equal to baseline values are
reached (Wang et al., 2006). A washout period was not
applicable in this study because of the educational feature
of the intervention in which the knowledge was expected
to be sustained, as well as because of a lack of research
regarding estimation of the correct washout period length
(previously applied by Prosperini et al., 2013). Despite the
omission of a washout period, the crossover design was
chosen based on the ethical benefits, as all participants
were offered the intervention.
After enrolment, the participants received an initial pretest at measurement point one (T1; Figure 1). The participants were then randomised to one of the following
sequences: I/C (intervention period/control period) or
C/I (control period/intervention period). Group 1 (I/C)
received the intervention for the first three months and
then crossed over to the control group for three additional
months. For group 2 (C/I), the periods were reversed.
During the control periods, no additional intervention was
offered to the participants in the study. Measurement
point two (T2) followed the first three months for both
groups, and measurement point three (T3) followed the
final intervention and control period. The study lasted

34 weeks, including the measurement points (T1, T2
and T3).

## Power analysis

The power analysis was based on one of the secondary
outcomes, the Evaluation of Social Interaction Skills
(ESI; Fisher and Griswold, 2013) because standard error
(SE) and mean values for a normal sample of older adults
were provided. The pre–post mean value in a group of
adults was 0.34 logits (Simmons and Griswold, 2010),
although two SE values were used to minimise the risk
of errors, resulting in a mean difference of 0.30. Using
the standard deviation (SD) of the sample of older
adults in the ESI database (equal to 0.38) provided an
effect size of 0.79 (0.30/0.38 ¼ 0.79). A power of 0.8 was
selected, and a sample of 25 participants was anticipated
to be sufficient for the statistical analysis (Lipsey and
Hurley, 2009).

## Participants and randomisation

To enrol participants, information regarding the study and
contact details was announced on bulletin boards and in
local daily newspapers in a mid-sized northern city in
Sweden. Older adults who were interested in participating
could contact the project leaders via email or telephone.
The inclusion criteria were: (a) living in ordinary housing
with no home care services, (b) aged 60 years old or older,
(c) retired, (d) reporting experiences of loneliness, (e)
reporting decreased social contacts and/or decreased participation in social activities, (f) internet users (including
email) and (h) having a computer with Internet access at
home. The exclusion criteria were: (a) regular participation in SIBAs such as Facebook and Skype, (b) inability to
communicate verbally and/or in writing and (c) inability to
receive individual support in their homes due to geographical distance. During the two-month recruitment period,
the older adults’ eligibility was assessed by the project
leader during individual phone calls. Eighteen older
adults were excluded based on the established criteria
(Figure 1). Finally, 30 older adults (24 women and six
men aged 61–89 years) were enrolled, and the majority
were single and/or were widows/widowers (Table 1).
At recruitment, the participants received verbal and
written information about the study and its purpose and
about their right to withdraw at any time. Before the initiation of the study, all participants signed a voluntary
consent letter.
The 30 participants were randomised using a computerised programme. The first author wrote in the sequence
boundaries (1–24, 25–30) for randomisation, and the participants were stratified according to sex. The numbers
were then randomly assigned into two groups by one
employee who was working at the same department as
the research group (not otherwise included in the study).
The first author then received a preset list from a second
employee (within the research group) with a number for

each participant that revealed each participant’s group
enrolment.
During the study, two participants dropped out:
woman from group 1 (I/C) and one man from group 2
(C/I). The reasons given for withdrawal were a lack of
time and no need for the intervention. One male participated only in the measurement periods but not in the
intervention, and one female did not participate in the
last month of her intervention period. These two participants were not considered as dropouts, thereby supporting
future comparisons to studies in which not all participants
comply with the intervention plans.


## The individually adapted SIBA intervention

The intervention programme (Larsson et al., 2013) was
based on the client-centred approach described in the
Occupational Therapy Intervention Process Model
(OTIPM; Fisher, 2009). The focus of the intervention
programme was to support individually adapted and
goal-directed participation in SIBAs. The intervention
programme combines individual and group meetings,
including in-home support and remote support via the
internet or telephone. The programme characteristics
include a description of the frame (that is, the time and

place of the intervention) and the content (that is, preset
actions and individual tasks; Table 2). In the frame, an
hour and a half is set as the maximum time for each
meeting (in groups and individually). The individual
meetings are offered weekly, and the frequency and
type of support (in home or remotely) are adapted to
the participants’ needs for support, and can therefore
take place more frequently for some participants. The
group meetings are offered every second week. The programme content includes pre-decided actions for the
occupational therapists, for example to establish a collaborative relationship initially (described in the
OTIPM), as well as pre-decided tasks and individually
adapted goal-directed tasks for the participants (see
Table 2 for examples). Goal achievements are not evaluated in this article because of the large volume of data
available, but the goals could include finding a new
friend with the same interests or learning how to participate in debates using SIBAs.
In total, three part-time occupational therapists (two
per intervention period) provided the intervention. They
worked in parallel and were responsible for six to eight
participants each per intervention period. The occupational therapists had previous experience of working
with older adults, and prior to the intervention, they
attended a two-day course on how to apply the intervention programme.

## Data collection

An external rater who was blinded to group allocation and
was trained to administer all of the measurements performed all data collection during the three measurement
points (T1, T2 and T3). At T1, baseline characteristics
were collected, and initial evaluations of the primary and
secondary outcomes were conducted. At T2 and T3, the
primary and secondary outcomes were re-evaluated.

### Baseline characteristics. At baseline, information was collected on the participants’ age, educational level, living
arrangements, frequency of email use and participation
in other social activities. Moreover, computer-related
skills were evaluated using the Assessment of ComputerRelated Skills (ACRS; Fischl and Fisher, 2007), an observational tool that evaluates 37 skills required for computer
and Internet use. The ACRS information was only used to
describe the target group, not for pre–post comparisons.

### Primary outcome. The primary outcome was self-reported
loneliness, measured using the UCLA loneliness scale
(Russell, 1996), which has been found to be valid and reliable when used for groups of older adults and in intervention studies (Cattan et al., 2005). For this study, a Swedish
version of the UCLA loneliness scale that was previously
translated by Engelberg and Sjo¨ berg (2005) was used. The
scale contains 20 questions graded on a four-step scale,
where 1 ¼ never, 2 ¼ rarely, 3 ¼ sometimes and 4 ¼ always.
Nine questions are reversed before the answers are graded.
The scores are summarised to yield a total score ranging
from 20 to 80. A higher total score indicates a higher
degree of loneliness (20�34 ¼ low, 35�49 ¼ moderate,
50�64 ¼ moderately high and 65�80 ¼ high experiences
of loneliness; Perry, 1990).

### Secondary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were satisfaction with social contacts online and offline, which were
measured using the visual analogue scales (VASs) from the
Social Network Online and Offline (SN) questionnaire
(Larsson et al., 2013). The scales ranged from 0 ¼ not
satisfied to 10 ¼ very satisfied. The ESI (Fisher and
Griswold, 2013) was used to observe and rate the quality
of 27 social interaction skills when participating in social
activities offline. The performance quality was rated using
a four-step scale, where 1 ¼ severely limited,
2 ¼ ineffective, 3 ¼ questionable and 4 ¼ competent. The
measurement is valid to use for groups of older adults
(Simmons et al., 2010). The ESI software (ESI, 2015)
uses the Rasch measurement model to transform ordinal
data into interval data, generating a measure (in logits) of
the quality in social interaction skills for each person. The
age normative limits (�2 SD) for each age group are: 60–
69 years old, 1.3 logits; 70–79 years old, 1.0 logits; and 80
years old and older, 0.8 logits (Fisher and Griswold, 2013).

differences, the paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank
test was used (for linear or ordinal data, respectively).
In addition to the comparison of pre- and post-test
intervention scores, a calculation of the percentage
change was added, which is a comparison of the mean
change between the measurement points (T2–T1 and
T3–T1). To assess whether the intervention effects
were sustained for three months post intervention (no
significant difference between T3 and T2 for group 1 [I/
C]), the Bonferroni post hoc test was used. The sustainability test was not applicable for group 2 (C/I) because
they were not followed up after three months. With
repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA),
differences within and between subjects were compared
using the measurement points (T1, T2 and T3) and the
group allocations (group 1 [I/C], group 2 [C/I]), respectively. A time–treatment interaction analysis was applied
to assess the treatment effect at T3. The result of this
analysis is referred to as the time effect. Possible covariates of the main outcome (age, educational level and
living arrangements) were included in the RMANOVA. The analyses were conducted using IBM
SPSS Statistics for Windows v22.0 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY). A p-value of � 0.05 was set to detect significant changes.


## Results
 Baseline characteristics

Baseline differences between the two groups were controlled
for; no significant differences were found for loneliness
(p ¼ 0.464), satisfaction with social contacts online
(p ¼ 0.705), satisfaction with social contacts offline
(p ¼ 0.273) or ESI (p ¼ 0.285). No differences were detected
for the living arrangement (p ¼ 0.690) or educational level
(p ¼ 0.512), but a significant difference was found for age
(p ¼ 0.047; group 1 [I/C] had a higher mean age, including
participants older than 80 years of age). At baseline, 87% of
the participants partook in social activities offline once per
week or more frequently, and 70% used email once a week
or more frequently (for more details, see Table 1). The
ACRS observations at baseline indicated that the most
challenging skills for the participants (displayed by inefficient and/or deficient skills for 93% of the participants)
were adapting their performance and modifying their
behaviour while using computers and the internet.

both groups (group 1 [I/C] p ¼ 0.003; group 2 [C/I] p ¼ 0.049).
Satisfaction with social contacts online was significantly
improved post intervention for group 2 (C/I; p ¼ 0.05), and
no change was detected for group 1 (I/C; p ¼ 0.266; Table 3).
No significant differences for satisfaction with social contacts
offline post intervention were detected (group 1 [I/C]
p ¼ 0.451; group 2 [C/I] p ¼ 0.074). Analysis of the ESI measurement by a paired t-test showed that the participants’ social
interaction skills were significantly lowered post intervention
for group 1 (I/C; p ¼ 0.007), but no change was detected for
group 2 (C/I; p ¼ 0.210; Table 3). Because of the negative
trend in social interaction skills for one group, the ESI data
were further explored using a box plot. Outliers in the data
were found but were not removed due to the already small
size of the sample.
The Bonferroni post hoc test showed that the intervention effects for all variables (loneliness, p ¼ 1.000; satisfaction with social contacts online, p ¼ 0.499; satisfaction
with social contacts offline, p ¼ 0.165; and ESI measurement, p ¼ 0.393) were sustained for group 1 (I/C) three
months post intervention, as no significant changes were
detected for the already established effects.

## Comparisons among measurement points T1, T2 and T3


RM-ANOVA showed no interaction between the intervention and group allocation (group 1 [I/C] vs group 2

[C/I]), indicating that the sequence (AB vs BA) had no
effect on the intervention. The time-treatment interaction
analysis (time effect) showed significant treatment effects
for all variables (experiences of loneliness: F ¼ 13.156,
p < 0.001; satisfaction with social contacts online:
F ¼ 13.159, p < 0.001; satisfaction with social contacts offline: F ¼ 11.723, p < 0.001; and ESI measurement:
F ¼ 3.375, p ¼ 0.050; Table 3). The F-statistic is the ratio
between within-subject variation (intervention effect) and
error variation (random/unsystematic differences). A large
F-statistic yields a correspondingly small p-value, suggesting that there is a large variation in means between the
measurement points over time. When age, educational
level and living arrangement were added to the model,
the treatment effect remained unchanged.

## Discussion and implications


The results indicate that the individually adapted SIBA
intervention programme for socially vulnerable older
adults has the potential to reduce experiences of loneliness.
The intervention effects were sustained post intervention,
which was expected and desired as part of the goal of the
programme. As previous research indicated a relationship
between health and loneliness (O’Luanaigh and Lawlor,
2008), the results from this study indicate that the SIBA
intervention has the potential to be used by occupational
therapists in health-promotive actions for older adults.
The occupational therapists’ ability to work in a clientcentred way, to tailor the intervention to the individual
(that is, level of independence and time needed to learn)

and to support meaningful goal-directed online activities
(Larsson et al., 2013) might have influenced the positive
results. Previous studies have identified that the frequency
or time online cannot entirely explain or support a reduction in loneliness (Aarts et al., 2014). Furthermore, the
implementation of the intervention can be facilitated by
collaborating with several actors in society (for example,
senior organisations, professionals in health care and
other establishments), which could help to reduce
demands on health care. However, due to the explorative
study design, the results should be interpreted with
caution.
In this study, the majority of participants were women
living alone, who represent a group indicated to be more
vulnerable to loneliness (Dahlberg et al., 2015). Despite
this characteristic of our study population, none of the
participants reported high levels of loneliness at baseline
according to the loneliness scale, indicating that the
intervention was tested on a group with low to moderate
levels of loneliness. Therefore, continuing to explore the
applicability and effects of the programme for
older adults with different levels of loneliness, especially
for those with high experiences of loneliness, is
important.
The secondary outcome, satisfaction with social contacts online, was significantly improved for one group
post intervention, but no significant change was detected
for satisfaction with social contacts offline. However, at
T3, the treatment effect was significantly improved for satisfaction with social contacts both online and offline.
Previous research has highlighted that satisfaction with
social contacts and high-quality social relationships can
decrease loneliness (Routasalo et al., 2006; Stanley et al.,
2010). Therefore, the results from this study, indicating
that satisfaction online and offline has improved over
time, are promising but still very preliminary. The inconclusive results of this study related to satisfaction with
social contact could be due to the high baseline values in
the groups, indicating less possibility for improvement.
Consequently, satisfaction with social contacts should be
controlled for in forthcoming studies. Additionally, privacy and technological issues that are known to limit successful use of internet-based activities (Nef et al., 2013)
must also be controlled for and recognised as factors
that can affect the establishment of and satisfaction with
friendships via the internet.
Social interaction skills (measured by the ESI) were
assumed to be related to participation in SIBAs.
However, one group unexpectedly displayed decreased
social interaction skills during the intervention. This
result must be considered and followed up in future studies. A possible explanation for the decrease in social
interaction skills includes unreported diagnoses (that is,
depression and cognitive decline), as that could affect
social interaction skills and must be evaluated accordingly
(Fisher and Griswold, 2013).
This explorative study, which included a small sample
size, can form the basis for future larger, controlled studies
and robust power calculations (Devane et al., 2004).


The strengths of this study include the randomisation
strategy and the use of an external rater who evaluated
the study outcomes. An additional strength is that the
occupational therapists who provided the intervention
were not otherwise included in the study and were not
biased by expectations of the study outcome. However,
as no alternative intervention was offered during the control periods, the effects might have been biased by the
attention received by the participants from the intervening
occupational therapists. To isolate the effects of the individual approach applied in this programme, a comparison
study with a general predefined intervention programme
should be conducted. Consequently, if an alternative intervention or no intervention had been provided to one of the
groups, the validity of the study might have been
strengthened.

## Conclusion

The present study indicates that this individually adapted
SIBA intervention programme has the potential to reduce
experiences of loneliness in socially vulnerable older
adults. If occupational therapists embrace this SIBA intervention programme, their readiness to support seniors
in the technological changing society might be enhanced.
To advance the applicability of the intervention programme, further randomised controlled studies should be
conducted.

### Key findings

. The SIBA intervention programme is client-centred,
individually adapted and goal directed to support the
participation of seniors in SIBAs.
. The SIBA intervention programme shows evidence of
reducing older adults’ experiences of loneliness.

### What the study has added

This study adds knowledge about the social effects from
participation in the client-centred, individually adapted
SIBA intervention programme and the need to use such
programmes in a more technology-based society.
