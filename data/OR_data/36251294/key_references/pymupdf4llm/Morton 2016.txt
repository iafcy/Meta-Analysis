**Abstract**
**Objective: Guided by theoretical and empirical work attesting to the health**
benefits of social connections, we tested whether Internet connectivity, and
training in its use for social purposes, can support the well-being of older
adults receiving care. Method: Participants (N = 76) were randomly assigned
to receive 3 months training versus care-as-usual. Cognitive and mental
health were assessed before and after the intervention. **Results: Results**
show significant cognitive improvements across time in the training, but not
control, group. This effect was mediated through a combination of increased
social activity, improved self-competence, and maintained personal identity
strength. Indirect effects on mental health outcomes via these processes
were also observed. Discussion: These findings suggest that Internet access
and training can support the self and social connectedness of vulnerable
older adults and contribute positively to well-being.

**Keywords**
computers, Internet, social connections, cognitive capacity, well-being

Social connections benefit cognitive, emotional, and physical health (e.g.,
Berkman & Syme, 1979; Boden-Albala, Litwak, Elkind, Rundek, & Saco,
2005; Cohen, Doyle, Skoner, Rabin, & Gwaltney, 1997; Cruwys et al., 2013;
Holt-Lunstad, Smith, Baker, Harris, & Stephenson, 2015; House, Landis, &
Umberson, 1988). Aging can contribute to social isolation and increase vulnerability to its negative effects (e.g., Hawkley, Masi, Berry, & Cacioppo,
2006; Ong, Rothstein, & Uchino, 2012). Because of this, finding ways to
support the social relationships of older adults should be a priority for those
concerned with their well-being (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2007). Internet connectivity offers a creative way to increase older adults’ social connectivity,
and through this to support their well-being (e.g., Mason, Sinclair, & Berry,
2012). Yet, evidence for the effectiveness of this strategy is inconclusive,
perhaps due to an insufficient focus on the social uses of technology, and on
the challenges involved in supporting older adults to access these. The current study targets these challenges.

## Internet Use, Health, and Well-Being Among Older Adults

Longitudinal data link older adult’s Internet use to reduced depression,
improved cognitive capacity, and better health behavior (Cotten, Ford, Ford,
& Hale, 2014; Xavier et al., 2013, 2014). But, other research finds limited
benefits of online compared with face-to-face interaction (Helliwell &
Huang, 2013), and that increased online social activity can predict subsequently _reduced well-being (Kross et al., 2013), raising the concern that_
online social interaction might come at the expense of more important offline
interactions. However, the depression-reducing benefits of older adults’
Internet use amplify among those in smaller versus larger households (Cotten
et al., 2014), suggesting that Internet use can compensate, rather than detract
from, offline networks.
A similarly mixed pattern is evident in the experimental literature.
Inducing online social activity might reduce younger adults’ loneliness
(Deters & Mehl, 2013). However, interventions that introduce older adults to
computers and online networking suggest few reliable consequences.
Although early studies of this kind were promising (McConatha, McConatha,
Deaner, & Dermigny, 1995), larger scale, better controlled, studies have


-----

found no discernible benefits for cognitive and mental well-being or social
engagement (e.g., Slegers, van Boxtel, & Jolles, 2008; White et al., 2002;
Woodward et al., 2011).
When interpreting this evidence, it should also be noted that the majority
of interventions targeting older adults were conducted prior to (McConatha
et al., 1995; White et al., 2002), or only on the cusp of (Slegers et al., 2008),
the expansion of online social networking capabilities (i.e., “Web 2.0”). Their
methods also suggest that training was directed toward proficiency in computer use, rather than using computers as social tools (Woodward et al., 2011,
is an exception). Computers have also become increasingly customizable to
different needs and capacities, including those of older adults. In light of
these issues, further investigation of the benefits of socially focused, “agefriendly,” Internet and computer training seems warranted. This was the primary aim of the current study.

## Interventions Targeting Social Participation Among Older Adults

The current study was informed by a growing body of research, inspired by
prominent social-psychological theories of group membership, which attests
to the value of socially targeted interventions among older populations
(Jetten, Haslam, Haslam, Dingle, & Jones, 2014). Recent studies show that
the well-being benefits of a range of ordinary activities (e.g., Gleibs, Haslam,
Haslam, & Jones, 2011; Haslam et al., 2014; Knight, Haslam, & Haslam,
2010) are enhanced when activities are group-based rather than individualized (see Jetten, Haslam, & Haslam, 2012), thereby allowing the development of meaningful social connections. This work particularly points to the
role of group participation in supporting individual identity (i.e., knowing
“who I am”) as a key mechanism through which positive health effects flow
(e.g., Jetten, Haslam, Pugliese, Tonks, & Haslam, 2010; Jones et al., 2011).
Similarly, we expected effects of Internet provision and training to be
maximized when these focused on social engagement, rather than the mere
acquisition of computer skills—although, consistent with other theories of
the self and psychological functioning, we expected that increased competencies, as well as connectedness, would contribute positively to well-being (in
line with self-determination theory; for example, Reis, Sheldon, Gable,
Roscoe, & Ryan, 2000). In addition to these mechanisms, we anticipated that
the sense of identity that social participation supports might also be important
for explaining well-being benefits. Testing these possible mediating pathways was the second aim of this research.

## The Current Research

We tested the potential for age-friendly computer and Internet provision, and
training on its use _for social purposes, to enhance the well-being of older_
adults. In spite of the weak evidence from previous studies, we expected to
find benefits of training not just on indicators of individual skills acquisition
and competency but also on social engagement, identity, and, through these,
individual well-being outcomes.
We were also interested in the degree to which benefits might differ depending on the individual’s immediate social context (i.e., following Cotten et al.,
2014). All participants were recruited through a care organization, but approximately half were in residential care, whereas the other half were supported in the
community. We expected the benefits of the intervention to be most evident
among those who were previously most isolated, and we reasoned that those
receiving care in their own home might display greater risk of this. Although
those living in residential care should be worse off in terms of individual health
(reflecting their enhanced care needs), they also have easier access to a community of others and structured social activity to facilitate connections with these.

## Method

 Participants

One hundred twenty-one clients of a large not-for-profit care organization
(78 female, aged 60 to 95 years) agreed to take part in the study. Participants
were receiving care in their own home/supported housing in the community
(henceforth “domiciliary care”), or residential care in one of the organization’s 26 care homes.
Care staff identified potential participants who were (a) willing to be
engaged for a period of 4 months, (b) had the space and infrastructure for
Internet use (i.e., a phone connection and a table that could accommodate the
computer package), and (c) had sufficient cognitive ability to engage with the
training. The latter was initially based on a six-item screener (Callahan,
Unverzagt, Hui, Perkins, & Hendrie, 2002), subsequently confirmed by the
Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975), on
which potential participants were required to score ≥ 19 out of 30.[1] We limited participation to individuals who did not currently have Internet access.
The only advertised rewards for participation were receiving temporary use
of a computer and training package (experimental group), or going into a lottery to win one of two computer packages (control group).
Following initial recruitment, 22 participants withdrew before baseline
assessment. A further 23 withdrew before follow-up assessment. Participant

numbers and reasons.
_Note. CONSORT = consolidated standards of reporting trials._

flow is summarized in Figure 1. Seventy-six participants completed baseline
and follow-up assessments. The majority (50) were women (M age = 80.71;
_SD = 8.77) and were widowed (60%), single (15%), or divorced (9%), with_
only 15% being currently married. The mean age at leaving full-time education was 15.34 years. Participants were distributed across residential (n = 32)
and domiciliary care (n = 44; mean approximate length of care = 5.68 years;
_SD = 8.71). The majority (75%) of the latter lived alone._

## Design

The study followed a 2 (condition: training, control) × 2 (population: domiciliary, residential) × 2 (time: baseline, follow-up) design. After baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to either a training or care-as-usual
control group. Stratified randomization was used within domiciliary and residential participants to ensure balanced allocation to condition. Trained


-----

research assistants verbally administered assessments. Ethical approval was
given by the University of Exeter.

## The Training Package

The training group received a customized computer platform with a simplified touch-screen interface (“EasyPC”) and any necessary broadband infrastructure (i.e., modem, cables, etc.). Participants kept this for 12 months,
which included the training period, after which they could choose to buy the
package at a reduced rate and to take on broadband costs.
Three “Care Technologists” administered the training. These were qualified carers employed by the organization who were trained to deliver computer training for the current project. The training schedule was manualized,
and participants were also provided with a user manual to support their training, including homework tasks to consolidate learning in between sessions.
Training was stepped-down across 3 months and involved the following:

**Month 1: Face-to-face training (three per week; 90min each) on basic**
computer use, specific social applications (email, Skype, Facebook) and
other Internet resources. Participants were also helped to develop an individual life story folder, containing materials (e.g., photographs, music,
video, family and work histories) that could be shared online.
**Month 2: Fortnightly face-to-face sessions, supplemented with telephone**
and email contact in alternate weeks to monitor progress (typically not
more than 1 hr per contact).
**Month 3: Independent use supplemented with telephone and email sup-**
port as required (no scheduled visits).

Within the defined schedule, Care Technologists were flexible with training and responsive to the needs and interests of their client. If participants
were not interested in a specific application (e.g., Facebook) they were not
required to persist with it, provided they had received the basic training in
how to use that application should they wish. In this way, we aimed to instill
competencies with computer use, and specifically in social networking applications, rather than to force participants to use things that did not meet their
needs or interests.

## Procedure

A member of the research team scheduled baseline assessments with potential participants. The researcher ensured that these were fully informed and


-----

understood the random nature of group assignment. If consent was given,
demographic details were taken and all measures were administered.
Assessments typically took between 1 and 2 hours.
Randomization followed the T1 interview. This was achieved via an online
randomization program that occurred monthly to include all participants who
had completed a baseline interview in that time. Participants allocated to the
control condition received care-as-usual (also involving regular carer visits).
They were sent a letter and small gift (e.g., a pen) expressing gratitude for
their involvement and inviting them to participate in a follow-up interview
and were informed that on completing the second interview they would be
entered into the lottery for one of two computer packages. Those who were
allocated to the training group had infrastructure installed and were assigned
a Care Technologist.
Follow-up assessment was scheduled after training was complete or after
an equivalent period for control participants. This was targeted to occur
within a 4-week period post-training (i.e., 4 months since baseline). Due to
health or delays in training, this time frame varied for some participants.
Once all measures had been administered, participation was complete and
participants were thanked.

## Measures

_1. Cognitive and mental health._

The Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination–Revised (ACE-R; Mioshi,
Dawson, Mitchell, Arnold, & Hodges, 2006) was used to assess general cognitive ability across multiple domains, including attention/orientation, memory, verbal fluency, language, and visuo-spatial abilities. In accordance with
standard scoring procedures for this instrument, participants received a total
score out of 100, with higher scores indicative of better cognitive functioning
across domains.
Mental health was assessed using several indicators. The 12-item General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12; Goldberg & Williams, 1988) assessed the
frequency of negative mental health symptoms “in the past few weeks” (αs =
.87 and .85); the eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression
Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) assessed the frequency of depressive symptoms in the last week (αs = .82 and .81); and the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory–
Short Form (GAI-SF; Byrne & Pachana, 2011), assessed the experience of
five anxiety symptoms, also in the last week. GHQ and CES-D items were
assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = rare or no symptoms, 4 = frequent
_symptoms; exact wording depended on scale and item), and responses were_


-----

averaged to give indices on which higher scores indicated more frequent
negative mental health symptoms within the specified time frame. GAI items
were responded to in a binary agree/disagree format, and number of agreements were summed to give an indication of the degree of anxiety experienced by the person in the last week. General well-being was indexed via the
five-item Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWL; for example, “In most ways my
life is close to ideal”; Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985). Responses
to these items were given on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all true, 5 = very true),
and individual items were averaged to form an index on which higher scores
indicated greater SWL (αs = .85 and .81).

_2. Sense of self and social relationships._

We assessed the _autonomy and competence subscales from self-_
determination theory’s basic needs satisfaction questionnaire (Gagné,
2003; the third need, relatedness, is covered elsewhere). This included 13
statements (e.g., “I generally feel free to express my ideas and opinions,”
“Often I do not feel very competent”) and participants indicated the degree
to which each was true for them (1 = _not at all true, 5 =_ _very true)._
Responses were averaged, with higher scores indicating stronger feelings
of autonomy (αs = .71 and .74) and competence (αs = .42 and .73).[2]
_Personal identity strength was assessed by six items (from Baray,_
Postmes, & Jetten, 2009; Campbell et al., 1996; for example, “I know what
I want from life,” “I have a clear picture of who I am and what I am”; αs =
.68 and .77). Responses were given on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all true, 5
= very true) and were averaged so higher scores indicated a stronger sense
of one’s self.
A social network activity index (Cohen et al., 1997) asked participants to
report (yes, no) whether they had been in contact with each of 10 different
targets (e.g., spouse, children, grandchildren, other family, friends, close
neighbors, people in my local community) at least once every 2 weeks.
Responses were summed. Separately, participants indicated their satisfaction with the amount of contact they had with each of these targets (1 = very
_dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied). Responses were averaged to provide a gen-_
eral index of _social network satisfaction. Subjective loneliness was also_
assessed with eight items (αs = .86 and .84) from the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale (Russell, 1996) on
which participants indicated the extent to which various statements applied
to them (e.g., “How often do you feel that you lack companionship?”; 1 =
_never, 4 = always)._


-----

_3. Computer attitudes._

These were assessed using 13 items from Jay and Willis’ (1992) questionnaire (e.g., “I feel comfortable with computers”). Responses were made using
a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) and averaged such
that higher scores indicated more positive attitudes (αs = .81 and .90).

## Results

 Initial Checks

Analyzing all the data collected at Time 1 (n = 97), conditions did not differ
in age, t < 1, p = .70, gender, χ[2] = .20, p = .67, or any measure at baseline,
_ts < 1.60, ps > .11. There were no baseline differences between those who had_
dropped out by Time 2 and those who did not, neither overall, ts < 1.39, ps >
.17, nor within each condition, all ts < 1.75, ps > .08, and no indication of
different drop-out rates across conditions, χ[2] = 1.50, p = .22. This suggests
that randomization was successful and attrition not systematic. That said, in
the analyses conducted on the sample of completers (n = 76), reported below,
small baseline differences are apparent on certain indices (computer attitudes, CES-D, and GHQ). This suggests some possible effects of attrition, an
issue we return to in the “Discussion” section. To address the robustness of
the findings from these analyses, we also report intention-to-treat analyses
based on the full sample of participants assigned to conditions, irrespective of
whether they completed the study.
There were also (predictable) differences between residential and domiciliary populations. Participants in residential (vs. domiciliary) care were significantly older, t = 3.00, p = .004, performed worse on the ACE-R, t = −4.22,
_p < .001, felt less autonomous, t = −2.28, p = .02, and slightly less competent,_
_t = −1.96, p = .053. Residential participants also reported a less active social_
network, t = −5.51, p < .001. No other baseline differences between groups
emerged, |t|s < 1.33, _ps > .019. There was, therefore, no evidence for our_
assumption that domiciliary (vs. residential) care participants would be at
greater risk for social isolation—if anything, the pattern was the reverse.

## Effects on Computer Attitudes, Sense of Self, and Social Relationships

Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. The impact of the intervention
was assessed via a series of 2 (condition: training, control) × 2 (population:


-----

-----

residential, domiciliary) × 2 (time: 1, 2) mixed ANOVAs. Statistics are
reported in Table 2.

_Computer attitudes. This analysis revealed a significant effect of condition_
qualified by a significant Condition × Time interaction. Follow-up tests confirmed that although there was a small difference between training and control groups at Time 1, F(1, 70) = 5.68, p = .02, ηp[2] = .08, this difference was
considerably larger at Time 2, F(1, 70) = 19.11, p < .001, ηp[2] = .21. Moreover,
trainees reported improved attitudes about computers across time, F(1, 70) =
3.83, _p = .054,_ ηp[2] = .05, whereas attitudes in the control group did not
change, F(1, 70) = 2.59, p = .11, ηp[2] = .04.
Beyond this, there was a significant effect of population, and a significant
Condition × Population interaction. Follow-up tests revealed a difference
between training and control participants in the residential care group, F(1,
70) = 20.23, p < .001, ηp[2] = .22, but not in the domiciliary care group, F(1, 70)
= 2.03, p = .16, ηp[2] = .03. Residential trainees had more positive attitudes than
residential controls. Although the three-way interaction was not significant,
further probing revealed that the Condition × Time interaction was more
apparent in residential, F(1, 29) = 3.83, p = .06, ηp[2] = .12, than domiciliary
participants, F(1, 41) = 1.92, p = .17, ηp[2] = .05. Thus, the intervention improved
computer attitudes, but especially among those living in a care home rather
than their own home.

_Sense of self. On feelings of competence, there was a significant effect of_
condition, qualified by a significant Condition × Time interaction. Although
there were no differences between groups at Time 1, F < 1, by Time 2 trainees were experiencing heightened feelings of competence relative to the
control group, _F(1, 70) = 10.86,_ _p = .002,_ ηp[2] = .13. Moreover, trainees
reported improved feelings of competence across time, F(1, 70) = 9.52, p =
.003, ηp[2] = .12, whereas self-competence in the control group did not change,
_F(1, 70) = 1.91, p = .17,_ ηp[2] = .03.
This pattern did not extend to feelings of autonomy. For this variable,
there was a significant difference between residential and domiciliary groups,
qualified by a significant Condition × Population interaction, indicating that
the baseline population difference was more apparent in the control group
than the training group. However, as this interaction was not modified by
time of measurement, the pattern is difficult to attribute to the training itself.
The analysis of personal identity strength revealed significant main
effects of time and condition: Personal identity strength declined across time
and was higher in the training versus control group. A significant Time ×
Population interaction further indicated that the decline in personal identity


-----

-----

strength was more evident among those in residential care, F(1, 71) = 14.17,
_p < .001,_ ηp[2] = .17, than domiciliary care, F < 1. Although no other effects
were significant, given the emerging pattern we probed the condition and time
effects further. This revealed that the apparent decline in personal identity
strength was limited to the control group, F(1, 71) = 8.47, p = .005, ηp[2] = .11,
and was not apparent in the training group, F(1, 71) = 2.56, p = .11, ηp[2] = .04. This
accelerated decline resulted in a significant difference between training and
control groups at Time 2, F(1, 71) = 4.23, p = .04, ηp[2] = .06, that was not
apparent at Time 1, _F(1, 71) = 1.92,_ _p = .17,_ ηp[2] = .03. This pattern was
especially evident among participants receiving residential rather than domiciliary care. Among the former, decline was more pronounced in the control, F(1, 71) = 12.61, p = .001, ηp[2] = .15, than training group, F(1, 71) =
2.85, p = .10, ηp[2] = .04. Among the latter, there was no evidence of decline
in either group, Fs < 1.

_Social relationships. The analysis of social network activity revealed a mar-_
ginal effect of condition qualified by a significant Condition × Time interaction. Although there were no differences between training and control groups
at Time 1, F < 1, at Time 2 there was a significant difference, F(1,71) = 7.88,
_p = .006,_ ηp[2] = .10. Trainees reported increased social network activity across
time, F(1, 71) = 7.91, p = .006, ηp[2] = .10, whereas the control group did not
change, F < 1. The effect of training on indicators of social connectedness
was confined to the measure of network activity rather than satisfaction or
subjective feelings of loneliness.

_Summary. The above analyses provide evidence that the intervention did_
what it was designed to do: Across time, participants who received the training developed more positive attitudes about computers, felt more competent
as a person, and were engaged more actively with their social network relative to those who did not receive the training. There was also some evidence
that training contributed to the maintenance of personal identity over time.
Contrary to initial expectations, to the extent that there were different effects
across population groups, these favored the residential care, who in fact were
more socially restricted at the outset.

## Effects on Cognitive and Mental Health

_Cognitive health. The analyses of ACE-R scores revealed a significant effect_
of time, indicating that cognitive performance improved from baseline to
follow-up. Although the interaction with condition did not reach significance
(p = .11), given the general expectation of cognitive decline in this


-----

population, and the unusual nature of improvement, we explored the apparent
time effect further. Follow-up tests revealed that the effect of time was confined to the training group, F(1, 72) = 10.34, p = .002, ηp[2] = .13, and was not
at all apparent in the control group, F(1, 72) = .43, p = .51, ηp[2] = .006.

_Mental health. The only effects to emerge on mental health outcomes were a_
marginal effect of training on CES-D, and a significant effect of training on
GHQ scores. Trainees experienced slightly better mental health than control
participants. However, these effects were independent of time of measurement and therefore hard to attribute to the training. There were no other main
or interactive effects of the variables on any of these measures.

## Intention-to-Treat Analysis

To check the robustness of the effects reported above, and to partly address
any problems of attrition, we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis including all allocated participants. Given the short period of assessment, and the
general pattern of limited change in the control group in the main analyses,
we assumed no change among those who withdrew or were lost to follow-up.
The last measurement (i.e., Time 1) was carried forward to represent Time 2
for these participants. The observed patterns on computer attitudes, competence, social network activity, personal identity strength, and cognitive capacity held in these analyses (see Table 3), as did the absence of any effects on
mental health outcomes.

## Indirect Effects on Cognitive and Mental Health

We also explored the possibility of indirect effects on cognitive and mental
health outcomes via the observed impacts on the suggested mediators.
Specifically, we specified a series of models (PROCESS, Model 6; Hayes,
2013) in which maintained personal identity strength was positioned as a
proximal mediator of any indirect effects of training (coded: _training = 1,_
_control = 2) on improved cognitive and mental health outcomes (i.e., control-_
ling for baseline); and improved competence and expanded social networks
were (separately) specified as mediators of any effects of training on personal
identity strength and outcomes (again controlling for baseline). This general
model is depicted graphically in Figure 2. Model statistics are reported in
Tables 4 and 5.

_Indirect effects on cognitive improvement. The model testing the serial links_
between training, increased competence, maintained personal identity strength,


-----

-----

**Figure 2. Schematic model of indirect effects analysis.**
_Note. All mediator and outcome measures are Time 2 controlling for Time 1 (i.e., represent_
change).

and improved ACE-R scores revealed 95% confidence intervals for the twostep meditational path that did not include zero, suggesting a significant indirect effect. Similarly, the model testing the serial links between training,
expanded social networks, maintained personal identity strength, and improved
ACE-R scores revealed confidence intervals for the two-step path did not span
zero, suggesting a significant indirect effect.

_Indirect effects on mental health. The models run on mental health indicators_
produced slightly different patterns for each mediator. The model testing
sequential effects via increased competence revealed support for a singlestep meditational model linking training to reduced depression (CES-D),
anxiety (GAI), and improved general mental health (GHQ) via increased
competence alone (i.e., not further mediated through maintained personal
identity strength). The analysis of SWL revealed the two-step meditational
path via competence and personal identity strength. The model testing
sequential effects on these outcomes via increased social network activity
revealed support for the two-step meditational pathway for CES-D, GAI, and
SWL, but not for GHQ.

## Discussion

Participants who were randomly assigned to a training group (vs. a control),
who received computers, Internet connections, and supportive training in the
use of these for social purposes, displayed progressively more positive


-----

-----

-----

attitudes about computers and enhanced feelings of self-competence.
Consistent with the intention of the training, this group also displayed
increased social network activity across time, as well as a maintained sense
of self (i.e., personal identity). Finally, the training had cognitive benefits.
Notably, these changes were intertwined: Analyses of indirect effects showed
that the improved cognitive capacities of trainees were in part explained
through their maintenance of self (consistent with Jetten et al., 2010; Jones
et al., 2011), and that this, in turn, was partly explained by the twin processes
of improved self-competence and increased social engagement.
There were similar indirect pathways to improved mental health, but
direct effects of training on these mental health outcomes were not observed.
This could suggest that the mental health benefits of receiving the training
were offset by additional unexamined processes (e.g., frustration), or that
these effects are more complex or simply require more time to develop and
unfold. Similarly, the fact that we observed significant effects of the intervention on the amount of reported social activity, but not on participants’ subjective satisfaction with their social relationships or reductions in felt loneliness,
could suggest that these more qualitative features of social networks are
harder to affect, or take longer to percolate, than quantity of contact alone. To
clarify this picture, future research should seek to extend these findings by
exploring the longer term impact of computer and Internet use on the social
worlds and emotional well-being of older adults who receive such training.

## Implications

The present findings provide a positive signal for technology-based interventions to support the well-being of vulnerable older adults. Informed by theory, and a growing literature on socially based interventions (see Jetten et al.,
2012; Jetten et al., 2014), the current investigation prioritized the social use
of technology, rather than technology per se. That is, we did not just give
trainees computers and teach them how to use them as computers. Rather,
training specifically focused on the use of computers as social tools, in addition to ensuring basic skills. This, perhaps, explains the broader range of
effects observed relative to past work, in which skills acquisition was the
primary focus (e.g., Slegers et al., 2008; White et al., 2002).
Along these lines, and in keeping with our general theoretical framework,
we do not believe that computers themselves were responsible for any benefits
that accrued. Indeed, based on our experiences in this project, we echo the
critical warning that to properly address the social isolation of older adults one
should not mistake “broadband connections for social ones” (e.g., Coward,
2014). For computer and Internet provision to become viable components of


-----

intervention to address the social and psychological needs of older people, our
results suggest that these should be accompanied by supportive training in
how to use these as tools of social engagement, an analysis supported by the
observed meditational roles of increased social network activity and maintained sense of self in addition to improved feelings of competence.
Extending this point further, we also do not believe that technology is the
only intervention that should be considered in this space. Although our participants generally experienced the training positively, feedback from carers
suggested that some individuals did not find this a positive and enhancing
experience, and preferred not to engage with the computer they were given.
While we do not know what factors determined this experience, it is clear that
computers are not for everyone. Alternative interventions may be needed to
address this group. But, again, the mechanisms we observed in our study are
useful for informing such alternatives. Consistent with social-psychological
theories, our study found that feelings of self-competence, social engagement
(e.g., Reis et al., 2000), and maintenance of identity (Jetten et al., 2010; Jones
et al., 2011) were critical to the intervention’s success. On this basis, we suggest that alternative interventions should also try to maximize the likelihood
of these processes being activated.

## Limitations

Further larger scale experimental investigations are still clearly necessary
and our findings suggest value in pursuing this line of enquiry. A key limitation of the present study (and comparable previous ones: Slegers et al., 2008;
White et al., 2002; Woodward et al., 2011) is the inability to disentangle the
effects of training from the trainer. Regular visits from a trainer could, arguably, account for the increased social engagement observed. However, several points speak against this interpretation. First, all participants were
receiving care. Attentive visits were not new or novel to our participants,
irrespective of condition. Second, increased social activity was carried mostly
by changes in reported contact with grandchildren and children rather than
relationship categories that could plausibly contain carers.[3] Finally, training
ended at least 1 month prior to follow-up assessment, and the last month of
training was delivered remotely on an ad hoc basis. Contact with trainers was
neither recent nor regular by the time of the follow-up assessment.
Nonetheless, future investigations should control for this possibility more
rigorously, for example, via a second control group receiving visits of similar
regularity and duration to those in the training group.
A further important limitation of the present study is that of attrition.
Although the level of attrition itself was not surprising, especially given the


-----

population being studied (i.e., vulnerable older adults receiving care), attrition inevitably creates the possibility that any effects observed might be due
to differences between those who completed and those who did not, either
alone or in combination with the intervention given. While we cannot rule out
this as a source of bias in our data, baseline checks did not detect any significant differences between those who remained in the study and those who
dropped out, and patterns of dropout were not confounded with condition.
Furthermore, intention-to-treat analyses, in which no change was assumed
for those who dropped out, confirmed the robustness of the observed patterns. It is, of course, still possible that those who dropped out differed from
those who did not on some dimension that was not measured in the study, or
that dropout was related to some condition that developed over the course of
the intervention but was not apparent at baseline (e.g., an emerging mental or
physical health condition resulting in withdrawal). Unfortunately, without
any Time 2 data from those who dropped out, this issue cannot be resolved.
A final potential limitation of this work is the enduring relevance of the
issues we have raised. Specifically, it could be argued that the importance of
providing older adults with supportive training in the social use of Internet
technology might wane as current generations, who are more accustomed to
living their lives online, grow older and enter care. While it is true that computer literacy is likely to increase with each generation, technology itself is
not static and also changes across time. As such, we do believe that there will
always be an important place for technological support within the care environment, and that this will remain true even with improved technological
competency among the clients of care providers. Irrespective of what the
future holds in terms of computer literacy, it is also the case that right now
technological access and support to clients is relatively low in the care sector.
For example, one recent report estimated that only ~20% of care homes in the
United Kingdom routinely provide Internet access to their residents
(McCardle, 2013). Based on our findings, we would suggest that this might
be a missed opportunity for improving the quality of life of residents and
something that needs to change in the present, rather than waiting for the
future to change around it.

## Conclusion

Interventions that support older individuals to maintain their social connections are vitally needed. Internet technology is an often-suggested basis for
such interventions; however, past research suggests only limited benefits of
this for older adults. In contrast, our experimental study revealed that the
combination of a user-friendly computer interface with supportive training


-----

(a) significantly improved the cognitive capacity of trainees, (b) did so
through supporting the self and activating social connections, and (c) indirectly flowed through the same processes to improve indicators of mental
health and well-being. Thus, we highlight the utility of socially guided technological interventions to support and empower older adults to build their
social connections, participate in meaningful social networks, and through
this experience better health and well-being.

**Notes**

1. Three participants were included despite not meeting this threshold. This was
allowed because their overall Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) performance was clearly compromised by stroke-related physical (rather than cognitive) impairment.
2. We have no explanation for the low reliability of Time 1 competence. As the Time 2
measure was of interest, and reliable, we retained the Time 1 scale for consistency.


-----

3. In a supplementary analysis, we performed a series of binary logistic regressions
on each of the items from the social network activity (SND) index at Time 2, with
the Time 1 equivalent and Condition entered as predictors. In all these analyses,
Time 1 contact was a significant predictor Time 2 contact, ps < .019. However,
only for reported contact with children, p = .014, and grandchildren, p = .004, was
Condition a significant predictor over and above the Time 1 effect, suggesting that
training specifically increased contact with these targets rather than alternative
sources of social contact (e.g., friends, neighbors, people in the community, or
volunteers).
