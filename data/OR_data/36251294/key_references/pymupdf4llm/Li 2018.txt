the elderly has already become a problem beyond
neglect for TB control in China.
Advanced age, concomitant diseases and waning
immunity make older people vulnerable to developing TB due to the reactivation of _Mycobacte-_
_rium tuberculosis from infection at a young age.[7 8]_
Compared with other people, elderly individuals
with TB need more support because they are more
likely to experience negative life events, such as
reduced mobility, loss of social status, loneliness
after retirement, stigma, social isolation, financial
burden and adverse effects of medication.[9–11] A
qualitative study found that educational, psychological and emotional supports were needed for
these patients.[12] Evidence has shown that social
support is positively associated with health-seeking
behaviours, treatment adherence and health
outcomes and that it can act as a stress buffer
for the psychosocial well-being of patients.[13–15]
However, a study conducted in Zhejiang Province of China reported that patients with TB had
a low level of social support.[16] It is meaningful to
explore feasible and effective social support interventions in communities for TB management and
control.
Social support intervention in patients with TB
was recommended by WHO for the programmatic
management of drug-resistant TB and the new End
TB Strategy.[17] Social support via various educational, psychosocial interventions has also been
implemented to enhance treatment adherence.[14]
However, as the types of support, patterns of intervention, target groups and study settings were
different, the magnitude of the benefit of these
social support interventions should be considered
with caution.[18] Additionally, most of the studies
focused on the effect of social support interventions
on treatment adherence or outcomes. Hardly any
study assessed the effect of these interventions on
the level of social support patients perceived. The
social support patients perceived may act as an intermediate variable between the social support intervention and the treatment adherence or outcomes.
Exploring the effect of social support interventions
on the level of social support of patients can help
to understand how social support intervention
influences the treatment adherence or treatment
outcomes of patients

#### Abstract Background With the increasing of ageing population, tuberculosis in the elderly brings a challenge for the tuberculosis (TB) control in China. Enough social support can promote the treatment adherence and outcome of the elderly patients with TB. Exploring effective interventions to improve the social support of patients is of great significance for TB management and control. Methods A community-based, repeated measurement trial was conducted. Patients with TB >65 years of age were allocated into the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group received comprehensive social support interventions, while those in the control group received health education alone. The social support level of patients was measured at baseline and at the first, third and sixth months during the intervention to assess the effectiveness of comprehensive social support interventions. Results A total of 201 patients were recruited into the study. Compared with the control group, social support for patients in the intervention group increased significantly over time (βgroup*time=0.61, P<0.01) in the following three dimensions: objective support (βgroup*time=0.15, P<0.05), subjective support (βgroup*time=0.32, P<0.05) and support utilisation (βgroup*time=0.16, P<0.05). The change in the scores in the control group was not statistically significant. Conclusions The intervention programme in communities, including health education, psychotherapy and family and community support interventions, can improve the social support for elderly patients with TB compared with single health education. Trial registration number ChiCTR-IOR-16009232

 Introduction
Although great progress in tuberculosis (TB)
control has been made over the last two decades,[1]
TB remains one of the biggest health problems in
China.[2 3] Concurrently, WHO reported that the
burden of TB disease is shifting to the elderly,[4] as
the proportion of the older population will increase
from 12.4% in 2010 to 28% in 2040 in China.[5]
According to the fifth national TB survey conducted
in China in 2010, the TB prevalence increased with

To the best of our knowledge, no research has explored interventions to improve the social support of elderly patients with
TB in China. Therefore, based on the hypothesis that comprehensive social support interventions might increase the social
support of the elderly with TB, we conducted this community-based trial to assess the effects of the comprehensive interventions on the improvement of social support of elderly patients
with TB.

#### Methods Study settings
This study was conducted in Hubei Province, China, from
November 2015 to April 2016. Hubei Province is one of the
top 10 high TB-incidence provinces in China and the Directly
Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) strategy has been
well implemented among its communities.[19] After treated in
hospitals for the intensive phase, patients with TB are treated
as outpatients in communities. Community health centres are
responsible for the management of these patients with TB.
All patients with TB that are newly diagnosed in all medical
institutions must be reported to the local Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention through the internet-based National
Infectious Diseases Reporting System (NIDRS).[20] So information on patients with TB, such as gender, age, occupation
before retirement, diagnosis date and sputum smear result,
was collected from the NIDRS.

#### Sample size
As the social support scores of patients were designed to be
measured four times during the study, the sample size was
calculated according to the repeated-measures formula: M=2

[1+(k-1)ρ] σ[2](Z1-α/2+Z1-β)[2]/kδ[2].[21] The following parameters
were used in this formula: power of 85% and type I error of 5%
(two-sided), number of repeated times K=4, smallest detected
meaningful difference δ=4.2, correlation coefficient among
measures ρ=0.70 and SE σ=10 based on the results of pilot
study. Consequently, 195 patients were needed for this study.
To obtain sufficient patients, 12 communities in both cities were
estimated to be randomly selected.

#### Study sample
To perform interventions more easily and avoid information
contamination among patients, we used a multistage sampling
method. Among the 16 major cities in Hubei Province, Wuhan
City and Enshi City were randomly selected and assigned to
the intervention and control groups, respectively. Then, 12
communities in each city were randomly selected. The elderly
patients with TB in these communities who were registered
in the NIDRS were all included in the corresponding group.
Because all of the patients in one community were in the same
group and because all staff (psychologists, community health
workers and administrators) who conducted the intervention
could not be blinded to the study group, the patients and staff
were not blinded.
Patients in this study met the following inclusion criteria: (a)
diagnosed with TB at a local medical institute for TB control
according to the WHO guideline,[22] (b) >65 years of age, (c)
local residents, (d) registered in the NIDRS, (e) normal communication ability and (f) volunteered to participate in this study.
Patients were excluded if they (a) were suffering from mental
health disorders, (b) had cognitive impairment or (c) were
enrolled in other st dies


#### Interventions
This study lasted for 6 months with an intervention frequency
of twice per month. Patients in the control group received the
health education intervention alone, and those in the intervention group received psychotherapy and family and community
support interventions in addition to health education. Except for
the psycho-educational workshops in the family and community
support interventions, these interventions were performed in a
one-to-one setting rather than a group setting to avoid cross-infection among patients.

#### Health education
Health education consisted of basic knowledge about TB
(including transmission route, treatment policy, therapeutic
regimen), psychological coping skills (including treatment
side effects, effective communication, confidence enhancement), reasonable diet (including light diet, low salt and fat
diet, high protein diet) and healthy lifestyle (including smoking
and drinking cessation, regular physical exercise). TB health
brochures were also delivered to the patients. It was conducted
by community health workers at patients’ homes and lasted
approximately 30 min per patient.

#### Psychotherapy
To eliminate the mental health problems of patients, Morita
therapy was delivered to patients at their home by psychologists
of the Tongji Research Center of Mental Health at Tongji Medical
College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. A
checklist of the key components of Morita therapy was developed according to prior studies[23–25] before the intervention and
was strictly followed during the intervention. Throughout the
study, every patient was asked to complete a diary for psychologists to evaluate the intervention. Every psychotherapy session
lasted approximately 30 min per patient.

#### Family and community support interventions
This part included home visits, psycho-educational workshops
and peer support. During the study, one community health
worker and one community administrator conducted home
visits to communicate and construct a harmonious relationship with the patients. Simultaneously, family members and
friends of patients were invited to attend psycho-educational
workshops to receive basic knowledge about TB and encourage
them to express their emotional pressure. Additionally, recovered patients with TB and their family members were invited
to provide peer support. They shared their experiences with
patients and their family members about how to solve problems
and improve self-care.

#### Outcome measurement
The primary outcome was the social support level of patients
and was evaluated by the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS).
This multidimensional scale consists of three dimensions that
measure objective support, subjective support and support
utilisation. The total SSRS score ranges from 12 to 66, with
a higher score indicating the better availability of support.
The reliability and validity of this scale were relatively high
when it was applied to measure social support in the Chinese
population.[16 26] In this sample, Cronbach’s alpha for the total
score was 0.91. Details of the SSRS are available in the online

#### Data collection
Data were collected at baseline and at the first, third and sixth
months after intervention initiation. Each patient was given


the scale and asked to complete it alone. Investigators could
provide an explanation for any confusion about the scale to
avoid any error and ensure the data quality. The investigation
was supervised and coordinated by a supervisor. Data were
double-entered into the EpiData V.3.1 software. Scales with
missing data concerning any items were excluded from the
final analysis.

#### Statistical analysis
The normality of the data was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous and categorical variables were
presented as the means (SD) and frequencies (percentages),
respectively, and compared by the t-test and χ[2] test, respectively. Considering the structure of repeated-measures data,
a multilevel model was performed to assess the changes of
social support scores between two groups. These analyses
were performed using the Statistical Analysis System V.9.2,
and the sample size was calculated using the Power Analysis
and Sample Size software V.11.0. A two-sided P value <0.05
was considered statistically significant.

#### Results Demographic and TB-related characteristics
A total of 201 patients were recruited at the beginning of the
study (69 in the intervention group and 132 in the control
group). During the intervention, 18 patients in two groups
were excluded (one died, three showed poor compliance
and four dropped out in the intervention group; two died,
four showed poor compliance and four dropped out in the
control group). Finally, 183 patients were included in the final
analysis (61 in the intervention group and 122 in the control
group) (see figure 1). Overall, the percentages of men in the
two groups were similar and the mean ages of the two groups

were both close to 72 years. No significant differences were
observed in the baseline characteristics between the groups
(see table 1).

#### Change in social support scores
At baseline, the average scores of SSRS, objective support,
subjective support and support utilisation of 183 patients were
37.04, 8.17, 22.10 and 6.77, respectively. The total SSRS score
and scores of its three dimensions (objective support, subjective
support and support utilisation) all showed an increasing trend
in two groups during the intervention, but this trend was more
obvious in the intervention group. At the end of intervention,
these four scores in the intervention group were all higher than
those in the control group (see figure 2).

#### Multilevel model analysis of social support scores
The methods of multilevel analysis are available in the online
[supplementary appendix 2. After the background variables](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech-2017-209458)
were controlled, the total SSRS scores and subjective support
scores of the two groups were significantly different at baseline (βgroup=2.35, P<0.05 and βgroup=2.00, P<0.001, respectively). Additionally, the score of SSRS and its three dimensions
(objective support, subjective support and support utilisation)
at four times did not change significantly in the control group
(βtime=0.24, P>0.05; βtime=0.04, P>0.05; βtime=0.16, P>0.05;
and βtime=0.01, P>0.05, respectively). However, the differences
in these four scores between the groups increased with changes
in the time (βgroup*time=0.61, P<0.01; βgroup*time=0.15, P<0.05;
βgroup*time=0.32, P<0.05; and βgroup*time=0.16, P<0.05, respecti l ) ( t bl 2)


#### Adverse effects
Due to the appropriate guidance, no adverse events associated
with comprehensive social support interventions were reported
for any patients during the trial.

#### Discussion
Based on the DOTS strategy, comprehensive social support
interventions, including health education, psychotherapy and
family and community support interventions, can increase the
social support of elderly patients with TB compared with single
health education.
Qualitative studies reported that health education was needed
by patients with TB.[9 12] Receiving more information about the
disease might empower the patient to feel more confident and
active in his or her treatment.[12] However, a Cochrane review
found insufficient evidence for the promotion of treatment
adherence through health education.[27] We found that the social
support of patients was not improved obviously through health
education. It indicates that TB health education alone is not
effective in improving the social support for patients with TB.
Effective educational interventions are those that aim to modify
patients’ behaviour rather than simply providing information
about the disease.[28] Considering these, to promote the social
support and health behaviour of elderly patients with TB, health
education should be provided to those patients combined with
other interventions rather than a single one.
Mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are often
complicated with TB[29] due to adverse reactions of drugs, inadequate social support and social stigma.[30] Mental health internti n r t d t pr id f r p ti nt ith TB t t kl

their mental issues.[9 12 30] Psychotherapies, such as group psychotherapy,[31] have been proved to be effective in improving treatment adherence.[13 32]

In our study, Morita therapy was implemented for elderly
patients with TB. Morita therapy is a psychotherapy that was
developed in Japan by Dr Shoma Morita in 1919 and is aimed
at eliminating the mental health problems of patients through
transferring their attention from negative stress.[33] This therapy
is based on the premise that unpleasant symptoms are a natural
part of the human experience.[23] We found that most elderly
patients with TB often isolated themselves from others because
of stigma, but many of them gradually participated in social
activities and then sought and used help from others during the
intervention. Another significant change was that many patients
were willing to disclose their disease to others after the intervention. Some studies pointed out that most of the patients with TB
who disclosed their disease status to a wider audience received
more positive support.[12 34] These suggest that psychotherapy,
such as Morita therapy, is effective in improving psychological
issues of elderly patients with TB and should be considered as an
essential part of the intervention to facilitate the social support
of elderly patients with TB.
As the place in which elderly patients with TB lived, communities have great potential to provide valuable social support for
patients.[12] Involvement of family and community members to
support patients with TB was found to be one way to improve
treatment outcomes and overcome social issues like stigma.[11]
Hence, we incorporated the family and community interventions into the comprehensive interventions.
Through home visits, community health workers and administrators knew more about the elderly patients with TB and their
families. These patients also expressed that they felt they were
cared for and supported. They trusted these health workers and
were also willing to ask for help from them. These phenomena
indicate that the good patient–health worker relationship,
which can be achieved through home visits, is significant for the
support patients perceived and for their treatment, as has been
found in other studies.[12 16]

Simultaneously, a study pointed out that caregivers might lose
confidence during the treatment of patients with TB, which would
result in reduced social support for patients.[16] We held psycho-educational workshops for the family members and friends of the
elderly patients with TB to lessen their psychological stress and
increase their knowledge about TB. Many family members


expressed that they experienced isolation by others and lacked
knowledge about TB treatment. Through workshops, they gained
more confidence and were more active in supporting patients’
treatment. This suggests that not only does the patients need
psychological intervention and health education, but also family
members and other caregivers need psycho-educational intervention to better support the elderly patients with TB.[9 12]

Additionally, we invited recovered patients with TB as peer
support for the elderly patients with TB. During the intervention, most patients expressed that these former patients with
TB understood how they felt. Some elderly patients with TB
even developed valuable friendship with the recovered patients
with TB. Several studies, which involved other chronic diseases,
also proved that peer support was a useful method to support
patients.[35 36] It is of practical significance to treat recovered
patients with TB as peer support to provide emotional support
for the elderly with TB.[12]

Due to the design of the study, several limitations should be
acknowledged. First, there might be some bias caused by the
differences in the economic and medical level between Wuhan
City and Enshi City. Although Wuhan City and Enshi City were
selected and allocated into different groups randomly, patients
with TB in Wuhan City, which is the biggest city in Hubei Province, might receive better medical services than patients in Enshi
City. Second, we did not assess the social support of patients
after the end of the study. Therefore, we are uncertain about
whether our interventions could consistently influence the social
support of patients. Further studies can be done to explore the
long-term effects of these interventions on the social support of
elderly patients with TB in communities. Third, although the
scale used to evaluate the primary outcome in this study was
developed based on China’s social conditions and tested with a
good reliability and validity in China, it was not widely used to
assess social support in foreign studies. This made the results of
our study less comparable to foreign studies.

#### Conclusions
The key aspect of our study was to identify effective comprehensive social support interventions and assess its impact on the
social support level of elderly patients with TB in communities.
Our results showed that compared with the single health education the interventions, consisting of health education, psychotherapy and family and community support interventions, could
effectively promote the social support for the elderly with TB in
communities. The comprehensive interventions provide a reference value for the management of elderly patients with TB in
China.

#### What is already known on this subject


#### Evidence has shown that social support is positively associated with treatment adherence and health outcomes. But no study has explored effective interventions to improve the social support of elderly patients with tuberculosis (TB) in communities of China.


#### What this study adds


#### This community-based trial found that interventions which consisted of health promotion, psychotherapy and family and community support interventions were effective to improve the social support for the elderly with TB. These could provide a reference value for the TB management in communities of China.
