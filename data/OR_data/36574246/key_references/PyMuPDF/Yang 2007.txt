The Association Between the Postconcussion Symptoms
and Clinical Outcomes for Patients With Mild Traumatic
Brain Injury
Chi-Cheng Yang, MS, Yong-Kwang Tu, MD, PhD, Mau-Sun Hua, PhD, and Sheng-Jean Huang, MD
Background: Postconcussion symp-
toms (PCS) (such as dizziness, headache, ir-
ritability, fatigue, and impaired memory)
are common in patients who sustain a mild
traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However,
few studies have systematically investigated
the association between PCS and clinical
outcomes in mTBI patients. Therefore, the
present study attempted to examine PCS
during the disease course and to determine
whether PCS adversely affect outcome.
Methods: This was a prospective, co-
hort and controlled study of 115 mTBI
patients. The PCS checklist was used to
identify PCS and the Glasgow Outcome
Scale and the Glasgow Outcome Scale-
Extended were used to investigate clinical
outcomes. All patients were evaluated
four times: at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks,
and 8 weeks after the injury.
Results: Physical symptoms such as
dizziness and headache were prominent in
the early after injury stage (1 and 2
weeks). On the other hand, the psychoso-
cial symptoms, such as depression and ir-
ritability, were significant at the late after
injury stage (4 and 8 weeks). Dizziness
adversely affected clinical outcome at both
the early and late stages of the disease,
whereas the impact of intracranial lesions
and depression on outcome was greatest
early and late, respectively.
Conclusions: The results show that
PCS during the disease course and the
relationship between PCS and clinical out-
come can be systematically evaluated. In
fact, different postconcussion symptom
domains should be monitored while the
disease is progressing.

raumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public health
problem with an annual incidence of 1.5 to 2 million
people in the United States, of which an estimated
70,000 to 90,000 cases result in remarkable functional
impairments.1 Some western studies2,3 concluded that mild
TBI (mTBI) accounts for 90% of TBIs whereas there were
77% to 82% TBIs classified as mild severity group in Tai-
wanese literature.4,5 In Taiwan, the incidence rate of mTBI in
2004 was 728 people per 100,000, which meant more than
160,000 people had suffered from this problem.6 Several
studies7–9 further evidenced that lost productive work time
after mTBI may be the largest component of economic costs
of brain trauma.
The postconcussion symptoms (PCS) are common com-
plaints after mTBI. Rutherford10 reported that the most com-
mon acute complaints were physical problems (headache and
dizziness) that occurred early, whereas the most common
chronic ones were psychosocial difficulties (depression and
memory impairment) that occurred late in the illness. Al-
though most mTBI patients recover quickly, usually within 3
months after injury, many studies11–15 have identified a small
proportion of patients who continue to have difficulties more
than 1 year after head trauma. In fact, the persistent cognitive
and emotional disturbances are often considered potential risk
factors for lifetime disability.16–18
Surprisingly, few researchers have explored the relation-
ship between PCS and clinical outcome. Moreover, their studies
had some methodological drawbacks. Most were cross-sectional
studies. Thus, although Chamelian and Feinstein19 found that
dizziness was an adverse predictor of patients’ clinical outcomes
at 6 months after mTBI, their study failed to distinguish between
early and late PCS owing to its cross-sectional nature. Moreover,
though commonly used to assess clinical outcomes of severe
TBI patients, the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)20 might not be
suitable for mTBI patients. In fact, the GOS was shown clini-
cally to be constrained by a significant ceiling effect and thus
was unable to effectively differentiate between PCS and clinical
outcomes.
The present study tried to resolve these methodological
problems. First, the authors regularly followed mTBI patients
immediately after injury to 2 months after injury. In addition,
we used the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)21,22
to place greater emphasis on assessment of the TBI patients’
social and family relationships, which are possible predictors
of patient prognosis. Hence, the purpose of the study was to
explore the relationship of PCS and clinical outcome system-
atically. Two sets of hypotheses needed to be tested. First, in
our mTBI patients, the specific PCS would manifest differently

between the earlier and later after injury stages. Second, the
clinical outcomes of the earlier and later after injury stages
would be adversely affected by specific PCS, respectively.
METHODS
Participants
During a period of 15 months (January 2004 to March
2005), 130 mTBI patients were followed up in the clinic.
Fifteen patients were excluded and 115 patients with mTBI
participated in this study. The diagnosis of mTBI was made
in a Level 1 trauma center by a neurosurgeon and was based
on the guidelines of mTBI management proposed by Servadei
et al.23 Accordingly, patients with the following criteria were
included in the present study: (1) initial GCS score of 14/15
and (2) initial loss of consciousness of less than 30 minutes.
The demographic data of the patients are shown in Table 1.
As a control group, we recruited healthy volunteers with no
history of significant brain injury or neurologic disorders and
with a mean age similar to that of the patients (34.85 years 
13.40, t [153]  0.63, p  0.05).
The recruitment and follow-up of the mTBI patients
discharged from the emergency room or hospital took place
in a specific neurosurgery clinic. All patients with a history of
suspected psychiatric problems, cerebrovascular insults, or
other major medical illnesses (e.g. brain tumors, thyroid dys-
function, etc.) were excluded.
Measurement of the PCS
The description of PCS in our study matched that de-
scribed in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-
10) clinical diagnosis of PCS (code F07.2).24 The symptoms
included headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, insomnia,
difficulty with concentration or memory, emotional liability,
alcohol abuse, and stress intolerance. Accordingly, the au-
thors designed a PCS screening instrument, known as the
Checklist of Postconcussion Symptoms (CPCS), for clinical
use. This instrument was used to assess the severity of 16
commonly reported PCS, including headache, dizziness, fa-
tigue, nausea, vomiting, poor vision, tinnitus, loss of energy,
depression, irritability, insomnia, anxiety, attention deficits,
memory impairments, psychomotor slowing, and other dis-
turbances. All participants were asked, “Did any of the fol-
lowing symptoms reduce your ability to work or make you
sick in the past week?” If patients manifested any symptoms
in the scale, an examiner (a clinical neuropsychologist)
scored “1” for each item they reported. The sum of those
checked items represented the total PCS score for that patient.
Measurement of the Clinical Outcomes
Many past studies have reported that mTBI patients
manifest many cognitive and emotional disturbances though
their GOS-evaluated outcomes are still favorable. Hence, the
GOSE, which uses an eight-point ordinal scale and a semi-
structured interview, was developed to evaluate patients’
clinical outcomes. The GOS and the GOSE are shown in
Table 2. The main difference between the GOS and the
GOSE is that the latter also assesses patients’ social activities
and family relationships. Moreover, the examiner had to
evaluate patients’ before and after injury conditions to make
an intrapersonal comparison.
Procedures
When the patients were discharged from the emergency
department or the hospital, they were prospectively evaluated
using the CPCS, GOS, and GOSE at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1
month, and 2 months after injury. Because some patients did
not need to be followed up continuously, the authors con-
ducted their after-injury evaluations by telephone. The study
protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of
participating institutions, and the patients gave informed con-
sent after the study requirements were explained.
Data Analysis
The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post
hoc analysis using Scheffe’s procedure, Spearman’s correla-
tion, 2 test, and logistic regression were used to evaluate
differences between groups. Statistical significance was de-
fined as a probability value of less than 0.05. Commercially

RESULTS
Do Our mTBI Patients Have PCS?
Most of our mTBI patients (85%) had at least one
postconcussion symptom. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 3,
a variety of symptoms appeared 1 week after injury including
dizziness (in 74% of the patients), headache (45%), fatigue
(24%), attentional deficits (14%), and nausea (14%). At 2
weeks after injury, 55% of the patients still had a least one PC
symptom: dizziness (45%), headache (20%), or fatigue
(14%). Less than 7% of the patients reported other PCS, such
as nausea, attention deficit, and depression.
At the 4- and 8-week postinjury evaluations, 23% and
13%, respectively, had at least one symptom. Moreover, most
symptoms (except dizziness in 18% of patients) were dimin-
ished at 4 weeks after injury. At the 8-week postinjury eval-
uation, 94% of the patients had no postconcussion symptom.
Did the PCS Adversely Affect Clinical Outcome?
One Week After Injury
To analyze the relationship between PCS and clinical
outcome, patients were divided into two groups: those with a
GOSE score of 8 (the “good recovery” group) and those with
a GOSE score of less than 8 (the “poor recovery” group). All
patients had favorable clinical outcomes based on GOS score
(GOS  5).
As shown in Table 4, one-way ANOVA found a significant
main effect of groups on PCS scores, and a post hoc analysis
using Scheffe’s procedure found a significant main effect of
groups on the total PCS scores (F  16.99, p  0.001). In fact,

significantly more total PCS presented in both the good and the
poor recovery groups than in the control group, and presented in
the poor recovery group than in the good recovery group. Mean-
while, the Spearman’s correlation study revealed that mTBI
patients with more PCS had poorer outcomes, as measured by
the GOSE (r  0.40, p  0.01). As for the impacts of
individual PCS on clinical outcome, 2 analysis showed that
headache (2  6.27, p  0.01), dizziness (2  16.67, p 
0.001), and nausea (2  5.14, p  0.05) were strongly asso-
ciated with GOSE rating. Moreover, the logistic regression anal-
ysis (Table 5) revealed much more headache and dizziness in the
poor and good recovery groups than in the control. Therefore,
intracranial lesions had an adverse impact on GOSE score ( 
0.25, p  0.01).
Two Weeks After Injury
As shown in Table 4, although 76% of the mTBI patients
recovered well, one-way ANOVA revealed a significant main
effect of groups on PCS, and a post hoc analysis with Scheffe’s
procedure showed that significantly more PCS were present
in the poor recovery group than the control group (F  16.95,
p  0.001). Furthermore, Spearman’s correlation study showed
that mTBI patients with more PCS had poorer outcomes, as
measured by the GOSE (r  0.48, p  0.05). As for the
impacts of individual PCS on clinical outcome, 2 analysis
indicated that headache (2  12.09, p  0.01) and dizziness
(2  24.50, p  0.001) individually were still markedly asso-
ciated with GOSE score. Logistic regression analysis (Table 5)
found significantly more dizziness in the good and poor recov-
ery groups than in the control. In addition, anxiety (2  5.77,
p  0.05), fatigue (2  10.27, p  0.01), loss of energy (2 
16.24, p  0.001), and irritability (2  12.88, p  0.001) were
all markedly associated with GOSE rating. As found at 1 week
after injury, the intracranial lesions had a negative effect on
GOSE score (  0.41, p  0.05).
Four Weeks After Injury
At 4 weeks after injury, 88% mTBI patients were recover-
ing well. The one-way ANOVA found a significant main effect
of groups on PCS, and a post hoc analysis with Scheffe’s
procedure found significantly more PCS were present in the
poor recovery group than the control group (F  7.88, p 
0.01). Furthermore, Spearman’s correlation revealed that
mTBI patients with more PCS had poorer outcome, as mea-
sured by the GOSE (r  0.60, p  0.05). As for the impacts
of individual PCS on the clinical outcomes, 2 analysis
showed that dizziness (2  30.19, p  0.001), fatigue (2 
4.09, p  0.05), and irritability (2  7.28, p  0.01)
remained markedly associated with GOSE score. Logistic
regression analysis (Table 5) found more dizziness in the
poor recovery group than in the control. Attention deficit
(2  8.56, p  0.01) was significantly associated with
GOSE score, and intracranial lesions had an adverse impact
on GOSE score (  0.33, p  0.01).
Eight Weeks After Injury
Most patients (97%) had recovered well by 8 weeks after
injury. Moreover, one-way ANOVA revealed a significant
main effect on PCS, and a post hoc analysis with Scheffe’s
procedure showed significantly more PCS were present in the
poor recovery group than the control group (F  5.97, p 
0.01). The Spearman’s correlation showed that mTBI patients
with more PCS had poorer outcome, as measured by the
GOSE (r  0.26, p  0.01). As for the impacts of indi-
vidual PCS on the clinical outcomes, the 2 analysis showed
that headache (2  4.00, p  0.05), dizziness (2  4.00,
p  0.05), fatigue (2  4.92, p  0.05), poor vision (2 
75.98, p  0.001), nausea (2  37.66, p  0.001), and
depression (2  37.66, p  0.001) were significantly asso-
ciated with GOSE score. As at 4 weeks after injury, logistic
regression analysis revealed the presence of more dizziness in
the poor recovery group than the control (Table 5). Surpris-
ingly, intracranial lesions and GOSE score were not associ-
ated (  0.06, p  0.05).
DISCUSSION
Definition of mTBI
The definition of mTBI is controversial.25–32 In most
studies to date,33–36 mTBI patients had GCS scores of 13/15.
However, Tellier and colleagues37 suggested that patients
who had “mild head injury” were not a homogeneous group.

The studies of Hsiang et al.38 and Hsiang39 further supported
this point of view. They considered the pathophysiology of
mTBI in these patients was heterogeneous and recommended
subdivision of head injury patients with GCS scores of 13/15
into a “mild head injury” and “high-risk mild head injury”
groups. “Real” mild head injury was defined as GCS score of
15 without any acute positive radiographic findings. In addi-
tion, Uchino et al.,35 while confirming the results of previous
studies, favored exclusion of patients with GCS score of 13
from the mild head injury category, because of a high inci-
dence of brain damage on computed tomography scans in
those patients. Hence, to avoid the ambiguity associated with
heterogeneity of pathophysiology, our study included only
mTBI patients with GCS score of 14/15.
The PCS in mTBI Patients
The prospective design of our study permitted us to show
significant association between PCS and disease course. Un-
like past studies,10,13 which reported headache as the most
common symptom after mTBI, our study found dizziness was
the most prominent and persistent. In contrast to most past
studies, which were cross-sectional, our prospective cohort study
revealed symptom prevalence at different stages after mTBI.
Even so, most of the other PCS had lessened by 2 weeks after
injury. In fact, the results of some past cross-sectional studies
support this result. For instance, Dikmen and colleagues11 found
that very few minor head injury patients reported PCS after 1
month. Recent studies40,41 agreed and showed that symptoms
usually disappeared by 3 months after injury. However, symp-
toms can persist from months to years after injury and may even
be permanent, causing disability in some individuals. When this
cluster of PCS is persistent in nature, it is often called persistent
PCS (PPCS).42 In our study, there were only three patients with
PPCS at 8 weeks after injury.
Some researchers explored whether PCS is specific to
mTBI or simply a nonspecific symptom cluster. Iverson43
examined the prevalence of postconcussion-like symptoms in
a sample of healthy individuals. Participants completed the
British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory-Short
Form (BC-PSI-Sf), a test designed to measure both the fre-
quency and intensity of ICD-10 criteria for PCS, and the
Beck Depression Inventory (2nd edition). Specific endorse-
ment rates of postconcussion-like symptoms ranged from
35.9% to 75.7% for any experience of the symptoms in the
past 2 weeks. In our study, less than 15% of the healthy
participants complained of PCS. Moreover, there was signif-
icantly more headache and dizziness in mTBI patients than in
the control group (Table 5).
The Outcome of mTBI
In the literature, the GOS remains the most widely used
outcome measure of head injury severity.44,45 However, past
researchers22,46–48 showed that the GOSE could better dif-
ferentiate levels of recovery in mild-to-moderate TBI patients
when combined with a structured interview. Levin et al.48
reported that the validity of GOSE exceeded that of GOS in
mild-to-moderate TBI. In fact, the GOSE was more sensitive
to change than the GOS at the 3-month and 6-month assess-
ments. In our study, GOS scores did not change significantly
(all patients appeared to be fully recovered) between evalu-
ations, whereas a number of patients did not achieve optimal
recovery as measured by the GOSE. Therefore, our findings
support the conclusion that the GOSE is the better of the two
methods for measuring the clinical outcomes in mild-to-
moderate TBI patients.
PCS Adversely Affected Clinical Outcome
in mTBI Patients
Regardless of the stage after head trauma, the PCS re-
ported by mTBI patients had a significant negative influence
on clinical outcome. Unfortunately, few studies have directly
investigated the association between PCS and clinical out-
come. Haboubi et al.15 showed a significant number of 1,255
patients with minor head injury still complained at 2 weeks
after injury of some PCS, which might contribute to a delay
in return to work. In addition, Chamelian and Feinstein19
compared clinical outcomes in mild-to-moderate TBI patients
with and without dizziness. Their results showed that the
presence of dizziness at 6 months after injury was an adverse
prognostic indicator. In fact, our results provide further
evidence that dizziness is the most persistent symptom
adversely affecting clinical outcome as well as disease
course. Moreover, we found that emotional disturbances, such
as irritability and depression, might be adverse factors for clin-
ical prognosis at 4 weeks after injury. Some researchers16,49,50
reported depressive symptoms in 25% of patients 1 year after
mTBI. The negative impact of emotional and cognitive difficul-
ties on clinical outcomes has also been reported. Rutherford10
proposed that the emotional and cognitive problems were late
PCS that might negatively influence clinical outcome. Notably,
Jorge et al.51 showed that depression after mTBI adversely
affected clinical outcome. Moreover, recently, Wilson et al.52
concluded from a study of 135 TBI patients that there was a
significant negative correlation between outcome and depression
at 6 months after injury. In addition, our study confirmed that
latent PCS, such as depression and irritability, adversely affect
clinical outcome, even 8 weeks after injury.
CONCLUSION
A significant number of PCS follow (at 1–8 weeks)
mTBI. However, most of them are diminished by 4 weeks
post-mTBI. In addition, the PCS adversely influenced mTBI
outcome. Physical symptoms had more adverse impact on
outcome at early mTBI stages (1 and 2 weeks), whereas
emotional disturbances had more adverse impacts at later
stages (4 and 8 weeks). Therefore, it is vital to help the patient
to understand and face the difficulties posed by PCS. More-
over, progress of the disease should be monitored by moni-
toring different PCS domains.
