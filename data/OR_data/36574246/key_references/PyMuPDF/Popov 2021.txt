ABSTRACT: Objective: To assess demographic, clinical, and injury characteristics associated with health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) in adults with persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS). Methods: Adults with PPCS presenting to a specialized brain
injury clinic completed demographic, injury, and clinical outcome questionnaires at the initial clinic assessment. Clinical outcome
measures were collected including the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). HRQOL was measured using the
Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) questionnaire. Stepwise hierarchical multiple regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, and
months since injury was used to determine associations between quality of life and clinical outcome measures. Results: Overall, 125
participants were included. The PHQ-9, FSS, and GAD-7 were signiﬁcant predictors of QOLIBRI scores (R2 = 0.481, p < .001),
indicating that participants with higher levels of depressive symptoms, fatigue, and anxiety reported poorer HRQOL. The PHQ-9 score
was the strongest predictor, accounting for 42.0% of the variance in QOLIBRI scores. No demographic or injury characteristics
signiﬁcantly predicted QOLIBRI scores. There was a high prevalence of depressive symptoms with 72.8% of participants having PHQ-9
scores ≥10. Conclusion: Among patients with PPCS, mental health and fatigue are important contributors to HRQOL. As there is a high
burden of mood disorders and fatigue in this population, targeted treatments for these concerns may impact the quality of life.
RÉSUMÉ : Facteurs associés à la qualité de vie chez les adultes qui ressentent des symptômes postcommotionnels persistants. Objectif : L’étude
visait à établir des associations entre certaines caractéristiques démographiques, cliniques et lésionnelles, et la qualité de vie liée à la santé chez des adultes
qui ressentaient des symptômes postcommotionnels persistants (SPCP). Méthode : Des adultes qui présentaient des SPCP ont rempli différents
questionnaires sur des données démographiques, les traumas subis et les résultats cliniques à leur première consultation dans un centre spécialisé dans le
traitement des lésions cérébrales. Les renseignements sur les résultats cliniques ont été recueillis à l’aide des questionnaires suivants : le Rivermead Post
Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), le Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), la Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) et la Fatigue
Severity Scale (FSS). Quant à la qualité de vie liée à la santé, elle a été déterminée à l’aide du questionnaire Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI).
En ce qui concerne la démarche, les données utilisées dans l’analyse par régression multiple hiérarchique ont été rajustées selon l’âge, le sexe et le nombre
de mois écoulés depuis l’accident puisque que ce dernier constituait un point de repère dans l’établissement d’associations entre la qualité de vie et les
résultats cliniques. Résultats : Au total, 125 patients ont participé à l’étude. Les questionnaires PHQ-9, FSS et GAD-7 se sont révélés des instruments
prévisionnels importants des scores au questionnaire QOLIBRI (R2 = 0,481; p < 0,001); en effet, les participants qui ont fait état de degrés élevés de
symptômes de dépression, de fatigue et d’anxiété ont également fait état d’un degré de qualité de vie liée à la santé plus faible que les autres. Le score
PHQ-9 s’est montré le résultat prévisionnel le plus important; il pesait pour 42,0 % de la variance des scores QOLIBRI. Par contre, aucune donnée
démographique ou caractéristique lésionnelle n’a permis d’établir de prévisions signiﬁcatives quant aux scores QOLIBRI. Enﬁn, il y avait une forte
prévalence de symptômes dépressifs : 72,8 % des participants avaient un score PHQ-9 ≥10. Conclusion : Parmi les patients souffrant de SPCP, la santé
mentale et la fatigue se sont révélées d’importants facteurs de la qualité de vie liée à la santé. Puisque les troubles de l’humeur et la fatigue dans ce groupe
particulier de personnes imposent un lourd fardeau, des traitements ciblés visant ces facteurs pourraient avoir une incidence sur la qualité de vie.

INTRODUCTION
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a signiﬁcant health concern
worldwide, presenting on a spectrum from mild to severe, which
can lead to short or long-term disability and reduced quality of
life.1 Approximately 80% of all TBI is classiﬁed as mild and is
frequently referred to as a concussion.2 In Canada, the incidence
of concussions is steadily increasing.3 According to the Canadian
Community Health Survey, the annual incidence of self-reported
concussion increased from 1.9% in 2009 to 3.2% in 2014.4
Increasing trends in incidence were also observed by analyzing

Ontario physician billing codes for concussion from 2008 to
2016.5 These trends likely reﬂect a growing awareness of con-
cussions among the public as well as healthcare providers,3 in
part due to a growing understanding of the long-term conse-
quences of head injuries.6,7
While most adults who experience a concussion will see a
resolution of symptoms within 10–14 d, between 20% and 40%
will experience symptoms more than 3 months post-injury.8,9
When symptoms persist beyond expected recovery, patients may
be diagnosed with post-concussional syndrome (PCS).10 Accord-
ing to the International Classiﬁcation of Disease-10 (ICD-10)
PCS criteria, PCS is a syndrome that describes the constellation
of persistent symptoms that develop following a concussion,
including headaches, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, difﬁculty
concentrating and performing mental tasks, impairment of mem-
ory, insomnia, and reduced tolerance to stress, emotional excite-
ment, or alcohol.11 In the past, some studies have used the term
PCS to refer to the acute symptoms in the weeks following
concussion; therefore, there has been a shift toward using the term
persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) in more recent
research. For the purpose of this study, we will use the term
PPCS for greater clarity on the persistent nature of the condition
experienced by our study cohort.
PPCS can be difﬁcult to treat, as many symptoms are nonspe-
ciﬁc, can be present in non-TBI populations, and also overlap with
the symptoms of common mental health disorders.12 Associated
musculoskeletal injuries at the time of concussion, especially
whiplash-type injuries, can also prolong recovery if inadequately
diagnosed and treated.13 Given its complexity, the Ontario Neuro-
trauma Foundation Guidelines for the treatment of concussion/mild
TBI and persistent symptoms recommend a comprehensive, mul-
tidisciplinary approach to patient-centered care.14,15
The persistence of post-concussion symptoms can have a great
impact on work, school, and social relationships leading to
reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL).2 In other chronic
conditions where clinical presentations and the extent of recovery
are variable, HRQOL is an important patient-reported outcome
that can guide rehabilitation goals.16 HRQOL is deﬁned as “a
person’s perspective on [their] subjective health condition, function-
ing, and well-being in the domains of physical, psychological,
social, and daily life”16 and can provide valuable information about
the success of interventions. The relationship between PPCS and
HRQOL is an emerging area of interest. A recent large cohort study
found that 6 months post-injury, adult patients with PPCS reported
signiﬁcantly lower HRQOL than patients with concussion who did
not develop PPCS following their injury.17 Mental health may be an
important contributor to HRQOL, as a recent study found that high
depression and anxiety scores were related to poorer HRQOL.18
However, most of the research investigating predictive factors for
reduced HRQOL has been conducted in pediatric populations,19,20
or in samples of highly specialized elite and professional ath-
letes.21,22 While sport-related concussions have been critical to
accelerating research in the ﬁeld, other mechanisms such as falls
and motor vehicle accidents account for a greater proportion of adult
concussion than sport or recreation.23
Factors such as older age, female gender, history of prior head
injuries, and premorbid mental health conditions have been
linked to the development of greater post-concussion symptom
burden.24 Previous studies have also shown that in patients with
PPCS, there is a relatively high prevalence of psychiatric
disorders (31%), depression (9%), anxiety (9%), and fatigue
(32%).25,26 It is unclear whether these or other factors inﬂuence
self-reported HRQOL. As such, there is a substantial need for
research examining the experiences of adults with PPCS and
what factors impact the quality of life. The primary objective of
this study was to examine how patient demographics, injury
characteristics, and clinical outcome measures of speciﬁc post-
concussion symptoms (fatigue, depression, anxiety) are related to
HRQOL in adults with PPCS. We hypothesize mood disorders
and fatigue substantially inﬂuence HRQOL, and therefore the
second objective of the study was to determine the relationship
between depressive symptoms at the time of clinic visit and
patient characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We examined a cohort of adult patients with PPCS presenting
to a specialized brain injury clinic in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
This study was nested in a larger study exploring the relationship
between growth hormone deﬁciency and clinical outcomes in
patients with PPCS and was approved by the Conjoint Research
Ethics Board at the University of Calgary (REB19-0663). As this
was a retrospective cohort study, informed consent was not
required. Prior to being seen in the clinic, individuals were asked
to complete a series of clinical questionnaires, including the
Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI),16 Rivermead
Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ),27 Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),28 Generalized Anxiety Disor-
der Scale-7 (GAD-7),29 and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).30
Data were collected prior to their ﬁrst visit to the clinic and
stored on an online platform (Research Electronic Data Capture
(REDCap) database) requiring multifactor authentication. A re-
search assistant was available for assistance via phone or email to
aid in the completion of the survey.
Participants
Data collection occurred between April 2018 and March 2020.
Inclusion criteria were (1) aged 18 and above; (2) diagnosis of
concussion (meeting the American Congress of Rehabilitation
diagnostic Criteria for mild TBI)31 and meeting ICD-10 criteria
for PCS11; (3) 3 months–5 years since the concussion; and (4)
completion of all clinical questionnaires. Self-reported patient
and injury characteristics were collected including age, sex, level of
education, employment status, months since injury, mechanism of
injury, whether there was loss of consciousness at time of injury, and
total number of self-reported previous concussions. Past psychiatric
history (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders)
was extracted from the medical records at the initial visit to the brain
injury clinic. Participants were excluded if the clinical outcome
questionnaires were not completed or they had a previous moderate/
severe TBI or other acquired brain injury.
Clinical Outcome Measures
Quality of Life After Brain Injury (QOLIBRI)
The QOLIBRI was developed to assess HRQOL in patients
who have sustained a TBI.16 This 37-item questionnaire consists
of 6 subscales (cognition, self, daily life and autonomy, social
relationships, emotions, and physical problems). Each subscale is

scored out of 5, which is then converted to a total score of 100,
with higher scores reﬂecting better HRQOL.16
Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ)
The RPQ is a frequently used measure of symptom burden in
PCS research.27 It is a 16-item measure of commonly reported
post-concussion symptoms with each item scored from 0 to 4. A
total score is calculated out of 64 with higher scores indicating
higher levels of symptom burden.
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
The PHQ-932 is a commonly used assessment tool to screen
for depression following concussion.28 It is a 9-item question-
naire that is scored out of 27 points. Depression scores are
classiﬁed as mild (5–9 points), moderate (10–14 points), moder-
ately-severe (15–19 points), and severe (20–27 points). Clinical-
ly, a score of 10 or greater suggests a need for treatment
intervention.32 Due to the clinical relevance of this cutoff, we
have dichotomized scores <10 as none to mild depression and
scores ≥10 as moderate or greater depression.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)
The GAD-7 is a brief validated measure of generalized anxiety
disorder.29 This is a 7-item questionnaire scored out of a total of
21 points. Anxiety scores are classiﬁed as mild (5–9 points),
moderate (10–14 points), and severe (15–21 points).
Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)
The FSS is a 9-item measure assessing the level of fatigue
using a 7-point Likert scale with a total score ranging from 9 to 63
points.30 Higher scores indicate greater fatigue.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to assess demographic and
injury characteristics. Stepwise hierarchical multiple regression
was used to analyze the associations between the QOLIBRI score
(dependent variable) and the independent variables, including the
number of previous concussions, presence of past psychiatric
history, RPQ, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and FSS scores. The model was
adjusted controlling for sex, age, and months since injury. Further
analysis of the PHQ-9 was completed with a binomial logistic
regression controlling for age, sex, and months since injury.
Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as p < 0.05. All analyses
were performed using SPSS 26 for Mac.33
RESULTS
Participant selection is presented in Figure 1. Between April
2018 and March 2020, approximately 848 new patients presented
to the outpatient brain injury clinic in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
Of these, 325 completed the intake questionnaires and were
screened for eligibility with 209 participants presenting with a
concussion. Overall, 125 participants met the inclusion criteria.
Of those screened for eligibility, reasons for exclusion included
alternative diagnosis than a concussion, having incomplete
primary outcome measures, or not meeting the criteria for
PPCS. Eligible participants were excluded if forms were incom-
plete. Common reasons for this included time constraints,
administration difﬁculties, and patient decline. Demographic and
injury characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Clinical outcome questionnaires are presented in Table 2.
Using the PHQ-9 screening tool, 72.8% of participants scored
≥10, which is categorized as having moderate or greater depres-
sion. On the GAD-7, 55.2% of participants had scores ≥10,
which is categorized as having moderate or greater anxiety.
Further, the average (±SD) PHQ-9, GAD-7, FSS, and RPQ
scores
were
13.3 ± 5.6,
10.54 ± 5.8,
43.18 ± 12.8,
and
37.25 ± 11.9, respectively. The average (±SD) QOLIBRI score
was 41.83 ± 17.4.
Premorbid psychiatric history was prevalent: 41.6% of parti-
cipants reported a pre-injury history of mental illness: 28.8%
depression, 25.6% anxiety, 9.6% PTSD, and 4.0% substance use
disorder. There were no participants with a history of bipolar or
psychotic disorders. Of the 52 participants reporting a past history
of psychiatric illness, 26 (50%) reported having 2 or more mental
health diagnoses.
The relationship between clinical outcome measures and
QOLIBRI scores is presented as scatterplots in Figure 2. The
PHQ-9 had the strongest correlation (r(123) = −.685, p < .001),
followed by the GAD-7 (r(123) = −.489, p < .001), the FSS
(r(123) = −.438,
p < .001),
and
the
RPQ
(r(123) = −.392,
p < 0.001). Next, a set of clinically relevant potential predictors
were chosen, including the number of previous concussions, past
psychiatric history, RPQ, FSS, PHQ-9, and GAD-7. Using
stepwise hierarchical multiple regression controlling for age at
assessment, sex, and months since injury, the PHQ-9, FSS, and
GAD-7 were signiﬁcant predictors of QOLBRI in the model.
Together, they accounted for 48.1% of the variance in QOLIBRI
scores (R2 = .481, p < .001). The PHQ-9 was associated with
42.0% of the variance (B = −1.305, s.e.(B) = .305, t = −4.281,
p < .001), FSS scores with 3.5% of the variance (B = −.252,
s.e.(B) = .103, t = −2.450, p = .016). and the GAD-7 was asso-
ciated
with
2.6%
of
the
variance
in
QOLIBRI
scores
(B = −.582, s.e.(B) = .267, t = −2.184, p = .31). Demographic
factors, past psychiatric history, and injury characteristics were
not signiﬁcant predictors of QOLIBRI scores.

We further analyzed the PHQ-9 by dichotomizing scores
based on the clinically relevant threshold of ≥10 representing
moderate or greater depression,32 using binomial logistic regres-
sion controlling for age, sex, and months since injury. Number of
prior concussions and GAD-7 scores were signiﬁcantly associat-
ed with scoring ≥10 on the PHQ-9. For every 1-point increase in
GAD-7 scores, participants were 1.38 times more likely to
score ≥10 on the PHQ-9 (OR 1.380; 95% CI: 1.131–1.682,
p = .001). For every additional previous concussion, participants
were 2.23 times more likely to score ≥10 on the PHQ-9 (OR
2.234; 95% CI: 1.059–4.716, p = 0.035). While these measures
were statistically signiﬁcant, given the small odds ratios, these

results are unlikely to be clinically signiﬁcant. Age, sex, months
since injury, loss of consciousness, past psychiatric history, RPQ
score, and FSS score were not signiﬁcant factors differentiating
participants with depression scores ≥10 on the PHQ-9.
DISCUSSION
The primary objective of this study was to identify factors
inﬂuencing HRQOL in adults with PPCS. We found measures of
depression, fatigue, and anxiety combined to signiﬁcantly predict
HRQOL in patients with PPCS. Age, sex, months since injury,
number of previous concussions, past psychiatric history, and
RPQ scores did not. Depression scores were the most signiﬁcant
predictor of HRQOL, accounting for 42% of the variance in
QOLIBRI scores. The secondary aim of the study was to deter-
mine if the severity of depression was inﬂuenced by patient
characteristics, past psychiatric history, injury characteristics, or
speciﬁc measures of symptom burden. We found over 72.8% of
the patients with PPCS in our cohort scored ≥10 on the PHQ-9
(moderate or greater depression) suggesting a need for treatment,
and PHQ-9 scores were positively associated with a greater
number of previous concussions and higher GAD-7 scores.
Health-related Quality of Life in Patients with PPCS
The Relationship between HRQOL and Depression
The vast majority of previous studies evaluating HRQOL
following
concussion
have
been
conducted
in
pediatric
and adolescent populations19,20,34 or in elite athletes.6,35 Prior
research has also seldom focused on participants experiencing
concussion symptoms months to years following their injury –
well beyond the expected concussion recovery.36 Of the few studies
speciﬁcally assessing depression and quality of life in patients with
PPCS, one was of military personnel at 6 months post-injury,37 and
the other included a mix of patients with PPCS and those whose
PPCS had resolved.18 Both of these studies found higher depression
scores were correlated to poorer HRQOL.18,37 This is in line with the
ﬁndings in our study, as the PHQ-9 score emerged as the most
signiﬁcant predictor of QOLIBRI scores in an adjusted regression
model. This is not surprising, given the well-established relationship

between depression and quality of life in both healthy cohorts38 and
those with other chronic health conditions.39-41
The Relationship between HRQOL and Fatigue
In addition to depression scores, the second signiﬁcant pre-
dictor of HRQOL was fatigue as measured by the FSS. Fatigue is
one of the most frequently reported chronic symptoms in patients
with PPCS,25 and it is also common in patients experiencing
depression.37 In one study, normative data for the FSS in a
healthy population showed a mean score of 20.7, and a score of
36 was used to differentiate between healthy controls and patients
with chronic diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple
sclerosis).30 In this study, 5% of healthy controls reported scores
of 36 or greater, compared to 91% of patients with multiple
sclerosis and 60% of patients with systemic lupus erythema-
tous.30 In our cohort, patients with PPCS experienced similar
levels of fatigue with 73.6% of participants scoring 36 or greater.
Similar to our results, a study on veterans with PPCS found both
depression and fatigue to be signiﬁcantly associated with poorer
HRQOL at 6 months post-injury.37
The Relationship between HRQOL and Anxiety
The relationship between anxiety and HRQOL in patients with
PPCS has rarely been studied, but has been explored in other
populations suffering from chronic disease.41 In our cohort, there
were high levels of anxiety based on their GAD-7 scores at clinic
assessment with 55.2% scoring in the moderate or greater
categories, although anxiety only accounted for a small percent-
age of variance in HRQOL. A recent study that used the
Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale-42 (DASS-42) in patients
with PPCS similarly found that anxiety scores negatively im-
pacted HRQOL.18 In further analysis, we found there was an
association between anxiety and depression, as higher GAD-7
scores were a signiﬁcant factor for scoring ≥10 on the PHQ-9.
Given that anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid
conditions,22 this ﬁnding is not surprising and assessment for
anxiety should be considered in patients with PPCS.
The Relationship between HRQOL and Concussion Symptoms
In this study, the RPQ, a general screen of concussion
symptoms, was not a signiﬁcant predictor of HRQOL. Current
literature is mixed on this topic. For example, a study of patients
with concussion 6 months post-injury reported an inverse rela-
tionship between RPQ and HRQOL with patients experiencing
PPCS having a greater than a 20% reduction of HRQOL.17 As
our study only included patients who met PPCS criteria, this may
suggest that among those with PPCS other factors such as mental
health are stronger contributors to HRQOL than the severity of
symptom burden alone. Conversely, our ﬁndings support previ-
ous studies that have failed to elicit a signiﬁcant predictive

relationship between measures of post-concussion symptom
burden and HRQOL. In a study of older adults (65 years and
older), higher scores on the RPQ were associated with higher
levels of disability at 6 months post-concussion, but were not
predictive of HRQOL.42 Another study of middle-aged adults
similarly found no relationship between symptom burden and
HRQOL, and the only factor that contributed to poor HRQOL
was unemployment at 1 month post-injury.36 The inconsistency
in the literature may be due to the heterogeneous nature of PPCS,
and that one global symptom score, such as the RPQ, may be too
general to capture the relationship between symptom clusters and
HRQOL. Given that the PHQ-9, FSS, and GAD-7 scores were all
signiﬁcant predictors of QOLIBRI in the regression model, and
RPQ was not, measures of individual post-concussion symptoms
may be more clinically relevant than measures of overall symp-
tom burden in the context of HRQOL.
The Relationship between Time since Injury and HRQOL
We found months since injury did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
HRQOL in patients with PPCS. Conversely, in a prospective
longitudinal study of concussion outcomes in adults at 1, 6, and
12 months post-injury, HRQOL was different at 1 and 6 months
post-injury.43 However, the vast majority of participants achieved
full recovery by 1 year and were indistinguishable from the
orthopedic injury control group on both the RPQ and QOLI-
BRI.43 Of those who experienced persistent symptoms and poor
HRQOL at 1 year, the majority had a psychological risk factor
(depression, traumatic stress, and/or low resilience) identiﬁed at
1 month post-injury.43 Our cohort represents a subset of patients
experiencing PPCS beyond the expected recovery timeline (average
time since injury was 14.8 months) and may require a different
treatment focus compared to those patients within a year of injury.
The Relationship between Age, Sex, and HRQOL
We found no relationship between age or sex and HRQOL in
patients with PPCS. This differs from the ﬁndings of a study by
Yousefzadeh-Chabok and colleagues, which found women and
those of younger age18–35 had signiﬁcantly lower HRQOL scores
6 months post-concussion.44 This study used a different measure
of HRQOL, the Short Form-36, and it is possible that the
difference in ﬁndings is due to different measurement tools.
Additionally, this sample was recruited from patients who were
admitted to hospital in Iran for their initial concussion,44 in
comparison to referral to a specialized outpatient concussion
clinic in our study. Finally, Yousefzadeh-Chabok and colleagues’
data were collected at 6 months post-injury compared to our study
in which the average participant was greater than 1-year post-
injury, thus reﬂecting a more chronic condition that may not be
inﬂuenced by age and sex.
Depression in Patients with PPCS
The Relationship between Depression and Clinical, Injury, and
Demographic Characteristics in Patients with PPCS
It is believed that the development and duration of PPCS is the
result of a complex interplay of social, physical, cognitive, and
psychological factors, and that the perception of one’s injury may
be inﬂuenced by co-occurring depression.38 In Canada, the
lifetime prevalence of depression is 11.2%, and is twice as high
among women (14.0%) as it is among men (8.4%).45 Previous
literature suggests the prevalence of depression at 1-year post-
concussion is approximately 9%,26 however, this includes both
patients who have recovered from their initial injury and those who
experience PPCS. In our cohort, 28.8% of participants reported a
pre-injury history of depression, although 72.8% of participants
scored ≥10 on the PHQ-9 post-injury. This implies that even those
without a depression history are still at risk of developing depressive
symptoms when experiencing prolonged recovery from concussion
and that multiple other factors may contribute.
This study found that higher GAD-7 scores and a greater
number of prior concussions were factors signiﬁcantly associated
with a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Similar to previous literature, we
found anxiety was high in patients with PPCS26 and was signiﬁ-
cantly related to depression. Though not speciﬁcally explored in
patients with PPCS, other studies evaluating patients with chronic
disease have found anxiety and depression are often comorbid
conditions.41 We also found a greater number of prior concus-
sions was signiﬁcantly associated with depression severity in our
cohort. A systematic review completed in 2007 suggests a
potential dose-dependent response with regards to the number
of head injuries and risk of developing depression.6 A recent
study on patients with PPCS also found that a higher number of
prior concussions was associated with elevated depression
scores.18 Though not explored in this study, other important
contributors to post-concussion depression severity include social
support, coping skills, and access to specialized healthcare
services.46 As depression has such a signiﬁcant impact on
HRQOL, clinicians working with patients who have PPCS
should screen for depression, even if there is no past medical
history of psychiatric illness.
We did not ﬁnd a relationship between depression and age,
sex, past psychiatric history, months since injury, loss of con-
sciousness, RPQ scores, or FSS scores in patients with PPCS.
Previous literature on this topic is mixed. In contrast to our study,
Hart and colleagues found that sex and age were factors associ-
ated with depression after concussion, as female sex and younger
age were associated with higher rates of depression than male sex
or older age.47 However, this study did not differentiate between
patients who had recovered from their injury versus those with
PPCS. Similar to our study, Iverson and colleagues found no sex
or age differences in post-concussion depression rates, but in
contrast to our study found pre-injury mental health history was
signiﬁcantly associated with the development of depression post-
injury.24 Finally, a premorbid history of depression and anxiety
has been associated with post-concussion depression and anxi-
ety,8,24,48,49 however, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship
between past psychiatric history and severity of post-injury
depression. As well, previous studies have found a signiﬁcant
relationship between severity of PPCS (as measured by RPQ
scores) and depression, whereas we did not.37
Limitations
This study has limitations as it represents a cohort of parti-
cipants at one time point (initial assessment at an outpatient brain
injury clinic), does not examine changes in HRQOL across
recovery, and does not have a healthy control group. These
patients are a chronically symptomatic group who require spe-
cialized treatment for PPCS, and are not representative of all

individuals who experience a concussion. Additionally, the
results are based on self-reported tools and brief mental health
screens (PHQ-9 and GAD-7). These tools reﬂect symptomatolo-
gy, but in practice require further evaluation to make formal
diagnoses like major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety
disorder. There may also be gender and/or cultural differences in
responding to certain items on these tools, such as tearfulness on
the RPQ. Among the cohort, there was a signiﬁcant level of
mental health burden present with more than two-thirds reporting
moderate or greater depression scores. Given depression scores
were the most signiﬁcant predictor of HRQOL in our cohort, our
ﬁndings may be less helpful in addressing quality of life in
patients with PPCS who are not experiencing mental health
challenges. Finally, only self-reported concussion history was
collected and no previous concussion characteristics were asked.
In future studies, collecting concussion history characteristics or
using a validated concussion history screening tool should be
implemented.
CONCLUSION
Patients with PPCS are complex and require a multimodal
approach to treatment. Our study found that in patients with
PPCS, depression, fatigue, and anxiety were signiﬁcant predic-
tors of HRQOL, and that a history of concussion and anxiety may
contribute to more severe depressive symptoms. This suggests a
comprehensive approach that addresses the contribution of past
medical history, mental health, and fatigue are vital to addressing
HRQOL in patients with PPCS. The study provides new infor-
mation to the existing literature, as we explored the relationship
between HRQOL and symptoms in middle-aged adults with
concussions due to varying causes. Compared to previous popu-
lations studied, this patient population is unique as they have
different external stressors than those at either end of the age
spectrum, such as work, family, and ﬁnancial responsibilities.
Loss of function and decline in quality of life has a substantial
impact during this time of life to the individual as well as to the
economy. The results from this study provide important knowl-
edge to aid in targeted treatments to address quality of life in
patients experiencing PPCS, and highlight the importance of
mental health assessment in this population.
