The constellation of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, collectively known as
postconcussion syndrome (PCS), is not uniquely associated with concussion, making the
etiology of chronic postconcussion symptoms controversial. The current study compared
percentages of individuals meeting symptom-based criteria for PCS in a population-based
sample of veterans composed of subgroups with various psychiatric diagnoses, a history of
mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and healthy controls. Participants were identified from
4462 randomly sampled male U.S. Army veterans who served during the Vietnam era. Only
32% of veterans with a history of MTBI met DSM-IV symptom criteria for PCS as
compared to 40% of those diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 50% with
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 57% with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 91%
with somatization disorder. Results were consistent with existing literature showing that the
PCS symptoms are not unique to concussion, and also provide important base-rate
information for neuropsychologists practicing in both clinical and personal injury forensic
settings.

(Alves, Macciocchi, & Barth, 1993; Dikmen, McLean, & Temkin, 1986; Hartlage,
Durant-Wilson, & Patch, 2001; Powell, Collin, & Sutton, 1996) or even years post
injury (Alexander, 1992; Hartlage et al., 2001; Deb, Lyons, & Koutzoukis, 1999).
Common symptom complaints include headaches, balance problems, dizziness,
fatigue, depression, anxiety, irritability, and memory and attention difficulties. It is
important to note that this constellation of physical, emotional, and cognitive
symptom complaints is only one part of the formal diagnostic criteria for
postconcussion syndrome (PCS).
Despite the frequency with which MTBI occurs, the incidence, cause, and
persistence of symptoms following an uncomplicated MTBI remain controversial in
the medical-legal arena. Determining whether MTBI is the cause of post-acute or
chronic symptoms is extremely difficult. Even objective findings suggesting either
residual neuroimaging or neurocognitive abnormalities would not necessarily mean
that subjective symptom complaints were related to a past MTBI. Traditionally,
medical causality follows a linear model in which a specific event (infection, injury,
etc.) leads to symptoms, which are verified by history, medical examination, and
diagnostic tests. A diagnosis is established when findings point to one particular
etiological explanation and are inconsistent with alternative etiologies. However, the
particular symptom complaints after a MTBI are not exclusive to PCS. Recent
studies suggest that PCS complaints after a concussion are more likely due to
psychological factors, such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD, rather than a MTBI
(Lippa, Pastorek, Benge, & Thornton, 2010; Meares et al., 2011; Ponsford et al.,
2012; Wilk et al., 2010).
Increasingly researchers are calling into question the validity of the PCS
symptom constellation. To qualify as a syndrome, there must be a set of symptoms
or characteristics indicating the existence of a condition present in persons who have
the condition and absent in those who do not have it (Larrabee, 2005). In fact,
symptoms associated with PCS are not specific or unique to MTBI and are common
in other conditions such as chronic pain (Smith-Seemiller, Fow, Kant, & Franzen,
2003), depression (Gunstad & Suhr, 2001; Iverson, 2006), and even healthy
community and student samples (Chan, 2001; Garden & Sullivan, 2010; Iverson &
Lange, 2003; Vanderploeg, Curtiss, Luis, & Salazar, 2007; Wang, Chan, & Deng,
2006). The non-specificity of PCS symptoms (PCSS) presents a major diagnostic
challenge for clinicians.
The challenge for the neuropsychologist (either in a legal setting or clinical
setting) is to determine whether these self-reported, non-specific symptoms are more
likely than not related to an often remote injury event during which a MTBI
possibly occurred. The evidentiary standard in personal injury cases is 51%,
meaning that ‘‘the trier of fact favors parties having at least 51% of the evidence in
their favor’’ (Greiffenstein & Cohen, 2005, p. 35). As such it would be extremely
useful for the expert to be able to say that, based on prevalence studies, it is more or
less likely that the reported PCSS are due to the MTBI versus psychiatric disorders
and/or chronic pain, when those conditions are present. However, there is no
existing literature to show relevant PCSS prevalence across diagnoses within the
same overall population-based sample. Although several studies have shown high
rates of PCSS in a variety of patient populations as well as healthy control samples,
no one has completed a comparative study of PCSS frequency within the same

sample across diagnostic conditions and healthy controls. The current study
examined the incidence of satisfying only the symptom-based criteria for PCS in a
population-based sample of community dwelling, Vietnam-era U.S. military
veterans.
Also examined were the frequencies of reporting two specific PCSS: headaches
and dizziness. Recent research has found these two symptoms are most uniquely
associated with MTBI. Vanderploeg et al. (2007) and Vanderploeg, Belanger, and
Curtiss (2009) reported that individuals with a history of MTBI were more likely
than healthy controls to report symptoms of headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to
light, sleep problems, double vision, and memory problems. However, only
headaches, sleep problems, and memory problems remained significant after
demographic, medical, psychiatric, and other injury variables were controlled,
although the odds ratio for dizziness remained the largest. Similarly, Hoge et al.
(2008) reported that soldiers with MTBI were significantly more likely to report a
high number of physical health symptoms. However, after adjustment for PTSD
and depression, only headaches remained significantly associated with MTBI,
although again, dizziness had the highest odds ratio associated with MTBI.
METHOD
Participants
The data utilized in the current investigation were those of the Vietnam
Experience Study (Centers for Disease Control, 1988a, 1988b). These data were
collected in the mid-1980s as part of an investigation of the effects of the Vietnam
experience on veterans. This nonclinical, population-based sample consisted of 4462
randomly selected, male U.S. Army veterans who entered the military between
January 1965 and December 1971 serving during the Vietnam era. Of these
participants, 56% served in Vietnam and the remaining participants served in the
U.S., Germany, or Korea.
Participants were flown from their city of residence to a city in the
southwestern United States for a 3-day comprehensive evaluation involving
extensive medical, psychological, and neuropsychological evaluations. All partici-
pants provided written informed consent and experimental procedures complied
with the code of ethics of the Institutional Review Board. Data from the original
study were collected in a research context—a non-clinical and non-medicolegal/
compensation setting. Participants were told the nature of the study was to evaluate
the effects of the Vietnam experience. Therefore potential secondary gain or other
biases were unlikely to have played a role in evaluation results.
The participants ranged in age from 31 to 48 years (M ¼ 37.8; SD ¼ 2.5), were
predominantly non-Hispanic Caucasians (82%) and completed an average of 13
years of formal education (M ¼ 13.3; SD ¼ 2.3).
Procedures

variables included in the original study, measures used in the current study included:
basic demographic information, a 30-minute structured medical history question-
naire and a structured psychiatric interview, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule
(DIS), Version III-A (Robins et al., 1987). Information about a history of TBI was
determined from the following two questions: (a) Since your discharge from active
duty, have you injured your head? and (b) Did you lose consciousness as a result of
the head injury? If participants were unclear if they had lost consciousness, they
were asked if they had ‘‘blacked out’’ in the accident. Thus the TBI criteria included
a disturbance of consciousness or period of post-traumatic amnesia, not just
unconsciousness. Individuals who reported hospitalization after the TBI were
excluded from analyses. Therefore the TBI group can most likely be considered a
mild TBI sample. Given that the evaluations were conducted approximately 16
years after military discharge, the TBI would, on average, have likely occurred
about 8 years prior to the evaluation. Unfortunately no other information was
collected regarding when the injury occurred and all data are self-report.
Psychiatric diagnoses were determined via the DIS Version III-A (DIS-III-A),
administered by trained examiners under supervision of doctoral level psychologists.
The DIS-III-A is a standardized questionnaire used to assess the prevalence of
psychiatric disorders in the general population. The instrument consists of modules
that are grouped together in diagnostic categories (e.g., anxiety, mood, substance
use). Diagnoses on this version of the instrument were made according to DSM-III
(American Psychiatric Association, 1980), not DSM-IV, and were generally
considered to represent ‘‘current’’ diagnoses. To be classified as having psychiatric
diagnoses in the present study, participants had to endorse the pertinent criteria
within the last year. Of the 4462 individuals, the following diagnostically unique
subgroups were identified: major depressive disorder (MDD) (n ¼ 58), generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD) (n ¼ 141), somatization disorder (n ¼ 21), alcohol abuse/
dependence (n ¼ 391), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n ¼ 130), MTBI
(n ¼ 154), and healthy controls (n ¼ 3001; i.e., no MTBI and no psychiatric
diagnoses). Because of the small sample size those in the somatization disorder
group included those who also met criteria for up to one other psychiatric diagnosis
(i.e., nine with somatization only, two with comorbid PTSD, seven with comorbid
GAD, and three with comorbid alcohol abuse/dependence). Additionally, sub-
groups with multiple diagnoses were included (see Table 1) for a total number of
participants equaling 4422. A total of 40 participants were excluded either because
they were hospitalized after the TBI or because not all psychiatric subgroups were
included for this study (e.g., drug abuse/dependence and other affective disorders).
PCSS frequencies were captured from the medical history questionnaire
administered by physician assistants based on the criteria listed in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV; American
Psychiatric Association, 1994) and the International Statistical Classification of
Disease and Related Health Problems 10th Edition (ICD-10; World Health
Organization, 1992). Because the objective was to identify PCSS in a non-clinical,
non-referred population, many of whom had not experienced a head injury, the
following criteria were not included in the PCSS diagnosis: a history of head injury,
neuropsychological evidence of cognitive problems, or preoccupation with symp-
toms. Participants met the DSM-IV criteria for PCSS if three or more of the

following symptoms were endorsed: fatigue; sleep problems; headaches; dizziness;
irritability; and either anxiety, depression, or mood lability. The ICD-10 PCSS
criteria require three or more of the following: (1) headache, dizziness, malaise,
fatigue, or noise intolerance; (2) irritability, depression, anxiety, or emotional
lability; (3) subjective concentration, memory, or intellectual difficulties; (4)
insomnia. We adopted the Mittenberg and Strauman (2000) PCS classification
scheme for the ICD-10 criteria.
Analyses
Frequencies of the PCSS, as well as frequencies of headaches and dizziness,
were determined for each subgroup and odds ratios for PCSS, headaches, or
dizziness were calculated using the healthy control subgroup for comparison.
RESULTS
Overall findings are presented in Table 1. A total of 32% of veterans with a
history of concussion without any comorbid Axis I psychiatric disorder met DSM-
IV criteria for PCSS (27% met ICD-10 PCSS criteria), as compared to 40% of those
diagnosed with PTSD (39% ICD-10), 50% with GAD (41% ICD-10), 57% with
MDD (55%), and 91% with somatization disorder (91% ICD-10). The only
diagnostic subgroup that had a lower frequency of PCSS than MTBI was alcohol
abuse/dependence (26% DSM-IV; 24% ICD-10).
When examining comorbid diagnostic groups, 75% of those that were
diagnosed with comorbid MDD and GAD met DSM-IV criteria for PCSS (77%
ICD-10) versus 80% (80% ICD-10) of those with comorbid MDD, GAD, and
MTBI. Additionally, 85% of veterans diagnosed with comorbid MDD and PTSD
met DSM-IV criteria for PCSS (86% ICD-10), the same frequency whether or not
MTBI was comorbid. The two highest multiple diagnostic subgroups that met
DSM-IV criteria for PCSS were GAD, PTSD, and MTBI at 92% (100% ICD-10)
and MDD, GAD, and PTSD also at 92% (96% ICD-10).
With regard to headaches and dizziness, somatization disorder had the highest
percentage at 76% and 81%, respectively, whereas veterans diagnosed with a
history of MTBI had some of the lowest frequencies at 27% and 20%, respectively
(see Table 1).
DISCUSSION
Although several studies have shown high rates of PCSS in a variety of patient
populations as well as healthy control samples, prior to this study no one has
completed a comparative analysis of PCSS frequency within the same sample across
diagnostic conditions and healthy controls. Like previous studies (Chan, 2001;
Garden & Sullivan, 2010; Gunstad & Suhr, 2001; Iverson, 2006; Iverson & Lange,
2003; Smith-Seemiller et al., 2003; Vanderploeg et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2006),
current findings again demonstrate that PCSS are not unique to concussion. The
symptoms and problems typically conceptualized as comprising PCS are non-
specific; they can follow a MTBI, or they can arise from other conditions singly or

in combination. In the current population-based sample those with somatization
disorder, MDD, GAD, or PTSD had higher frequencies of PCSS than individuals
with a history of concussion. With increasing numbers of psychiatric conditions, the
frequency of PCSS increased. With one psychiatric comorbidity, a history of
concussion increased the frequency of PCSS. However, with two or more
psychiatric comorbidities, a history of concussion added minimally to PCSS
frequency. The same pattern of findings was seen with the individual symptoms of
headaches and dizziness.
The present findings have a great deal of relevance in medical-legal contexts
where there is uncertainty about the causation of reported symptoms. One expert
may assert that the presence of PCSS verifies that a suspect MTBI was in fact a
MTBI and that the symptoms are the result, even if the claimant has comorbid
PTSD and Depression. In contrast, the current findings suggest that it is more likely
that the PCSS are secondary to PTSD and Depression, and that the suspect MTBI
plays no role in the current symptom presentation.
The experienced clinician who works with this patient population knows that
a reasonable perspective for conceptualization is biopsychosocial. In all cases
clinicians should carefully study the history and progression of symptoms and
problems, and systematically conduct a differential diagnostic assessment examining
competing explanations for the symptoms. The current study’s findings would be a
valuable aid in this process.
From a theoretical perspective the current data can be seen as consistent with
the hypothesis that chronic PCS following a concussion may be a form of
somatoform disorders (McCrea, 2007) given that 91% of those with somatization
disorder met symptom-based criteria for PCSS, a substantially higher frequency
than veterans with a remote history of concussion. However, at the same time the
finding that a comorbid concussion added to the frequency of PCSS over and above
the presence of all single psychiatric conditions suggests that a history of
concussion, even in a chronic state, has some additional unique contribution to
the presence of PCSS. In all cases the frequency of PCSS with multiple diagnoses,
with or without a history of concussion, was less than summative of the unique
diagnostic subgroups’ frequencies. This finding suggests a possible common
mechanism that may reflect PCS (as well as the unique symptoms of headaches,
dizziness, and others), being associated with increased levels of stress or distress,
mediated through a type of somatoform response.
An important advantage of these data is that the set of variables was obtained
in a non-clinical, non-referred, population-based randomly selected sample and
without regard to MTBI status. Therefore the data are likely free of MTBI-
attributable reporting bias. The data collection situation in the current study is
similar to that of clinical practice where details regarding the presence, severity, and
time frame of a MTBI typically are entirely self-report.
Several factors may limit the generalizability of this study. The sample was
entirely male. Given today’s military composition it is possible that the results
would be different if groups were assessed on demographic factors alone, i.e., gender
and ethnicity. However, it is unlikely to change the overall result that PCSS
frequencies are significantly higher among various psychiatric diagnostic groups
than in individuals with chronic MTBI. Another limitation was that, because we

relied on archival data that were collected for another purpose, details of injury
severity, time post onset, and compensation status related to MBTI are unknown.
In addition, all information about MTBI was based on self-report unsubstantiated
by other data. Also lacking is any information about additional head injuries prior
to or during military service.
