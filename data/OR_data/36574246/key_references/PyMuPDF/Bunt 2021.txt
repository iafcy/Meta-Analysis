ABSTRACT
Introduction: Recovery and return to play are important milestones for athletes who sustain sport- 
related concussions (SRC). Several factors have been shown to influence resolution of post- 
concussion related symptoms (PCS), but resilience, a trait that reflects the ability to overcome 
adversity, is another factor that may influence recovery. The aim of this study was to determine the 
relationship of resilience with resolution of symptoms during recovery in adolescents and young 
adults following SRC.
Method: This prospective study is part of the North Texas Concussion Registry (ConTex). Subjects 
(N = 332) aged 13 to 25 years who sustained a SRC within 10 days of presenting to clinic were 
evaluated at two time points: initial clinical visit and three-month follow-up. Resilience was 
measured by the self-report Brief Resilience Survey (BRS) and PCS by the Sport Concussion 
Assessment Tool-5 Symptom Evaluation Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS). Recovery was 
determined by self-reported return to sports/physical activity and percent back to normal.
Results: Repeated measures ANCOVA and linear regression models showed that lower resilience 
ratings at initial visit were associated with a greater number and severity of PCSS symptoms along 
with higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during recovery from SRC. At three months, 
subjects with lower initial resilience ratings were less likely to report feeling back to normal and 
had greater aggravation of symptoms from physical and cognitive activity even when they had 
returned to sports/physical activity.
Conclusions: Lower resilience was associated with greater symptoms and delayed recovery from 
SRC. Results suggest that resilience may be another important factor to address in recovery from 
SRC. Future research is needed to examine the extent to which resilience measured after SRC 
reflects pre-injury characteristics and to better inform the development of interventions to pro­
mote resilience during recovery.

Introduction
Participation in sports and exercise in the United States 
has steadily increased since 2003, with 25.9% of those 
aged 15–24 engaged in some form of sport or exercise 
(Woods, 2017). With this rise in participation comes 
concern regarding sport-related concussion (SRC) in 
athletes and physically active individuals. An estimated 
2.5 million high school students in the U.S. reported 
sustaining a concussion in 2017, with prevalence in 
athletes being significantly greater than that of non- 
athletes (DePadilla et al., 2018). In a slightly older popu­
lation of 954 undergraduate university students, SRC 
accounted for 35.6% of all concussions (Breck et al., 
2019). Recovery and clearance for return to play are 
paramount for athletes who have sustained SRC, with 
resolution of post-concussion-related symptoms being 
a key factor (McCrory et al., 2017). Premorbid psycho­
logical factors such as anxiety, depression, and resilience 
may affect symptom severity and influence recovery 
(Durish et al., 2019; Iverson et al., 2017; Lange et al., 
2011), although not much research has specifically 
addressed resilience in this context.
Resilience has been defined as a personality trait 
demonstrating “the ability to bounce back or cope suc­
cessfully despite substantial adversity” (Rutter, 1985). 
The definition of resilience has evolved over time and 
has been conceptualized to include a framework of 
individual, family, and social protective factors and

possibly an interaction between risk factors and protec­
tive resources (Haase, 2004; Neils-Strunjas et al., 2017). 
It may function as a developmental process (Gillespie 
et al., 2007) or a positive adaptation following 
a significant threat or adversity (Luthar et al., 2000). 
For the current study, resilience was defined as the 
ability to “bounce back” or recover from a stress- 
inducing event such as an injury (Smith et al., 2008). 
Resilience as such has been measured by several self- 
rated scales including The Resilience Scale (Wagnild & 
Young, 1993), the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale 
(Connor & Davidson, 2003), and the Brief Resilience 
Scale (BRS; Smith et al., 2008). Resilience has been 
found to affect rehabilitation and adaptation to a wide 
range of acquired brain injuries (Neils-Strunjas et al., 
2017), including mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or 
concussion (Durish et al., 2019; Kreutzer et al., 2016; 
Losoi et al., 2015; McCauley et al., 2013; Rainey et al., 
2014).
Low resilience, as specifically assessed by the BRS, has 
been shown to have a negative association with recovery 
following various physical injuries and after surgery. 
Patients with orthopedic injuries and low resilience 
were found to experience decreased functionality during 
recovery following surgery compared to patients with 
higher BRS scores (Tokish et al., 2017). In studies of 
patients with concussion from various causes, high resi­
lience 
(BRS) 
predicted 
lower 
scores 
on 
the 
Neurobehavioural Symptom Inventory, a widely used 
multidimensional symptom measure (Cicerone & 
Kalmar, 1995; Sullivan et al., 2015). Whether the rela­
tionship between resilience and post-concussion recov­
ery applies specifically to SRC has yet to be determined. 
The objective of this investigation was to determine if 
low resilience would be associated with higher self- 
reported post-concussion symptoms, anxiety, depres­
sion, and prolonged recovery from SRC in an adolescent 
and young adult population.
Methods
Study population and participants
This prospective study included 332 participants aged 
13–25 years diagnosed with a recent SRC, enrolled within 
ten days of injury, at one of five North Texas Concussion 
Registry (ConTex) clinic sites between January 2015 and 
April 2020 who completed both initial and three-month 
follow-up assessments. A standardized, multimodal 
approach was used at all sites to confirm diagnosis 
(Cullum et al., 2020; Henry et al., 2016; McCrory et al., 
2017). The University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center Institutional Review Board provided approval 
for participating sites and written informed consent was 
obtained from all subjects. For patients less than 18 years 
of age, participant assent was obtained with informed 
consent of the parent/legal guardian for enrollment in 
the study.
Procedures and measures
Following a diagnosis of concussion at initial clinic visit, 
eligible participants completed demographic, medical 
history, and injury related information. The Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006), Patient 
Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009), 
the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-5 Symptom 
Evaluation Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (SCAT-5 
PCSS; Echemendia et al., 2017), and the BRS (Smith 
et al., 2008) were completed by participants. They also 
rated the percent to which they felt “back to normal” at 
the time of initial evaluation. Three-month follow-up 
surveys were completed via e-mail, which included 
these same measures. Data entry from each study site 
was managed using REDCap (Harris et al., 2019, 2009).
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measures included self-reported 
severity of symptoms as measured by the SCAT-5 PCSS. 
Severity for each of the PCSS items was measured on 
a 7-point scale that ranged 0 (none) – 6 (severe). The total 
number of endorsed symptoms ranged 0–22 and the total 
symptom severity ranged 0–122. Exacerbation of PCSS 
symptoms by physical or cognitive activity was deter­
mined by a yes or no answer. Levels of self-reported 
anxiety and depression post injury were measured by 
the GAD-7 (0–28) and PHQ-8 (0–32), respectively. 
Recovery at three months was assessed by subjects’ indi­
cation that he/she had returned to play or normal physi­
cal activities and their report of percent back to normal 
functioning.
Independent variable
The BRS is a six-item instrument developed to quantify 
the degree of resilience perceived by an individual and 
has been shown to be valid and reliable in a variety of 
populations (Rodríguez-Rey et al., 2016; Smith et al., 
2008; Windle et al., 2011). Each item on the BRS is 
scored on a 1 (low) – 5 (high) Likert scale and the 
Total BRS score is the average of the six items. To 
provide clinical utility and align with other research 
which provided low and high resilience groupings 
(Tokish et al., 2017), total BRS scores were classified

into three resilience groups: Low (1.00–2.99), Average 
(3.00 to 4.30), and High (4.31–5.00) based on published 
guidelines (Smith et al., 2013).
Statistical analyses
Sample means and standard deviations were used to 
describe continuous variables and frequencies (percentage) 
were used to characterize categorical variables. Prior to 
analysis of PCSS, GAD-7, and PHQ-8 outcome measures, 
statistical assumptions were examined, and log base 10 
transformations were performed to address issues of 
unequal group variances and non-normal distributions 
on all measures. Analyses were conducted on the trans­
formed variables and then presented in tables and figures 
by back transforming the measures. For age and time to 
clinic, t-tests were performed to determine differences 
between sexes. ANOVA was conducted to determine dif­
ferences between resilience groups. When the effects for 
ANOVA were significant, Bonferroni post hoc pairwise 
group comparisons were performed. Pearson’s Chi- 
Square analyses or Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate, 
were used to examine differences in participant categorical 
demographics, medical history, and injury characteristics 
by sex and resilience groups. Tukey-type post hoc propor­
tions tests for group differences were conducted when Chi- 
Square was significant (Zar, 1996).
Separate linear mixed models analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) examined resilience groups at two time 
points (initial evaluation and three-month follow-up) in 
terms of the total number of endorsed PCSS symptoms, 
PCSS total symptom severity, GAD-7, PHQ-8, and parti­
cipants’ perception of their recovery (percent back to 
normal). Because the literature supports outcome differ­
ences by sex and history of depression in symptom 
reporting, both were included as covariates in the model 
if p < .15. When an effect was significant for any of the 
linear mixed models, Bonferroni post-hoc pairwise com­
parisons were performed. Stepwise multiple regression 
analyses were performed last in order to determine the 
relationship of resilience with other factors which may 
predict symptom recovery. Separate analyses were con­
ducted to examine prediction of the total number of 
endorsed PCSS symptoms and PCSS Total Symptom 
Severity at three-month follow-up using the following 
measures from initial evaluation: number of PCSS symp­
toms or total severity of PCSS symptoms, Total BRS score, 
GAD-7 (anxiety at time of initial evaluation), PHQ-8 
(depressive symptoms at time of initial evaluation), sex, 
history of depression, history of anxiety, and reported 
amnesia at time of injury. These predictors were chosen 
a priori based on previously published findings (Iverson 
et al., 2017; Meehan et al., 2016) or presence of significant 
differences in these measures between resilience groups at 
initial visit. Pairwise Pearson and point-biserial correla­
tions were performed to examine multicollinearity across 
measures. All statistical analyses were carried out using 
SAS Software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.J.) and 
SPSS V26. The level of significance was set at α = .05 (two- 
tailed) unless otherwise specified.
Results
Participant demographic and clinical characteristics are 
summarized in Table 1. There were 332 participants 
(Male n = 179, 53.9%, Female n = 153, 46.1%), with 
a mean age at time of injury of 15.1 years (Median = 15). 
Football (28.3%, n = 94), soccer (24.1%, n = 80), basketball 
(12.7%, n = 42), volleyball (7.8%, n = 26), wrestling (3.9%, 
n = 13), and cheerleading (3.3%, n = 11) accounted for 80% 
of all injuries. Scores on the BRS were used to divide 
participants into three resilience groups: low (n = 41), aver­
age (n = 199), and high (n = 92), with no significant 
difference in percentage of males and females between 
groups. Participants identified predominantly as White 
(78.0%, n = 259) and ethnically as non-Hispanic/Latino 
(82.5%, n = 274). There were no significant sex differences 
in terms of demographic, medical history, or injury-related 
factors. The low resilience group reported a more frequent 
history of depression (12.2%) than the average (3.0%) and 
high (2.2%) resilience groups (p = .013). At initial visit, all 
resilience groups differed significantly (p < .001) in GAD-7 
scores. In post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons the low resi­
lience group (6.63 SD = 4.58) was higher than both the 
average resilience (3.65 SD = 2.76, p < .001) and high 
resilience (1.82 SD = 3.82, p < .001) groups, which were 
also significantly different from each other (p = .044). The 
resilience groups were also significantly different on the 
PHQ-8 at initial visit, with the low resilience group scoring 
higher (6.93 SD = 4.45) than either the average (3.96 
SD = 4.03) or high resilience groups (2.93 SD = 3.34), 
which did not significantly differ from each other 
(p = .114).
A summary of the results of the linear mixed models 
for PCSS symptoms, GAD-7, PHQ-8, and percent back 
to normal are found in Table 2 and Figure 1. The multi­
ple regression analyses predicting number of endorsed 
symptoms and symptom severity at three months are 
found in Table 3.
Covariates
Sex was a significant covariate for the number of PCSS 
symptoms (p = .092) and PCSS total symptom severity 
(p = .027). History of depression was a significant cov­
ariate for GAD-7 (p < .001) and PHQ-8 (p = .035).

PCSS symptoms by resilience group
For the number of PCSS symptoms endorsed, there 
was a significant interaction for BRS group by visit 
(p = .048). At the initial clinic visit, all three groups 
were similar in number of PCSS symptoms endorsed 
(p > .118), but at three-month follow-up, the Low 
Resilience Group endorsed significantly more PCSS 
symptoms than either the Average (p = .006) or High 
Resilience (p < .001) Groups, but the Average and 
High 
Groups 
were 
not 
significantly 
different 
(p = .749).
The main effects for Resilience Group and Visit 
were both significant for number of PCSS symptoms 
endorsed (p < .001 and p < .001, respectively) and 
PCSS Total Symptom Severity (p < .001 and 
p < .001, respectively). As expected with recovery, 
the number of PCSS Symptoms endorsed and PCSS 
Total Symptom Severity at the initial visit for each 
group was significantly higher than at the three- 
month visit (both p < .001). Pairwise analysis 
showed that the groups at initial visit were not 
significantly different in terms of the number of 
PCSS symptoms endorsed (all p > .118) or PCSS 
Total Symptom Severity (all p > 0.064). However, at 
the three-month follow-up, the Low Resilience 
Group endorsed more PCSS symptoms than either 
the Average (p = .006) or High Resilience (p < .001) 
Groups. Average and High Resilience Groups did 
not differ at three months (p = .749). At three 
months the Low Resilience Group also had 
a 
significantly 
higher 
PCSS 
Total 
Symptom 
Severity than both the Average (p < .004) and 
High Resilience Groups (p = .002), and the 
Average and High Groups were again not signifi­
cantly different (p > .90).
Stepwise multiple regression
In the examination of the multicollinearity of the mea­
sures, significant Pearson correlations were found 
between BRS score and initial visit total number of 
endorsed PCSS symptoms (r = −0.174, p = .001), PCSS 
Total Symptom Severity (r = −0.205, p < .001), GAD-7 
score (r = −0.406, p < .001) and PHQ-8 score 
(r = −0.323, p < .001). The point biserial correlation 
between BRS score and self-reported history of depres­
sion was significant (r = −0.143, p < .05). None of the 
other factors in the regression models were significantly 
correlated with BRS or the PCSS measures. Of the mea­
sures from the initial visit included in the stepwise 
regression model predicting number of PCSS symptoms 
endorsed at follow-up (R2 = 0.103, p < .001), two of the 
nine measures were significant in the model: the initial 
BRS score (b = −0.119, p < .001) and GAD-7 score

Impact of physical and cognitive activity on 
concussion symptoms
The summary of return to physical activity, exacerbation 
of symptoms, and residual symptoms at three-month 
follow-up are found in Table 4. There was no difference 
between Resilience Groups in their return to sports/phy­
sical activity at three months (p = .589). However, there 
was a higher percentage of subjects in the Low Resilience 
Group who reported exacerbation of symptoms with 
physical activity (22.0%) vs. Average Resilience (5.0%) 
or High Resilience (4.3%) Groups (p = .002). The Low 
Resilience Group also reported more frequent symptom 
exacerbation with cognitive activity (24.4%) vs. the 
Average (7.0%) and High Resilience (3.3%) Groups 
(p < .001). Furthermore, the percentage of participants 
still reporting as symptomatic at three months in the Low 
Resilience Group was significantly higher (33.6%) than in 
the Average (17.6%) and High (12.0%) Resilience Groups 
(p = .003).
Anxiety and depression symptom effects
The main effects of Resilience Group and Visit were 
significant for both GAD-7 (both p < .001) and PHQ-8 
(both p < .001). The main effect of Visit was significant 
(p < .001) with the mean GAD-7 score and PHQ-8 score 
being significantly higher for all resilience groups at the 
initial visit compared to the three-month follow-up. Post 
hoc pairwise Resilience Group comparisons of GAD-7 
scores resulted in the Low Resilience Group scoring sig­
nificantly higher than either Average (p < .001) or High 
Resilience Groups (p < .001) at initial visit. The Average 
Resilience Group was scored significantly higher on the 
GAD-7 score than High Resilience Group (p = .043). At 
three-month follow-up the Low Resilience Group was still 
significantly higher than either Average (p = .009) or High 
Resilience Groups (p < .001). These two groups however 
did not differ at three-month follow-up (p = .271).
For the PHQ-8, post hoc pairwise group comparisons 
revealed that the Low Resilience Group scored signifi­
cantly higher on the PHQ-8 than either the Average 
(p = .015) or High Resilience Groups (p < .001) and 
there was no difference (p = .308) between Average and 
High Groups at initial visit. At three-month follow-up 
the only significant difference was higher PHQ-8 scores 
for Low vs. High Resilience Groups (p = .009).
Percent back to normal
The main effects of both Resilience Groups and Visit were 
significant for percent back to normal ratings (p < .001). 
Overall rating of percent back to normal improved with 
time (Visit) from initial to follow-up visit. Post hoc pair­
wise comparisons for Resilience Groups at initial visit 
showed the percent back to normal for the Low

Discussion
Our investigation focused on SRC among subjects aged 
13–25, a prime age for sports participation in the United 
States (Woods, 2017). Previous research has shown only 
limited differences in concussion symptomatology and 
recovery across this age group of adolescent and young 
adult athletes, particularly when evaluated within 
21 days of injury (Howell et al., 2019; Kara et al., 2020; 
Nelson et al., 2016). In this large sample of adolescent 
and young adults who sustained a SRC, level of resili­
ence appeared to be associated with the number and 
severity of concussion symptoms reported during 
recovery. At time of initial evaluation, resilience was 
not associated with number or severity of PCS endorsed 
but was associated with a greater number and increased 
severity at three months post injury. Specifically, indi­
viduals considered to have low resilience reported both 
a greater number of symptoms and a higher severity of 
symptoms than those with average or high resilience at 
three months post injury. Higher resilience levels did 
not appear to be associated with a benefit above the 
average levels of resilience, possibly reflecting a ceiling 
effect of the BRS. This has been seen in older popula­
tions of emergency room mTBI patients where subjects 
considered to have medium-high resilience levels 
reported a lower level of post-concussive symptoms 
compared to those considered to have low resilience 
(Losoi et al., 2015). In contrast, it has been proposed 
that high resilience levels actually may be associated 
with greater post injury anxiety and concussion symp­
toms immediately following injury before any potential 
benefit may emerge (McCauley et al., 2013). However, 
our findings did not support such a notion, as higher 
levels of resilience did not appear to relate to greater 
symptoms within ten days post-injury or at three 
months. Rather, our results indicate that low resilience 
levels (linear mixed models and regression models) may 
be associated with greater symptom reporting during 
recovery and a longer perceived recovery from SRC.
Given the number of psychological factors which 
have been identified as being associated with concussion 
symptomology (Broshek et al., 2015; Iverson et al., 
2017), it is important to determine if resilience as 
defined in our study is an independent contributing 
factor to SRC recovery. Anxiety and depressive symp­
toms may mediate its role, but previous research has 
posited resilience as a discrete factor in concussion 
recovery (Durish et al., 2019; Sullivan et al., 2015). 
Outside of concussion research it has been shown that 
adolescents with higher resilience show lower levels of 
anxiety and depression symptoms (Haddadi & Besharat, 
2010; Hjemdal et al., 2007). It is also possible that 
negative response bias may influence the role resilience 
might play in SRC recovery. This risk appears low given 
that in our study, there was no significant correlation 
between self-reported resilience levels with prior history 
of anxiety, and the significant correlation with prior 
history of depression was low (r = −0.143). The moder­
ate correlations between resilience and post-injury anxi­
ety (GAD-7), (r = −0.406) and depression (PHQ-8), 
(r = −323) scores may pose limitations on our findings 
and merit further exploration. However, even with these 
correlations, only post-injury anxiety was a predictor for 
the number of endorsed PCSS symptoms at three 
months. The lack of inclusion of these emotional factors 
in both of the regression models may point to a complex 
relationship between these factors. As measured, levels 
of resilience had the strongest relationship with PCSS 
symptoms, even after accounting for psychological fac­
tors in the models, providing some support that resili­
ence appears to be distinct from other psychological 
factors.
The relationship between resilience and levels of 
post-injury anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-8) 
was further examined in separate ANCOVAs. At initial 
evaluation, the relationship between resilience group 
and level of anxiety was linear, with lower resilience 
associated with greater anxiety. However, at follow up, 
the Low Resilience Group still expressed greater anxiety 
than either High or Average Resilience Groups. In 
regard to depressive symptoms, at initial evaluation, 
the Low Resilience Group endorsed higher level of 
depressive symptoms that still remained higher than 
the other resilience groups at follow up. It is important 
to note that although some participants may have 
reported elevated symptoms of anxiety as measured by 
the GAD-7, mean raw scores for all three groups were 
generally low and did not meet established cutoff scores 
(7–10) for generalized anxiety disorder at either initial 
evaluation or three-month follow-up (Plummer et al., 
2016). Likewise, none of the mean PHQ-8 scores across 
resilience groups met the suggested cutoff score of ≥ 10 
for clinically significant depression (Kroenke et al., 
2009). Also, as expected with recovery from concussion, 
all groups significantly improved in both anxiety and 
depressive symptoms at follow-up compared to initial

visit. Although perhaps not significant in a clinical sense 
(in view of mean scores not meeting standard cutoff 
values), the slightly elevated initial scores for anxiety 
and depression in subjects with low resilience are con­
cerning. Anxiety and depression have been shown to 
have an additive effect on endorsed concussion symp­
toms (Ponsford et al., 2012; R. T. Lange et al., 2011; 
Yang et al., 2015). As such, if low resilience is associated 
with self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression, 
it should be considered a factor in evaluating emotional 
PCSS symptoms in clinical interviews at initial evalua­
tion and during recovery (Collins et al., 2014).
Level of resilience was associated with participants’ 
perceived functionality and being back to normal at 
initial evaluation and at three months. Participants in 
the Low Resilience Group reported that they were func­
tioning at a lower level in terms of percent back to 
normal than the other groups at both time points. As 
with the PCSS, there may also be a resilience “ceiling” 
effect as high resilience did not provide a benefit in 
function over that of average resilience. Subjects were 
also asked whether or not they had returned to play/ 
physical activity at the three-month follow-up, and the 
percentage of participants who had returned to activity 
was the same across resilience groups regardless of 
symptoms. Progressive steps of asymptomatic physical 
activity are a standard for return to play/physical activ­
ity protocol (McCrory et al., 2017), although in concus­
sion recovery, being “asymptomatic” may not mean 
a complete absence of concussion symptoms, as healthy 
non-concussed individuals often report some symptoms 
at baseline (Asken et al., 2017). Even if participants in 
our study indicated they had returned to play/physical 
activity, 47% reported at least one PCSS symptom pre­
sent at three-month follow-up. When applying 
a standard of “asymptomatic” as measured by symptom 
severity (male ≤ 5, female ≤ 6) (Alla et al., 2012), a larger 
percentage of the Low Resilience Group (36.6%) were 
still symptomatic than the Average (17.6%) or High 
(12.0%) Resilience Groups (p = .003) at three months. 
This would be consistent with subject reports regarding 
their perceived “percent back to normal” at three 
months, regardless of return to sport/physical activity, 
as the low resilience group reported a smaller percen­
tage of return to normal function than the other two 
groups. This group also reported a greater exacerbation 
of symptoms with physical and cognitive activity com­
pared to the other groups. Symptom “spikes” can occur 
in this age group after increased mental activity such as 
return 
to 
school 
and 
extracurricular 
activities 
(Silverberg et al., 2016). Physical and cognitive activity 
are beneficial to recovery from SRC but only when kept 
below the threshold that increases symptoms (McCrory 
et al., 2017; Schneider et al., 2017). It is possible that low 
resilience may relate to individuals being more sensitive 
to symptom spikes even if recovered and may also factor 
into perception of lower functionality. Further research 
in this area will be important to delineate such 
a relationship.
Our results suggest that the assessment of resilience 
may lend an important contribution to the evaluation 
and management of SRC recovery. Symptom checklists 
such as the PCSS are important tools which are part of 
the current Berlin consensus protocols for initial evalua­
tion of SRC and tracking recovery (McCrory et al., 
2017), and the BRS, or other measure of resilience, 
might be a worthwhile adjunct to these checklists. In 
management of recovery from SRC, comprehensive and 
targeted approaches have become a standard for reha­
bilitation strategies (Collins et al., 2014). Widening 
these strategies to include a specific focus on resilience 
may prove beneficial to overall recovery (Neils-Strunjas 
et al., 2017). Residual concussion symptoms and symp­
tom spikes may impede functionality even after release 
to return to school and work (Silverberg et al., 2016, 
2018); quality of recovery and functionality at school 
and work may be improved by interventions targeting 
resilience.
As with many concussion studies using self-report 
measures, our results are subject to a possible “good 
old days” bias in reporting of concussion symptoms 
(Lange et al., 2010). Care must also be taken in general­
izing results to other populations, as this study focused 
on SRC and not concussions resulting from other 
mechanisms or initially evaluated greater than 
10 days post injury. Participants were also predomi­
nantly Caucasian, which may limit generalizability to 
other sociodemographic populations. Another limita­
tion of the study is the lack of a pre-injury “baseline” of 
resilience, as the BRS was only obtained at time of 
initial post injury assessment.
Conclusion
The objective of this investigation was to examine the 
relationship between resilience and concussion symp­
toms, anxiety, depression, and perceived return to nor­
mal during recovery from SRC in adolescents and young 
adults. Low level of resilience was associated with greater 
concussion symptoms and higher self-reported symp­
toms of anxiety and depression immediately post injury 
and during recovery. Low resilience also appeared to be 
associated with longer reported return to normal follow­
ing SRC even after controlling for sex and prior history 
of depression. A patient’s resilience, defined as the ability 
to “bounce back” or recover (Smith et al., 2008)

This study found that low resilience was associated with 
higher post-concussion and emotional symptoms following 
SRC and should be considered at initial evaluation and when 
managing SRC recovery.
