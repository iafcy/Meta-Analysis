ABSTRACT
Objectives: Although depression can be a serious consequence of concussion, little is known about the
factors that predict depression and concussion recovery outcomes in children. The purpose of this study
was to explore the risk and possible predictors of developing significant depressive symptoms in children
recovering from concussion. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in a paediatric tertiary
care clinic. Depression data were collected from 92 children using the Children’s Depression Inventory-2
(CDI-2) screening tool. Correlations, t-tests and logistic regression were used to examine the associations
between depression scores and demographic as well as injury-related factors. Results: Depressive symptoms were found in 22% of the children (T score on CDI-2 >65). Children with evidence of depressive
symptomatology had significantly higher mean post-concussive symptom inventory (PCSI) scores in
recovery (p = 0.004) than children who were not depressed. Variables of i) Sex; ii) hospital admission; iii)
number of head injuries; iv) post-concussion symptom score and v) experience of prolonged symptoms
were predictive of clinically significant CDI T scores, explaining 36% of the variation in the binary logistic
model. Conclusion: Depression is commonly reported in this subset of children. High post-concussive
symptom scores and hospital admission were strong predictors of depression. Screening for depression
should be standard practice in concussion management in children and youth.

In the USA, the incidence of concussion is reported to be
between 1.7 and 3.8 million individuals per year; more than
half of them are children [1]. Recent figures from sports
injuries alone show that the prevalence of concussions
doubled in the 8–19-year-old age group from 1997 to 2007

[2] due in most part to increased community awareness and
subsequent policy changes and new guidelines [3,4]. Children
are a vulnerable group because of their developing brains and
susceptibility to prolonged recoveries compared to the adult
population [5,6,7]. Children also have the potential for many
injuries over their lifespan especially given that concussion is
a predictor of future concussions [8,9].

Concussion as defined by the World Health Organization
(WHO) results from a blow or force to the head and consists
of one or more of the following criteria: loss of consciousness
for less than 30 minutes, confusion or disorientation, posttraumatic amnesia of less than 24 hours and/or transient
neurological symptoms [10]. There remains a considerable
lack of agreement in the diagnosis or label of concussion[i],
mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or mild closed head
injury particularly in children [11,12]. Currently, in clinical
practice, there is variation in injuries even when a diagnostic
label is given [11].

Recovery from childhood concussion has varied trajectories

[13,14] and is currently described on the basis of the length of
symptom presentation: under 1 month, between 1 and 3 months
and over 3 months. Symptoms of concussion are categorized as
somatic (e.g., headache and balance issues), emotional (e.g.,


irritability and anxiety), cognitive (e.g., difficulty concentrating
and remembering) and sleep symptoms [15].

Childhood concussive injuries typically resolve in days or
weeks, but some of these ‘mild’ injuries can have serious and
prolonged health consequences [16,17]. When symptoms last
more than 3 months, they can significantly affect the child’s
everyday life and may intensify emotional or depressive symptoms [18]. Children and adolescents are at higher risk for
prolonged symptoms after concussion, with 11–30% of children reporting ongoing symptoms at 3 months post injury

[19,20].

While there are frequent references to the risk of developing depression after concussion, there is little evidence
specifically about this result in children. Psychosocial outcomes after childhood concussion are beginning to receive
more attention, as depression in young people profoundly
affects their participation in school, social and physical activities as well as putting youth at risk for suicidal behaviour,
substance abuse and negative life trajectories [21,22]. The
prevalence for major depressive disorder in the general
population is reported to be 1–3% in children [23] and
increasing in adolescents to a 7.5 past-year prevalence

[24,25]. Girls report depression more than boys beginning
at 12 years of age and increasing to a 2:1 ratio in later
adolescence and adulthood [23,26]. Injury or illness increases
the susceptibility to depression [27,28]. Within the first year
after concussion, adults demonstrate rates of 15–18% of new
onset depression [29,30].

Recent studies investigating depression after concussion
in children fall into two categories: 1) those investigating
the risk of depression based on exposure to concussion and
2) those investigating depression that occurs shortly after
injury, complicating the recovery from concussion.
Consistent results from the former studies show an
increased likelihood of becoming depressed when there is
a history of concussion or traumatic brain injury (TBI)

[31,32]. However, studies exploring depression that occurs
during recovery from concussion are less conclusive in
determining prevalence. Two prospective studies, the latter
with an orthopaedic control group, found an 11% and
21.4% incidence of new onset of depression/anxiety in children within 6 months after their injury [33,34]. Both of
these studies drew their samples from children who were
hospitalized for mild injuries, which potentially introduces
selection bias as more severe cases are hospitalized. A recent
cross-sectional study of post-concussive children aged 7–17
years examined them 1–3 years post injury for depression
and post-concussion symptoms [35]. Depression was found
to be uncommon and was experienced by only 3% of their
sample [35]. Differences in sample selection and inclusion
criteria, definitions of concussion, follow-up time and additional methodological issues make it difficult to draw substantive conclusions about the incidence of depression in
children recovering from concussion. More studies are
needed to close the gaps in knowledge or to confirm and
add to some of these preliminary conflicting findings.
Investigations specifically representing children with concussion need replication. Studies also need to focus on the
period of recovery from concussion and to span both childhood and adolescence if we are to fully understand the issue
of depression in relation to childhood concussion.

Research studies examining the association between
depression and concussion have identified factors that may
predict the incidence of depression after concussion. Many
non-injury-related factors are reported to be associated with
the onset of depression after concussion: older child, family
history of anxiety [34], lower socioeconomic status [36] and
post-injury stress [33]. In addition, many injury-related factors in the adult population have been identified as risk
factors for depression, including multiple brain injuries, number and severity of symptoms, mechanism of injury, hospitalization and imaging abnormalities [37–39]. To date, there
have been very few studies conducted with children. One
paediatric prospective cohort with orthopaedic controls
demonstrated that the severity of injury and post-injury stress
predicted the onset of depression [33].

Research determining both the incidence of depression and
the factors that predict risk for depression after concussion is
in the early stages. More work needs to be done to understand
the incidence of depression in children recovering from concussion and to highlight factors that predict depression in
children who are still in recovery from concussion.
Determining the factors that increase the risk for depression
post concussion can lead to strategies for effective prevention
and early intervention.

The purpose of this study is to explore the risk of depres

concussion, and to identify predictors of depression during
the recovery period. It was hypothesized that depression
would be associated with prolonged recovery from concussion. It was also hypothesized that there would be gender and
age differences in depression, with higher rates among adolescent girls. Finally, it was hypothesized that injury-related
factors (i.e., number of head injuries, symptom scores and
hospitalization) would increase the risk of developing
depression.

##### Methods

A prospective cohort study was conducted with children
recovering from concussion through the acquired brain injury
(ABI) clinic (n = 477) at a tertiary care children’s hospital.
This tertiary care centre, located in Southwestern Ontario,
serves a region of approximately 2.3 million people.
Approximately 45% of referrals to this clinic are received
from the emergency department and hospital wards, and
55% are received from community physicians and outlying
hospitals. This provides a mixture of children who have had
both acute and complex care needs.

Sample

Due to the interest in depression, a protocol of screening for
depression was implemented as a pilot project in the ABI
clinic from April to June 2013 with full implementation to
consecutively presenting patients from August to December
2013. Thus, a prospective cohort of 92 consecutive children
who were newly referred or had follow-up appointments
scheduled were administered the CDI-2 [40] if they were
between the ages of 8 and 18 years. Data of those who met
the following inclusion criteria were included for analysis:

(1) Physician label of mTBI/concussion documented in

the medical record*
(2) completion of a CDI-2 [40]
(3) completion of one or more Post-Concussion Symptom

Inventory checklists [15]

*Physicians in this clinical environment used the WHO diagnostic criteria as there is no universally accepted definition of
concussion.

Children who had open head injuries, injuries sustained
from child abuse and those from intoxication were not
included. Participants were not excluded if they required
hospitalization or had intracranial lesions or skull fractures.

The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board approved
the prospective collection of data from the clinical ABI database. Consent was covered through this process.

Procedures

Upon initial presentation to the ABI follow-up clinic, a thorough history is obtained and a review of medical records is
completed by the physician. This interview of parent and
child collects demographic data history of the present injury


-----

including developmental history, school performance and past
mental health issues. Subsequent follow-up visits to the clinic
include a review of the medical history and a physical examination as well as follow-up interviews in regard to how the
concussion symptoms are impacting their lives. School performance is closely monitored, and problems are identified
through clinical interview. A decrease in academic standing is
documented when those school difficulties noted post-concussive injury result in decreased academic marks by more
than 10%, reduced academic workload or clinician documented symptoms of decreased concentration, difficulty coding
and decoding, reading or studying.

Parents and children also each independently completed a
Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) [15] and the
CDI-2 short version (CDI-2S) [40] at the appointment. The
PCSI was completed at each clinic appointment from admission to discharge, detailing symptoms experienced in the past
2 days. Data were collected prospectively, and some children
who were being followed long term had up to three symptom
evaluations recorded, with time three being the most current
symptom score. The scores from the CDI-2S were obtained
every 3 months if children were being followed long term;
however, it was decided to use only those CDI-2S scores from
the first administration as there were very few children (4)
with more than one set of depression scores. Depression data
were collected over a period of 8 months in 2013.

Measures

The CDI-2 is both a self-report and parent-report measure of
the extent and severity of depressive symptoms [40]. The
screening tool (CDI-2S) consists of 12 questions and requires
one of three response options: the child chooses the statement
that best describes their feelings or moods in the past 2 weeks.
Statements represent the range of severity of the symptom
from 0 (none) to 2 (definite). Scores are totalled, and raw
scores are converted to T scores. A T score of 65 (1.5 SD
above the mean) is generally considered to indicate a clinically
significant level of depressive symptomatology. This screening
tool has a high correlation with the full-length self-rated form
(r = 0.95, p < 0.001) and has been validated for use with
medically ill children [41]. There are three questions dealing
with depressed mood and irritability, three questions regarding physical symptoms, one about diminished pleasure, one
dealing with cognitive symptoms and the rest are about feelings of low self-esteem, worthlessness and hopelessness.

The parent measure is a parallel questionnaire that
includes 17 questions with scores that are grouped into emotional, functional and total score domains. Again, parents are
asked to consider the child’s moods and feelings in the past 2
weeks.

The Post-Concussion Symptom scale [15] is a symptom
inventory derived from the original sideline assessment
developed by the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National
Football League [42]. This clinically driven tool has many
variants and has been adopted and standardized into such
tools as the Acute Concussion Evaluation [15], the Sport
Concussion Assessment Tool [43] and the Immediate Post

used to make return to sport decisions. Most of the variants
have a 7-point Likert scale to measure intensity of symptoms and others have a yes/no dichotomous scale [45]. It is
a quick and clinically useful way of tracking symptom
resolution through serial administration over days or
weeks. The PCSI [15] is one of the variations and lists 22
concussion symptoms in the domains of physical, cognitive,
emotional and sleep and has a yes/no dichotomous scale

[45]. Both children and parents fill in this checklist independently, answering yes (1) or no (0) to whether the child
has experienced each symptom in the past 3 days. The ‘yes’
scores are added for a total score out of 22. The scales are
valid in measuring change in symptoms over time; however,
psychometric evidence is stronger for adolescents than
younger children [46].

Symptoms of depression and post concussive symptoms
are known to overlap; however, these measures actually have
only two items that are worded similarly: irritability and
fatigue. Sadness and decision-making are also asked about in
both measures but are worded quite differently.

Data analysis

Our sample size of 92 is adequate to provide a valid model to
estimate risk in logistic regression analyses. The value of 10
events per variable and higher is recommended by Peduzzi
et al. for both proportional hazards and logistic regression
analyses [47]. Below this, the statistical model may not be
valid. We will have one primary outcome (depressive symptoms indicated by a T score >65 on CDI-2S) with five
predictors.

For analysis, children were categorized based on the CDI
T-score of ≥65 (n = 20) indicating depression or <65 (n = 72)
indicating no depression. Initially, to test for group differences, chi-square and student t-tests were conducted on
demographic variables and clinical characteristics. As this
was an exploratory study, significance was two-tailed and set
at p ≤ 0.05. Much of the data of interest were not normally
distributed, not uncommon in brain injury research, so a
decision was made to use non-parametric statistics for correlations and regression. Correlations between depression and
injury and non-injury-related variables were determined using
Spearman’s Rho. Logistic regression was used to model the
predictor variables of interest with the primary binary outcome: a clinically significant level of depressive symptoms
either present (‘yes’ T score ≥65; coded 1) or not present
(‘no’ T score <65; coded 0). Predictor variables were selected
based on our hypotheses, results from descriptive statistics
and univariate analysis using binary logistic regression. The
selected variables were subjected to linear regression analysis
to test for collinearity. The data did not violate the multicollinearity assumption with variance inflation factors well
below the cut-off of 10 (range from 1.29 to 2.36). A combination of forward and backward selection was used for model
fitting using the most significant candidate covariates and
then eliminating those with p values over 0.6 [47]. All data
analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows

##### Results

The study sample consisted of 92 children aged 7–18 years
included 56 girls and 36 boys with a mean age of 15 years ± 2.5.
Depression screens were administered a median of 3.7 months (2
weeks–35 months) after injury (see Table 1). PCSI scores were
obtained a mean of 9.2 weeks for Time 1 at their initial clinic
appointment, 5.6 months for Time 2 and 8.5 months for Time 3.
Information on demographic and clinical characteristics by outcomes is presented in Table 2. Although 30% of the children were
hospitalized, the majority for 24 hours, there were seven children
who required longer admissions due to musculoskeletal, spinal
and/or facial injuries (2–14 days). The study sample of 92 children
differed from the larger dataset of 477 children followed in the ABI
clinic in a few ways: there were more girls in our subset (64%
compared with 44%); the PCSI means were higher in girls (9.91 vs.
8.26), and 70% of the 92 children had symptoms for 3 months or
more compared to only 52% in the larger dataset.

Non-injury-related factors

In comparing children classified as depressed versus nondepressed (chi-Square analysis; χ[2]), there were no significant

differences in age (p = 0.85), sex (p = 0.79), premorbid history
of learning issues (p = 0.61) or premorbid history of mental
health issues (p = 0.90). Significant differences, however, were
noted in decreased academic standing after concussion (χ[2] =
4.6, df = 1, p = 0.03) as well as in persistence of concussion
symptoms (>3 months duration) (χ[2] = 6.3, df = 1, p = 0.01).
Children with depression were less likely to be succeeding in
school after concussion. Prior to their injury, 7.6% of children
had documented learning issues, whereas, after injury, 53%
reported a decrease in school performance.

Correlational analysis using Spearman’s Rho for categorical
variables (see Table 3) showed strong positive associations
between depression scores (yes/no) and persistence of concussion symptoms (yes/no) over 3 months (r = 0.483, p <
0.01), and between depression scores and decrease in academic standing (r = 0.431, p < 0.01).

Injury-related factors

In comparing children classified as depressed versus not
depressed, chi-square analysis showed no significant differences in reports of multiple head injuries (p = 0.46), cause of
injury (p = 0.35), computerized tomography abnormalities (p
= 0.67) or hospital admissions (p = 0.67). Significant differences were, however, found in the number of concussion
symptoms as reported on the PCSI. Children with depression
had higher initial clinic PCSI mean scores (p = 0.004) and
higher PSCI scores reported on the third clinic visit (p =
0.041). Length of hospital stay was also found to be significantly higher in children who were subsequently classified as
depressed (T score > 65 on the CDI-2-S) (p = 0.003).

Correlational analysis showed significant positive associations between depression scores and the number of

a linear relationship.

Logistic regression results
The results of the logistic regression analysis show that the full
model using the five independent variables of gender, number of
concussions, admission to hospital, PCSI Time 1 score and
experiencing symptoms over 3 months was significant (Χ[2] (5)
= 18.55, n = 71, p < 0.002). This means that the odds for children
to have a positive depression score at a mean time of 6 months
after concussion is associated with these five variables (see
Table 3). The model correctly classifies 81.7% of cases. The
Nagelkerke R-squared value of 0.357 indicates the model fits
the data well. Table 3 presents the standardized coefficient
beta, Wald statistic and significance as well as the odds ratios
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals for the variables in the
model. The strongest predictors in the model were high PCSI
scores (standardized coefficient beta = 0.278, p = 0.009) and
admission to hospital (standardized coefficient beta = 2.464, p
= 0.030). Admission to hospital with an OR of 11.75 means that
the odds that a child had a high depression score (T ≥65)
increased by a factor of 11 if the child was admitted to hospital
compared to those who were not admitted. The OR for early
PCSI is 1.32, which indicates that for every one point increase in
symptom scores (1 additional symptom), the odds of being
depressed increase by a factor of 1.32.

Length of hospital stay was a variable that could not be


over-fitting due to the small sample as only seven children
had a stay over 24 hours. We did a univariate analysis using
length of hospital stay to predict depression and found it to be
significant Χ[2] = 8.06, p < 0.005 (standardized coefficient beta
= 0.447, p = 0.033). This single variable increased classification accuracy by 17% and has an OR of 1.56 indicating that
for every extra day of stay in hospital, the likelihood of
depression increased by a factor of 1.5.

##### Discussion

In this prospective cohort of children and youth with concussion, we found the incidence of depression to be above that
found in community samples cited in the literature and in
standardized tests, which report a prevalence of 8–11% in this
age group [24,25,49]. Twenty-two per cent of children selfreported significant depressive symptomatology, an average of
6 months following their injury. Youth in our study did report
some premorbid histories of headache/migraine (9%), learning issues (7%) and mental health issues (7.5%); yet, none of
these were significantly associated with ratings of post-concussion depression. Five predictors, sex, number of concussions, admission to hospital, PCSI score and experiencing
prolonged symptoms explained 36% of the variance in depression scores.

Our prevalence of 22% is congruent with other published
studies that report an increase in depression after mild-tomoderate TBI ranging from 11% to 26% [34 33] as well as


-----

including chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy and soft tissue injuries [28,50]. Our sample had a higher
representation of girls who reported more symptoms than the
larger dataset and 70% of the sample reported ongoing symptoms over 3 months. Girls are known to be at greater risk for
more symptoms, neurocognitive changes and prolonged
recovery [51,52]. It may be that the chronicity of symptoms
experienced by the youths in this study contributed to the
prevalence of depressive symptoms.

The findings of increased rates of depression after concussion are contradicted by a recent study conducted by Smyth
et al. [35] who evaluated depression and pre-injury life stressors 1–3 years after injury and found only 3% of their sample
had depression. Although this was also a concussion cohort,
differences between the samples such as numbers of children
admitted to hospital, sex distribution and the differences in
timing of the depression evaluation (1–3 years after injury) in
addition to the cross-sectional study design may explain the
disparate results.

Other factors frequently hypothesized to be associated with
depression including age, sex, cause of injury and the total number of head injuries had no significant relationship individually
with depression in this study. These results were curious as sex in
the general population of depressed adolescents has distinct differences with a 2:1 ratio of girls to boys into adolescence and
adulthood [23,50]. Covassin, Elbin, Larson and Kontos also found
no sex differences on depression scores after concussion in high
school and collegiate athletes [53]. It is unclear whether there is a
mediating effect of concussion in boys that equalizes the depression outcome between the sexes. Rates of depression in adolescents are known to be double those seen in younger children

[54,55], yet our results were insignificant for age. This sample,
however, had only twenty children in the 7–12 age group, which
may have resulted in a type II error with not enough statistical
power to show a true difference.

Evidence has also shown an association between multiple
concussions and self-reported depression in retired adult football
players [37]. Our data did not reflect these findings in children.
Multiple concussions have been shown to predict prolonged
symptoms, and time between concussions is a factor in recovery

[56]. Neither prolonged symptoms nor depression was associated
with multiple concussions in our data. Although 40% of the
sample had two or more concussions, a larger sample size may
have had the power to detect differences especially in the small
groups of children with three, four and five injuries.

Although the study findings contribute to debate in the literature about the mechanism of the development of post-concussion
depression, there are no clear causal relationships. On the one
hand, damage to the brain, combined with other biological vulnerabilities (inherited traits of learning disabilities, temperament,
etc.) is thought to provide a neurobiological susceptibility to
depression [57]; on the other hand, stress (loss of meaningful
activity, trauma, and family factors) can also influence the development of depression [58]. In our study, admission to hospital and
length of stay increased the likelihood of showing elevated depressive symptoms in the first year after a concussive injury; however,
this by itself is not conclusive. Although hospitalized youth may
represent a subset of children who have a more severe injury,
tentatively providing support to a neurobiological process leading
to depression outcomes [59], hospitalization itself is very stressful
which may trigger more anxiety and depression from environ

concussion found in studies using hospitalized samples [33,34]. In
fact, our sample showed that most of the children were hospitalized for longer periods because of other injuries in addition to the
concussion (spinal, musculoskeletal, etc.). These injuries themselves would be very stressful and lead to loss and uncertainty,
which has been associated with depression. Other factors associated with a high depression score in our data were academic
difficulties and experiencing symptoms over 3 months in duration, which both create a great amount of stress in the youth.

One of the most stressful activities post concussion is
returning to school [60]. Thirty per cent of children recovering from concussion have reported school absence and dropping grades [61,62]. We found a significant relationship
between a decrease in academic standing and depression
scores. Our assessment of declining academic performance,
while not objective, does capture parent and child perception
of post-concussive school problems, and these findings as well
as prolonged school absence may indicate that the child is
depressed or at risk for becoming depressed. On the other
hand, depression could very well precede a decrease in academic standing. Although the direction of this relationship
remains unclear, school performance is worthy of attention
for signalling potential poor outcomes.

Prolonged recovery from concussion was also moderately
associated with depression in our sample and in our depression prediction model, a child with symptoms over 3 months
had a 1.2-fold increased odds of being depressed even when
accounting for all other variables.

Significant depressive symptoms can predispose youth to
depression in subsequent years and later into adulthood [63].
Once a depressive episode has resolved, deficits in academics
and social relationships remain making the developmental cost
of depression in childhood and adolescence very high [21]. It is
therefore vital to identify those children who may be susceptible to
depression early in their recovery post concussion. Based on our
results, we recommend that screening for depression in this vulnerable population should be a regular part of follow up, particularly for those who are admitted to hospital, have high symptom
scores, experience protracted symptoms or are experiencing academic failure. Because we were unable to follow all children from
inception, timing of depressive symptoms is an unknown.
Longitudinal studies in adults have reported depression diagnosis
early after injury [29,64]. In our study, significant depressive
symptoms were reported at a mean of 6 months after injury,
which may not represent the natural history of onset. Screening
for depression should occur in the first weeks to months post
concussion with further research needed to determine the optimal
time period. Early identification might lead to timely provision of
management strategies to prevent the effects of depression.

Limitations

There are several limitations to this study. This research
would have benefitted from a non-specific injury control
group to determine if the cause of depressive symptoms was
the concussion or the process of being injured in another way.

Our subset of data did differ from the larger dataset as 70% of
the sub-sample had symptoms more than 3 months after their


-----

this subset of children seems to have more complex recovery
patterns than previously seen. This is most likely a reflection of
the increasingly specialized nature of the clinic attracting more
complex referrals and may have inflated depression rates. Referral
bias may also have been introduced due to the tertiary nature of
this clinic. Although referrals were from a variety of sources,
50–60% were from other hospitals and community physicians,
which suggests that these children may have been more chronic in
their recovery patterns when referred. As a result of these factors
and higher rates of girls and sport-related injuries, this sample may
not be representative of concussions in the general population of
the 8–18-year-old age group. However, the sample does include
the spectrum of concussion recovery trajectories and provided a
unique opportunity to examine a protracted symptom group. The
clinical nature of the database resulted in some inconsistencies in
data collection as children did not return for follow-up or information was not obtained, which means there were missing data
over time. This may have resulted in a lack of power to detect
difference between those with depression scores and those without
and also may have limited the model building in predicting
depression.

##### Conclusion

Depression in the first year after childhood concussion is not a
rare occurrence. Prevalence of depression during concussion
recovery could be up to 2–4 times greater than that reported for
childhood depression in published population data. This study
adds to the knowledge regarding the risk of depression in youth
recovering from concussion and some of the factors that play a
role in increasing that risk. Children with a history including
admission to hospital, high initial symptom scores and prolonged
symptoms over 3 months should be followed closely with vigilance
for the development of depressive symptoms.
