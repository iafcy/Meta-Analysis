Abstract

The purpose of this study is to examine the relation between the microstructural architecture of white matter, as measured by diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI), and postconcussion symptom reporting 6–8 weeks following mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Participants were 108 patients
prospectivelyrecruitedfromaLevel1TraumaCenter(Vancouver,BC,Canada)followinganorthopedicinjury[i.e.,36traumacontrols(TCs)]or
MTBI (n ¼ 72). DTI of the whole brain was undertaken using a Phillips 3T scanner at 6–8 weeks postinjury. Participants also completed a 5 h
neurocognitive test battery and a brief battery of self-report measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, and postconcussion symptoms). The MTBI
sample was divided into two groups based on ICD-10 criteria for postconcussional syndrome (PCS): first, PCS-present (n ¼ 20) and second,
PCS-absent (n ¼ 52). There were no significant differences across the three groups (i.e., TC, PCS-present, and PCS-absent) for any of the neurocognitive measures (p ¼ .138–.810). For the self-report measures, the PCS-present group reported significantly more anxiety and depression
symptomscomparedwiththePCS-absentandTCgroups(p, .001, d ¼ 1.63–1.89,verylargeeffectsizes).FortheDTImeasures,therewereno
significant differences in fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, or mean diffusivity when comparing the PCS-present and
PCS-absent groups. However, there were significant differences (p, .05) in MD and RD when comparing the PCS-present and TC groups.
There were significant differences in white matter between TC subjects and the PCS-present MTBI group, but not the PCS-absent MTBI
group. Within the MTBI group, white-matter changes were not a significant predictor of ICD-10 PCS.

Introduction


Postconcussionsymptomsarecommonintheacuterecoveryphasefollowingmildtraumaticbraininjury(MTBI).Patientswho
sustain MTBI report more acute symptoms than healthy control and trauma control (TC) subjects in the initial days and weeks
postinjury in most (Iverson, Silverberg, Lange, & Zasler, 2013), but not all studies (e.g., Landre, Poppe, Davis, Schmaus, &
Hobbs, 2006). Fortunately, in the majority of cases, these symptoms resolve within weeks to a few months (Iverson et al.,
2013). However, the diagnostic significance of postconcussion symptom reporting following MTBI is controversial. Clinicians
often assume that postconcussion symptoms reported many months or years postinjury are directly related to the biological

consequences of that brain injury. However, there are many factors unrelated to brain injury that can potentially account for these
symptoms (e.g., other medical problems (Lees-Haley & Brown, 1993), personal injury litigation (Lees-Haley & Brown, 1993),
posttraumatic stress disorder (Foa, Cashman, Jaycox, & Perry, 1997), orthopedic injuries (Meares et al., 2008; Mickeviciene
et al., 2004), chronic pain (Iverson & McCracken, 1997), depression (Iverson, 2006; Suhr & Gunstad, 2002b), and myofascial
injury (whiplash) (Sullivan, Hall, Bartolacci, Sullivan, & Adams, 2002). Complicating matters further, the perception and reporting of symptoms can be influenced by a diverse range of psychological and social-psychological factors that may cause, maintain,
orworsen themyriadofsymptomsthatarereportedpostinjury(e.g.,premorbidpersonality[Hibbardetal.,2000],clinical methods
used to elicit symptoms [Iverson, Brooks, Ashton, & Lange, 2010], nocebo effect [Hahn, 1997], “expectation as etiology”

[Gunstad & Suhr, 2001], diagnosis threat [Suhr & Gunstad, 2002a], and “good old days” bias [Gunstad & Suhr, 2001; Iverson,
Lange,Brooks,&Rennison,2010]).Somestudieshaveillustratedthatpreinjurymentalhealthproblemsandpostinjurydifficulties
with anxiety are strongly related to symptoms that persist for many months following injury (Ponsford et al., 2012).
Todate,thereislimitedevidence tosupportadirectcausal linkbetweenmacrostructuralbraininjuryandsymptomreporting.In
general, neuroimaging studies have not documented a relationship between greater postconcussion symptom reporting and intracranial abnormalities identified on structural computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans within the
first few days (Hughes et al., 2004; Kurca, Sivak, & Kucera, 2006), 3–6 months (Hofman et al., 2001; Lannsjo, Backheden, Af
Johansson, Geijerstam, & Borg, 2013; Sigurdardottir, Andelic, Roe, Jerstad, & Schanke, 2009; Taylor et al., 2010), or 6–12
months (Deepika, Munivenkatappa, Devi, & Shukla, 2013; Sigurdardottir et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2010) following injury. In
fact, de Guise and colleagues (2010) found, paradoxically, greater postconcussion symptom reporting 20 weeks following
MTBI in those patients who had normal day-of-injury CT scans (rather than abnormal scans). Of course, the lack of association
between postconcussion symptoms and intracranial abnormalities on structural CT or MRI scan may be due, in part, to the lack of
sensitivityofthesemethodstodetectdiffusemicrostructuralchangesoftenassociatedwithMTBI(Bruns&Jagoda,2009; Gaetz&
Weinberg, 2000; e.g., Hofman et al., 2001; Lewine et al., 2007).
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is useful for detecting white-matter changes in the brain following TBI (Belanger,
Vanderploeg, Curtiss, & Warden, 2007; Xu, Rasmussen, Lagopoulos, & Haberg, 2007) and it has become an important tool
for the evaluation of MTBI in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases of the recovery trajectory (Inglese, Bomsztyk, et al.,
2005; Inglese, Makani, et al., 2005; Kraus et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2009; Lipton et al., 2009; Rutgers et al., 2008; Shenton
et al., 2012). To date, a number of researchers have established the sensitivity of DTI to differentiate healthy controls from
those individuals who have sustained MTBI and who report postconcussion symptoms 3–6 years following injury (Lipton et al.,
2008; Niogi et al., 2008). The methodology of these small, cross-sectional, correlational studies, however, does not allow one to
assume a causal link between microstructural white-matter findings and postconcussion symptoms. In recent years, the number of
DTI studies that have examined the relationship between postconcussion symptom reporting and MTBI has increased steadily.
These studies can be characterized into two categories: correlational studies and group studies.
Results from correlational studies have found a relatively consistent relationship between postconcussion symptom reporting
and various DTI metrics. For example, researchers have reported that increased postconcussion symptom reporting is associated
with (a) increased fractional anisotropy (FA) and decreased apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and radial diffusivity (RD) in
the corpus callosum in 10 adolescents within the first 6 days following MTBI (Wilde et al., 2008); (b) low trace values in thewhole
brain at 72 h and 1 month postinjury in six patients following MTBI (Bazarian et al., 2007); (c) pre–post season changes in FAand
mean diffusivity (MD) in nine high school athletes who sustained repeated multiple subconcussive blows (Bazarian, Zhu, Blyth,
Borrino, & Zhong, 2012); and (d) increased MD in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and
superior longitudinal fasciculus; and decreased FA in uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, internal capsule,
corpus callosum, and the parietal and frontal subcortical white matter in 20 patients 1 month postinjury (Smits et al., 2011).
One exception to this is a study by Levin and colleagues (2010) who found no relationship between FA and ADC and postconcussion symptoms in 37 mild–moderate TBI service members 2.3 years postinjury using fiber-tracking and region of interest (ROI)
methodology. It is important to appreciate, however, that despite the significant correlations found between postconcussion
symptom reporting and some DTI metrics in the above studies, there were many other DTI metrics that were not associated
with postconcussion symptom reporting.
In contrast to correlational studies, there are mixed findings in group studies that have compared DTI metrics across subgroups
defined by postconcussion symptom reporting. Messe and colleagues (Messe´ et al., 2011, 2012) found some DTI differences in a
small sample of patients with MTBI divided into poor outcome (Postconcussion Syndrome [PCS] present [i.e., PCS ]) versus
+
good outcome (PCS absent [i.e., PCS-]) groups. These differences were found for MD only, and not for FA, axial diffusivity
(AD), or RD (Messe´ et al., 2011). At 3 months postinjury (n ¼ 23), participants in the PCS group had higher MD compared
+
with the PCS2 group in the forceps major and minor, the corpus callosum, the inferior-occipital fasciculus bilaterally, and inferior
longitudinal fasciculus bilaterally. The PCS group (but not the PCS2 group) also had higher MD compared witha healthy control
+
sample in some ROIs (i.e., superior longitudinal fasciculus, corticospinal tract bilaterally, and left anterior thalamic radiation). In a

follow-up longitudinal study of 53 MTBI patients evaluated in the acute phase of recovery (8–21 days [T1]) and subacute (6 months

[T2]), Messeandcolleagues(2012) (Messeetal.,2012)reportedthatthePCS grouphadagreaternumberofabnormalbrainregions
+
on DTI than the PCS2 group when compared with healthy controls. These authors did not provide detailed information regarding a
direct comparison between PCS vs. PCS2 groups; however, they concluded that “significant structural differences were found
+
between PCS and PCS2 groups at T1 and less at T2 for the MD and AD measures, that involved primarily the corpus callosum,
+
the longitudinal fasciculus, and the internal capsules.” (p. 288). There were no differences found for FA or RD measures. Similarly,
Hartikainen and colleagues (2010) examined 18 patients with mild–moderate TBIs at 6 months postinjuryand found that thosewho
reportedpersistentpostconcussionsymptoms(n ¼ 7)hadlowerADC(d ¼ 2.33)andhigherFA(d ¼ 1.86)comparedwiththosewho
reported nosymptoms (n ¼ 11) inthe midbrainstructures(i.e.,thalamus,internal capsule, centrumsemiovale, and mesencephalon).
In contrast to these studies, Waljas et al. (2014) examined 48 patients with uncomplicated MTBI and found no differences
across16ROIsforFA,or10ROIsforADC,betweenthosewhodidanddidnotreportpostconcussionsymptomsat3weeksfollowing injury. Similarly, Lange, Iverson, Brubacher, Madler, and Heran (2012) examined the relation between DTI of the corpus callosumandreportingin60patientswhohadsustainedMTBI,and34patientswithorthopedic/soft-tissue injuries(i.e.,TCs).At6–8
weeks postinjury, there were no significant differences between the MTBI and TC groups for FA or for MD in the genu, body, and
splenium of the corpus callosum. Similarly, in the MTBI sample, there were no significant differences on any DTI measures
between those who did and did not meet ICD-10 symptom criteria for postconcussion syndrome (PCS). In the MTBI sample,
Cohen’s effect sizes ranged from very small (d ¼ 0.02) to small (d ¼ 0.16) for all DTI measures; with the exception of small–
medium effect size found for FA in the genu (d ¼ 0.39) and body (d ¼ 0.37) of the corpus callosum.
The purpose of this study is to expand the study by Lange and colleagues (2012) that examined the relation between DTI and
postconcussionsymptomreportingby:first,usingDTItoexaminethewholebrain;second,includealargernumberofDTImetrics
such FA, MD, RD, and AD; third, use more advanced and comprehensive DTI analysis methods including tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and standard brain atlas generated ROI analyses; fourth, include neurocognitive tests and more symptom scales as
outcomemeasures;fifth,includeasampleofindividualsintheMTBIgroupthatdonothaveintracranialabnormalitiesthatpredate
their injury; and finally, include a sample of participants in the TC group that do not include minor intracranial abnormalities (e.g.,
T2 hyperintensities).
The hypotheses are threefold. First, compared with the TC group, patients with MTBI will (a) report a greater number of postconcussion, depression,and anxiety symptoms; (b)perform comparablyon neurocognitive measures;and (c) have reduced whitematter integrity in thewhole brain as measured by DTI metrics. Second, in the MTBI group, patients who meet ICD-10 criteria for
PCS (i.e., PCS-present)will report agreater numberof depressionand anxietysymptomscomparedwith those patientswho do not
meet ICD-10 PCS criteria (i.e., PCS-absent). Third, intheMTBI group,therewill be no differences across allneurocognitivemeasures and DTI metrics when comparing the PCS-present vs. PCS-absent groups.


Method

Participants


Participants were 108 patients (72 MTBI and 36 TC) prospectively recruited from the Emergency Department of Vancouver
GeneralHospital(Level1TraumaCenter)betweenJune2007andApril2012.Patientswereidentifiedforpotentialinclusioninthe
study via daily reviews of consecutive Emergency Department admissions. Patients were targeted for recruitment and consent if
they presented to the Emergency Department after sustaining a MTBI (i.e., MTBI group), or they had sustained a soft-tissue or
orthopedic injury without brain injury (i.e., TC group).
All participants were enrolled in the study if they were first, between 19 and 55 years of age, second, injured as a result of a
traumatic injury (e.g., fall, motor vehicle accident, assault, etc.), and third, had a blood alcohol level (BAL) obtained at the
time of injury by hospital staff on admission to the Emergency Department. General exclusion criteria included first, lack of proficiency in conversational English; second, educated in a language other than English after age 10 (Note that the second and more
stringentcriterion forESLwasonlyintroduced in2009aftertheevaluationofaseriesofpatientswhoseneurocognitiveprofilewas
considered to be affected by a lack of English-based education (e.g., intact scores on all measures except language-based measures).); (c) history of a neurological disorder (e.g., stroke or multiple sclerosis), TBI, learning disability, or psychiatric illness
requiring hospitalization; (d) presence of any contraindication to MRI, (e) history of significant drug abuse other than alcohol;
(f) presence of upper body injuries restricting the use of hands or arms; or (g) difficulties with eyesight.
Participantswereincludedinthe TCgroup if(a)theysustainedasoft-tissueororthopedicinjurybelowtheneck;(b)therewasno
evidence of an alteredstate of consciousness as indicated bya reduction in GlasgowComa Scale (GCS) score, or presence of a loss

complaints of head, neck, or back pain). In a small number of cases (n ¼ 2), TC participants had undergone a head CT but had no
evidence of intracranial abnormality.
Participantswereincludedinthe MTBIgroup ifthey(a)presentedtotheEmergencyDepartmentfollowingheadtrauma,and(b)
had evidence of MTBI as indicated by at least one of the following: (i) witnessed LOC of at least 1 min duration but not .30 min,
(ii) PTA of at least 15 min duration but not .24 h, and/or (iii) GCS score of 13 or 14. Patients were further classified into uncomplicatedandcomplicatedMTBIgroupsasfollows:(a)uncomplicatedMTBI:GCS ¼ 13–15,PTA, 24 h,LOC,30 min,andno

MRI scan. Of the 72 MTBI patients included in this study, there were 38 (52.8%) with uncomplicated MTBI and 34 (47.2%) with
complicated MTBI.
For the purpose of this study, the MTBI group wasdivided into two groups based on ICD-10 criteriafor PCS: PCS-present (n ¼
20) and PCS-absent (n ¼ 52)—see Self-reported symptoms for classification criteria.


Participant Selection

Participants were selected from a larger sample of 170 patients enrolled in the study (105 MTBI and 65 TC) in a three-step
manner. First, participants were initially included in the sample if they met the following criteria: (1) completed the entire neuropsychological test battery (99.4% of sample), (2) neurocognitive test performance was not considered influenced by reduced
English language proficiency (95.9% of sample), (3) scored above the recommended cutoff for good effort on the Test of
Memory Malingering (100% of entire sample), (4) behavioral observations during the neuropsychological evaluation did not
provide suspicion of questionable motivation or attention that may have negatively influenced test performance (98.8% of
sample),(5)successfullycompletedMRIscanning(99.4%ofsample),(6)therewasnoevidence ofobviousincidentalneurological abnormalities on MRIsuch asmeningioma,cisternmass, venous anomaly(95.8%ofsample),and (7)structural MRIscanswere
consideredcomplete and readable byaneuroradiologist (98.8% ofsample). Inaddition, intheMTBI group, participants wereonly
included if (8) there was no evidence of intracranial abnormality that was considered to predate the current injury (97.1% of the
MTBI sample). Similarly, in the TC group, participants were only included if (9) they had 1 white-matter hyperintensity
≤
(WMHIs [76.2% of TC sample]). Researchers have reported that healthy adults with two or more WMHIs have abnormalities
on DTI metrics (distal from the hyperintensities) compared with adults with zero or one of hyperintensity (Iverson et al., 2011;
Lange, Brickell, et al., 2013; Lange, Shewchuk, et al., 2013). Application of these criteria resulted in retaining 130 participants
(39 TC, 91 MTBI [26 PCS-present, 65 PCS-absent]).
Second, in order to control for the influence of age, handedness, and preinjury alcohol consumption, participants were further
excluded if they were 50 years or older, left-handed, or whose preinjury alcohol consumption was considered to be unusually high
(defined as drinking .30 drinks per week and/or drinking five or more drinks per occasion during four or more days per week).
These additional criteria were applied following an exploratory frequency analysis that identified a number of outliers that were
considered to bias the analyses. Application of these criteria resulted in retaining 120 participants (39 TC and 81 MTBI [i.e., 22
PCS-present, 59 PCS-absent]).
Third, prior to DTI postprocessing, the MRI scans were inspected for image quality. Scans were excluded if they exhibited significant motion artifact or brain coverage was inadequate. Application of these criteria resulted in retaining a final sample of 108
participants (36 TC and 72 MTBI [i.e., 20 PCS-present, 52 PCS-absent]).
Some of the participants in this study were included in a previous study by Lange and colleagues (2012). In the current MTBI
group, 54.2% (n ¼ 39) were included in the previous study. In the current TC group, 50.0% (n ¼ 18) were included in the original
study. There were two primary reasons why participants from the original study were not included here. First, the inclusion of the
neuropsychological variables in this study resulted in the exclusion of some participants due to unsuccessful test completion, poor
English proficiency, and/or fluctuating attention (i.e., criteria 1–4 above). Second, more stringent criteria was applied to the TC
and MTBI groups in this study with regard to the structural MRI scans, in order to create “cleaner” groups (i.e., criteria 8 and 9
above).


Measures and Procedure

Participants completed a 1-h MRI brain scan and a 5-h neuropsychological assessment battery that included measures of neurocognitive functioning and self-reported mental health and postconcussion symptoms, 6–8 weeks postinjury (M ¼ 46.6 days,
≏
SD ¼ 6.0). All participants gavewritten informed consent inaccordance with theClinical ResearchEthics Board attheUniversity
of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.

Self-Reported symptoms. Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety
Inventory (BAI), and the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI). The BDI-II (Beck, Steer, & Brown,
1996) and BAI (Beck & Steer, 1993) arewidely used measures designed to assess depressiveand anxiety symptoms, respectively.
Totalscoresforeachmeasurewereobtainedbysummingtheindividual responsestoallitemsoneachscaleseparately.Inaddition,
forthepurposesofthisstudy,anadditionaltotalscorewascalculatedfortheBDI-IIusing10selectedsymptomsthatarebelievedto
havetheleastoverlapwithsymptomsofMTBI,andthatareconsideredmostrepresentativeofdepression(i.e.,BDI-II10-itemtotal
score). These items included sadness, loss of interest, loss of pleasure,pessimism, past failure, guilt feelings, punishment feelings,
self-criticalness, crying, and suicidal thoughts or wishes. The BDI-II 10-item total scorewascalculated bysumming the responses
to these 10 individual items.
The BC-PSI (Iverson, Zasler, & Lange, 2007) is a symptom inventory designed based on ICD-10 (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000) symptom criteria for PCS that requires the testtaker to rate the frequency (0 ¼ “not at all” to 5 ¼ “constantly”)
and intensity (0 ¼ “not at all” to 5 ¼ “very severe problem”) of 13 symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, sensitivity to noises, etc.) as well as the effect of three co-occurring life problems on daily living (i.e., effects of alcohol consumption,
worrying/ dwelling on symptoms, and self-perception of brain damage). For each of the 13 symptoms, the two ratings are multiplied together (frequency intensity) to create a single score for each item. These product-based scores were then converted to
×
itemscoresthatreflectboththefrequencyandintensityofsymptomendorsement (range ¼ 0–4).Itemscoresof3areinterpretedas
falling in the moderate range.
Responses on the BC-PSI were classified into two categories based on ICD-10 criteria for PCS: (a) PCS-present and (b)
PCS-absent. Participant responses were classified as PCS-present if they endorsed BC-PSI items as moderate or greater on 3
≥
of the six ICD-10 Category C criteria. Similarly, participant responses were classified as PCS-absent if they endorsed BC-PSI
items as a moderate or greater on,3 of the six ICD-10 Category C criteria. The percentages of patients who endorsed each individual symptom domain were as follows: physical symptoms ¼ 28.7%, emotional symptoms ¼ 15.7%, cognitive symptoms ¼
16.7%, poor sleep ¼ 20.4%, sensitivity to alcohol ¼ 18.5%, and being overly focused on and concerned about their symptoms ¼
35.2%.
It is important to appreciate that symptom endorsement on the BC-PSI cannot be used in isolation to evaluate whether a person
meets ICD-10 criteria for PCS. The diagnosis of PCS is complicated, challenging, and requires a comprehensive clinical evaluation (see Iverson et al., 2013 for a comprehensive discussion). This was not done here. Rather, endorsement of BC-PSI items that
meet ICD-10 symptom criteria for PCS simply reflects clinically elevated postconcussion symptom reporting and not a diagnosis
per se.


Neurocognitive measures. The neurocognitive measures consisted of 16 tests from the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery
(NAB; Stern & White, 2003). The NAB is a comprehensive, co-normed (across all tests) neuropsychological test battery that consists of 24 individual tests designed to assess cognitive functioning across five domains: attention, language, memory, spatial, and
executivefunctioning.Thenormativesampleislargeandthecoverageofneuropsychologicalabilitiesassessedisbroad.TheNAB
can beused inafixedor flexiblemanner. Only16 ofthe24 testswereselected foruse inordertoreduceadministration time. The16
selected tests result in 23 scores of interest. In order to reduce the number of cognitive variables for the analyses, the 23 scores of
interest were used to generate index scores for each of the five cognitive domains. The Attention and Memory indexes were generated as per the instructions in the manual. For the Language, Spatial, and Executive Functioning Indexes, however, not all tests
included in these indexes were administered. As such, these indexes were prorated. These three indexes were calculated by generating a prorated “sum of T-scores” which was converted to a standard score using the look-up table (i.e., Table 7.1) in the NAB
normative manual (Stern & White, 2003). The prorated sum of T-scores for the three indexes was calculated by averaging the
demographicallyadjusted T-scores across all available teststhat are included in each index. The mean T-scorewasthen multiplied
bythenumberofsubteststhatareusedtogeneratethefullversionoftheindex.FortheLanguageIndex,twooffivepossiblesubtests
were used (i.e., Oral Production and Naming). For the Spatial Index, two of four possible subtests were used (i.e., Visual
Discrimination and Design Construction). For the Executive Functioning Index, three of four possible subtests were used
(Categories, Mazes, and Word Generation). A NAB Total Score Index was also generated using the standard scores derived
for the five indexes above as per the instructions in the manual.
As part of the larger neurocognitive test battery, participants were also administered the (a) Test of Memory Malingering
(Tombaugh, 1996) to evaluate the possibility of poor effort during neuropsychological testing, (b) Reynolds Intellectual
Screening Test (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2003) to assess current level of intellectual ability, and (c) Wechsler Test of Adult
Reading (The Psychological Corporation, 2001) to assess premorbid level of intellectual ability. In addition, participants completed a semi-structured interview designed to gather information about their past and present medical, psychiatric, and personal
history. Detailed information regarding the duration of PTAwas obtained during this interview and reconstructed, when possible,
using collateral information obtained from hospital records.

Neuroimaging. All MRI data were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3T scanner equipped with Dual Nova Gradients (maximum
gradient strength 80 mT/m, max. slew rate 200 mT/m/s) and an eight-channel head coil. Partial parallel imaging was performed using sensitivity encoding (SENSE) (Pruessmann, Weiger, Scheidegger, & Boesiger, 1999). The total data acquisition
time was 43 min. The MRI protocol included: (a) axial T2-weighted turbo spin echo scan (TR ¼ 3000 ms, TE ¼ 80 ms, flip
angle ¼ 908, acquisition matrix ¼ 320 245, field of view ¼ 240 192 139 mm[3], acquired voxel size ¼ 0.75 0.78

relevant to this study.
The structural T1 and FLAIR images were reviewed by a board certified radiologist (JRS or MKSH) who determined whether
any visible trauma-related intracranial pathology was present. Common pertinent MRI pathologies that were coded included
number and location of susceptibility and T2 hyperintense foci, encephalomalacia, and extra-axial collections.

2004) were used for comparisons of FA, MD, AD, and RD. DTI sequences with poor field-of-view resulting in significant deficits in whole brain coverage or artifacts were not considered in the analysis. Motion and artifacts in the diffusion data were
corrected using affine registration of all gradient volumes with the first b ¼ 0 volume (FLIRT; FMRIB Software Library,
Oxford, UK), and gradient directions were compensated for rotations (Landman et al., 2007). This was followed by creation
of a manual brain mask based on the first b ¼ 0 image using 3D Slicer version 2.7 (Gering et al., 2001). Voxel-based comparisons (on the TBSS skeleton using randomize) of FA, MD, AD, and RD were performed using FSL Version 4.1.9 (Smith et al.,
2006). Briefly, individual FA maps were nonlinearly registered via FSL-FNIRT to the Montreal Neurological Institute
International Consortium Brain Mapping (ICBM)-152 template provided by FSL, followed by creation of a mean FA skeleton.
Individual FA values were then projected onto this mean skeleton. MD, AD, and RD values were projected onto the same template using the previously created FA transformation. FA threshold was set to 0.35 and the number of permutations was set at
5,000. The conservative threshold of 0.35 was chosen based on a visual inspection of the mean TBSS skeleton and represented
the best qualitative compromise between skeletal continuity and peripheral white-matter inclusion. Threshold-free cluster
enhancement with correction for family wise error rate was employed. The p, .05 T-contrast maps were projected on the
mean FA images. To identify which specific anatomical areas were implicated, the mean FA skeleton and contrast map were
overlaid with the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter label atlas (Hua et al., 2008; Mori, Wakana,
Nagai-Poetscher, & va Zigl, 2005; Wakana et al., 2007).
FSL statistics were then used to compute the mean FAvalues for each individual for each of the ROIs on the mean FA skeleton.
Mean values for MD, AD, and RD were done similarly. Forty-eight individual ROIs were identified according to the JHU
ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas (Hua et al., 2008; Mori et al., 2005; Wakana et al., 2007).
TheROIsfromtheICBM-DTI-81atlasincludedthe(a)genu,body,andspleniumofcorpuscallosum;(b)pontinecrossingtract,
fornix,and middlecerebellarpeduncle; and(c) twounilateralsymmetricalROIs(left/right) eachforthecorticospinal tract,medial

corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, sagittal stratum, external capsule, cingulum (cingulate gyrus), cingulum (hippocampus), fornix/stria terminalis, superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and
tapetum.
Due to the large number of ROIs, four summary scores were calculated for each participant and used in all statistical analyses.
The four summary scores represent the number of ROIs with FA, MD, AD, and RD values that fell below/above a specified cutoff

FA values that were .2 SDs below the mean, and MD, AD, and RD values that were .2 SDs above the mean, were classified as
reflecting an ROI with “reduced white-matter integrity” (i.e., abnormal score).

Demographic and Injury Characteristics


Descriptive statistics and group comparisons (using ANOVA and x[2] analyses) of demographic and injury characteristics are
presented in Table 1 (continuous variables) and Table 2 (categorical variables). In the MTBI group, there were no significant differences between the PCS-present and PCS-absent group for GCS scores, duration of LOC, duration of PTA, intracranial abnormality on day-of-injury CT scans, or intracranial abnormality on MRI scans 6–8 weeks postinjury (range: p ¼ .233–.999). When
comparing the remaining variables across the three groups (i.e., PCS-present, PCS-absent, and TC), there were no significant
effects for age, education, gender, ethnicity, preinjury alcohol use, day-of-injury BAL, mechanism of injury, days tested postinjury, current intellectual ability, or estimated premorbid intellectual ability (all p . .05).
There was a significantly greater proportion of women in the PCS-present group (45.0%) compared with men (21.2%; p ¼
.043). There was a significantly greater proportion of individuals who were intoxicated at the time of injury in the PCS-absent
group (76.0%) comparedwith thosewhowere sober (52.4%; p ¼ .042). The effect sizes (phi-coefficient; w) for these two findings
were relatively small (i.e., gender: w ¼ 0.24; intoxication: w ¼ 0.22). Further, the PCS-absent group had a significantly higher
level of education, and higher BALs at the time of injury, compared with the TC group (both p, .05, d ¼ 0.51 and 0.50, respectively).

Neuropsychological Measures


Descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and Cohen’s effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) for the self-reported symptoms and neurocognitive measures, by group, are presented in Table 3. For the self-reported symptoms, there were significant main effects (using
Kruskal–Wallis H tests due to non-normal distribution) for the BC-PSI total, BAI total, and BDI-II total scores. As expected, pairwisecomparisons(usingMann–Whitney U-tests)revealedthatthePCS-presentgrouphadhighertotalscoresontheBC-PSI,BAI,
and BDI-II compared with both the PCS-absent group (d ¼ 1.63–1.89 [Of course, the significant difference between the
PCS-present and PCS-absent group for the BC-PSI total score is not meaningful. This group difference is a direct consequence
of group classification. As such, the Cohen’s effect size for this comparison is not reported here.], very large effect sizes) and
TC group (d ¼ 1.22–2.46, very large effect sizes). There were no significant differences, or substantial effect sizes, when comparing the PCS-absent group and TC group across the three measures.
For the neurocognitive variables, therewere no significant main effects (using ANOVA) for the NAB Total Index (p ¼ .761) or
for the five NAB Indexes (range: p ¼ .138–.810). Pairwise comparisons revealed no significant differences between groups,
though there were a number of meaningful effect sizes. There was a trend for the PCS-present group to have better scores on
the Language Index compared with the PCS-absent group (d ¼ 0.50, medium effect size). There was a trend for the
PCS-absent group to have better scores on the Attention, Memory, and Language Indexes compared with the TC group (d ¼
0.25–0.34, small–medium effect sizes).
Comparison of the prevalence of the number of low neurocognitive scores was undertaken by considering all 23 individual
NAB measures simultaneously. The cumulative percentages of the number of low scores (using,16th and,10th percentile

FA, AD, RD, and MD brain regions,by group, are presented in Table 5. Therewere no significant main effects (Kruskal–Wallis H
tests) for the number of regions with abnormal FA, AD, RD, or MD across the three groups. However, pairwise comparisons
(Mann–Whitney U tests) revealed that participants in the PCS-present group had a statistically (p, .05) greater number of locationswithabnormal RDandMDcomparedwiththeTCgroup(d ¼ 0.36[small–mediumeffectsize]and d ¼ 0.56[mediumeffect

PCS-present and PCS-absent groups. The largest effect sizes were found for FA and AD (d ¼ 0.25 and 0.23, respectively)
between these groups.
The cumulative percentages of the number of abnormal FA, AD, RD, and MD regions by group are presented in Tables 6 and 7.
Using x[2] analyses, there were significant pairwise comparisons when comparing the PCS-present and TC groups on FA, RD, and

ROIs for RD [see Fig. 1], and 8 ROIs for MD [see Fig. 2]). The number of abnormal areas of white matter was calculated for each
individual across the select ROIs and was compared acrossthe three groups. There were significant main effects (Kruskal–Wallis
H tests) for the number of abnormal RD regions (p ¼ .029), but not MD regions (p ¼ .131). Pairwise comparisons (Mann–
Whitney U tests) revealed that participants in both the MTBI groups had a significantly greater (p, .05) number of abnormal
RD regions (i.e., PCS-absent: M ¼ 0.9, SD ¼ 2.1; PCS-present: M ¼ 1.5, SD ¼ 3.6) compared with the TC group (M ¼ 0.5,
SD ¼ 1.8; d ¼ 0.22 and 0.39, respectively). There were no significant differences between the PCS-present and PCS-absent
groups (p . .05, d ¼ 0.20, small effect size).
Examination of the cumulative percentages of the number of brain regions with abnormal RD and MD by group (data not
shown; available on request from RTL) revealed no significant pairwise differences across the three groups for the percentage
of patients that had multiple abnormal MD or RD regions. The one exception to this was for RD. The proportion of the
PCS-present group (45.0%) and PCS-absent group (30.8%) that had one or more abnormal RD regions was significantly
higher (p, .05) compared with the TC group (11.1%). There were no significant differences between the PCS-present and
PCS-absent groups.


Prediction of PCS-Present versus PCS-Absent Groups

To examine which factors provide the most unique contribution towards the prediction of postconcussion symptom reporting,
logistic regression analyses were undertaken to determine if select factors could identify participants in the PCS-present versus

PCS-absent groups. Factors were selected were as follows: (i) gender, (ii) education, (iii) BDI-II 10-item total score, (iv) BAI total
score, and (v) the total number of abnormal FA and MD scores combined. For the logistic regression analysis, all five factors were
entered simultaneously as the independent variables and group membership as the dependent variable.
Onlytwoofthesixvariablesweresignificantpredictorsofgroupmembership(depression[p ¼ .043]andBAItotal[p ¼ .043])
accounting for 52.1% of the variance (Nagelkerke R[2]; p, .001). Overall, 83.3% of participants were correctly classified using
depression and BAI total scores alone. However, classification rates were substantially higher when predicting the PCS-absent
group (94.2%) compared with the PCS-present group (55.0%). No DTI metrics entered the prediction model.


Discussion

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between DTI and postconcussion symptom reporting following
MTBI. There were three hypotheses. First, compared with the TC group, patients in both the MTBI groups would (a) report a
greater number of depression, anxiety, and postconcussion symptoms; (b) perform comparably on neurocognitive measures;
and (c) have reduced white-matter integrity in the brain as measured by DTI metrics. Second, in the MTBI group, patients who
met ICD-10 criteria for PCS would report a greater number of depression and anxiety symptoms compared with those who did
not meet criteria for PCS. Third, in the MTBI group, there would be no differences across all neurocognitive measures and
DTI metrics when comparing those patients who are classified as PCS-present versus PCS-absent.


MTBI versus Trauma Controls

Consistent with the first hypothesis, compared with the TC group, the PCS-present group (a) reported a greater number of depression, anxiety, and postconcussion symptoms; (b) had multiple regions of the brain with significant differences in MD and RD
using TBSS (but notAD orFA);and (c) had a greater numberof brainregionswith abnormal RD and MD (but notAD or FA) using
ROI analyses. In contrast, these differences were not found when comparing the PCS-absent and TC groups. Although the
PCS-absent group had a greater number of abnormal MD regions compared with the TC group, there were no group differences
when comparing (a) all DTI measures using TBSS, (b) FA, AD, and RD measures using ROI analyses, and (c) measures of
depression, anxiety, and postconcussion symptoms.
Fractional anisotropy is a representation of the directional coherence (anisotropy) of water diffusion, and MD represents the
average total diffusion of water within a particular voxel, irrespective of direction. Mean diffusivity values generally increase,
and FA values decrease in response to white-matter injury (Hulkower, Poliak, Rosenbaum, Zimmerman, & Lipton, 2013).
Radial diffusivity represents the diffusion of water perpendicular to the axon, and thus is thought to be sensitive to processes
such as demyelination (Mac Donald, Dikranian, Bayly, Holtzman, & Brody, 2007). AD represents the diffusivity parallel to
theaxon andhencechangesinADarethoughttoindicateaxonalcompromise(MacDonaldetal.,2007).Therefore,anexplanation
for our results is that the PCS group showed evidence of white-matter compromise (increased MD) mainly via a membrane in+
tegrity mechanism (increased RD). This is consistent with other research showing increased RD in the subacute period (Hulkower
et al., 2013; Mac Donald et al., 2007).
TBSS revealed a nonsignificant trend to lower FA values in the PCS groups. Given that increases in mean and RD generally
+
result in lower FA (because they are interrelated mathematical derivations), the nonsignificant findings for FAvalues could result
from insufficient sample size, or simply that MD is a more sensitive measure of white-matter integrity during the subacute period,
as has been observed in other studies (Hulkower et al., 2013).
ItispossiblethatsomeofthedifferencesinDTImetricsinthisstudybetweenthePCS-presentandTCgroupscouldberelated,at
leastin part, to the influence of depression and anxiety on physiology, rather than differences in the microstructureof white-matter
attributable to differences in biomechanical forces applied to the brain. Numerous studies have shown that depression and other
affective disorders are associated with white-matter abnormalities as identified by DTI. In a systematic review of DTI studies in
affective disorders, Sexton, Mackay, and Ebmeier (2009) concluded that “21 of 27 studies found significantly lower [fractional]
anisotropy in subjects with affective disorders compared to control subjects” (p. 814).
Nonetheless, the DTI results in this study are relatively consistent with some past studies that have compared controls with
MTBI groups divided into PCS-present/absent groups. For example, Messe´ et al. (2011) found that MTBI patients who were classified as having persistent PCS from,1 month to 3 months postinjury (but not those whose symptoms had improved) had higher
MD scores compared with a healthy controls in some ROIs (i.e., superior longitudinal fasciculus, corticospinal tract bilaterally,
and left anterior thalamic radiation). In another study, Messe et al. (2012) reported that compared with healthy controls, MTBI
patients who met criteria for ICD-10 PCS,1 month and 6 months postinjury had a greater number of abnormal brain regions
compared with those who did not meet ICD-10 PCS criteria.

Also consistentwith the first hypothesis, therewere no significant differences on the neurocognitivemeasureswhen comparing
theTCgroupwithbothMTBIgroups.Thisfindingwasnotsurprisingorunexpected.PatientswithMTBIperformpoorlyonneuropsychological tests in the initial days (e.g., Hughes et al., 2004; Lovell, Collins, Iverson, Johnston, & Bradley, 2004) and up to the
firstmonthfollowingtheinjury(e.g., Levinetal.,1987; Ponsfordetal.,2000),butcognitivedeficitstypicallyarenotseenafter1–3
months (e.g., Gentilini et al., 1985; Ponsford et al., 2000) in prospective group studies. This has been illustrated repeatedly
in reviews and meta-analyses (e.g., McCrea et al., 2009; Rohling, Larrabee, & Millis, 2012). In our study, we examined patients
at 6–8 weeks postinjury. Although this time period falls in the middle of when we might expect most,but certainly not all, patients
tohavenormal performance onneuropsychological tests; itis ourexpectation thattherewouldbeno measurablegroup differences
on neuropsychological testing at this time.


PCS-Present versus PCS-Absent

In support of the second hypothesis, those individuals in the MTBI group who were classified as PCS-present at 6–8 weeks
postinjury reported a greater number of depression and anxiety symptoms on the BAI and BDI-II compared with those patients
who were classified as PCS-absent. The effect sizes were very large (d ¼ 1.63 and 1.89, respectively). Of course, the relationship
between postconcussion symptoms and depression and anxiety found here is not new. Many researchers have reported a strong
relation between postconcussion symptoms and other self-reported mental health problems. In a military context, the relation
between postconcussion symptoms and depression or PTSD symptoms following MTBI is well established (e.g., Lange,
Brickel, et al., 2013; Lange, Shewchuk, et al., 2013; Lange et al., 2014). Similarly, in a civilian context, the relationship
between postconcussion symptoms and depression and anxiety following MTBI is also well established (Bryant & Harvey,
1999; Garden & Sullivan, 2010).
Consistent with the third hypothesis, there were no significant differences between those patients in the MTBI group that were
PCS-present versus PCS-absent across all neurocognitive measures and DTI metrics. The DTI results reported in this study are
consistent with some research that has also found no group differences in DTI metrics when an MTBI sample is divided into
ICD-10 PCS-present versus PCS-absent groups at 3-week postinjury (Waljas et al., 2014) and 6–8 weeks postinjury (Lange
et al., 2012). Of course, these results are not consistent with other studies that have reported differences between MTBI groups
when divided into PCS-present versus PCS-absent groups at 3 months (Messe´ et al., 2011) and 6 months (Hartikainen et al.,
2010; Messe et al., 2012) postinjury. Collectively, based on these results, one might argue that differences between
PCS-present versus PCS-absent groups are more likely to be detectable after 3 months following injury. However, contrary to
this, in a longitudinal study by Messe et al. (2012), these authors concluded that there were “significant structural differences”
found between PCS-present versus PCS-absent groups at,1 month postinjury, but less at 6-month postinjury.


Limitations

Thisstudyhas severalmethodological limitations.First,TBSSis aconservativeDTI approach thatwechose becausewehad no
a priori hypothesis that some regions would be affected over others. Other approaches that interrogate specific regions, such as
user-defined track selection or probabilistic tractography may indeed be more sensitive than a full brain analysis, if driven by a
well-informed hypothesis. Second, this study does not address medium- or long-term postconcussion symptom reporting, nor
did it address the course of recovery following MTBI. Longitudinal studies would assist in understanding the role of microstructural white-matter abnormality on the short-, medium-, and long-term outcome from MTBI. There are no such studies reported in
adults to date. Third, although the focus of this study was on the relationship between postconcussion symptomreporting and DTI,
itisnotpossibletoexcludetheinfluenceofotherfactorsthatmayhavehadacontributoryrole(e.g.,persistentpain[Smith-Seemiller,
Fow, Kant, & Franzen, 2003], “good old days” bias [Gunstad & Suhr, 2001], diagnosis threat [Suhr & Gunstad, 2002a], etc.).
However, we did include TC patients (rather than a healthy control group) because these patients tend to share more preinjury characteristicstotheirhead-injuredcounterparts(Dikmen,Machamer,Winn,&Temkin,1995).Assuch,thepotentialbiasofthesefactors
influencing the results in one group, but not the other, is mitigated. Fourth, there were a greater proportion of women in this sample
whometICD-10criteriaforPCScomparedwithmen.Nearly,1in2womenmetsymptomcriteriaforPCScomparedwith1in5men.
This is consistent with research that has found increased postconcussion symptom reporting in women compared with men (e.g.,
Meares et al., 2008). It is possible that sex differences influenced the results of this study. Fifth, it would be a mistake to assume
that the results from this study generalize to all people who sustain an MTBI. Our patients were recruited from a Level 1 trauma
center. The majority of people who sustain an MTBI in daily life are not evaluated in the Emergency Department of a hospital
(Sosin, Sniezek, & Thurman, 1996). Our patients had clear evidence of an MTBI. The vast majority of our patients underwent
day-of-injury CT scanning and a substantial minority had a day-of-injury intracranial abnormality. Therefore, the patient sample
used in this study represents a minority of the more seriously injured MTBI population.

Conclusion


Following an MTBI, there is no doubt that many people experience a range of postconcussion symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties). These symptoms typically resolve within the first few days, weeks, or months for most
people. However, for some people, these symptoms are reported many months or years postinjury. In this study, symptoms of depression and anxiety differentiated patients with MTBIs who met criteria for the postconcussion symptom versus those who did
not. In contrast, these groups did not differ on diverse metrics of DTI. These findings once again highlight that there are many
factors that can potentially account for postconcussion symptom reporting, even in the first 6–8 weeks of recovery. It has been
recommended that postconcussion symptom reporting be viewed from a biopsychosocial perspective (Iverson et al., 2013).
