Abstract

**Purpose and Objective: Psychological distress is known to contribute to recovery following mild**

traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and there is a need to understand the mechanisms that contribute to this

relationship. The present study examined psychological flexibility, as a hypothesised psychological

mechanism, in 169 treatment seeking adults with mTBI.

**Research method/design: Participants completed self-report measures of post-concussion symptoms,**

psychological distress (anxiety, stress, and depression) and functional status within four weeks of

entry to an mTBI outpatient clinic. A general measure (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire; AAQ
II), as well as a context specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire – Acquired Brain Injury;

AAQ-ABI (RA)) measure of psychological flexibility were administered.

**Results: Simple linear regression analysis showed that psychological flexibility made a significant**

contribution to the prediction of post-concussion symptoms and functional status. A series of multiple

mediation analyses also found that psychological flexibility had a significant indirect effect on the

relationships between psychological distress and post-concussion symptoms, and functional status.

The context specific, rather than the general measure of psychological flexibility, was consistently

shown to contribute to these findings.

**Conclusions/Implications: These results suggest that psychological flexibility may be a**

psychological mechanism that contributes to recovery outcomes in individuals with mTBI and could

therefore be an important treatment target in mTBI interventions.

Keywords: psychological flexibility, mild traumatic brain injury, post-concussion symptoms,

outcomes

**Impact and Implication Statement**

  - There is a growing need to identify the psychological mechanisms that explain the

relationship between psychological factors and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) recovery

outcomes; psychological flexibility may be one such mechanism.

  - This study found that psychological flexibility significantly contributes to post-concussion

symptoms and functional status in people after mTBI. Additionally, psychological flexibility

partly mediated the relationship between psychological distress and post-concussion

symptoms and functional status.

  - The present study provides novel evidence that psychological flexibility may be an important

psychological mechanism that contributes to recovery outcomes in individuals with mTBI.

  - Psychological flexibility may be an important treatment target in mTBI interventions.

There has been a shift in the understanding of prognosis and long-term consequences of mild

traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (Gardner & Yaffe, 2015). Historically, this injury was associated with

limited and transient behavioural changes with only a small minority (termed the “miserable

minority”) experiencing long term neuro-psychiatric sequelae (McCrea et al., 2003; Karr,

Areshenkoff & Garcia-Barrera, 2014). However, recent evidence from large longitudinal cohort

studies, where the confounds of selection bias are reduced, have found that nearly half of those with

mTBI can experience persistent symptoms beyond the timeframes historically stipulated (Dikmen,

Machamer, & Temkin, 2017; McInnes, Friesen, MacKenzie, Westwood, & Boe, 2017; McMahon et

al., 2014; Theadom et al., 2016; Barker-Collo et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2019). The impact of

persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) can be profound, causing significant disruptions in

wellbeing, functioning and quality of life (McCrea, Iverson, McAllister, Hammeke, Powell, Barr, &

Kelly, 2009; Silverberg, & Iverson, 2011; Carroll et al., 2014; Ahman, Saveman, Styrke, Bjornstig, &

Stålnacke, 2013). It is therefore not surprising that mTBI is a significant and increasing public health

problem globally (James et al., 2019; Te Ao et al., 2014). Consequently, understanding the factors that

contribute to the development of PPCS is of importance.

There is strong evidence that psychological factors significantly impact recovery following

mTBI (Broshek, De Marco & Freeman, 2015; Ponsford et al., 2012; 2019; Nelson et al., 2019;

Barker-Collo et al., 2015; Scott et al., 2016). A pre-injury mental health condition, and acute

psychological distress, have been found to be robust risk factors for PPCS (Silverberg et al., 2015),

supporting biopsychosocial modelling of mTBI recovery outcomes. In short, these models highlight

the role of pre-injury vulnerabilities, early physiological effects, and over time, an increasing role of

psychosocial factors (Berrigan, Marshall, McCullagh,Velikonja, & Bayley, 2011; Krpan, Stuss, &

Anderson, 2011; MacMillan, Hart, Martelli, & Zasler, 2002; McCrea et al., 2009; Polinder et al.,

2018; Silverberg & Iverson, 2011; Iverson, 2019; Rickards, Cranston, & McWhorter, 2020; Young,

2020). Despite these proposed models, systematic reviews of prognostic factors and multivariable

modelling have not yet identified a model that adequately predicts individual recovery outcomes from

mTBI (Silverberg et al., 2015).

There have been recent attempts to identify the specific psychological mechanisms that

influence the relationship between psychological factors and recovery outcomes after mTBI. Initial

investigations suggest that fear avoidance, catastrophising, uncertainty, emotion habituation and self
efficacy may contribute to mTBI recovery (Wijenberg et al., 2017; Mantua & Ready, 2019; Yehene et

al., 2019; Mah & Reed, 2018; Merz, Zane, Emmert, Lace, & Grant, 2019; Stubbs et al., 2020; Polich

et al., 2019; Snell et al., 2015; Greenberg et al., 2020; Silverberg et al., 2017). Yet, systematic reviews

have found limited evidence supporting psychological interventions which would target these factors

(e.g. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) for the management of post-concussion symptoms (Snell,

Surgenor, Hay-Smith & Siegert, 2009; Sullivan et al., 2020; Arbabi, Sheldon, Bahadoran, Smith,

Poole, & Agrawal, 2020; Teo, Fong, Chen, & Chung, 2020). Methodological problems with included

studies aside, one possibility is that these types of interventions may not sufficiently address

underlying psychological mechanisms. Consequently, identifying additional psychological

mechanisms that contribute to symptom persistence could also inform psychological treatments and

result in more efficacious recovery outcomes after mTBI.

Psychological flexibility may be one such mechanism that contributes to recovery outcomes

after mTBI (Whiting et al. 2015; Whiting et al., 2017 Faulkner et al., 2020). Psychological flexibility

can be succinctly defined as the pursuit of values despite the presence of pain or distress (Kashdan,

Disabato, Goodman, Doorley & McKnight, 2020; Hayes et al., 2004; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson,

2011). More specifically, psychological flexibility involves adapting to changing situational demands,

allocating mental resources, shifting perspective, and finding balance amongst competing demands

(Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010). Psychologically flexible individuals are less invested in controlling

uncomfortable internal states with the sole aim to maximise pleasant and minimise unpleasant feelings

(Kashdan et al., 2020). Psychological inflexibility contributes to a range of health conditions

including, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, chronic pain and insomnia (Bond et al., 2011;

Masuda & Tully, 2012; Chawla & Ostafin, 2007; Leonidou, Panayiotou, Bati, & Karekla, 2019;

Bohlmeijer, Fledderus, Rokx, & Pieterse, 2011; Scott, Hann, & McCracken, 2016; Luoma, Drake,

Kohlenberg, & Hayes, 2011; Bluett et al., 2016; de Boer, Steinhagen, Versteegen, Struys &

Sanderman, 2014; Densham, Williams, Johnson, & Turner-Cobb, 2016). Psychological flexibility is

conceptualised as a psychological mechanism as it exerts an influence on the relationship between

psychological factors (i.e. rumination, impulsivity) and health outcomes (i.e. psychological distress,

pain, fatigue) (Morris & Mansell, 2018). That is, high levels of psychological inflexibility can result

in the rigid implementation of these factors which maintains psychological symptoms. Psychological

flexibility is a viable target for psychological interventions, lying at the core of Acceptance and

Commitment therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl & Wilson, 2009). Psychological flexibility has been

found to mediate mental health outcomes in several ACT randomised controlled trials (Arch,

Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, & Craske, 2012; Forman et al., 2012; Twohig, Plumb Vilardaga, Levin, &

Hayes, 2015).

Psychological flexibility has been found to be context specific; that is, inflexible responses

can manifest specifically in response to thoughts and feelings that pertain to a specific condition (Ong,

Lee, Levin & Twohig, 2019). As a result, alongside general measures of psychological flexibility (i.e.

the Action and Acceptance Questionnaire Revised (AAQ-II; Bond et al., 2011), researchers have

derived domain specific variants that assess psychological flexibility in particular conditions, for

example body image concerns (Body Image Acceptance and Action Questionnaire [BI-AAQ]

(Sandoz, Wilson, Merwin & Kellum, 2013)). Due to more specific wording, these measures can

provide a more sensitive measure of psychological flexibility with respect to the problem of interest

(Gregg et al., 2007; Houghton et al., 2014; Vowles & McCracken, 2008). In a review of AAQ-II and

its variants, Ong et al., (2019) found that context specific measures performed better than a generic

measure of psychological flexibility with respect to incremental validity and sensitivity to treatment

effects. In the broader Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) context, Whiting and colleagues (2015) explored

the impact of psychological flexibility on mental health outcomes. In this study, the AAQ-II, as well

as a context specific derivative (AAQ-ABI) were administered. They found that in 150 participants

with ABI (117 severe traumatic brain injury, 11 brain tumour, 9 hypoxic injury, 13 cerebrovascular

accident), self-report measures of reduced psychological flexibility were significantly associated with

increased depression, anxiety and stress. The authors noted that the magnitude of the correlation

6


-----

differed between the AAQ-II and the AAQ-ABI suggesting that both measures may be capturing

different aspects of psychological flexibility. In support of the use of context specific variants of

psychological flexibility, it was concluded that the AAQ-ABI appears to measure psychological

flexibility about the thoughts and feeling related to a brain injury, whereas the AAQ-II measures

psychological flexibility about general psychological distress.

Recently, Faulkner and colleagues (2020) proposed that psychological flexibility is a

mechanism that might influence recovery outcomes following mTBI. This hypothesis was based on

the following: a relationship exists between psychological flexibility and pre-injury psychological risk

factors such as a pre-injury mental health condition (Meares et al., 2008; Silverberg et al., 2015) and

resilience (Sullivan, Kempe, Edmed & Bonanno (2016); psychological flexibility may be associated

with frontal lobe functioning (Whiting et al., 2017), brain regions known to be vulnerable to the

pathophysiology associated with mTBI (Lipton et al., 2015). Further, following the injury, post
concussion symptoms such as low mood, stress and anxiety, and neuropsychological dysfunction,

such as executive function difficulties, may be present (Ruff et al., 2009). These factors are all

associated with psychological inflexibility (Whiting et al., 2017; Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010).

Although a lack of evidence exists at present, post-concussion symptoms may exacerbate and

maintain the effects of pre-injury risk and/or the injury-related impacts on psychological flexibility.

Finally, post-concussion symptoms following mTBI can also precipitate certain psychological

responses, such as avoidance, to cope with the ongoing effects of the injury. Psychological

inflexibility could result in these responses being applied more rigidly and thus contribute to symptom

persistence and reduced functioning (Morris & Mansell, 2018). The objective of this study is to begin

to test this hypothesis and examine the role of psychological flexibility in mTBI recovery. To achieve

this, we first aim to investigate if psychological flexibility makes a unique contribution to post
concussion symptoms and functional status. We also aim to examine psychological flexibility as a

psychological mechanism and explore its role in influencing the relationship between psychological

distress and mTBI recovery outcomes.

**Method**

**Participants and Procedure**

The Auckland University of Technology ethics committee provided ethics approval for this

study (ref 20/32). Adult patients were recruited from outpatient clinics providing rehabilitation

services for mTBI in the North Island of New Zealand between March 2020 and September 2020. At

the recruitment sites, participants were approached by a clinician within one month of entry into the

service and invited to participate. Inclusion criteria were adults 18 years or older who had been

diagnosed with an mTBI in accordance with the WHO Neurotrauma Taskforce criteria (Holm et al.,

2005). Patients that were non-fluent in English, had a prior neurological condition, or had a severe

unstable medical condition were excluded. Eligible and consenting participants completed

questionnaires via REDCap (Harris, Taylor, Thielke, Payne, Gonzalez, & Conde, 2009), a secure web
based platform, or via telephone (with data entered into the database manually).

**Measures**

**_Demographic and Clinical Variables: Data on demographic and clinical variables were_**

ascertained via the online self-report questionnaire. Demographic variables included: age, gender,

ethnicity, education, relationship status, pre-injury employment status, as well as medical, concussion

and mental health history. Clinical variables were time since injury, mechanism of injury, and other

injury sustained.

**_Psychological Flexibility. Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II). The AAQ-II measures_**

experiential avoidance (EA), which is thought to be indicative of psychological inflexibility. EA

involves both emotional and behavioural avoidance employed to minimise the discomfort associated

with internal experiences (Hayes, Wilson, Gifford, Follette, & Strosahl. 1996). It is a manifestation of

psychological inflexibility because engaging in EA leads one to respond in an inconsistent or

inflexible manner to a variety of experiences. The AAQ-II is a 7-item questionnaire utilising a 7-point

Likert scale (response format, 1 = ‘never true’ to 7 = ‘always true’) with scores ranging from 7 to 49.

Higher scores are indicative of greater psychological inflexibility or experimental avoidance. The

8


-----

AAQ-II has been found to have good reliability and validity, with the Confirmatory Factor Analysis of

this measure supporting a one-factor model (Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.78 to 0.88; Bond et al.,

2011).

_AAQ-ABI (RA). The AAQ-ABI (Reactive Avoidance (RA)) is a 9-item questionnaire_

containing questions to address experiential avoidance associated with reactions about having a brain

injury (Sylvester, 2011; Whiting et al., 2015). The reactive avoidance subscale is derived from the 15

item, AAQ-ABI (Sylvester, 2011). The AAQ-ABI has a three factor structure (factor 1 (9 items) =

reactive avoidance; factor 2 (2 items) = denial; factor 3 (2 items) = active acceptance), however,

factors 2 and 3 have been found to have poor psychometric properties (Whiting et al., 2015). As a

result, in the present study only the AAQ-ABI (RA) was used. The AAQ-ABI (RA) uses a 5-point

Likert scale (0= ‘never true’ to 4 = ‘always true’) with scores ranging from 0 to 36; higher scores

indicate greater psychological inflexibility associated with an ABI. The measure has been developed

and validated in an undifferentiated sample of ABI (Cronbach’s alpha 0.89; Whiting et al., 2015). In

the current study, items within the questionnaire were modified by replacing “brain injury” with

“concussion” in accordance with the characteristics of the sample and their engagement in an

outpatient treatment programme that was referred to as a ‘concussion service’. Faulkner and

colleagues (2021) found that the AAQ-ABI (RA) has one distinct underlying factor in an mTBI

sample and strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.87). In accordance with their

recommendations, in the current study, ordinal measures were converted to interval scores using their

conversion table to improve the psychometric properties of the measure.

**_Post-Concussion Symptoms. The_** Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire

(RPQ) is a 16 item self-report questionnaire that assesses common symptoms following mTBI

(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90) (King, Crawford, Wenden, Moss & Wade, 1995). The RPQ consists of

somatic symptoms (headaches, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, noise and light sensitivity, sleep

disturbance and double vision); cognitive symptoms (forgetfulness/poor memory, poor concentration,

and taking longer to think); and emotional symptoms (being irritable/easily angered feeling depressed

or tearful, feeling frustrated or impatient). Participants are required to rate the presence and problem

9


-----

status of these symptoms on a scale of 0 - 4 (0 = not experienced at all; 1 = no more of a problem than

before injury; 2 = a mild problem; 3 = a moderate problem; 4 = a severe problem). Scores of 1 (“no

more of a problem than before injury”) were recoded to 0 as per the recommendations of King et al.,

(1995).

**_Psychological Distress. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21; Lovibond &_**

Lovibond, 1995) is a 21 item self-report with three subscales that measure depression, anxiety, and

stress over the previous week. It utilises a 4-point Likert scale with 0 = never, 1 = sometimes, 2 =

often, and 3 = always. Higher scores on this measure are indicative of elevated levels of depression,

anxiety and stress. The DASS-21 has good psychometric properties (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.73-0.81;

Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) and is a valid measure of depression, anxiety and stress in people with

ABI (Ownsworth, Little, Turner, Hawkes, & Shum, 2008). A recent structural equation modeling

analysis supported a three-factor structure of the DASS-21, and the internal consistency of each factor

was very good (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82-0.90, Randall, Thomas, Whiting, & McGrath, 2017).

**_Functional Status._** The 12-item WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) is a

questionnaire evaluating disability representing six International Classification of Functioning (ICF)

activity and participation domains including cognition, self-care, mobility, interpersonal functioning,

life activities, and participation (Üstün, Kostanjsek, Chatterji & Rehm, 2010; Federici, Bracalenti,

Meloni & Luciano, 2016). The WHODAS 2.0 asks respondents how much difficulty they have had in

the past 30 days in relation to all their health problems for each of the 12 items. The Likert scale

options are: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = extreme/cannot do (higher scores

represent greater disability). Snell, Siegert and Silverberg (2020) showed that the 12-item WHODAS

2.0 had high internal consistency in mTBI (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.92). In accordance with their

recommendations, in the current study, ordinal scores on the WHODAS 2.0 were converted to interval

scores using their conversion table provided, to improve the psychometric properties of the measure.

**Data Analysis. Statistical analyses were computed using SPSS version 26. The dataset was**

complete (no missing data), and so no imputation strategies were required. Statistical significance was

set to p<0.05. A power analysis using the G*power software (Faul et al., 2009) was used to ensure

10


-----

adequate same size for the regression and mediation analyses. Assuming a medium effect size (f[2]) of

0.15, an alpha of 0.80, and a maximum of 11 predictors, power analysis suggested a minimum sample

of 123 participants. Descriptive analyses and Pearson’s product moment correlations (r) (Field, 2013)

were conducted to broadly characterize psychological flexibility and demographic, clinical, and

questionnaire measures in our sample. In accordance with our first aim, which is to determine the

unique contribution of psychological flexibility to post-concussion symptoms and functional status,

regression analyses were run. Both the context specific (AAQ-ABI (RA)) and general measure of

psychological flexibility (AAQ-II) were entered into the model based on previous findings that these

measures capture different aspects of psychological flexibility (Whiting et al., 2017). To control for

possible confounding effects, demographic and clinical variables known to exert an influence on

outcomes (post-concussion symptoms/functional status) and/or psychological flexibility were selected

(Heinze, Wallisch & Dunkler, 2018). This included age (Karr, Luoto, Gilman, Berghem, Kotilainen &

Iverson, 2020), gender (Bazarian, Blyth, Mookerjee, He, & McDermott, 2010), other injury sustained

(Cnossen et al., 2018), medical history (Ponsford et al., 2012), concussion history (Theadom et al.,

2016), and mental health history (Silverberg et al., 2015). Additionally, given the association between

psychological flexibility and psychological distress (Whiting et al., 2017; Leahy & Melwani, 2012),

measures of anxiety, depression and stress were included in the model, to ensure the unique role of

psychological flexibility could be captured. The selected predictor variables were entered into a

multiple regression model to identify the factors that made a significant (p<0.05) contribution to either

RPQ and WHODAS 2.0.

To achieve our second aim mediation analysis was used, given the role of psychological

flexibility as a mechanism that exerts an influence on the relationship between two variables

(psychological factors and recovery outcomes) (MacKinnon, Fairchild & Fritz, 2010). A series of

mediation analyses were conducted using PROCESS for SPSS (Hayes, 2012) to evaluate the indirect

effects of psychological flexibility for the relationship between predictors (anxiety, depression and

stress) and dependent variables (post-concussion symptoms and functional status). Multiple mediation

analyses were conducted for the two measures of psychological flexibility (M1 = AAQ-ABI (RA) and

11


-----

M2 = AAQ-II). We estimated the individual effect of each dependent variable on each mediator (i.e.

stress, AAQ-ABI(RA); path A), the effect of each mediator on the predictor variables (i.e. AAQ
ABI(RA), post-concussion symptoms; path B), and the indirect effect of the dependent variables

through each of the individual mediators (path A x B). We compared the direct effect (path C’; the

effect of the dependent variable on the predictor variable minus each mediator) and the total effect

(path C; the effect of the dependent variable on the predictor variable plus each mediator). We

assessed the magnitude of all mediation effects (paths A x B) by the standardized beta coefficients.

Six models were analysed, with each predictor and dependent variable, and two mediators (PROCESS

model #4). We assessed the reliability of the sample mediation effects via the percentile

(nonparametric) 95% confidence interval (CI) generated by a bootstrapping procedure with a

resample rate of 5,000 to avoid inflation of type 1 error rate (Preacher & Hayes, 2008; Fritz, Taylor &

MacKinnon, 2012). Bootstrapping is a computational nonparametric resampling technique that

enables population characteristics to be estimated from the existing sample (Mooney & Duval, 2006).

We report variance in post-concussion symptoms and functional status that is explained by each

mediation model (overall R[2]).

**Results**

The sample consisted of 169 adults with mTBI. Table 1 presents the demographic and injury

characteristics of the sample.

-------------------------------------------------------Table 1-------------------------------------------------------
Mean, standard deviations, and range for all self-report measures are reported in Table 2. The

sample had on average anxiety, depression, and stress scores in the mild range.

**Contribution of Psychological Flexibility to Post-Concussion Symptoms and Functional**

**Status**

As shown in Table 3, psychological flexibility was a significant predictor of post-concussion

symptoms and functional status. Specifically, the context specific measure of psychological flexibility

12

(AAQ-ABI (RA)) made a significant contribution to post-concussion symptoms (β = 1.06, p<.001),

and functional status (β = -0.48, p<.001), whilst accounting for demographic, clinical and

psychological variables. In addition to psychological flexibility, medical history (β =-3.70, p<.001),

and stress (β =1.33, p<.001), also significantly contributed to post-concussion symptoms. Anxiety (β

= 0.19, p<.001) also made a significant contribution to functional status.

**The mediation effects of psychological flexibility in the relationship between**

**psychological distress and outcomes**

The bootstrapped method (PROCESS) with n = 5000 bootstrap resamples and 95% bias

corrected and accelerated confidence intervals was used in a series of analyses to examine the indirect

effects of psychological flexibility (M1 = AAQ-ABI (RA), M2 = AAQ-II) on the relationship between

psychological distress (stress, anxiety, depression) and outcomes (post-concussion symptoms and

functional status).

All six multiple indirect effect models, with post-concussion symptoms and functional status

(x) as predictors and anxiety, stress, and depression (y) as dependent variables, showed a significant

indirect effect of psychological flexibility (i.e. the combined indirect effects of AAQ-ABI (RA) and

AAQ-II). Detailed results of each model pertaining to each dependent variable showing the indirect

effects are summarised in Table 4

-------------------------------------------------------Table 4--------------------------------------------------------
**Stress, Psychological Flexibility and Outcomes**

The full model showed a significant indirect effect of psychological flexibility on the

relationship between stress and post-concussion symptoms (β = .35, p<.01), and stress and functional

status (β = .32, p<.01). Among the individual psychological flexibility factors, in both models, only

the AAQ-ABI (RA) had a significant indirect effect in the full model (path A X B; post-concussion

symptoms: β = 0.44, p <.01; functional status: β = 0.26, 95% p<.01). In each analysis, on each

respective path, the AAQ-ABI (RA) illustrated significant coefficients in both a and b paths. The

13


-----

AAQ-ABI (RA) showed significant coefficients in both paths when functional status was the predictor

variable (see Figure 1). The total effects of stress on post-concussion symptoms and functional status

was significant (β = 1.75, P <.01; β = .54, P <.01), as was the direct effect of stress on post-concussion

symptoms and functional status (β = 1.40, P <.01; β = .18, P <.01), indicating that the mediation was

partial. The model explained 49.76% of the variance on post-concussion symptoms and 47.38% on

functional status.

-------------------------------------------------------Figure 1--------------------------------------------------------
**Anxiety, Psychological Flexibility and Outcomes**

The full model showed a significant indirect effect of psychological flexibility on the

relationship between anxiety and post-concussion symptoms (β = .65, p<.01), and anxiety and

functional status (β = .32, p<.01). Among the individual psychological flexibility factors, in both

models, only the AAQ-ABI (RA) had a significant indirect effect in the full model (path A X B; post
concussion symptoms: β = 0.63, p<.01; functional status: β = 0.24, 95% p<.01). In each analysis, on

each respective path, the AAQ-ABI illustrated significant coefficients in both a and b paths (see

Figure 2). The total effects of anxiety on post-concussion symptoms and functional status was

significant (β = 1.52, P <.01; β = .59, p<.01), as was the direct effect of stress on post-concussion

symptoms and functional status (β = 0.88, P <.01; β = .26, p<.01), indicating that the mediation was

partial. The full model explained 40.86% of the variance on post-concussion symptoms and 49.23%

on functional status.

-------------------------------------------------------Figure 2--------------------------------------------------------
**Depression, Psychological Flexibility and Outcomes**

The full model showed a significant indirect effect of psychological flexibility on the

relationship between depression and post-concussion symptoms (β = .63, P <.01), and depression and

functional status (β = .31, p<.01). Among the individual psychological flexibility factors, in both

models, only the AAQ-ABI (RA) had a significant indirect effect in the full model (path A X B; post
concussion symptoms: β = 0.62, p<.01; functional status: β = 0.23, p<.01). In each analysis, on each

respective path, the AAQ-ABI(RA) illustrated significant coefficients in both a and b paths (see

14


-----

Figure 3). The total effects of depression on post-concussion symptoms and functional status was

significant (β = 1.11, P <.01; β = .46, p<.01), as was the direct effect of stress on post-concussion

symptoms and functional status (β = 0.49, P <.01; β = .15, p<.01), indicating that the mediation was

partial. The full model explained 37.10% of the variance on post-concussion symptoms and 46.81%

on functional status.

**Discussion**

The objective of this study was to examine the role of psychological flexibility in recovery

after mTBI. To achieve this, we aimed to examine the unique contribution of psychological flexibility

on mTBI recovery outcomes. After considering demographic and clinical variables, as well as current

mental health status, psychological flexibility was found to significantly contribute to post-concussion

symptoms and functional status. A further aim of this study was to examine psychological flexibility

as a psychological mechanism that mediates the relationship between psychological distress and

recovery outcomes after mTBI. A series of simple mediation analyses found that psychological

flexibility partially mediated the relationship between psychological distress and recovery outcomes.

Specifically, the multiple mediation model and bootstrapping procedure indicated that psychological

flexibility meaningfully contributed to the relationship between stress, anxiety and depression, on

post-concussion symptoms and functional status. With psychological flexibility as a mediating

variable, in some of the analyses nearly half of the variance on post-concussion symptoms and

functional status was explained; with slightly better prediction with anxiety and stress as the starting

point of the model as compared to depression.

The results of this study support previous research highlighting the role of psychological

flexibility in health conditions. Psychological flexibility has been found to have a significant effect on

symptoms in those with chronic pain, insomnia, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue (Wicksell et al.,

2013; de Boer et al., 2014; Densham, Williams, Johnson, & Turner-Cobb, 2016; McCracken, &

Morley, 2014; McCracken, Williams, & Tang 2011). For example, Gentili and colleagues (2019)

found that psychological flexibility (measured as avoidance, value obstruction, and value progress)

15


-----

had a significant indirect effect on the relationship between symptoms and functioning in chronic

pain. Most pertinent to the current study, psychological flexibility has been found to contribute to

mental health outcomes in ABI (Whiting et al., 2015), and holds promise as an important change

mechanism in psychological interventions in this population (Whiting et al., 2020; 2020; Sander et al.,

2020). The current results provide preliminary evidence that psychological flexibility may contribute

to post-concussion symptoms and functional status after mTBI. Further evidence is needed, however,

interventions that target psychological flexibility may improve recovery outcomes after mTBI.

Psychological flexibility is context specific and as a result measures have been designed to

assess this construct in particular conditions (Ong, Lee, Levin, & Twohig, 2019). In the current study.

two measures of psychological flexibility; a general measure (the AAQ-II), as well as a context specific

derivative (AAQ-ABI (RA)) were used. Our results support findings that context specific measures are

[more sensitive at detecting psychological flexibility in the domain of interest (Gregg et al.,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221214471930033X?casa_token=X7ypcxgdZe8AAAAA:cRtNnyPW_jbTha1cbpZFWwKOMiWb-xFUwzJssDPqaygszBswuMO2HhSDnE1SR6Gg6DMIn7JtyrEM#bib39)

2007, Houghton et al., 2014, Vowles & McCracken, 2008). This study found that only the context

specific measure (AAQ-ABI (RA)) contributed significantly to recovery outcomes, and partially

mediated the relationship between psychological distress, post-concussion symptoms, and functional

status. Although further research is needed, these findings could inform the treatment approaches

utilised for mTBI population. It suggests that when targeting psychological flexibility in people with

mTBI, intervention techniques, such as those proposed by ACT (i.e. mindfulness, acceptance,

defusion), could be tailored to address thoughts and feelings specifically pertaining to the mTBI.

Psychological difficulties are common among people after mTBI and can be precipitated by

the injury (van der Horn et al., 2019), it’s impact on functioning (Broshek, De Marco, & Freeman,

2015) and psychosocial stressors (Bryant, 2008). It may also reflect a continuation and exacerbation

of pre-injury mental health status (Karr et al., 2019). Psychological factors have a significant role in

predicting recovery following mTBI (Silverberg et al., 2015). Attempts are now being made to

understand the psychological mechanisms that underlie this relationship (Silverberg et al., 2018). This

will improve explanatory models and provide targets for mTBI interventions. Our results suggest that

psychological flexibility may be one such mechanism. Fear avoidance has also been proposed as a

16


-----

mechanism that could contribute to mTBI recovery (Cassetta, Cairncross, Brasher, Panenka, &

Silverberg, 2020; Silverberg, Panenka, & Iverson, 2018; Wijenberg et al., 2017). Fear avoidance

postulates that anxiety may lead to symptom amplification due to misattribution of symptoms and

elimination or reduction of activities. Interestingly, getting stuck in misattributing patterns (i.e.

catastrophising) or avoidant behaviour could be conceptualised as a manifestation of psychological

inflexibility (Özkan, Zale, Ring, & Vranceanu, 2017). Future research would benefit from exploring

these associations as psychological flexibility may also influence recovery after mTBI through other

mediating mechanisms such as fear avoidance and catastrophising.

There are limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the results of the study. We

used a cross-sectional design and as such causality cannot be inferred. The relationships between

examined variables in the mediation models are likely to be bidirectional, with post-concussion

symptoms and reduced functional status increasing psychological distress through the mediating role

of psychological flexibility. Future research should explore these relationships within longitudinal

designs to examine how these relationships might evolve or change over time. This is particularly

pertinent for mTBI in which the development of PPCS can transpire with time. Our sample were

recruited within one month of entry to an outpatient mTBI treatment service and the average time

since injury (8.73 weeks) was below current definitions of persistent symptoms (typically greater than

three months). Future research should aim to explore psychological flexibility over multiple time

points to investigate its role in the development and maintenance of persistent symptoms. It is also

important to highlight that participants had been referred for specialty care for the management of

their post-concussion symptoms, and therefore our sample is not representative of the wider mTBI

population. The study findings there cannot be generalised to the wider mTBI population. Finally, the

AAQ-II, and therefore the AAQ-ABI, measures one facet of psychological flexibility, reactive

avoidance. Future research would benefit from exploring the relationship between psychological

flexibility and mTBI recovery outcomes using more comprehensive measures of psychological

flexibility such as the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Index (Rolffs, Rogge, & Wilson,

2018) or the Personalised Psychological Flexibility Index (PPFI; Kashdan et al., 2020).

**Conclusion**

In this study, psychological flexibility significantly contributed to post concussion symptoms

and functional status in a sample of treatment seeking adults with mTBI. In addition, psychological

flexibility had a significant mediating role on the relationship between psychological distress and

outcomes (post-concussion symptoms and functional status). The present findings suggest that

psychological flexibility may be an important psychological mechanism that could contributes to

mTBI recovery and may be an important treatment target in mTBI interventions.
