**ABSTRACT**
**Introduction: Recovery and return to play are important milestones for athletes who sustain sport-**
related concussions (SRC). Several factors have been shown to influence resolution of postconcussion related symptoms (PCS), but resilience, a trait that reflects the ability to overcome
adversity, is another factor that may influence recovery. The aim of this study was to determine the
relationship of resilience with resolution of symptoms during recovery in adolescents and young
adults following SRC.
**Method: This prospective study is part of the North Texas Concussion Registry (ConTex). Subjects**
(N = 332) aged 13 to 25 years who sustained a SRC within 10 days of presenting to clinic were
evaluated at two time points: initial clinical visit and three-month follow-up. Resilience was
measured by the self-report Brief Resilience Survey (BRS) and PCS by the Sport Concussion
Assessment Tool-5 Symptom Evaluation Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS). Recovery was
determined by self-reported return to sports/physical activity and percent back to normal.
**Results: Repeated measures ANCOVA and linear regression models showed that lower resilience**
ratings at initial visit were associated with a greater number and severity of PCSS symptoms along
with higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during recovery from SRC. At three months,
subjects with lower initial resilience ratings were less likely to report feeling back to normal and
had greater aggravation of symptoms from physical and cognitive activity even when they had
returned to sports/physical activity.
**Conclusions: Lower resilience was associated with greater symptoms and delayed recovery from**
SRC. Results suggest that resilience may be another important factor to address in recovery from
SRC. Future research is needed to examine the extent to which resilience measured after SRC
reflects pre-injury characteristics and to better inform the development of interventions to pro­
mote resilience during recovery.

##### Introduction

Participation in sports and exercise in the United States
has steadily increased since 2003, with 25.9% of those
aged 15–24 engaged in some form of sport or exercise
(Woods, 2017). With this rise in participation comes
concern regarding sport-related concussion (SRC) in
athletes and physically active individuals. An estimated
2.5 million high school students in the U.S. reported
sustaining a concussion in 2017, with prevalence in
athletes being significantly greater than that of nonathletes (DePadilla et al., 2018). In a slightly older popu­
lation of 954 undergraduate university students, SRC
accounted for 35.6% of all concussions (Breck et al.,
2019). Recovery and clearance for return to play are


paramount for athletes who have sustained SRC, with
resolution of post-concussion-related symptoms being
a key factor (McCrory et al., 2017). Premorbid psycho­
logical factors such as anxiety, depression, and resilience
may affect symptom severity and influence recovery
(Durish et al., 2019; Iverson et al., 2017; Lange et al.,
2011), although not much research has specifically
addressed resilience in this context.

Resilience has been defined as a personality trait
demonstrating “the ability to bounce back or cope suc­
cessfully despite substantial adversity” (Rutter, 1985).
The definition of resilience has evolved over time and
has been conceptualized to include a framework of
individual, family, and social protective factors and

possibly an interaction between risk factors and protec­
tive resources (Haase, 2004; Neils-Strunjas et al., 2017).
It may function as a developmental process (Gillespie
et al., 2007) or a positive adaptation following
a significant threat or adversity (Luthar et al., 2000).
For the current study, resilience was defined as the
ability to “bounce back” or recover from a stressinducing event such as an injury (Smith et al., 2008).
Resilience as such has been measured by several selfrated scales including The Resilience Scale (Wagnild &
Young, 1993), the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale
(Connor & Davidson, 2003), and the Brief Resilience
Scale (BRS; Smith et al., 2008). Resilience has been
found to affect rehabilitation and adaptation to a wide
range of acquired brain injuries (Neils-Strunjas et al.,
2017), including mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or
concussion (Durish et al., 2019; Kreutzer et al., 2016;
Losoi et al., 2015; McCauley et al., 2013; Rainey et al.,
2014).

Low resilience, as specifically assessed by the BRS, has
been shown to have a negative association with recovery
following various physical injuries and after surgery.
Patients with orthopedic injuries and low resilience
were found to experience decreased functionality during
recovery following surgery compared to patients with
higher BRS scores (Tokish et al., 2017). In studies of
patients with concussion from various causes, high resi­
lience (BRS) predicted lower scores on the
Neurobehavioural Symptom Inventory, a widely used
multidimensional symptom measure (Cicerone &
Kalmar, 1995; Sullivan et al., 2015). Whether the rela­
tionship between resilience and post-concussion recov­
ery applies specifically to SRC has yet to be determined.
The objective of this investigation was to determine if
low resilience would be associated with higher selfreported post-concussion symptoms, anxiety, depres­
sion, and prolonged recovery from SRC in an adolescent
and young adult population.

##### Methods

**_Study population and participants_**

This prospective study included 332 participants aged
13–25 years diagnosed with a recent SRC, enrolled within
ten days of injury, at one of five North Texas Concussion
Registry (ConTex) clinic sites between January 2015 and
April 2020 who completed both initial and three-month
follow-up assessments. A standardized, multimodal
approach was used at all sites to confirm diagnosis
(Cullum et al., 2020; Henry et al., 2016; McCrory et al.,
2017). The University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center Institutional Review Board provided approval


for participating sites and written informed consent was
obtained from all subjects. For patients less than 18 years
of age, participant assent was obtained with informed
consent of the parent/legal guardian for enrollment in
the study.

**_Procedures and measures_**

Following a diagnosis of concussion at initial clinic visit,
eligible participants completed demographic, medical
history, and injury related information. The Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006), Patient
Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009),
the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-5 Symptom
Evaluation Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (SCAT-5
PCSS; Echemendia et al., 2017), and the BRS (Smith
et al., 2008) were completed by participants. They also
rated the percent to which they felt “back to normal” at
the time of initial evaluation. Three-month follow-up
surveys were completed via e-mail, which included
these same measures. Data entry from each study site
was managed using REDCap (Harris et al., 2019, 2009).

**_Outcome measures_**

The primary outcome measures included self-reported
severity of symptoms as measured by the SCAT-5 PCSS.
Severity for each of the PCSS items was measured on
a 7-point scale that ranged 0 (none) – 6 (severe). The total
number of endorsed symptoms ranged 0–22 and the total
symptom severity ranged 0–122. Exacerbation of PCSS
symptoms by physical or cognitive activity was deter­
mined by a yes or no answer. Levels of self-reported
anxiety and depression post injury were measured by
the GAD-7 (0–28) and PHQ-8 (0–32), respectively.
Recovery at three months was assessed by subjects’ indi­
cation that he/she had returned to play or normal physi­
cal activities and their report of percent back to normal
functioning.

**_Independent variable_**

The BRS is a six-item instrument developed to quantify
the degree of resilience perceived by an individual and
has been shown to be valid and reliable in a variety of
populations (Rodríguez-Rey et al., 2016; Smith et al.,
2008; Windle et al., 2011). Each item on the BRS is
scored on a 1 (low) – 5 (high) Likert scale and the
Total BRS score is the average of the six items. To
provide clinical utility and align with other research
which provided low and high resilience groupings
(Tokish et al., 2017), total BRS scores were classified


-----

into three resilience groups: Low (1.00–2.99), Average
(3.00 to 4.30), and High (4.31–5.00) based on published
guidelines (Smith et al., 2013).

**_Statistical analyses_**

Sample means and standard deviations were used to
describe continuous variables and frequencies (percentage)
were used to characterize categorical variables. Prior to
analysis of PCSS, GAD-7, and PHQ-8 outcome measures,
statistical assumptions were examined, and log base 10
transformations were performed to address issues of
unequal group variances and non-normal distributions
on all measures. Analyses were conducted on the trans­
formed variables and then presented in tables and figures
by back transforming the measures. For age and time to
clinic, t-tests were performed to determine differences
between sexes. ANOVA was conducted to determine dif­
ferences between resilience groups. When the effects for
ANOVA were significant, Bonferroni post hoc pairwise
group comparisons were performed. Pearson’s ChiSquare analyses or Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate,
were used to examine differences in participant categorical
demographics, medical history, and injury characteristics
by sex and resilience groups. Tukey-type post hoc propor­
tions tests for group differences were conducted when ChiSquare was significant (Zar, 1996).

Separate linear mixed models analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) examined resilience groups at two time
points (initial evaluation and three-month follow-up) in
terms of the total number of endorsed PCSS symptoms,
PCSS total symptom severity, GAD-7, PHQ-8, and parti­
cipants’ perception of their recovery (percent back to
normal). Because the literature supports outcome differ­
ences by sex and history of depression in symptom
reporting, both were included as covariates in the model
if _p_ < .15. When an effect was significant for any of the
linear mixed models, Bonferroni post-hoc pairwise com­
parisons were performed. Stepwise multiple regression
analyses were performed last in order to determine the
relationship of resilience with other factors which may
predict symptom recovery. Separate analyses were con­
ducted to examine prediction of the total number of
endorsed PCSS symptoms and PCSS Total Symptom
Severity at three-month follow-up using the following
measures from initial evaluation: number of PCSS symp­
toms or total severity of PCSS symptoms, Total BRS score,
GAD-7 (anxiety at time of initial evaluation), PHQ-8
(depressive symptoms at time of initial evaluation), sex,
history of depression, history of anxiety, and reported
amnesia at time of injury. These predictors were chosen
_a priori_ based on previously published findings (Iverson
et al., 2017; Meehan et al., 2016) or presence of significant


differences in these measures between resilience groups at
initial visit. Pairwise Pearson and point-biserial correla­
tions were performed to examine multicollinearity across
measures. All statistical analyses were carried out using
SAS Software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.J.) and
SPSS V26. The level of significance was set at α = .05 (twotailed) unless otherwise specified.

##### Results

Participant demographic and clinical characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. There were 332 participants
(Male _n_ = 179, 53.9%, Female _n_ = 153, 46.1%), with
a mean age at time of injury of 15.1 years (Median = 15).
Football (28.3%, n = 94), soccer (24.1%, n = 80), basketball
(12.7%, n = 42), volleyball (7.8%, n = 26), wrestling (3.9%,
_n = 13), and cheerleading (3.3%, n = 11) accounted for 80%_
of all injuries. Scores on the BRS were used to divide
participants into three resilience groups: low (n = 41), aver­
age (n = 199), and high (n = 92), with no significant
difference in percentage of males and females between
groups. Participants identified predominantly as White
(78.0%, _n_ = 259) and ethnically as non-Hispanic/Latino
(82.5%, n = 274). There were no significant sex differences
in terms of demographic, medical history, or injury-related
factors. The low resilience group reported a more frequent
history of depression (12.2%) than the average (3.0%) and
high (2.2%) resilience groups (p = .013). At initial visit, all
resilience groups differed significantly (p < .001) in GAD-7
scores. In post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons the low resi­
lience group (6.63 _SD_ = 4.58) was higher than both the
average resilience (3.65 _SD_ = 2.76, _p_ < .001) and high
resilience (1.82 _SD_ = 3.82, _p_ < .001) groups, which were
also significantly different from each other (p = .044). The
resilience groups were also significantly different on the
PHQ-8 at initial visit, with the low resilience group scoring
higher (6.93 _SD_ = 4.45) than either the average (3.96
_SD_ = 4.03) or high resilience groups (2.93 _SD_ = 3.34),
which did not significantly differ from each other
(p = .114).

A summary of the results of the linear mixed models
for PCSS symptoms, GAD-7, PHQ-8, and percent back
to normal are found in Table 2 and Figure 1. The multi­
ple regression analyses predicting number of endorsed
symptoms and symptom severity at three months are
found in Table 3.

**_Covariates_**

Sex was a significant covariate for the number of PCSS
symptoms (p = .092) and PCSS total symptom severity
(p = .027). History of depression was a significant cov­
ariate for GAD-7 (p < .001) and PHQ-8 (p = .035).

**_PCSS symptoms by resilience group_**

For the number of PCSS symptoms endorsed, there
was a significant interaction for BRS group by visit
(p = .048). At the initial clinic visit, all three groups
were similar in number of PCSS symptoms endorsed
(p - .118), but at three-month follow-up, the Low
Resilience Group endorsed significantly more PCSS
symptoms than either the Average (p = .006) or High
Resilience (p < .001) Groups, but the Average and
High Groups were not significantly different
(p = .749).

The main effects for Resilience Group and Visit
were both significant for number of PCSS symptoms
endorsed (p < .001 and _p_ < .001, respectively) and
PCSS Total Symptom Severity (p < .001 and
_p_ < .001, respectively). As expected with recovery,
the number of PCSS Symptoms endorsed and PCSS
Total Symptom Severity at the initial visit for each
group was significantly higher than at the threemonth visit (both _p_ < .001). Pairwise analysis
showed that the groups at initial visit were not
significantly different in terms of the number of
PCSS symptoms endorsed (all _p_ - .118) or PCSS
Total Symptom Severity (all _p_ - 0.064). However, at
the three-month follow-up, the Low Resilience
Group endorsed more PCSS symptoms than either
the Average (p = .006) or High Resilience (p < .001)


Groups. Average and High Resilience Groups did
not differ at three months (p = .749). At three
months the Low Resilience Group also had
a significantly higher PCSS Total Symptom
Severity than both the Average (p < .004) and
High Resilience Groups (p = .002), and the
Average and High Groups were again not signifi­
cantly different (p - .90).

**_Stepwise multiple regression_**

In the examination of the multicollinearity of the mea­
sures, significant Pearson correlations were found
between BRS score and initial visit total number of
endorsed PCSS symptoms (r = −0.174, p = .001), PCSS
Total Symptom Severity (r = −0.205, p < .001), GAD-7
score (r = −0.406, _p_ < .001) and PHQ-8 score
(r = −0.323, _p_ < .001). The point biserial correlation
between BRS score and self-reported history of depres­
sion was significant (r = −0.143, _p_ < .05). None of the
other factors in the regression models were significantly
correlated with BRS or the PCSS measures. Of the mea­
sures from the initial visit included in the stepwise
regression model predicting number of PCSS symptoms
endorsed at follow-up (R[2 ] = 0.103, p < .001), two of the
nine measures were significant in the model: the initial
BRS score (b = −0.119, _p_ < .001) and GAD-7 score

**_Impact of physical and cognitive activity on_**
**_concussion symptoms_**

The summary of return to physical activity, exacerbation
of symptoms, and residual symptoms at three-month
follow-up are found in Table 4. There was no difference
between Resilience Groups in their return to sports/phy­
sical activity at three months (p = .589). However, there
was a higher percentage of subjects in the Low Resilience
Group who reported exacerbation of symptoms with
physical activity (22.0%) vs. Average Resilience (5.0%)
or High Resilience (4.3%) Groups (p = .002). The Low
Resilience Group also reported more frequent symptom
exacerbation with cognitive activity (24.4%) vs. the
Average (7.0%) and High Resilience (3.3%) Groups
(p < .001). Furthermore, the percentage of participants
still reporting as symptomatic at three months in the Low
Resilience Group was significantly higher (33.6%) than in
the Average (17.6%) and High (12.0%) Resilience Groups
(p = .003).

**_Anxiety and depression symptom effects_**

The main effects of Resilience Group and Visit were
significant for both GAD-7 (both _p_ < .001) and PHQ-8
(both _p_ < .001). The main effect of Visit was significant
(p < .001) with the mean GAD-7 score and PHQ-8 score
being significantly higher for all resilience groups at the


initial visit compared to the three-month follow-up. Post
hoc pairwise Resilience Group comparisons of GAD-7
scores resulted in the Low Resilience Group scoring sig­
nificantly higher than either Average (p < .001) or High
Resilience Groups (p < .001) at initial visit. The Average
Resilience Group was scored significantly higher on the
GAD-7 score than High Resilience Group (p = .043). At
three-month follow-up the Low Resilience Group was still
significantly higher than either Average (p = .009) or High
Resilience Groups (p < .001). These two groups however
did not differ at three-month follow-up (p = .271).

For the PHQ-8, post hoc pairwise group comparisons
revealed that the Low Resilience Group scored signifi­
cantly higher on the PHQ-8 than either the Average
(p = .015) or High Resilience Groups (p < .001) and
there was no difference (p = .308) between Average and
High Groups at initial visit. At three-month follow-up
the only significant difference was higher PHQ-8 scores
for Low vs. High Resilience Groups (p = .009).

**_Percent back to normal_**

The main effects of both Resilience Groups and Visit were
significant for percent back to normal ratings (p < .001).
Overall rating of percent back to normal improved with
time (Visit) from initial to follow-up visit. Post hoc pair­
wise comparisons for Resilience Groups at initial visit
showed the percent back to normal for the Low


-----

Resilience Group to be significantly lower than only the
High Resilience Group (p < .001), with no significant
difference between the Average and High Resilience
Groups (p - .9). At three months, the Low Resilience
Group indicated a significantly lower percent back to
normal than both the Average (p = .028) and High
Resilience Groups (p = .007), which were similar in their
recovery ratings.

##### Discussion

Our investigation focused on SRC among subjects aged
13–25, a prime age for sports participation in the United
States (Woods, 2017). Previous research has shown only
limited differences in concussion symptomatology and
recovery across this age group of adolescent and young
adult athletes, particularly when evaluated within
21 days of injury (Howell et al., 2019; Kara et al., 2020;
Nelson et al., 2016). In this large sample of adolescent
and young adults who sustained a SRC, level of resili­
ence appeared to be associated with the number and
severity of concussion symptoms reported during
recovery. At time of initial evaluation, resilience was
not associated with number or severity of PCS endorsed
but was associated with a greater number and increased
severity at three months post injury. Specifically, indi­
viduals considered to have low resilience reported both
a greater number of symptoms and a higher severity of
symptoms than those with average or high resilience at
three months post injury. Higher resilience levels did
not appear to be associated with a benefit above the
average levels of resilience, possibly reflecting a ceiling
effect of the BRS. This has been seen in older popula­
tions of emergency room mTBI patients where subjects
considered to have medium-high resilience levels
reported a lower level of post-concussive symptoms
compared to those considered to have low resilience
(Losoi et al., 2015). In contrast, it has been proposed
that high resilience levels actually may be associated
with greater post injury anxiety and concussion symp­
toms immediately following injury before any potential
benefit may emerge (McCauley et al., 2013). However,
our findings did not support such a notion, as higher
levels of resilience did not appear to relate to greater
symptoms within ten days post-injury or at three
months. Rather, our results indicate that low resilience
levels (linear mixed models and regression models) may
be associated with greater symptom reporting during
recovery and a longer perceived recovery from SRC.

Given the number of psychological factors which
have been identified as being associated with concussion
symptomology (Broshek et al., 2015; Iverson et al.,
2017), it is important to determine if resilience as


defined in our study is an independent contributing
factor to SRC recovery. Anxiety and depressive symp­
toms may mediate its role, but previous research has
posited resilience as a discrete factor in concussion
recovery (Durish et al., 2019; Sullivan et al., 2015).
Outside of concussion research it has been shown that
adolescents with higher resilience show lower levels of
anxiety and depression symptoms (Haddadi & Besharat,
2010; Hjemdal et al., 2007). It is also possible that
negative response bias may influence the role resilience
might play in SRC recovery. This risk appears low given
that in our study, there was no significant correlation
between self-reported resilience levels with prior history
of anxiety, and the significant correlation with prior
history of depression was low (r = −0.143). The moder­
ate correlations between resilience and post-injury anxi­
ety (GAD-7), (r = −0.406) and depression (PHQ-8),
(r = −323) scores may pose limitations on our findings
and merit further exploration. However, even with these
correlations, only post-injury anxiety was a predictor for
the number of endorsed PCSS symptoms at three
months. The lack of inclusion of these emotional factors
in both of the regression models may point to a complex
relationship between these factors. As measured, levels
of resilience had the strongest relationship with PCSS
symptoms, even after accounting for psychological fac­
tors in the models, providing some support that resili­
ence appears to be distinct from other psychological
factors.

The relationship between resilience and levels of
post-injury anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-8)
was further examined in separate ANCOVAs. At initial
evaluation, the relationship between resilience group
and level of anxiety was linear, with lower resilience
associated with greater anxiety. However, at follow up,
the Low Resilience Group still expressed greater anxiety
than either High or Average Resilience Groups. In
regard to depressive symptoms, at initial evaluation,
the Low Resilience Group endorsed higher level of
depressive symptoms that still remained higher than
the other resilience groups at follow up. It is important
to note that although some participants may have
reported elevated symptoms of anxiety as measured by
the GAD-7, mean raw scores for all three groups were
generally low and did not meet established cutoff scores
(7–10) for generalized anxiety disorder at either initial
evaluation or three-month follow-up (Plummer et al.,
2016). Likewise, none of the mean PHQ-8 scores across
resilience groups met the suggested cutoff score of ≥ 10
for clinically significant depression (Kroenke et al.,
2009). Also, as expected with recovery from concussion,
all groups significantly improved in both anxiety and
depressive symptoms at follow-up compared to initial


-----

visit. Although perhaps not significant in a clinical sense
(in view of mean scores not meeting standard cutoff
values), the slightly elevated initial scores for anxiety
and depression in subjects with low resilience are con­
cerning. Anxiety and depression have been shown to
have an additive effect on endorsed concussion symp­
toms (Ponsford et al., 2012; R. T. Lange et al., 2011;
Yang et al., 2015). As such, if low resilience is associated
with self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression,
it should be considered a factor in evaluating emotional
PCSS symptoms in clinical interviews at initial evalua­
tion and during recovery (Collins et al., 2014).

Level of resilience was associated with participants’
perceived functionality and being back to normal at
initial evaluation and at three months. Participants in
the Low Resilience Group reported that they were func­
tioning at a lower level in terms of percent back to
normal than the other groups at both time points. As
with the PCSS, there may also be a resilience “ceiling”
effect as high resilience did not provide a benefit in
function over that of average resilience. Subjects were
also asked whether or not they had returned to play/
physical activity at the three-month follow-up, and the
percentage of participants who had returned to activity
was the same across resilience groups regardless of
symptoms. Progressive steps of asymptomatic physical
activity are a standard for return to play/physical activ­
ity protocol (McCrory et al., 2017), although in concus­
sion recovery, being “asymptomatic” may not mean
a complete absence of concussion symptoms, as healthy
non-concussed individuals often report some symptoms
at baseline (Asken et al., 2017). Even if participants in
our study indicated they had returned to play/physical
activity, 47% reported at least one PCSS symptom pre­
sent at three-month follow-up. When applying
a standard of “asymptomatic” as measured by symptom
severity (male ≤ 5, female ≤ 6) (Alla et al., 2012), a larger
percentage of the Low Resilience Group (36.6%) were
still symptomatic than the Average (17.6%) or High
(12.0%) Resilience Groups (p = .003) at three months.
This would be consistent with subject reports regarding
their perceived “percent back to normal” at three
months, regardless of return to sport/physical activity,
as the low resilience group reported a smaller percen­
tage of return to normal function than the other two
groups. This group also reported a greater exacerbation
of symptoms with physical and cognitive activity com­
pared to the other groups. Symptom “spikes” can occur
in this age group after increased mental activity such as
return to school and extracurricular activities
(Silverberg et al., 2016). Physical and cognitive activity
are beneficial to recovery from SRC but only when kept
below the threshold that increases symptoms (McCrory


et al., 2017; Schneider et al., 2017). It is possible that low
resilience may relate to individuals being more sensitive
to symptom spikes even if recovered and may also factor
into perception of lower functionality. Further research
in this area will be important to delineate such
a relationship.

Our results suggest that the assessment of resilience
may lend an important contribution to the evaluation
and management of SRC recovery. Symptom checklists
such as the PCSS are important tools which are part of
the current Berlin consensus protocols for initial evalua­
tion of SRC and tracking recovery (McCrory et al.,
2017), and the BRS, or other measure of resilience,
might be a worthwhile adjunct to these checklists. In
management of recovery from SRC, comprehensive and
targeted approaches have become a standard for reha­
bilitation strategies (Collins et al., 2014). Widening
these strategies to include a specific focus on resilience
may prove beneficial to overall recovery (Neils-Strunjas
et al., 2017). Residual concussion symptoms and symp­
tom spikes may impede functionality even after release
to return to school and work (Silverberg et al., 2016,
2018); quality of recovery and functionality at school
and work may be improved by interventions targeting
resilience.

As with many concussion studies using self-report
measures, our results are subject to a possible “good
old days” bias in reporting of concussion symptoms
(Lange et al., 2010). Care must also be taken in general­
izing results to other populations, as this study focused
on SRC and not concussions resulting from other
mechanisms or initially evaluated greater than
10 days post injury. Participants were also predomi­
nantly Caucasian, which may limit generalizability to
other sociodemographic populations. Another limita­
tion of the study is the lack of a pre-injury “baseline” of
resilience, as the BRS was only obtained at time of
initial post injury assessment.

##### Conclusion

The objective of this investigation was to examine the
relationship between resilience and concussion symp­
toms, anxiety, depression, and perceived return to nor­
mal during recovery from SRC in adolescents and young
adults. Low level of resilience was associated with greater
concussion symptoms and higher self-reported symp­
toms of anxiety and depression immediately post injury
and during recovery. Low resilience also appeared to be
associated with longer reported return to normal follow­
ing SRC even after controlling for sex and prior history
of depression. A patient’s resilience, defined as the ability
to “bounce back” or recover (Smith et al., 2008)


-----

following SRC may be an important and potentially
modifiable factor which may positively impact recovery.
