Abstract

Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare adolescent students with and without concussion on a battery of
academic, neurocognitive, and socioemotional measures and assess the aftereffects of concussion across domains of
functioning. Methods: Twenty-four adolescents (ages 13–17) reporting postconcussion symptoms were compared to
24 controls matched for age and gender across a battery of tests and surveys. Results: After correcting for multiple
comparisons, there were no significant differences on any neuropsychological measures. Similarly, there were no
significant group differences on academic measures of vocabulary, word recognition, or reading comprehension.
Self-reported concussion symptoms were much greater for students with concussion, as were self-reports of anxiety,
depression, and somatization symptoms. Parents also rated those with concussion as having greater depression and
somatization symptoms, but not to a degree that survived Bonferroni correction. Lastly, those with concussion reported
a significantly greater number of school problems and academic concerns. Conclusions: Results indicated that
adolescents who reported postconcussion symptoms do not perform differently from peers on most neurocognitive and
academic tasks, yet they showed considerably more worry, somatization, academic concerns, and feelings of inadequacy
than matched controls. The findings suggest that interventions to address psychological and academic stress may be
indicated for adolescents symptomatic from concussion.

duration of concussion symptoms and academic problems
(Baker, 2016; Field, Collins, Lovell, & Maroon, 2003;
Ransom et al., 2015). Adolescents may be especially prone
to school problems, as they take longer on average to recover
from concussion than other age groups (Lax et al., 2015),
and they usually have greater academic and extracurricular
demands than younger children. Numerous authors have
outlined suggestions for concussion-related academic accommodations (Halstead et al., 2013; Newlin & Hooper, 2015),
and a graduated return-to-school strategy was created for the
most recent consensus statement on concussion in sport
(McCrory et al., 2017).
Concussion can cause at least temporary impairments in
memory, processing speed, and other cognitive domains,
and neurocognitive assessment is now an integral component
of proper concussion management (Gioia, 2015). In most
cases, concussion-related cognitive impairments will resolve
in a matter of days or weeks (McCrea et al., 2009), and multiple group studies of pediatric concussion have shown no
differences between injured and control subjects by 3 months
(Babikian et al., 2011; Kirkwood et al., 2008). Also, longterm academic problems are not expected after pediatric
concussion (Light et al., 1998), with neither grades nor graduation rates affected (Russell et al., 2016).
A number of researchers have identified prolonged, yet
subtle, neurocognitive effectsinadolescents, including changes
in executive functioning (Howell, Osternig, Van Donkelaar,
Mayr, & Chou, 2013) and in verbal learning during divided
attention (Blanchet, Paradis-Giroux, Pépin, & McKerral,
2009). More common, however, is the persistence of selfreported postconcussion symptoms. In a sample of subjects
age 11–22 presenting to an emergency department after
concussion, over 20% still complained of symptoms at 1 month
including headache, fatigue, and taking longer to think
(Eisenberg, Meehan, & Mannix, 2014). In a more recent study
of pediatric patients who were initially seen in an emergency
department, Barlow et al. (2015) reported that nearly 12%
of children were still symptomatic at 3 months postinjury.
Other estimates of prolonged recovery vary widely, from less
than 5% to more than 38% of children still experiencing symptoms at 3 months (Rose, Fischer, & Heyer, 2015).
Interestingly, students and their parents tend to base their
perceptions of recovery mostly on the presence or absence of
concussion symptoms (Sandel, Henry, French, & Lovell,
2015). This can be problematic since concussion symptoms
are subjective, nonspecific to concussion, and common in
healthy youth. When symptoms do persist, factors other than
the concussion itself appear to play an increasing role over
time. For example, youth with a preinjury psychiatric history
are more likely to experience prolonged symptoms (Corwin
et al., 2014; Iverson et al., 2017), as are those with a preexisting learning or attention disorder (Barlow et al., 2015).
Baseline levels of somatization are strongly predictive of
postinjury symptom reports (Nelson et al., 2016), and athletes
with concussion may not cope as well after injury compared
to those with other types of injuries (Kontos et al., 2013).
Increased symptoms of depression have been found in high


school and collegiate athletes with concussion up to 14 days
postinjury with associated neurocognitive decrements
(Kontos, Covassin, Elbin, & Parker, 2012), and postinjury
changes in mood and activity level can serve to maintain symptoms (Reed, Taha, Monette, & Keightley, 2016). In a comprehensive review of the literature on psychological factors and
persistent postconcussion symptoms, Broshek, De Marco,
and Freeman (2015) reported that the neurobiological effects
of concussion can cause anxiety and depression symptoms,
and that psychosocial factors such as preinjury anxiety or misattribution of symptoms may contribute to prolonged recovery.
Plourde, Yeates, and Brooks (2018) did not find long-term
(32 months postinjury) problems in the psychosocial funcþ
tioning of children and adolescents who sustained one or
multiple concussions, but did note that preexisting mood and
attention problems seemed to predict psychosocial adjustment.
Management of adolescent students recovering from
concussion can be complicated by the direct effects of concussion, the academic expectations that continue despite
injury, and the multiple intersecting factors that can contribute to reported symptoms. A better understanding of these
variables can hopefully inform the development of more
effective interventions. The purpose of this study was to compare adolescent students with persistent concussion symptoms to intact peers on measures of concussion symptoms,
neurocognitive functioning, academic achievement, socioemotional status, and academic concerns. Because over 15%
of children who undergo neuropsychological evaluation after
concussion will meet criteria for invalid performance
(Kirkwood & Kirk, 2010), a validity measure was included
in the assessment battery. Finally, in an effort to better quantify the academic stress that can be experienced by students
recovering from concussion, we piloted a new self-report
measure, the School Academic Issues Device (SAID),
alongside a more commonly used self-report checklist, the
Behavior Assessment System of Children, Second Edition
(BASC-2). Since we planned to recruit participants from a
specialized concussion clinic where most patients are at least
a couple of weeks postinjury, we expected that the group of
students with concussion would endorse more concussion
symptoms, socioemotional symptoms, and academic/school
concerns than peers, yet perform comparably to peers on
neuropsychological and academic performance tests.

## METHOD

 Participants

After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, participants with and without concussion between 13 and 17 years
of age were recruited for this study. Participants who met
American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria for
mTBI (American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine,
1993) and who were currently experiencing concussion
symptoms were recruited at a hospital-based concussion clinic.
Those with a history of other neurologic disease and learning
or attention disorder were excluded. Control participants were


-----

recruited from the community via flyers and professional
contacts. We enrolled 60 participants in the study. Three participants with concussion (and their matched controls) were
removed from the analysis because they did not achieve a score
of > 85% on the immediate recognition (IR), delayed recognition (DR), and consistency (CON) on the Medical Symptom
Validity Test (MSVT; Green, 2004). One Concussion and
one Control participants did not complete the full test battery
due to technical challenges and subsequently were removed
from analyses. Finally, two Concussion participants were outliers in terms of days postinjury (> 1 year) and were removed
along with their matched controls.
Demographic information is listed in Table 1. In total, 24
matched (on gender and within 1 year) pairs (22 males, 26
females) were retained. The average age was equivalent in
the control (M = 14.89, SD = 1.31) and Concussion groups
(M = 14.88, SD = 1.26), with a range of 13:2–17:9 years.
The majority of participants identified as Caucasian in both
groups (n = 22, 91.6%). The majority of participants reported
no previous psychological diagnoses, but one Control and
one Concussion participants reported a prior history of anxiety. Both groups were also statistically similar for maternal or
paternal education levels.
For Concussion participants, the number of days postinjury
ranged from 13 to144 days, with an average of 61.96 days
(SD = 38.14) and median number of 48.50 days. Fourteen
participants (58.3%) reported no previous concussions,
while 10 (41.7%) reported this was their second concussion.

Unfortunately, we did not retain information about neuroimaging or specific injury characteristics. Of those who gave us
anecdotal reports, 75% reported their injury as sports-related
and 25% reported some loss of consciousness.

## Measures

 Immediate Postconcussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing

The Immediate Postconcussion Assessment and Cognitive
Testing (ImPACT) is a brief, computerized neuropsychological assessment designed to measure concussion symptoms and
specific cognitive processes commonly disrupted by concussion (Lovell, 2002). Six individual subtests (Word Memory,
Design Memory, X’s and O’s, Symbol Matching, Color
Matching, and Three Letters) contribute to five composite
scores (Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, Visual Motor
Speed, Reaction Time, and Impulse Control). Higher scores
across the Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, and Visual
Motor Speed composites indicate stronger performance, while
lower scores on the Impulse Control and Reaction Time composites indicate better performance. In addition to cognitive
testing, the ImPACT asks individuals to rate the severity of
22 concussion symptoms on a 7-point response scale (0 = not
experiencing, 6 = severe),which yields a Total Symptom score
ranging from 0 to 132.
With some exceptions (Broglio, Ferrara, Macciocchi,
Baumgartner, & Elliott, 2007), the ImPACT demonstrates
adequate psychometric properties. Iverson et al. (2003) found
test–retest reliabilities for the composite scores ranging from
.67 to .86. The ImPACT has also been shown to be both
sensitive (81.9%) and specific (89.4%) to the presence of
concussion when the Symptom score and four composite
scores were combined (Schatz & Putz, 2006). The ImPACT
demonstrates good convergent validity, but a recent review
questioned the measure’s discriminant and predictive validity
(Alsalaheen, Stockdale, Pechumer, & Broglio, 2016).

## Symbol Digit Modalities Test

The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) was included as a
measure of processing speed (Smith, 1973). Subjects have 90 s
to copy symbols into the blank spaces provided under a series
of numbers using a key. The SDMT Total score is the number
of correct items completed. The SDMT has been shown to be
sensitive to the immediate effects of concussion (Collins et al.,
1999) and accurately discriminates between individuals with
head injury and healthy controls (Barr, 2001). The SDMT also
shows strong correlation to other measures of attention, concentration, and processing speed (Barr, 2001).

## Trail Making Test

The Trail Making Test (TMT) is commonly used to measure
psychomotor speed and executive functioning (Reitan &
Wolfson, 1985). Part A requires participants to connect a


-----

series of circled numbers that are randomly placed on a page,
and Part B asks them to connect numbers and letters in alternating sequence. The subject’s score is the time to finish each
part (TMT completion time), including time for error correction. Reliability estimates (i.e., inter-rater, test–retest) for
Parts A and B are generally high (r = .80 - .95), and there
is adequate convergent and ecological validity (Strauss,
Sherman, & Spreen, 2006).

## The Medical Symptom Validity Test

The MSVT (Green, 2004) is designed to detect suboptimal
performance during neuropsychological evaluations and was
administered orally for this study. The test presents pairs of
related words, after which participants are asked to recall the
words. Scores from three MSVT indexes (IR, DR, & CON)
were used to create a dichotomous Pass/Fail variable (i.e.,
Effort) using the suggested cut score of 85%; one score below
85% equated to a Fail, while a Pass required all scores at 85%
and above. Green (2004) presents evidence of concurrent and
predictive validity, but does not provide reliability estimates
for the MSVT.

## TestTracker

TestTracker is a computerized reading assessment system that
guides students through a variety of academic tasks and questionnaires (Lewandowski, Gathje, Lovett, & Gordon, 2013;
Lewandowski, Hendricks, & Gordon, 2015). The study used
the comprehension, vocabulary, and word recognition tasks.
Reliability estimates for these tasks are adequate (internal consistency .85 to .90; retest .65 to .80). Additional information on
psychometric properties is detailed in a recent published study
(Lewandowski, Lovett, Berger, & Gordon, 2016).

## Reading comprehension

The reading comprehension task consisted of 10 passages, each
between 300 and 400 words and followed by 5 multiple-choice
questions that target both factual and inferential information.
Readability estimates for the passages ranged from 9th to
15th grade level, using the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level estimate. The Reading Comprehension score was the total number
of questions answered correctly within a 20-min period. The
results of an earlier validity investigation found that the percent
correct of TestTracker reading comprehension questions correlated at r = .51 with percent correct of comprehension questions on the Nelson Denny Reading Test (NDRT).

## Vocabulary

The vocabulary task requires an individual to identify a synonym for a target word from a list of five options in a 4-min
period. The 80 vocabulary words were selected from graded
word lists (8th–16th grade). The Vocabulary Correct score
correlated (r = .64) with the vocabulary score from the
NDRT, suggesting adequate construct validity.


## Word recognition

This task assesses a student’s fluency of word/nonword recognition by asking individuals to decide if a three-to-six-letter
string was a real English word. Sixty words were selected from
graded word lists (8th–16th grade) and 60 nonwords were generated resemble real words (e.g., “aisle” vs. “niehl”). Students
had 90 s to answer progressively more challenging items. The
Word Recognition score was total number of correct items.
This task is moderately correlated with the untimed Word
Attack subtest of the Woodcock Johnson III, r = .47.

## Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition

The BASC-2 (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004) is a rating
scale that evaluates the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions of
children and adolescents aged 2.5–25 years. This study utilized
the composites and subscales from the parent and self-report
forms. The BASC-2 Parent Rating Scale (PRS) includes
Externalizing Problems composite (Hyperactivity,
Aggression, and Conduct Problems subscales), Internalizing
Problems composite (Anxiety, Depression, and Somatization
subscales), Behavioral Symptoms Index composite
(Atypicality, Withdrawal, and Attention Problems subscales),
and Adaptive Skills composite (Adaptability, Social Skills,
Leadership, Activities of Daily Living, and Functional
Communication subscales). The BASC-2 Self-Report (SRP)
includes composite scores for School Problems (Attitude
Towards Teachers, Attitude Towards School, and Sensation
Seeking subscales), Internalizing Problems (Atypicality,
Locus of Control, Social Stress, Anxiety, Depression, Sense
of Inadequacy, and Somatization subscales), Inattention/
Hyperactivity (Attention Problems and Hyperactivity subscales), Personal Adjustment (Relations with Parents,
Interpersonal Relations, Self-Reliance, and Self-Esteem
subscales), and the Emotional Symptoms Index composite
(Anxiety, Social Stress, Depression, Sense of Inadequacy,
Self-Reliance, and Self-Esteem subscales). Descriptive classifications include: T score ≥ 60 = Borderline risk and a T score
≥ 70 = Clinically Significant risk.
The BASC-2 manual reports generally strong reliability and
validity estimates. The manual indicates good internal consistency for the PRS (α = .73 to .95) and for the SRP (α = .76 to
.95). It also demonstrates strong convergent and concurrent
validity with other behavioral scales (i.e., ASEBA Child
Behavior Checklist). See the BASC-2 manual for more
psychometric information (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004).

## School Academic Issues Device

The SAID is a pilot self-report measure aimed at capturing
students’ perceptions of their current academic concerns
(e.g., I learn things in school then cannot remember them
at home, I don’t have enough time to finish tests/quizzes).
There are 26 Likert scale items ranging from 1 (not true) to
7 (very true). The dependent measure for this study was


-----

the sum of the 26 responses (Total score range = 26–182).
Higher scores indicate greater academic concerns. The
SAID demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .95) for
the total sample.

## Procedure

Testing was conducted in private rooms located in a medical
building. After informed consent was obtained, the participant and parent completed the demographic survey and
BASC-2 rating scales. The parent returned to the waiting
room after completing the BASC-2 PRS. Next, the participant
completed a 20-min EEG task located in a different room
(not reported in this study). After the EEG task, participants
returned to the initial testing room to complete MSVT,
SDMT, TMT Parts A and B, SAID, ImPACT, and
TestTracker. The logistics and delayed tasks precluded true
counterbalancing of all measures; however, efforts were made
to randomize the administration of TestTracker and ImPACT
when possible.

## RESULTS

Before conducting between-group comparisons, the data
were analyzed for skewness and kurtosis within each group.
Kurtosis was not present (< 2.0) when the variables were
analyzed within each group separately; therefore, data transformations were not warranted. Age, gender, and preexisting
history of anxiety were investigated as potential covariates.
Age was a significant covariate on ImPACT Visual Motor
Speed composite, and gender was a significant covariate on
ImPACT Verbal Memory composite, TMT-B Completion
Time, SDMT Total score, BASC-2 PRS Adaptive Skills
composite, and BASC-2 SRP School Problems composite.
Analyses reflected that prior history of anxiety (self-reported
by one Concussion and one Control participants) was not a
significant covariate for any of the outcome measures.
Independent samples’ t tests were conducted on the remaining dependent measures without age or gender covariates.
Bonferonni corrections were applied to each family of tests
(e.g., ImPACT, BASC-2 PRS), which ranged from α = .01
to α = .017. For consistency, we used a conservative α level
of .01 for all comparisons.

## Concussion Symptoms

Students with concussion reported significantly more concussion symptoms (ImPACT Total Symptom score) than
controls (see Table 2). The mean number of symptoms for
the Concussion group was 45.67 (SD = 23.1) versus 3.38
(SD = 6.4) for the control group. These scores differed
significantly (p < .01, d = 2.49) as expected, and the
Concussion group was highly symptomatic compared to reference norms (Lovell et al., 2006). Within the Concussion group,
the highest scores on the 7-point (0–6) scale were reported for
Difficulty Concentrating (4.0), Headache (3.8), Fatigue (3.3),


and Irritability (3.15). Those with concussion also reported
sleeping either more than usual (1.85) or less than usual (1.56).

## Neurocognitive Measures

Mean ImPACT composites scores are presented in Table 2.
All ANCOVAs failed to meet alpha levels with Bonferroni
corrections. Across the t tests of the four composite scores
(Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, Visual Motor Speed, and
Reaction Time), only the Visual Memory composite came
close to reaching a significant group difference, t (42) = 2.13,
p = .04, d = 0.64, but fell short of our adjusted .01 α level. For
exploratory purposes, we further examined this composite
by conducting independent samples t tests on the Design
Memory and Xs and Os subtests separately. Results indicated
that the Xs and Os Total Correct Memory score showed the
largest group difference, t (42) = 1.38, p = .174, d = 0.42,
yet this difference was not statistically significant. It should
be noted that all ImPACT scores for both groups were within
normal limits according to ImPACT normative ranges
(Henry & Sandel, 2015). Scores for the TMT Parts A and B
Completion Time and the SDMT Total are also presented in
Table 2. Scores were not significantly different between
groups nor outside normal levels. Overall, there were no significant group differences on any of the neuropsychological
measures, and all scores were within the average range based
on test norms.

## Academic Achievement

No significant group differences were found on the
TestTracker academic measures (see Table 2). Only the
Vocabulary score approached significance, t (46) = 2.12,
p = .03, d = 0.61 (control M = 20.13, SD = 6.5; concussion
M = 16.21, SD = 6.3). The control group correctly answered
almost four more vocabulary terms than the Concussion
group. However, all mean scores from both groups were
comparable to age-based TestTracker norms, suggesting no
impairment in academic performance.

## Socioemotional Perceptions (BASC-2)

For convenience sake, only BASC-2 t tests with significant
results are presented in Table 3. While some parent report
measures met traditional alpha level (α = .05), no t tests on
the BASC-2 PRS met the conservative alpha level (α = .01).
On the other hand, significant findings were obtained on the
student self-report measures. On the BASC-2 SRP composites, the Concussion group was found to have significantly
higher T scores on the Inattention/Hyperactivity composite
(p = .003, d = 0.97), the Internalizing Symptoms composite
(p = .001, d = 1.10), and the Emotional Symptoms Index
(p = .01, d = 0.97) compared to Control participants.
Across all the BASC-2 subscales, results revealed that the
Concussion group had significantly higher T scores on
Attention Problems subscale (p < .001, d = 1.34), Sense of

Inadequacy subscale (p < .001, d = 1.18), and Somatization
subscale (p < .001, d = 1.61). The Anxiety (p = .011,
d = 0.79) and Depression subscales (p = .032, d = 0.66)
met traditional alpha values, but failed to approach significance with Bonferroni corrections. Though Concussion
participants reported significantly more socioemotional problems than controls, the Concussion group’s BASC-2 T scores
remained below the threshold for clinical significance
(T score ≤ 60 = Borderline risk), and thus were still within
the “normal” range relative to a normative peer group.

## School Concerns

The t tests for the SAID Total score revealed a significant
group difference, t (46) = 6.83, p < .001, d = 2.06, showing
that the concussion students endorsed many more school concerns than their peers (see Table 2). A trend in their responses
suggested worries about academic competence and efficiency


(e.g., I have to reread to understand; I worry about falling
behind). The youth in the Concussion group were not particularly worried about having the support or resources they need
to do their work, as judged by items that were seldom
endorsed (e.g., teachers don’t like me; I don’t have enough
time to finish my work). The Concussion participants seemed
to have perceptions of inadequacy and self-doubt with regard
to academic work.

## DISCUSSION

Students in this study who were tested an average of 62 days
after concussion reported very elevated levels of concussion
symptoms. They also reported significantly more academic
and emotional distress than a group of uninjured matched
(age and gender) controls. As expected given the time postinjury, students with concussion tended to perform almost identically to their uninjured peers on ImPACT neurocognitive


-----

tasks, neuropsychological screening measures, and time-sensitive academic achievement measures. Relative to Control
participants, Concussion participants endorsed elevated levels
of school problems, inattention, depression, anxiety, and somatization on the BASC-2, but these scores did not reach the
threshold for clinical significance (T score > 60). Similarly,
when compared to test norms, the Concussion group scores
were not outside the average range on any academic or neurocognitive measure. Overall, students in this study who report
persistent concussion symptoms perceive themselves as struggling academically, cognitively, and emotionally, despite
performing comparably to uninjured peers.
Our finding of subtle if any group differences on objective
measures is consistent with prior research showing that, in
youth, neurocognitive performance tends to normalize by 3
months postconcussion (Kirkwood et al., 2008). Research
into academic problems after concussion also shows no longterm negative effects (Light et al., 1998; Russell et al., 2016).
Yet despite these null findings, students with concussion
often express persistent academic concerns, including learning problems, worrying about school, and seeking school
resources and accommodations (Covassin, Elbin, Crutcher,
Burkhart, & Kontos, 2013; Ransom et al., 2015; Wasserman
et al., 2016). In this study, a very large (d = 2.26) group difference was found on a new measure of academic concerns, with
the Concussion participants scoring twice as high as the uninjured controls and endorsing greater concern about keeping
up with schoolwork.
Interestingly, although performance on objective neuropsychological and academic measures was similar between
the two groups, those with concussion did score somewhat
lower on a visual memory task. The strength of this finding
did not survive Bonferroni correction for significance level,
but aligned with results of a prospective study (Rieger et al.,
2013) that found a group of youth with concussion performing significantly worse on the ImPACT X’s and O’s subtest at
3-month follow-up compared to youth with orthopedic injuries. Adolescents with concussion in the current study were
tested an average of about 2 months postinjury and again
scored lower on the ImPACT Visual Memory composite, with
the largest subtest difference being on the X’s and O’s Total
Correct Memory score. Ponsford et al. (2011) reported the
same finding of lower ImPACT Visual Memory scores 3
months postinjury in a prospective controlled study of adults
with concussion recruited from an Emergency Department.
Thus while the present Concussion group’s score still fell with
average range based upon ImPACT norms, this repeated finding of lower performance than a control group across multiple
studies is consistent with mounting evidence that physiologic
recovery of the brain after concussion may take longer than
previously thought and can lag behind the resolution of symptoms (McCrory et al., 2017).
The lack of robust neuropsychological deficits in our
concussion sample is mirrored in our findings on speeded
academic performance measures. Only one of the three measures showed a group difference that approached significance, suggesting less fluency in correct identification of


vocabulary terms. Whether or not this finding is mediated
by some uncontrolled variable (e.g., IQ) is uncertain, but warrants further investigation.
The main finding in this study is that students who report
persistent postconcussion symptoms an average of 2 months
after injury also report higher levels of academic and emotional distress than their uninjured classmates. Elevations
on the BASC-2 are highest for internalizing symptoms such
as anxiety, depression, somatization, sense of inadequacy,
and inattention, while responses on the SAID reflect considerable worry about academic competence and keeping up
with schoolwork. It should be noted that although a number
of group differences were found on the BASC-2, the
Concussion group mean scores were still within the average
range on every scale. Yet relative to peers, students with concussion in this study seemed to feel that something is still
wrong with them. The finding of increased worry and distress
is quite similar to that of Mrazik et al. (2016) who reported
that youth hockey players with concussion had higher
BASC-2 scores than peers on scales of atypicality, locus of
control, anxiety, depression, sense of inadequacy, somatization, and attention. Whether these feelings are grounded in
subtle changes in brain functioning or in perceptions that
emerge from weeks of feeling abnormal – or both – is uncertain. Broshek et al. (2015) suggest that, just like in animal
models, concussion in humans can result in anxiety, fear,
and even depression, especially in those with a neurobiological vulnerability. Our findings and those of other researchers
suggest that individuals with concussion are prone to internalized psychological concerns, at least while they are symptomatic. A recent study by Plourde, Yeates, and Brooks (2018)
did not find group differences on psychosocial measures at
approximately 36 months after injury (vs. 2 months postinjury in this study), so it appears that academic and emotional
concerns after concussion do subside over time.
Finally, difficulty in concentrating was the symptom most
strongly endorsed by the Concussion group, followed by
headache, fatigue, and irritability. Concussion participants
were also more likely to report sleeping more or less than
usual. Unsurprisingly, pain and sleep problems can magnify
the subjective cognitive and emotional complaints reported
by adolescents after concussion and can contribute to poorer
outcome (Lavigne et al., 2015).
There are some limitations in the current study that require
consideration. This study had a small sample size, and subtle
differences may not have been detectable. It is also possible
that the academic and cognitive measures we used were insensitive to the problems reported by Concussion participants. The
generalizability of our findings is limited by recruitment from
one hospital within a narrow geographic locale, the fact that
participants were mostly Caucasian students from educated
parents, and a lack of information about injury characteristics
(e.g., loss of consciousness). We did not include an orthopedic
injury control group, which would have allowed us to better
account for any differences generally related to injury and
trauma (vs. concussion specifically), and we also did not look
at preinjury factors such as prior academic problems. We also


-----

realize that one of our strongest findings resulted from a pilot
measure that, although promising, must be subjected to further
psychometric validation.
Despite some limitations, results on the BASC-2 SRP and
SAID yielded rather robust differences in how students with
and without concussion perceived their emotional and academic well-being. Although scores for the Concussion group
were not in the clinical range for the most part, it appeared that
some of our Concussion participants would benefit from
interventions aimed at both academic and emotional concerns.
Multiple authors have proposed academic accommodations
and return-to-learn strategies that can mitigate academic stress
and increase the chances of a successful school reentry following concussion (e.g., Gioia, 2016; Halstead et al., 2013). New
CDC guidelines for pediatric mTBI (Lumba- Brown et al.,
2018) highlight the importance of tailoring academic interventions to the unique needs of each student. Our results also indicate that monitoring academic stress may be as important as
monitoring academic performance.
Our results are consistent with other research (Broshek
et al., 2015) showing increased levels of depression, anxiety,
and somatization in youth recovering from concussion.
Students who are experiencing high levels of emotional distress may benefit from counseling to learn coping skills
(Brent & Max, 2017) and to address possible misattribution
of physical symptoms and other cognitive biases (Broshek
et al., 2015). Also, while rest is commonly prescribed after
concussion to reduce symptoms (McCrory et al., 2017), there
is increasing recognition that a prolonged period of inactivity
may be counter-productive. Rather, it may be beneficial for
students to resume normal activities including exercise
and school/social activities, which can decrease stressand foster
symptom recovery (Gagnon, Galli, Friedman, Grilli, & Iverson,
2009; Gioia, 2015). It appears that our findings support an
emerging focus on health-related quality of life for youth with
mTBI (Fineblit, Selci, Loewen, Ellis, & Russell, 2016) and
recognize the importance of physical, mental, social, and emotional outcomes that need to be addressed and monitored.
