ABSTRACT
Elderly patients are at increased risk for persistent complaints after mild traumatic brain injury
(MTBI). This study aimed to investigate the role of post-concussive symptoms, mood, post-traumatic stress, and coping on functional outcome in elderly with MTBI. Information on mood,
post-concussive symptoms, post-traumatic stress, and coping was collected 2 weeks post-injury.
Six months post-injury functional outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale
Extended. One hundred and sixty-two patients aged � 60 years were included, 55% male, mean
age ¼ 71 (±6.2) years. The most frequent cause of injury was falls from standing height (75%).
Two weeks post-injury anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress were present in 15%, 12%,
and 38% of patients, respectively, with 73% reporting post-concussive symptoms. Avoidant coping was the most frequently used coping style. Six months post-injury, 44% showed incomplete
recovery. Higher depression scores (OR ¼ 0.87, p ¼ 0.005) and number of post-concussive symptoms (OR ¼ 0.91, p ¼ 0.03) were associated with incomplete recovery. Half of the elderly showed
incomplete recovery 6 months after MTBI, with early depression or post-concussive symptoms as
important factors. Coping style was not related to outcome. These results underline the need
for a different approach in elderly patients, focusing on other predicting factors and fall prevention strategies.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), with mild traumatic
brain injury (MTBI) accounting for the vast majority
of all TBIs, is a major worldwide problem. TBI is associated with high utilization of medical care and substantial medical costs (Fu, Jing, Fu, & Cusimano, 2016;
McMillan, Weir, & Wainman-Lefley, 2014; Mosenthal
et al., 2004; Scholten, Haagsma, Panneman, Van Beeck,
& Polinder, 2014; Thurman, Alverson, Dunn,
Guerrero, & Sniezek, 1999). The elderly population is
generally the largest consumer of health services and
critical care resources. By 2050, 40% of all trauma
patients will consist of adults aged 65years or older
(Tillou et al., 2014). Both the bimodal distribution of
TBI, with a higher risk of TBI in both younger
(younger than 15years) and older subjects (older than
65years) (Taylor, Bell, Breiding, & Xu, 2017), and the
increasing life expectancy of people are believed to lead
to higher mortality and morbidity rates after sustaining
a TBI. Elderly not only have an increased risk of sustaining a TBI, but advanced age is also a risk factor for


higher mortality and morbidity rates after sustaining a
TBI (Mosenthal, Lavery, & Addis, 2002; Pennings,
Bachulis, Simons, & Slazinski, 1993; Rozzelle, Wofford,
& Branch, 1995; Zonfrillo, Kim, & Arbogast, 2015).
Although the majority of elderly patients return to
their homes after sustaining a TBI (Rapoport &
Feinstein, 2000; Røe, Skandsen, Manskow, Ader, &
Anke, 2015), elderly patients are reported to experience
more complications (Papa, Mendes, & Braga, 2012),
and a greater dependence as compared to their
younger counterparts (Mosenthal et al., 2002).
Despite the increase in elderly patients who sustain
a TBI, the majority of studies focus on outcomes of
working-age individuals as opposed to older adults
(LeBlanc, de Guise, Gosselin, & Feyz, 2006;
Livingston et al., 2005; Mosenthal et al., 2004; Susman
et al., 2002; Weber et al., 2016; Zonfrillo et al., 2015).
This underlines the need for prognostic models in
this patient group. Previous studies have shown that
older age is a main prognostic factor for outcome,
whereas elderly patients also often suffer from a high

burden of chronic health conditions. These chronic
health conditions contribute to falls, which subsequently increases the risk of TBI. Mosenthal et al.
(2004) reported that 73% of elderly patients with TBI
had one or more medical conditions prior to injury.
In addition, Selassie, McCarthy, Ferguson, Tian, and
Langlois (2005) have demonstrated that older TBI
patients with three or more pre-existing comorbid
diseases showed mortality rates that were four times
higher than subjects without any pre-existing disease.
Mood (i.e. anxiety and depression), post-concussive
symptoms, and post-traumatic stress are important
factors that are associated with outcome after TBI
(Silverberg et al., 2015; W€aljas et al., 2015). For
instance, many studies have shown that the occurrence of a TBI increases the likelihood of developing
depression (Fedoroff et al., 1992; Jorge et al., 2004;
Kreutzer, Seel, & Gourley, 2001). Rapoport,
McCullagh, Streiner, and Feinstein (2003) reported
that major depression was seen in 15% of patients
with MTBI in a cohort with ages ranging from 15–91
years (Rapoport et al., 2003). It was also found that
individuals with depression showed poorer outcome
than subjects without depression (Rapoport et al.,
2003). Post-concussive symptoms are also associated
with the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress
(Haagsma et al., 2015; Lagarde et al., 2014). However,
specific information on the relation between emotional distress and post-concussive symptoms in elderly is lacking.
In addition, coping, which refers to ‘the thoughts
and acts people use to manage the demands of stressful
situations’ is also believed to play an important role in
the recovery process after TBI (Chen, Peng, Xu, &
O’Brien, 2018). The most commonly used coping styles
comprise the active, passive, and avoidant coping style,
of which passive coping is associated with incomplete
recovery and lower quality-of-life (Maestas et al., 2014;
Scheenen et al., 2017; Snell, Siegert, Hay-Smith, &
Surgenor, 2011; van der Naalt et al., 2017). Although
studies on coping styles in elderly patients with MTBI
are very limited, one study in older adults reported
that an avoidant coping style was associated with more
emotional distress (Couture, Larivi�ere, & Lefranc¸ois,
2005). Resilience is also assumed to contribute to
adverse outcome following MTBI. For instance, Losoi
et al. (2015) reported that higher levels of resilience
were associated with fewer post-concussive symptoms
and a better quality-of-life (Losoi et al., 2015).
Moreover, resilience was found to be associated with
lower use of an avoidant coping style in veterans who
sustained a TBI (Elliott et al., 2015).


Elderly also experience an age-associated loss of
cognitive and physical resources that can make it difficult to adjust to life following a TBI. For instance,
frailty (i.e. defined as ‘the attribute of aged people
who are at an increased risk of adverse health outcomes as a consequence of a diminished ability to
respond to stress’). Rockwood, Song, and MacKnight
(2005) has emerged as an independent predictor of
risk of adverse outcome in older people (Abdulle
et al., 2018). Therefore, we postulate that the ability
to adapt and cope with TBI is a determining factor in
satisfactory outcome in elderly patients. The current
study aims to investigate the role of post-concussive
symptoms, mood, post-traumatic stress and coping
(assessed at 2 weeks post-injury) on functional outcome measured 6 months after sustaining an MTBI in
elderly patients.

Method

Participants

This study is part of a larger observational cohort
study on outcome following MTBI (UPFRONT-study)
(van der Naalt et al., 2017). All patients were
recruited from 2013 to 2015 at the emergency department (ED) of three Dutch hospitals designated as
Level-1 trauma centres. MTBI was defined by a
Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 13–15, loss of consciousness (LOC) 30 min, and/or duration of post-trau�
matic amnesia (PTA) < 24 h (ACRM criteria). In the
current study, only data from patients aged 60 years
�
were used for the analyses. No one was suffering
from psychiatric disorders at the time of the MTBI,
and none of the patients were clinically diagnosed
with dementia. The study was approved by the
Medical Ethical Committee of the UMCG, and all
patients gave written informed consent.

Clinical measures

Data were collected anonymously and comprised
information on general characteristics (e.g. gender
and age), injury-related characteristics (e.g. mechanism of trauma, CT abnormalities, Injury Severity Scale
(ISS), hospital admission, and discharge destination).
In addition, the presence of pre-injury mental health
problems and pre-injury physical complaints were
assessed based on two specific questions (‘Did you
experience physical complaints prior to your accident?’, ‘Did you experience mental health problems
prior to your accident?’). Data were obtained at several intervals post-injury, but for the current study


-----

data from the questionnaires assessed at 2 weeks
injury were used unless stated otherwise. These questionnaires included:

Coping: The Utrecht Coping List (UCL) is a 47�
item questionnaire to investigate coping style
(Curran, Ponsford, & Crowe, 2000). The UCL has
seven sub-scales representing different coping
styles including problem-solving, avoidance, selfdistraction, social support, withdrawal, expression
of emotions, and positive reframing. For the current study, we investigated three commonly used
coping styles (i.e. active, passive, and avoidant coping style) (Maestas et al., 2014). The scores range
from low (1) to very high (5), and higher scores
on the scales indicate a greater tendency to adopt
that particular coping style. For the current study,
values were dichotomized in high (range 4–5)
¼
and low (<4) use of the coping style (Scheenen
et al., 2017; van der Naalt et al., 2017). The UCL
is frequently applied in Dutch clinical practice and
has been used in several earlier studies among
people with other types of brain injury or stroke
(Aben, Busschbach, Ponds, & Ribbers, 2008;
Wolters, Stapert, Brands, & Van Heugten, 2010).
Post-concussive symptoms: Commonly occurring
�
post-concussive symptoms were assessed with the
Head Injury Symptom Checklist (HISC) (de
Koning et al., 2016; van der Naalt, van Zomeren
A, Sluiter, & Minderhoud, 1999). The HISC contains 21 items with scores ranging from 0 to 42
(0 never, 1 sometimes and 2 often) corrected
¼ ¼ ¼
for pre-injury complaints. The presence of postconcussive symptoms was defined as reporting one
or more symptoms, and dichotomized into 0 (no
complaints) and 1 (one or more complaints).
Mood: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
�
(HADS) was used to measure anxiety and depression (Snaith & Zigmond, 1983). This instrument
contains 14 items with seven items on depression
and seven items on anxiety, with scores ranging
from 0–21. HADS scores were dichotomized, with
a score 8 indicating the presence of clinical anx�
iety and/or depression.
Post-traumatic stress: The Impact of Event Scale
�
(IES) was used to assess post-traumatic stress. This
15-item questionnaire has a 5-point Likert scale
(sum scores 0–75), and a cut-off score of 19 was
indicative of post-traumatic stress disorder
(Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979).
Outcome: Functional outcome, assessed with the
�
Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), was


measured 6 months after the MTBI (Wilson,
Pettigrew, & Teasdale, 1998). The GOSE questionnaire has an 8-point scale, ranging from death (1)
to complete recovery (8). The GOSE scores were
dichotomized, with a score of 0–7 indicating
incomplete functional recovery and a score of 8
indicating complete functional recovery.

Statistical analysis

Statistic calculations were performed with the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23.0
(IBM Corp. Released 2015. IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows, Version 23.0; Armonk, NY). Descriptive
statistics were used to describe patient characteristics.
Parametric tests (one-way ANOVA) were used to
assess group differences for normally distributed variables. Non-normally distributed data were assessed
using non-parametric tests (e.g. Kruskal Wallis, Chisquare test). Correlations between variables were calculated using binary logistic regression, with the
dichotomized GOSE scores as the dependent variable.
A p-value below 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Patients characteristics

A total of 162 patients were included. Patient characteristics are displayed in Table 1. The majority of
patients were males (55%) and had a mean age of 71
(± 6.2) years. At 6 months post-injury, 56% of the
patients had a complete recovery. The majority (73%)
of patients were hospitalized and were eventually discharged to their homes. No significant differences in
patient characteristics were present when comparing
patients with complete recovery to those with incomplete recovery at 6 months post-injury.

Mood, post-traumatic stress, and postconcussive symptoms

At 2 weeks post-injury, 15% of patients reported to
experience anxiety (14% of patients with complete
recovery and 16% of patients with an incomplete
recovery, p 0.92, Figure 1). Regarding depression,
¼
12% of the patients reported to experience depressionrelated complaints. When comparing patients with a
complete and incomplete recovery, a significantly
higher prevalence of depression was found in patients
with an incomplete recovery (20%), as compared to
patients with complete recovery (7%, p 0.02).

Discussion

The current study aimed to investigate the role of
mood, post-concussive symptoms, post-traumatic
stress and coping on outcome in elderly patients after
sustaining an MTBI. The main finding of our study

was that almost half (44%) of the elderly showed
incomplete recovery 6 months post-injury. In addition, elderly patients who experienced depressionrelated complaints and post-concussive symptoms
early after MTBI (i.e. 2 weeks post-injury) were more
likely to show an incomplete recovery at 6 months
post-injury. In addition, coping style was not found
to be significantly associated with outcome.


A total of 162 elderly patients were included in the
current study, and 44% of these elderly patients
showed an incomplete recovery 6 months after sustaining an MTBI. This finding is in accordance with
Rothweiler, Temkin, and Dikmen (1998), who
reported that with increasing age the proportion of
patients who recover completely decreases. They also
reported that only 20% of the subjects aged 60 years


-----

or older achieved complete recovery (Rothweiler
et al., 1998). This high number of incomplete recoveries might partly be explained by mood problems.
For instance, the current study found that 12% of the
elderly patients experienced early depression, and the
presence of depression was associated with a higher
likelihood of incomplete recovery 6 months postinjury. Conversely, anxiety was not found to be associated with outcome in our elderly cohort. In line
with our findings, it was previously reported that
patients frequently develop depression following TBI
and also show poorer recovery (Fann, Katon,
Uomoto, & Esselman, 1995; Menzel, 2008). In addition, Goldstein, Levin, Goldman, Clark, & Kenehan
Altonen (2001) found that elderly MTBI patients,
although having a relatively good cognitive recovery,
showed significant depression and anxiety.
In addition to mood, post-concussive symptoms
might also affect the outcome of these elderly
patients. Our study demonstrated that the majority of
patients experience at least one post-concussive symptom 2 weeks after injury. We have also shown that
higher numbers of post-concussive symptoms are significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of
complete recovery. In accordance with previous studies, the most frequently reported complaints in our
cohort were dizziness, fatigue, and headache (van der
Naalt et al., 1999; Wylie & Flashman, 2017).
Collectively, these findings further underline the
importance of early post-concussive symptoms and
depression as determining factors for outcome, and
suggest that elderly patients might benefit from early
rehabilitation.
Pre-injury physical status, as well as pre-existing
mental health problems, should always be taken into
account when assessing elderly MTBI patients. The
importance of early physical complaints is underlined
by the postulation that elderly have reduced physical
reserves (LeBlanc et al., 2006; Elliott et al., 2015). In
addition, it was previously reported that pre-existing
mental health problems are associated with an
increased risk of a worse outcome (Fedoroff et al.,
1992; Curran et al., 2000). However, in our elderly
cohort the prevalence of pre-injury mental health
problems was rather low. Although not being statistically significant, we did observe a higher prevalence of
pre-injury physical complaints in subjects with an
incomplete recovery 6 months post-injury.
Fall accidents are the leading cause of MTBI in
elderly patients, and in our cohort fall accidents from
standing height was the mechanism of injury in the
majority of patients. Given the fact that falls were the


most prevailing cause of injury, elderly patients might
potentially benefit from primary fall prevention strategies. In addition, falls have been associated with
post-traumatic stress (Rockwood et al., 2005). In our
cohort, one in three of the elderly patients reported
to experience early post-traumatic stress. O’Donnell
et al. (2012) have previously shown that psychological
interventions, early after sustaining an injury, could
have a positive impact on outcome. Therefore, the
initiation of such strategies should be encouraged.
We further investigated the use of the three most
frequently used coping styles (i.e. active, passive, and
avoidant). Contrary to what was expected, we found
that high use of these coping styles was not frequently
present in elderly patients. The avoidant coping style
was the most used coping style. In addition, the active
coping style was borderline significantly associated
with a decreased risk of incomplete recovery. In earlier studies, the passive coping style was associated
with incomplete recovery and a reduced HRQoL
(Aben et al., 2008). Studies on coping styles in elderly
patients who sustained an MTBI are very limited, and
interpretation of our current results might be speculative. For instance, the high use of the avoidant coping
style might be the best choice in these elderly patients
in order to deal with limitations in their daily life. By
using the avoidant coping style instead of the active
coping style, elderly would be less likely to get frustrated by their complaints. Conversely, it could be
reasoned that this would lead to depression, which is
also more present in our cohort. Although we have
not investigated social engagement, previous studies
have shown that social participation can constitute a
means of coping with health changes (Wolters et al.,
2010). Subsequently, social relationships might aid in
the recovery following an MTBI. Therefore, future
studies in elderly patients should also investigate the
role of social participation in coping with outcome
following an MTBI.
Despite the very interesting results, this present
study also has some limitations. The first limitation of
this study is the lack of a control group (one that
consists of elderly who have not sustained a brain
injury) to disentangle the effect of age and the effect
of the MTBI. Furthermore, it could be argued that
the GOSE is not an applicable instrument to measure
outcome in these elderly patients, as the focus is on
functional outcome. Nevertheless, the GOSE is a valid
scale and is applied worldwide to monitor functional
recovery, even several years after injury. The GOSE
has been used in all age-categories and enables us to
compare our results with other studies. Another


-----

limitation is that the current study did not measure
cognitive impairments, which made it difficult to
determine whether patients were suffering from ageassociated mild cognitive impairment. However, none
of the patients in this study were clinically diagnosed
with dementia. In addition, the diagnosis of MTBI in
these elderly patients is often considered difficult, due
to the fact that elderly patients might experience mild
cognitive impairment, use medication, and suffer
from multiple comorbidities which might affect their
brain function (Page, Linnebur, Bryant, & Ruscin,
2010; Papa et al., 2012). Therefore, the number of elderly sustaining an MTBI might even be under-estimated due to these known difficulties (de Koning
et al., 2016; Horowitz et al., 1979; Snaith &
Zigmond, 1983).

Conclusion

Our study showed that almost half of the elderly had
an incomplete recovery 6 months after sustaining an
MTBI. Elderly patients who experienced depression
and post-concussive symptoms early after sustaining
an MTBI were more likely to have an incomplete
recovery. Collectively, our results underline the need
for a different approach in these elderly patients.
Therefore, other strategies are needed to support these
elderly patients with incomplete recovery, focusing
more on pre-injury status, cognitive reserve, and
social participation. Since the most common cause of
injury in our elderly cohort was fall accidents from
standing height, more awareness of fall prevention
is warranted.
