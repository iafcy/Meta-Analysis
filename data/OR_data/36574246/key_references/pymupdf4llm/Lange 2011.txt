## Depression Strongly Influences Postconcussion Symptom Reporting Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury

#### Rael T. Lange, PhD; Grant L. Iverson, PhD; Alice Rose, OT

**Objective: To examine the influence of depression on postconcussion symptom reporting in patients following**
mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Participants: Sixty patients referred to a specialty clinic following MTBI, 58
outpatients with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-diagnosed depression, and 72 healthy community control
participants. Procedure: Participants with MTBI were divided into 2 subgroups on the basis of self-reported symptoms of depression (23 MTBI-depressed, 37 MTBI-not depressed). All participants completed a postconcussion
symptom questionnaire. Main outcome measure: British Columbia Post-concussion Symptom Inventory. Results:
There were significant differences in total reported postconcussion symptoms among all 4 groups (all P < .002;
Cohen’s d = 0.68–3.24, large to very large effect sizes; MTBI-depressed > depressed outpatients > MTBI-no depression > healthy controls). There were significant differences in the number of symptoms endorsed (P < .05),
with the highest number of symptoms endorsed by the MTBI-depressed group, followed by depressed outpatients,
MTBI-no depression, and healthy controls. Conclusions: Patients who experience MTBIs and who have a postinjury recovery course complicated by significant depression report more postconcussion symptoms, and more severe
symptoms, than (a) outpatients with depression, and (b) patients with MTBIs who do not have significant symptoms
of depression. Keywords: depression, mild traumatic brain injury, postconcussion symptoms

diagnostic symptoms of depression, and other problems associated with this condition, are similar to the
current definition of postconcussion syndrome. The diagnostic criteria for major depression include diminished
ability to think or concentrate, indecisiveness, fatigue or
loss of energy, and sleep problems.[30(][p327][)] In addition,
major depression often is associated with irritability, excessive worry over one’s health, and headaches.[30(][p323][)]

Common lifestyle and psychosocial problems include
strained social relationships, marital and family distress,
occupational problems, academic problems, and substance abuse.[30(][p323][)] Therefore, it can be extremely difficult to determine whether a person’s self-reported symptoms are due to depression, a persistent postconcussion
syndrome, or both, because of the considerable symptom overlap in these conditions.
Second, depression is common with conditions that
often coexist with MTBI. Cooccurring conditions may
be physical injuries that are secondary to the MTBI itself (eg, soft-tissue or orthopedic injuries), psychological consequences of the injury experience (eg, posttraumatic stress disorder), or they may exist premorbidly
(eg, substance abuse). Researchers have reported that depression is common in patients with chronic pain,[31,32]

general trauma,[33] chronic headaches[34,35] posttraumatic
stress disorder,[36,37] and substance abuse problems.[38,39]

Therefore, the underlying cause of depression in the presence of these comorbidities can be very difficult, if not
impossible, to determine.
Third, depression is one of the most common mental
health problems in the world. The average age of onset
is in the mid-20s, with an estimated lifetime risk in community samples ranging from 10% to 25% for women
and 5% to 12% for men.[40–44] A single episode of major
depression places an individual at greatly increased risk
for a future episode, with estimates of recurrence ranging from 50% to 80%.[42,45–48] People who have had 2 or
more episodes of depression are at extremely high risk
for a future episode.[45] Therefore, the underlying cause
of depression, in any given person at any given time, can
be very difficult, if not impossible, to determine.
Fourth, patients with depression are expected to have
cognitive complaints. Perceived cognitive impairment is
a cardinal feature of depression.[49,50–52] Researchers have
also reported that patients with depression perform more
poorly on neuropsychological testing.[53] However, to our
knowledge, no study has shown that the cognitive effects
of depression can be accurately differentiated from the
cognitive effects of an MTBI. The problem for clinicians
and researchers is that a person with depression is virtually guaranteed to meet diagnostic criteria (ie, symptom
complaint criteria) for a postconcussion syndrome,[54] regardless of whether that person (a) has ever injured his
or her brain or (b) a past brain injury is causally related
to his or her current symptoms.


The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to try to
isolate and examine the depressive experience in a cohort of patients following MTBI by comparing MTBI
patients with and without depression to depressed outpatients and healthy controls. It was hypothesized that
both MTBI and depression would be associated with
high levels of postconcussion-like symptom reporting;
however, depression would have a more significant impact on symptom reporting than MTBI alone. More
specifically, it was hypothesized that (i) patients with
MTBIs with and without depression would report more
symptoms than healthy controls; (ii) MTBI patients with
depression would report more postconcussion symptoms than MTBI patients without depression; (iii) depressed outpatients would report more symptoms than
healthy controls and MTBI patients without depression;
and (iv) symptom reporting between MTBI with depression and depressed outpatients would be comparable.

**METHODS**

**Participants**

Participants were 190 community-dwelling adults
from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. They composed 3 groups: individuals with MTBI (n 60), outpa=
tients with depression (n 58), and healthy community
=
controls (n 72).
=
The participants in the MTBI sample (60.0% male)
were selected from a larger sample of 110 consecutive
referrals (January 2007 to September 2009) to a specialty
clinic at GF Strong Rehab Center, Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada. This is a hospital-based “early intervention” clinic designed to provide educational services
regarding the expected symptoms and recovery trajectory following a traumatic brain injury (primarily MTBI).
Patients were included in the sample if (a) they had sustained a MTBI (88.1% of total sample), (b) English was
their first language, or they had sufficient English fluency
to complete the interview and questionnaires (97.3%
of total sample), (c) they had been evaluated within 8
months of injury (98.2% of total sample), and (d) could
be placed into 1 of 2 depression classifications outlined
below (64.5% of total sample). A total of 60 patients met
all criteria. For many patients, complete medical records
were not available for review. For these patients, classification of MTBI was based on (a) self-reported loss of
consciousness (LOC) and posttraumatic amnesia (PTA),
and (b) self-reported injury information (eg, witnessed
LOC, mechanism of injury).
The mean age and education of the MTBI sample
was 36.0 years (SD 13.1) and 14.2 years (SD 1.9),

respectively. Ethnicity of the sample was predominantly
white (76.7%), with 10.0% Asian, 3.3% East Indian,
1.7% Canadian aboriginal, and 8.4% of other ethnic
origins. The breakdown regarding LOC and PTA was as

equivocal; PTA: 76.7% positive, 20.9% negative, and
3.3% equivocal. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores
were not available for half of the patients (53.3%). Of
the remaining sample, GCS 15 (11.7%), GCS 14

(30.0%), and GCS 13 (5.0%). Day-of-injury CT scan

intracranial abnormalities: 36.7% negative, 25.0% positive, 38.3% no CT scan undertaken at the time of injury.

The 58 outpatients with depression were initially diagnosed and then referred by their psychiatrist or family
physician. They were then administered the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). The SCID-I
is a semistructured clinical interview used to establish
_DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses. The version of the SCID-_
I used in this study was the nonpatient research version 2.0, August 1998 revision.[26] All patients in the
“depressed” group had an SCID diagnosis of major depressive disorder (92%), dysthymic disorder (5%), or depressive disorder NOS (3%). The diagnoses of the clinicians (ie, family physician or psychiatrist) corresponded
to the diagnoses derived from the SCID-I interview the
majority of the time. Specifically, the clinicians and the
SCID raters agreed on a diagnosis of major depressive
disorder in 81% of the cases. The clinicians diagnosed
dysthymic disorder in 8 patients, but the SCID rater
diagnosed major depressive disorder in 7 of these. In 3
instances, the SCID rater diagnosed dysthymic disorder,
but the clinician diagnosed major depressive disorder in
2 of these cases. Thus, in approximately 18% of the patients, there was diagnostic disagreement between the
SCID rater and the clinician. Nonetheless, all patients
were diagnosed independently by both a physician and
the SCID examiner as having a depressive disorder. Thirteen of the 58 patients reported a history of concussion
or traumatic brain injury with LOC at some point in
their lives. There was no significant difference on the total score derived from the postconcussion scale between
those with (M 22.5, SD 12.6) and those without

sion (P < .55). Therefore, to increase the heterogeneity
and generalizability of the sample, these subjects were
retained. This patient sample has also been used in a
previous study.[23]

The healthy control group consisted of 72 adult participants in a study conducted in the community as part
of a clinical trial in psychiatry (age: M 49.9, SD 11.7;

education: M 14.6, SD 2.8; 59.5% female). These

participants were screened for mental health, substance
abuse, or neurological problems through the use of ques

tionnaires and by administering the SCID. This control
sample has also been used in previous studies.[5][,][25][,][55]

**Measures**

The British Columbia Post-concussion Symptom
Inventory[25] (BC-PSI) is a 16-item measure designed
to assess the presence and severity of postconcussion
symptoms.[56] The BC-PSI is based on International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10)[45] criteria for postconcussional syndrome and requires the test taker to
rate the frequency and intensity of 13 symptoms (ie,
headaches, dizziness/light-headedness, nausea or feeling sick, fatigue, sensitivity to noises, irritability, sadness,
nervousness/tension, temper problems, poor concentration, memory problems, reading difficulty, and sleep disturbance) as well as the effect of 3 co-occurring life problems on daily living (ie, greater present vs past effects of
alcohol consumption, worrying and dwelling on symptoms, and self-perception of brain damage). The 3 life
problems are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 “not
=
at all” and 5 “very much.” The 13 symptoms are rated
=
on a 6-point Likert-type rating scale that measures the
frequency (ie, “how often”) and intensity (“how bad”)
of each symptom in the past 2 weeks. Frequency ratings range from 0 (not at all) to 5 (constantly). Intensity
ratings range from 0 (not at all) to 5 (very severe problem). To score the BC-PSI, the 2 ratings are multiplied
together (how often how bad) to create a single score
×
for each item. These product-based scores are then converted to item scores that reflect both the frequency and
intensity of symptom endorsement (range 0–4). The
=
participants’ ratings of the 13 symptoms were the focus
of this study. Item scores on the 13 individual symptoms
range from 0 to 4. Item scores of 1 or more are classified
as symptoms endorsed at a “mild level or greater.” Item
scores of 3 or more are classified as symptoms endorsed
at a “moderate level or greater.” Total scores are obtained
by summing the scores on the 13 individual symptoms
(range 0–52).

The British Columbia Major Depression Inventory–
Second Edition[57] (BC-MDI-II) is a 19-item questionnaire patterned specifically after the DSM-IV for major
depressive disorder. The BC-MDI was designed to be
more sensitive to the evaluation of clinically significant
symptoms of major depression than other depression inventories, because of its ability to assess not only for the
presence and severity of depressive symptoms but also
their impact on a person’s everyday life. This feature
is critical to the evaluation of major depressive disorder because an essential DSM-IV criterion for assigning
the diagnosis is evidence of disruption in daily activities as a consequence of depressive symptoms. The first
16 items of the BC-MDI-II are rated on a 5-point (1–5)
Likert-type rating scale that measures the severity (“how

problems on day-to-day life with regard to (a) their effectiveness at work or school, (b) family relationships

**Procedure**

The MTBI group was divided into 2 depression subgroups (23 MTBI-depressed, 37 MTBI-no depression)
based on selected items from the BC-MDI-II.[∗] These
items were considered hallmark symptoms of depression that were least likely to overlap with postconcussion
symptoms: (a) Sadness (“I feel sad, down in the dumps,
and or blue; nearly every day”), (b) Guilt (“I am burdened by guilt”), (c) Worthlessness (“I feel worthless or
useless”), (d) Thoughts of dying (“I often thinking about
dying; most days”), and (e) Suicide (“I think about killing
myself”). Patients were classified in the MTBI-no depression group if they met either of these 2 criteria: (a) all
5 symptoms were reported as absent, or (b) scores on
Sadness < 2 (very mild problem) and guilt < 3 (mild
problem) and worthlessness < 3 and thoughts of dying
_< 2 and Suicide_ absent. Patients were classified in the
=
MTBI-depressed group if they met any of these 4 criteria: (1) score of 4 (severe problem) or greater on sadness,
(2) score of 3 (moderate problem) or greater on sadness

∗It would have been our preference to classify these groups using the
SCID. However, the SCID was not administered to the MTBI group.


and score of 3 or greater on 2 remaining symptoms, (3)
score of 2 (mild problem) or greater on sadness and score
of 2 or greater on 3 remaining symptoms, or (4) score
of 3 or greater on sadness and score of 3 or greater on
1 remaining symptom. In other words, patients in this
group needed to endorse a significant problem with sadness and other core depressive symptoms. Patients who
did not fit these subgroup criteria were not included in
the final sample (35.5% of consecutive sample).[∗]

**RESULTS**

**Demographic and injury severity variables**

Demographic characteristics for the 4 groups are presented in Table 1. There were significant main effects

∗The mean BC-PSI total score for this excluded group was 27.9 (SD =
9.3). This is significantly greater (ie, Mann Whitney U tests) than the
control group without depression (P < .001, d = 4.70) and the MTBIno depression group (P < .001, d = 1.11). However, there was no
significant difference between this group and the depressed outpatients
(P = .056, d = 0.55) or the MTBI-depression group (P = .166, d =
0.34). It is notable, however, that this excluded group had average BCPSI total scores that were in between the depressed outpatient sample
and the MTBI depressed group.

variance (for gender). There were no significant correlations between postconcussion symptoms (ie, BC-PSI
total scores) and age in all 4 groups: healthy controls

Table 2.[∗] Overall, the MTBI-depressed group had the
highest rates of symptom endorsement (mild and moderate), followed by the depressed outpatients, MTBI-no
depression, and healthy control group.[†] For example, the range of specific endorsement rates of symptoms at a mild level or greater was as follows: MTBIdepressed group (65.2%–95.7%), depressed outpatient
(34.5%–93.1%), MTBI-no depression (24.3%–70.3%),
and healthy control (1.4%–23.6%).
The percentages of participants with BC-PSI total
scores of 10 points or higher and 15 points or higher were
calculated and compared. A score of 10 points or greater,
and 15 points or greater, are considered to be “unusually high” and “extremely high,” respectively, compared
with those for healthy adults.[25] Chi-square analyses were
used to compare the proportion of patients in each group
whose BC-PSI total scores were classified into these 2 total score classification ranges. There were significant differences in the proportion of patients with total scores
of 10 points or higher for all 6 group comparisons (all

.169; it is notable, however, that there was a difference
of 12% between these 2 groups). The MTBI-depressed
(91.3%) group had the highest proportion of patients
with scores in this range, followed by the depressed
outpatient (79.3%), MTBI-no depression (40.5%), and
healthy control group (4.2%).
Further comparison of the prevalence of endorsed
symptoms was undertaken by considering all symptoms
simultaneously. The cumulative percentages of the number of “mild or greater” symptom ratings for each group
are presented in Figure 2. Chi-square analysis was used
to compare the cumulative percentages of patients who
endorsed “x-or-more” symptoms (ie, ranging from 1 to
13) across all 4 groups. Overall, the MTBI-depressed
group endorsed the most symptoms, followed by depressed outpatients, patients with MTBI-no depression,
and healthy controls.
For symptoms endorsed at a mild level or greater, the
most notable differences were found at the middle to
higher portion of the symptom endorsement curve. For

example, 95.7% of the MTBI-depressed group endorsed
8 or more symptoms at a mild level or greater, followed
by 70.7% of the depressed outpatients, 29.7% of the
MTBI-no depression group, and 2.8% of the healthy
control group (P < .05 for all comparisons). Similarly,
87.0% of the MTBI-depressed group endorsed 10 or
more symptoms at a mild level or greater, followed by
43.1% of depressed outpatients, 24.3% of MTBI-no depression, and 0% of the healthy control group (P < .05
for all comparisons).
The percentages of each group that met ICD-10 Category C symptom criteria for postconcussional disorder were calculated. According to these criteria, a
person must have at least 3 of the following 6 symptom categories: (1) headaches, dizziness, general malaise,
excessive fatigue, or noise intolerance; (2) irritability,
emotional lability, depression, or anxiety; (3) subjective
complaints of concentration or memory difficulty; (4)
insomnia; (5) reduced tolerance to alcohol; and (6) preoccupation with these symptoms and fear of permanent
brain damage. Based on symptom reporting as mild or
greater in 3 or more of the 6 symptom domains, the
percentages of each group that met ICD-10 symptom

**DISCUSSION**

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence
of depression on postconcussion symptom reporting in a
cohort of patients following MTBI. We compared MTBI
patients with and without depression with depressed outpatients and healthy controls. MTBI patients were carefully classified into depressed/not-depressed subgroups
on the basis of hallmark symptoms of depression that
were least likely to overlap with postconcussion symptoms. It was hypothesized that patients with depression

-----

following an MTBI would report symptoms similar to
uninjured outpatients with depression, and that both of
these groups would endorse more symptoms than patients with MTBIs who were not depressed and healthy
control subjects.
There were 4 specific hypotheses for this study. The results strongly supported the first 3 hypotheses, but not
the fourth. Consistent with the first 2 hypotheses, (i)
MTBI patients with and without depression reported
more postconcussion symptoms than healthy controls
and (ii) MTBI patients with depression reported more
postconcussion symptoms than MTBI patients without
depression. Consistent with the third hypothesis, depressed outpatients reported more symptoms than both
healthy controls and MTBI patients without depression.
The final hypothesis was that the symptom reporting
between MTBI patients with depression and uninjured
outpatients with depression would be comparable. There
were mixed findings relating to this hypothesis. Compared to the outpatients with depression, the MTBI patients with depression (i) had greater total scores on the
BC-PSI, (ii) had a greater percentage of individuals who
endorsed some individual symptoms, and (iii) had an
overall greater number of endorsed symptoms. However,
in contrast, there was no difference in the proportion of
patients who (i) met ICD-10 symptom criteria for postconcussional disorder for symptom domains endorsed
as mild or greater or moderate or greater, or (ii) had BCPSI total scores that were 10 points or more or 15 points
or more.
Although the impact of MTBI alone on postconcussion symptom reporting was very large (Cohen d 2.05),
=
there was an obvious greater impact on postconcussion
symptom reporting when a depressive experience accompanied MTBI (Cohen d 5.41). These results are
=
consistent with studies that have established depression
as having a significant impact on postconcussion symptom reporting following MTBI.[7,58] The large “additive
effect” of depression on postconcussion symptom reporting following MTBI was somewhat surprising. There
was a very large effect size between the MTBI-no depression and MTBI-depressed groups. In clinical terms, the
vast majority (95.7%) of the MTBI-depressed group met
ICD-10 symptom criteria for postconcussional disorder
(based on symptom reporting in each domain as moderate or greater) compared to fewer than half (48.6%)
of the MTBI-no depression group. These differences are
striking.
In the absence of an MTBI, depression alone had
an enormous impact on postconcussion symptom reporting when compared to nondepressed healthy controls. In addition, depression alone had a greater impact on postconcussion symptom reporting than MTBI
alone. The vast majority of the depressed outpatient
group (96.6%) met ICD-10 symptom criteria for post

concussional disorder based on symptom reporting in
each domain as mild or greater, and a substantial majority (82.8%) also met ICD-10 symptom criteria based
on symptom reporting as moderate or greater. When
taken as a whole, these findings suggest that depression
appears to have an obvious and greater impact on symptom reporting compared to MTBI alone, but depression
occurring comorbidly with MTBI is associated with an
extremely high symptom burden.
Clearly, what are commonly considered to be postconcussion symptoms were extremely common in this
sample of depressed outpatients. This is consistent with
previous studies that have reported at least moderate correlations between postconcussion symptoms and
depression[59] or life stress.[60–65] Patients with MTBIs
complicated by a depressive experience endorsed an extremely high number of symptoms. When compared
to healthy controls, the effect size was very large.
When compared to depression alone, the effect size
was large. When taken as a whole, these findings suggest that depression appears to have an obvious and
greater impact on symptom reporting compared with
MTBI alone, but depression occurring comorbidly with
MTBI is associated with an extremely high symptom
burden.
This study has several limitations. First, these findings
should not be considered generalizable to all people who
have sustained MTBIs. This is a highly selected, nonrepresentative, yet homogenous sample. Approximately
35% of the MTBI sample were excluded because they
could not be classified into 1 of the 2 depression categories. As a group, these patients were reporting high
levels of postconcussion symptoms (BC-PSI total score:
_M_ 27.9, SD 9.3). However, it was not possible to con= =
fidently differentiate the likely influence of depression
versus MTBI on symptom reporting in these individuals. In order for us to attempt to isolate and examine
the depressive experience, it was necessary to exclude a
significant minority of patients.
Second, the MTBI-depression group was selected on
the basis of symptoms whose etiology may not be solely
attributable to depression alone and may also be attributable to the residual effects of MTBI. It is possible that some people in the MTBI-depression group are,
in fact, not depressed but are experiencing symptoms
related to the neurobiology of MTBI. It is impossible
for us, or anyone else, to discern the precise etiology of
these symptoms. However, we have made every effort
to carefully select symptoms that were considered hallmark symptoms of depression that were least likely to
overlap with postconcussion symptoms. Although it is
not possible for us to say with certainty that all MTBI
patients have been classified accurately in depressed/notdepressed groups, we believe that our selection method
has minimized the potential impact of misclassification

as much as possible (within the limits of this research
design).
Third, there was no measure of effort administered.
The relation between effort test failure and elevated
symptom reporting has been established for some time.
Of particular relevance, Iverson and colleagues[55] have
reported that failure on the test of memory malingering is associated with increased postconcussion symptom reporting following MTBI. It is possible that some
of our patients exaggerated their symptoms. Although
it is not possible to evaluate the influence of effort test
failure here, it is possible to compare patients who are
seeking/not seeking financial compensation for their injuries. There were no significant differences between
litigants and nonlitigants in the TBI-depressed group
(d 0.53, medium effect size) or the TBI-no-depression
=
group (d 0.37, small effect size). However, there was a
=
tendency for litigants to report more severe symptoms,
but these analyses were underpowered because of small
sample sizes. Overall, litigation status had, at most, a
small effect on the results of this study. We could not,
however, examine the issue of effort or exaggeration separately from litigation status.
In conclusion, these results suggest that the presence
of depression, regardless of its etiology and course, will
significantly increase self-reported PCS symptoms, in
both the absence or presence of a past MTBI. These
findings emphasize the necessity to consider depression

as an important factor in the differential diagnostic process. The differential diagnosis of postconcussional disorder following MTBI is complicated by the presence of
depression. The presence of depression in a person with
a history of traumatic brain injury presents an obvious
challenge if one attempts to diagnose a persistent postconcussion syndrome, given the overlap in symptoms.
Certainly, depression is relatively common in patients
with traumatic brain injuries,[33] although not necessarily more so than in patients with general trauma.[31,32]

Depression is also common in persons with chronic
pain,[66,67] and it is associated with increased disability
in these patients. Therefore, patients seen long after an
MTBI who have chronic pain, depression, or both are
very likely to meet diagnostic criteria for a persistent
postconcussion syndrome, even if the problems associated with the MTBI have long since resolved. This is
particularly important in a forensic setting. When seeing a person long after an injury, the clinician or forensic examiner must decide whether the current reported
symptoms are caused by a low probability factor (the biological consequences of a remote MTBI) or a high probability factor (the presence of current depression, chronic
pain, or both). The clinician or forensic examiner who diagnoses persistent postconcussion syndrome in a patient
with comorbid depression, chronic pain, or both might
be criticized for coming to an erroneous conclusion
without considerable evidence to support this diagnosis.
