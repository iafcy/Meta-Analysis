Adults with Persistent Post-Concussion
Symptoms

ABSTRACT: Objective: To assess demographic, clinical, and injury characteristics associated with health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) in adults with persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS). Methods: Adults with PPCS presenting to a specialized brain
injury clinic completed demographic, injury, and clinical outcome questionnaires at the initial clinic assessment. Clinical outcome
measures were collected including the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). HRQOL was measured using the
QualityofLifeafterBrainInjury(QOLIBRI)questionnaire.Stepwisehierarchicalmultipleregressionanalysisadjustingforage,sex,and
months since injury was used to determine associations between quality of life and clinical outcome measures. Results: Overall, 125
participants were included. The PHQ-9, FSS, and GAD-7 were significant predictors of QOLIBRI scores (R2=0.481, p<.001),
indicatingthatparticipantswithhigherlevelsofdepressivesymptoms,fatigue,andanxietyreportedpoorerHRQOL.ThePHQ-9score
was the strongest predictor, accounting for 42.0% of the variance in QOLIBRI scores. No demographic or injury characteristics

burden of mood disorders and fatigue in this population, targeted treatments for these concerns may impact the quality of life.
