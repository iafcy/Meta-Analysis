Abstract
This study examined multiple biopsychosocial factors relating to post-concussion symptom
(PCS) reporting in patients with mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBI), including structural (CT
and MRI) and microstructural neuroimaging (diffusion tensor imaging; DTI).
Patients with MTBIs completed several questionnaires and cognitive testing at
approximately one month (N=126) and one year post injury (N=103). At approximately three
weeks post injury, DTI was undertaken using a Siemens 3T scanner in a subgroup (N=71).
Measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated for 16 regions of interest (ROIs) and
measures of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated for 10 ROIs. Patients were
compared to healthy control subjects.
Using ICD-10 postconcussional syndrome (PCS) criteria and mild or greater symptom
reporting, 59% of the MTBI sample met criteria at one month and 38% met criteria at one year.
However, 31% of the healthy control sample also met criteria for the syndrome—illustrating a
high false positive rate. Significant predictors of ICD-10 PCS at one month were pre-injury
mental health problems and the presence of extra-cranial bodily injuries. Being symptomatic at
one month was a significant predictor of being symptomatic at one year, and depression was
significantly related to PCS at both one month and one year. Intracranial abnormalities visible on
MRI were present in 12.1% of this sample, and multifocal areas of unusual white matter as
measured by DTI were present in 50.7% (compared to 12.4% of controls). Structural MRI
abnormalities and microstructural white matter findings were not significantly associated with
greater post-concussion symptom reporting.
The personal experience and reporting of post-concussion symptoms is likely
individualized, representing the cumulative effect of multiple variables, such as genetics, mental
health history, current life stress, medical problems, chronic pain, depression, personality factors,
and other psychosocial and environmental factors. The extent to which damage to the structure
of the brain contributes to the persistence of post-concussion symptoms remains unclear.

Introduction
It is well established that mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is associated with cognitive
impairment in the initial days following injury in athletes and civilians,1-3 and by three months
post injury there is substantial recovery and cognitive deficits are no longer present in group
studies.4-8 A minority of patients with MTBIs who undergo day-of-injury computed tomography
(CT) show evidence of macroscopic abnormalities [e.g., 5% in patients with a Glasgow Coma
Scale Score (GCS) of 15, 20% for those with a GCS of 14, and 30% for those with GCS of 139].
The term complicated MTBI has been used to refer this subgroup of patients who have evidence
of trauma-related intracranial abnormality (e.g., hemorrhage, contusion, or edema).10 Some
studies have shown that those with complicated MTBIs, as a group, have worse short-term (i.e.,
1 week to 3 months)11-14 and long-term outcome.15-17 Some researchers, however, have reported
that patients with complicated MTBIs do not report more post-concussion symptoms at one
month,18 three months,19 or six months20 following injury than those with uncomplicated MTBIs.
The rate at which people recover subjectively, in regards to post-concussion symptoms,
varies from study to study—but it is clear that a substantial minority of people continue to report
symptoms at one,21-23 three,24-27 six,28 and 12 months29-31 following injury. Post-concussion-like
symptoms tend to be persistent in some people; many of those who are highly symptomatic at
one month will also be highly symptomatic at one year.21,31,32 Of course, there is considerable
individual variability in how people endorse their symptoms over time.27,31,33 There is even
evidence that some people who do not report significant post-concussion symptoms shortly
following the injury report post-concussion-like symptoms many months or year post-injury.33,34
The situation is complicated because these symptoms are non-specific; they are reported fairly
frequently by healthy adults35,36 and people with chronic pain,37,38 post-traumatic stress

disorder,39,40 and depression.41-46 Therefore, it is not surprising that in clinical practice and
research it is difficult to predict the rate at which a person will improve and recover following an
MTBI. The etiology of persistent symptoms is likely diverse, multifactorial, and characterized by
considerable individual variability. Therefore, a perspective that integrates biological, social,
cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors into a biopsychosocial framework might be useful for
conceptualizing rapid, typical, or slow recovery in individual patients.47-53
The purpose of this study was to adopt a biopsychosocial perspective for examining the
natural history of post-concussion symptom reporting using a prospective, longitudinal, inception
cohort design. A biopsychosocial approach facilitates the integration and synthesis of a large and
diverse literature into a set of specific hypotheses that can be tested on a single large prospective
cohort. Numerous clinical and methodological factors that are relevant to studying outcome from
MTBI will be controlled or statistically analyzed, such as pre-existing mental health
problems,4,35,54-59 injury severity and structural neuroimaging,10,13,15,60-62 the nonspecificity of
post-concussion-like symptoms,35,55,56,63 and the role of post-injury mental health.49,64,65
Researchers have reported that pre-injury psychiatric problems55,57 are associated with persistent
post-concussion symptom reporting in some people. Moreover, brain injuries of all severities are
associated with increased risk for developing depression,41-46 especially in those with pre-
existing mental health problems.66 Therefore, the relationship between depression and post-
concussion symptom reporting is important to analyze. Studies examining the relationship
between persistent symptom reporting and macrostructural intracranial abnormalities (e.g.,
complicated vs. uncomplicated MTBI)11-20 and microstructural changes in white matter
(diffusion tensor imaging; DTI) have yielded mixed results. Waljas and colleagues67 summarized
the findings from 50 studies involving DTI in MTBI. They reported that 88% of authors reported

DTI abnormalities associated with MTBI. However, 82% of the studies did not study the relation
between the abnormalities and post-concussion symptoms. Most published studies have found a
relationship between white matter abnormalities and PCS,68-74 although some reported no
association.46,67,75
This prospective study will include diverse outcome measures, including structural (CT
and MRI) and microstructural neuroimaging (DTI), cognition, depression, and post-concussion
symptom reporting. There are five primary hypotheses. First, patients who sustain complicated
MTBIs (i.e., those with trauma-related abnormalities on day of injury CT or subacute MRI),
compared to those with uncomplicated MTBIs, will perform more poorly on memory testing and
report greater post-concussion symptoms at one month, but not at one year, following injury.
Second, patients with pre-existing mental health problems will report greater post-concussion
symptoms than those without pre-injury mental health problems following MTBI. Third, post-
concussion-like symptoms at both one month and one year following MTBI will have a medium
to high correlation with affective symptoms of depression. Fourth, patients with MTBIs will
show more areas of abnormality on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) than control subjects. Finally,
patients with abnormalities on DTI will endorse more symptoms than patients with broadly
normal DTI findings following MTBI at three weeks but not one year following injury.

115) criteria for an MTBI59). Inclusion criteria were (i) biomechanical force applied to the head,
(ii) loss of consciousness, if present, for less than 30 minutes, (ii) GCS score between 13 and 15
after 30 minutes following injury, and (iii) post-traumatic amnesia, if present, of less than 24
hours. Exclusion criteria were: age under 16 or over 65, history of previous major substance
abuse, history of psychiatric disorder, or past neurological condition or disease. MTBI patients
underwent day-of-injury head computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) at average 29 days (SD = 19.9 days) post injury. This sample included patients (N=17;
13.5%) who had an intracranial trauma-related abnormality on day-of-injury CT or follow-up
MRI (i.e., a complicated MTBI).
The average age of the MTBI sample was 37.8 years (SD = 13.5; Range = 16-64), their
average education was 12.6 years (SD = 2.7; Range = 8-22), and 56.3% of the sample was
female. At the time of injury, the employment status of the sample was as follows: 67.5%
working full time, 2.4% working part time, 15.9% students, 4.0% retired/partly retired, 9.5%
unemployed, and 0.8% on sick leave. The percentages of patients with previous MTBIs were as
follows: none = 65.1%, one = 32.5%, two = 2.4%. The psychiatric history of this sample was as
follows: 90.5% none, 7.1% yes, 2.4% unknown. The mechanisms of injury were as follows:
32.5% motor vehicle accident (MVA), 4.0% pedestrian-MVA, 8.7% sports, 36.5% fall (low),
7.1% fall (high), 7.1% assault, and 4.0% other. Their average GCS score was 14.96 (SD = 0.20,
Range = 14-15, 96% = 15). Duration of loss of consciousness (LOC) was as follows: 71.6% no
LOC, 12.0% LOC ≤ 1 min, 13.8% LOC > 1min ≤ 5 min, 1.8% LOC > 5 min ≤ 10 min, and 0.9%
LOC > 10 min; the average duration of LOC was 0.8 min (SD = 2.2, Range = 0 – 15). Duration
of post-traumatic amnesia was as follows: 48% no PTA, 22% PTA ≤ 2hours, 30% PTA > 2

hours, average duration of PTA was 196.2 minutes (SD = 353.2 minutes, Range = 0-1440
minutes). The average duration of sick leave after the injury was 42.1 days (SD = 112.1, IQR =
3.0 – 30.5, Range = 0 – 729). Four patients were missing data of duration of sick leave. None of
the patients were involved in litigation. All participants were Caucasian. This sample was also
used in a recent study examining return to work following MTBI,77 and a subgroup of this
sample was used to examine short-term outcome from uncomplicated MTBI.67
Two separate healthy control groups were recruited from the community for the study:
(a) a neuroimaging control group, and (b) a neuropsychological control group. The neuroimaging
control group initially consisted of 30 age- and gender-matched participants with no history of
brain injury, neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders who completed a neuroimaging
protocol using MRI with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In the control sample, 26.7% (8/30)
had incidental MRI findings. Of the 8, 6 participants were excluded due to major incidental
findings [e.g., cavernotic angioma with hemosiderin or numerous white matter hyperintensities
(e.g., more than 10)]. Twenty-four neuroimaging control subjects were included in the final
sample (Age: M=36.6 years, SD=10.1, female 66.7%). Of those 24, two had incidental white
matter hyperintensities (8.3%; one had a single nonspecific hyperintensity and the other had
two).
The neuropsychological control group consisted of 36 age and sex matched individuals
(63.9% female) with no history of head injury or psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the
controls was 36.9 years (SD = 13.6 years, Range = 17-61) and their average education was 15.1
(SD = 2.5 years, Range = 8-19) years. The employment status of the control sample was as
follows: 64% of the participants were working full time, 33% were full-time students and 3%
were unemployed. Participants in the neuropsychological control group completed self-report

measures (e.g., post-concussion symptoms and depression) and a test of verbal learning and
memory. The MTBI and control group did not differ on age (t[160] = .336, p = .737) or gender
(χ2 = .654, p = .419). The MTBI group differed from the control group on education (t[160] = -
4.890, p = .001). The mean years of education for MTBI patients and control subjects were 12.6
(SD = 2.7) and 15.1 (SD = 2.5), respectively.
All participants provided written informed consent according to the Declaration of
Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Tampere University
Hospital, Finland
Procedures
All the MTBI patients in this study were recruited from the ED of Tampere University
Hospital. Brain CT scans were performed in all patients within 24 hours of admission. For the
MTBI group, MRI scanning was conducted between two weeks and two months post injury for
the majority of participants (n= 119, 7 individuals missing MRI) (M=29.1 days, SD=19.9 days;
IQR = 21.0-32.0 days, Range=1-159 days). MTBI patients participated in an interview and
completed several questionnaires at approximately one month (N=126) and one year post injury
(N=103). The average number of days from injury to the first interview and questionnaires was
24.1 days (SD = 5.4, Range = 8-38). Most of the patients (n = 103, 82%) were seen for an annual
follow-up. This session occurred on average 12.6 months post injury (Mean = 383.8 days, SD =
30.6 days, Range = 316 – 488 days). For the control group, testing was completed as soon as
possible following enrolment in the study.
Measures
Neuroimaging. MRI was performed either on a 1.5 Tesla (Magnetom Avanto A TIM
system Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) (n = 37, 29.4%) or a 3T Siemens Trio

(Siemens AG Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) (n = 89, 70.6%) machine. MRI sequences
were evaluated by a certified neuroradiologist. The MRI protocol included sagittal T1-weighted
3D IR prepared gradient echo, axial T2 turbo spin echo, conventional axial and high resolution
sagittal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial T2*, and axial susceptibility weighted
imaging (SWI) series. White matter hyperintensities (WMHI) were recorded from FLAIR
sequences. The parameters for FLAIR sequences were TI 2216 ms, TR 7000 ms, TE 87 ms, FOV
199 × 220 ms, matrix 232 × 256, slice/gap 4.0/1.2 mm. The DTI sequence was single-shot
diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging. The parameters for DTI were TR 5144 ms, TE 92 ms,
FOV 230 mm, matrix 128 × 128, 3 averages, slice/gap 3.0/0.9 mm, voxel dimension 1.8 x 1.8 x
3.0 mm, b-factor 0 and 1000 s/mm2, and 20 diffusion gradient orientations. A 12-channel head
matrix coil was used. Only trauma related findings in CT and MRI were counted as abnormal;
minor incidental findings, such as isolated white matter hyperintensities, were not considered as
abnormal.
Of the 89 patients who underwent 3T MRI, DTI was acquired on 84 of them. A subset of
these subjects (n=13) were excluded due to the presence of major incidental findings (e.g.,
ischemic lesions, numerous white matter hyperintensities, or enlarged lateral ventricles); 3 for
incidental findings on CT, and 10 for incidental findings on MRI. The final subsample consisted
of 71 MTBI patients (at one year follow-up n= 60). Those who had 1.5T did not differ from
those with 3T on age (p=.106), education (p=.980), PTA (p=.603), RA (p=.858) LOC (p=.723),
BDI-II at one month (p=.269), BDI-II at one year (p=.396), AUDIT at one month (p=.170),
AUDIT at one year (p=.082), sex (p=.214), previous psychiatric symptoms (p=.726), previous
brain injuries (p=.204), or previous diseases (p=.564). There was a significant difference in

duration of time off work: the 1.5T group has a significantly greater number of days off work
(mean 87.4, SD=182.4) than the 3T group (mean 23.1, SD=54.5) (t[120]=2.08, p=.044).
Region-of-interest (ROI) based DTI measurements were performed in eight different
anatomical locations of each hemisphere and in three locations within the corpus callosum.
Quantitative DTI parameters, including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional
anisotropy (FA), were calculated symmetrically for multiple ROIs in the pyramidal tract (i.e.,
basal pons, cerebral peduncle, posterior limb of the internal capsule, corona radiata, and centrum
semiovale) and frontobasal area (i.e., uncinate fasciculus, forceps minor, and anterior corona
radiata). In the corpus callosum, the ROIs included three regions: the genu, body, and splenium.
ROIs were selected on the basis of prior studies that have demonstrated abnormalities on DTI
parameters in these areas.69,70,78-81
All diffusion parameter analyses were performed by one observer (a physicist with long
experience of brain ROI measurements; UH) on a workstation using commercially available
software (Neuro 3D; Siemens Medical Solution, Malvern, USA). Circular ROIs were manually
placed on color-coded axial fractional anisotropy (FA) maps and automatically transferred on the
non-diffusion-weighted b and ADC maps. The ROIs of the corpus callosum were drawn onto
0
the median-line sagittal images. The size of the ROI was modified to the axial structure of each
fiber tract. The circular ROIs were centered in the region taking care to avoid border areas, such
as overlapping with cerebrospinal fluid spaces and neighboring tracts. The data quality was
excellent in most cases, except in certain regions that had artifacts caused by air cavities and
fluid flow. Mean values for FA and ADC for each region were calculated from the mean values
of the right and left hemispheres.

A reliability study of this method was undertaken using the control sample (n=30).82
Each ROI was sampled twice by the same rater to evaluate intrarater reliability. Intraclass
correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for all FA and ADC using a two-way random-
model analysis with absolute agreement. The ICC values were considered as excellent agreement
if greater than 0.8, as substantial agreement if they were from 0.60 to 0.79, and as fair/poor
agreement if below 0.6. All ROIs that did not met criteria for substantial agreement for intrarater
reliability (>0.65) were excluded from the analyses, including the Cerebral Peduncle-ADC
(0.19), Centrum Semiovale-FA (0.48), Centrum Semiovale-ADC (0.63), Forceps Minor-ADC
(0.64), Anterior Corona Radiata-ADC (0.27), Corpus Callosum Body-FA (0.23), Corpus
Callosum-Body-ADC (0.26).
Initially, 19 ROIs were measured and ADC and FA values were calculated symmetrically
for each ROI. Based on results from the reliability study, two regions were excluded for FA
analysis (Centrum Semiovale, Corpus Callosum Body). Five regions were excluded for ADC
analysis (Cerebral Peduncle, Centrum Semiovale, Forceps Minor, Anterior Corona Radiata, and
Corpus Callosum Body). The number of ROIs retained for the analysis was 16 ROIs for FA and
10 ROIs for ADC.
Self-Report Questionnaires: Post-concussion symptoms were assessed with the
Rivermead Post Concussion Questionnaire (RPSQ).83 The RPSQ is a 16-item self-report
questionnaire that measures the severity of common post-concussion symptoms on a 5-point
Likert scale. The patients rated the presence of the symptoms over the past 24 hours on a scale
from 0 to 4 (0 = not experienced at all after the injury, 1 = experienced but no more of a problem
compared with before the injury, 2 = a mild problem, 3 = a moderate problem, and 4 = a severe

problem). A total score was calculated by adding all items with a score greater than 1. High test-
retest reliability has been reported for 7-10 day (r=.90) and 6-month (r= .87) intervals.83
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition
(BDI II 84 a 21-item self-report questionnaire). Subjects are asked to rate each item on a four-
point scale ranging from zero to three. It should be noted that many symptoms on this
questionnaire overlap with post-concussion symptom measured by the RPSQ and clinically it is
often not possible to differentiate depression from persistent post-concussion symptoms.
Therefore, 10 of the 21 symptoms from the BDI-II, believed to have the least overlap with
symptoms of MTBI and being most representative of depression, were selected. These symptoms
were: sadness, loss of interest, loss of pleasure, pessimism, past failure, guilt feelings,
punishment feelings, self-criticalness, crying, and suicidal thoughts or wishes. In this study, we
used the total score which is the sum of all 10 items, giving a range from zero to 30. Higher total
scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to detect alcohol
problems.85 The AUDIT is a widely used brief screening test to identify persons who have risky
drinking, harmful drinking, or alcohol dependence. The AUDIT is a self-report measure that
consists of 10 questions. Each of the questions has a set of responses to choose from, and each
response has a score ranging from 0 to 4 (questions 1 – 8). Questions 9 and 10 are scored 0, 2, or
4 only. All the response scores are added to create a total score. Total score of ≥ 10 on the
AUDIT is considered indicative of harmful or hazardous drinking. One subject did not complete
this questionnaire.
Neurocognitive measure: The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)86 was used
to assess verbal memory. RAVLT is a widely used test for learning and memory. In this study,

applied in this study were from Mitrushina and co-workers.87
Postconcussion Symptom Classification
Classification of the ICD-10 symptom criteria for the post-concussion syndrome (PCS)
was based on the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire. We defined the
syndrome, based on ICD-10 criteria, two ways: (a) based on mild or greater symptom reporting
in each domain, and (b) based on moderate or greater symptom reporting in each domain.
We defined the DSM-IV criteria for postconcussion disorder (PCD) two ways as follows:
(a) mild cognitive impairment AND mild or greater report of 3 Category C symptoms AND not
having returned to work by one month (30 days); or (b) mild cognitive impairment AND
moderate or greater report of 3 Category C symptoms AND not having returned to work by
approximately one month (30 days). The methodology of this study did not permit an exact
application of the DSM-IV criteria at 3 months because the symptom and cognition data were
collected prior to that point in time. In the total sample, 75.4% had returned to work by one
month and 93.4% had returned to work by three months following injury. We operationally
defined mild cognitive impairment in memory as scoring more than 1.5 standard deviations
below the normative mean on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test total score.87 The RAVLT
is recommended as a common data element for TBI research.88 Using 1.5 standard deviations
below the normative mean cut-off score, the percentages of the MTBI sample with low scores
were as follows: RAVLT total score = 7.1% at one month following injury and 1.9% at one year.
Applying this cut-off to the control sample, the percentages with low scores were as follows:
RAVLT total score = 5.6%.

Withdrawal During the Study
Twenty three patients (18.3%) dropped out of the study during the one-year follow-up.
Those who did not come to the follow-up (i.e., Attrition group) were compared to those who
came to the follow-up (i.e., Follow-up group). The Attrition group did not differ from the
Follow-up group on age (p=.205), education (p=.211), AUDIT at one month (p=.397), BDI-II at
one month (p=.302), RAVLT total score at one month (p=.113), RPSQ total score at one month
(p=.609), gender (p=.342), previous psychiatric symptoms (p=1.0) previous brain injuries
(p=.456), abnormal CT findings (p=.206), abnormal MRI findings (p=.737), or duration of time
off work (p=.325). There was a significant difference in PTA, retrograde amnesia (RA), and
LOC: the Attrition group had a significantly shorter PTA (mean=30.8 minutes, SD=81.5) than
the Follow-up group [mean=232.2 minutes, SD=378.7; t(121)=4.85, p<.001]. Also, the Attrition
group had a significantly shorter RA (mean=.03 minutes, SD=.11) than the Follow-up group
[mean=9.5 minutes, SD=36.5; t(101)=2.61, p=.010]. On LOC, the Attrition group had a
significantly shorter duration (mean=.16 minutes, SD=.47) than the Follow-up group [mean=.96
minutes, SD=2.39; t(107)=2.94, p=.004]. Therefore, by traditional injury severity criteria, those
who completed the study had more severe MTBIs than those who dropped out.
Results
Complicated Versus Uncomplicated MTBI
The MTBI group’s RAVLT total score mean 53.3 (SD=9.3) did not differ from the
healthy control’s RAVLT total score mean 55.6 (SD=9.0) at one month post injury [t(160)=-
1.31, p=.193; Cohen’s d=.25] or one year post injury [t(137)=1.04, p=.300; d=.20] (RAVLT total
score mean=57.4, SD=9.0 for the MTBI group at one year). Alpha was adjusted for the four
primary comparisons for the first hypothesis (.05/4=.0125). The RAVLT total score for those
with complicated MTBIs (n=17, mean=55.5, SD=12.8) did not differ from those with

uncomplicated MTBIs (n=109, mean=52.9, SD=8.7) at one month following injury [t(124)=-
1.06, p=.299; d=.28]. Similarly, the total score for those with complicated MTBIs (n=15,
mean=59.8, SD=10.7) did not differ from those with uncomplicated MTBIs (n=88, mean=57.0,
SD=8.7) at one year following injury [t(101)=-1.12, p=.266; d=.31].
Regarding symptoms, the RPSQ total score for those with complicated MTBIs
(mean=7.3, SD=6.3) did not differ from those with uncomplicated MTBIs (mean=10.9,
SD=11.2) at one month following injury [t(34)=1.92, p=.064; d=.34]. Similarly, the total score
for those with complicated MTBIs (mean=4.0, SD=4.3) did not differ from those with
uncomplicated MTBIs (mean=7.3, SD=10.2) at one year following injury [t(46)=2.11, p=.040;
d=.35]. The percentages of patients who met ICD-10 criteria, using “mild or greater” symptom
reporting, for a PCS at one month and one year post injury were as follows: uncomplicated
MTBI=59.8% and 39.8%, and complicated MTBI (MRI abnormality)=52.9% and 26.7%,
respectively. The percentages of patients who met ICD-10 criteria, using “moderate or greater”
symptom reporting, for a PCS at one month and one year post injury were as follows:
uncomplicated MTBI=21.9% and 13.6%, and complicated MTBI (MRI abnormality)=5.9% and
0%, respectively. Chi square analyses did not reveal any significant differences in the rates of the
ICD-10 diagnosis in relation to the presence or absence of MRI abnormalities. Also, the effect
sizes (phi-coefficient; φ) for this finding were very small (φ ranged from .05 to .15 indicating
little or no association).
Depression
There was a significant positive Pearson correlation between the BDI-II subscale scores
and the RPSQ total scores in the MTBI group at one month post injury (r=.51; p<.001) and at
one year post injury (r=.59; p<.001). The correlation between BDI-II subscale scores and RPSQ

total scores in the control group was .48 (p=.003). At one month, the MTBI group had higher
mean BDI-II subscale scores (sum of all 10 selected items; mean=2.2, SD=3.3) than the control
group [mean=1.3, SD=1.8; t(101)=2.10, p=.042, d=.30] – but this finding is not significant after
considering multiple comparisons. At one year, the MTBI group’s BDI-II subscale scores
(mean=1.7, SD=3.4, d=.13) did not differ from the control group mean subscale BDI-II score
(p=.548). Patients who met ICD-10 criteria for postconcussional syndrome had significantly
higher BDI-II subscale total scores than those patients who did not meet the ICD-10 criteria at
one month based on “mild or greater” symptom reporting [t(94)=-5.59, p<.001, Cohen’s d=.96]
and “moderate or greater” symptom reporting [t(27)=-3.59, p=.001, Cohen’s d=1.19]. Similarly,
at one year post-injury, patients who met ICD-10 criteria for the syndrome had significantly
higher BDI-II subscale total scores than those patients who did not meet the ICD-10 criteria
using both “mild or greater” symptom reporting [t(56)=-2.68, p=.010, Cohen’s d=.63] and
“moderate or greater” symptom reporting [t(12)=-3.59, p=.004, Cohen’s d=2.01]. Correcting for
multiple comparisons (.05/4=.0125), three of the four above mentioned findings are statistically
significant.
Regarding pre-injury history of mental health problems, the RPSQ total score for those
with pre-injury mental health problems (n=9, mean=21.0, SD=11.1) was much higher than for
those without mental health problems (n=117, mean=9.6, SD=10.3) at one month following
injury [t(124)=-3.19, p=.002; d=1.10]. At one year, the RPSQ total score for those with pre-
injury mental health problems (n=7, mean=12.9, SD=16.9) did not differ from those without
mental health problems [n=96, mean=6.4, SD=8.83; t(6)=-1.01, p=.351; d=.69], most likely due
to small sample size. Of the 73 patients who met ICD-10 criteria for PCS at one month post
injury based on “mild or greater” symptom reporting, 10.9% (n=8) had previous mental health

problems [χ2 (1,126)=3.61, p=.080]. Of those 8 patients, who had a history of mental health
problems, 88.9% met the ICD-10 criteria for PCS based on “mild or greater” symptom reporting.
Using symptom endorsement as “moderate or greater” in those with a pre-injury mental health
problem (n=8), 62.5% [χ2 (1,122)=9.94, p=.007] met the PCS criteria at one month. At one year,
there was not a significant association between PCS group membership and previous mental
health problems.
Descriptive Analysis of Post-Concussion Symptoms
Descriptive statistics, percentages, and group comparisons for the RPSQ total score and
individual symptoms at one month and one year post injury are presented in Table 1. The RPSQ
total score was significantly higher in the MTBI group compared to controls at both one month
[t(129)=5.32, p<.001, d=.71] and one year [t(119)=2.48, p=.015, d=.36] following injury. In the
MTBI group, significantly lower RPSQ total scores were found at one year post injury compared
to one month post injury [t(102)=3.57, p<.001, d=.35]. At one month, the individual symptoms
that differentiated the MTBI group from the control group with the largest effect sizes were
fatigue, taking longer to think, dizziness, headaches, blurred vision, and nausea. At one year, the
individual symptoms that differentiated the MTBI group from the control group, with the largest
effect sizes, were fatigue, taking longer to think, and blurred vision.

Considering the total number of symptoms endorsed by the MTBI and the control group,
two important issues emerge (see Figure 1). First, it is typical for control patients to endorse
post-concussion-like symptoms. When using the criteria “mild or greater” symptom reporting,
over 50% of controls endorsed one to five symptoms and approximately 6% endorsed six to ten
symptoms. Commonly reported symptoms included feeling frustrated or impatient, sleep

endorse an extremely high number of symptoms (11 or more) at both one month and one year
following injury. None of the controls endorsed this level of symptoms.

Diagnostic Rates for the Post-Concussion Syndrome
The percentages of the sample that met ICD-10 symptom criteria for postconcussion
syndrome (PCS) and DSM-IV criteria for postconcussional disorder (PCD) are presented in
Table 2. Using the mild or greater ICD-10 criteria for PCS, 59% of the MTBI cases met criteria
at one month post injury and 38% met criteria at one year post injury. In the control group, 31%
met the criteria. Using the moderate or greater ICD-10 criteria for the PCS, 20% of the MTBI
cases met criteria at one month post injury and 12% met criteria at one year. In the control group,
0% met the criteria. At one month post injury, a significantly greater proportion of MTBI
patients met PCS criteria than control participants using symptom endorsement as “mild or
greater” [χ2(1,160) = 8.97, p=.003] and “moderate or greater” [χ2(1,158) = 8.35, p=.007]. At one
year post-injury, a significantly greater proportion of MTBI patients met PCS criteria compared
to controls when using “moderate or greater” criterion [χ2(1,139) = 4.59, p=.036].
Using the mild or greater DSM-IV criteria for PCD, only 1.6% of the MTBI cases met
criteria at one month post injury, and 1.0% met criteria at one year. In the control group, 0% met
the criteria. Using the moderate or greater DSM-IV criteria for the syndrome, 0% of the MTBI
cases met criteria one month post injury, and 1.0% met criteria at one year. None of the controls
met the criteria. There were too few cases of PCD to run statistical analysis. All patients who met
DSM-IV PCD criteria also fulfilled ICD-10 PCS criteria.

Postconcussion Symptom Reporting Trajectory
The natural history of post-concussion symptom reporting from one month to one year
post-injury was examined in each individual MTBI subject (n=101). Of the 58 patients who met
criteria for ICD-10 PCS at one month based on “mild or greater” symptom reporting, 53.4% (31
patients) met and 46.6% (27 patients) did not meet the PCS criteria at one year. Of those 43
patients who did not meet the ICD-10 PCS criteria (“mild or greater” symptom reporting”) at one
month, 16.3% (7 patients) met and 83.7% (36 patients) did not meet the PCS criteria at one year.
Thus, of those who initially met the criteria ICD-10 criteria for PCS (n=58), 46.6% improved and
53.4% remained symptomatic. Of those who did not meet ICD-10 criteria at one month (n=43),
16.3% worsened and met criteria at one year.
Correlates of Post-Concussion Symptom Reporting (Exploratory Analyses)
Descriptive statistics and group comparisons for numerous demographic and injury
variables by ICD-10 PCS groups (e.g., mild or greater vs. moderate or greater) are presented in
Table 3 for exploratory purposes. There were no significant differences for age, sex, or education
across PCS groups at one month or one year post injury. The duration of post-traumatic amnesia
was not related to PCS group membership at one month or one year post injury. Those with
previous head trauma were not more likely to meet PCS criteria at one month or one year. Those
with multiple bodily injuries were more likely to have PCS (based on “mild or greater” symptom
reporting) at one month [χ2(1,124)=5.99, p=.014]. Presence of multiple bodily injuries was not
related to PCS group membership at one month based on “moderate or greater” symptom
reporting or at one year post injury. Those with structural abnormalities on day-of-injury CT or
four-week MRI were not more likely to meet PCS criteria at one month or one year. Post-injury

Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Post-Concussion Symptom Reporting
To examine the relation between self-reported post-concussion symptoms and DTI
measures, the MTBI subsample was divided into four groups based on ICD-10 criteria for PCS:
(a) PCS-Present at one month, mild or greater symptom reporting (n=39), (b) PCS-Absent at one
month, mild or greater symptom reporting (n=32), (c) PCS-Present at one year, mild or greater
symptom reporting (n=18), and (d) PCS-Absent at one year, mild or greater symptom reporting
(n=42).
A multivariate ROI analysis was used to examine the relation between post-concussion
symptoms and DTI measures. This methodology is described in detail by Iverson and
colleagues.89 For these analyses, the 16 ROIs for FA and 10 ROIs for ADC were considered
simultaneously. To examine the prevalence of low (FA) or high (ADC) scores, when all ROIs
were considered simultaneously, a cut-off score for each ROI was set at 1.28 SDs below or
above the mean of control values. The 1.28 SDs below the mean for each FA score for each ROI
was selected as a cutoff score for unusually low FA scores (i.e., 10th percentile) and 1.28 SDs
above the mean for each ADC score for each ROI was selected as a cutoff score for unusually
high ADC scores (i.e., 90th percentile). The 10th and 90th percentiles were selected because the
control sample was relatively small and this would create more variability, and mediate the
effects of possible outliers, in the control sample. The cumulative percentages of the number of
low FA scores and high ADC scores by group are presented in Table 4.

Overall, there were a greater number of low FA scores in the MTBI group compared to
the control group. Chi-square analyses revealed that there was a significantly greater number of
low FA scores when using 2 or more low scores as the criterion [Χ2(1,95) = 12.72, p<.001;
70.4% MTBI, 29.2% controls]. Also, there was a greater number of low FA scores in the MTBI
group when using 3 or more low scores as the criterion [Χ2(1,95) = 4.63, p=.046; 40.9% MTBI,
16.7% controls]. Similarly, there were also a greater number of high ADC scores in the MTBI
group compared to the control group. Chi-square analyses revealed that there was a significantly
greater number of high ADC scores when using 2 or more high scores [Χ2(1,95) = 10.60, p=
.002; 54.9% MTBI, 16.7% controls] and 3 or more high scores [Χ2(1,95) = 7.57, p=.006; 32.4%
MTBI, 4.2% controls] as the criterion. However, there were no significant differences in DTI
measures between those who met ICD-10 criteria for PCS and those who did not meet criteria for
PCS.
To further examine the relation between post-concussion symptoms and DTI measures, a
multifocal abnormal WM group was defined as follows: 4 or more areas of abnormally low FA
values or 3 or more areas of abnormally high ADC values. The broadly normal WM group was
defined as follows: less than 4 areas of abnormally low FA values and less than 3 areas of
abnormally high ADC values. Based on this definition, multifocal abnormal WM was found in
12.5% of the control group (3/24) and 50.7% of the MTBI group (36/71). Patients in the MTBI
group were significantly more likely to show evidence of multifocal diminished white matter
than participants in the control group [X2(1,95)=10.82, p=.001; RR=4.06, 95% CI (1.44-16.01)].
However, the presence of multifocal diminished white matter was not significantly associated
with the presence or absence of ICD-10 PCS (see Table 5).

Multivariable Prediction of ICD-10 Postconcussional Syndrome
Two logistic regression analyses were used to determine the extent to which ICD-10
PCS, based on mild or greater symptom reporting, could be predicted at one month and one year
following injury. To predict PCS at one month post injury, the variables entered into the model
were: (a) pre-injury mental health problems, (b) presence/absence of MRI abnormality, (c)
presence/absence of bodily injuries, (d) one-month BDI-II subscale score, and (e) total number
of low FA scores and high ADC scores on DTI. The only significant predictor of ICD-10 PCS
(mild or greater symptom reporting) was the one-month BDI-II subscale score [p<.001, 95% CI
(1.75-7.20)]. Presence of bodily injuries neared significance (p=.052). The overall classification
rate was 81.7% (74.4% PCS Present, 90.6% PCS Absent; Cox & Snell R2=.397, Nagelkerke
R2=.531).
To predict PCS at one year post injury, the variables entered into the model were: (a) pre-
injury mental health problems, (b) presence/absence of MRI abnormality, (c) presence/absence
of bodily injuries, (d) one-month BDI-II subscale score, (e) one-month RPSQ total score, (f) total
number of low FA scores and high ADC scores on DTI, and (e) one-year BDI-II subscale score.
At one year, only one-month symptom reporting [RPSQ total score, p=.001, 95% CI (1.10-1.48)]
was a significant predictor of ICD-10 PCS (mild or greater symptom reporting). The overall
classification rate was 81.7% (66.7% PCS Present, 88.1% PCS Absent; Cox & Snell R2=.391,
Nagelkerke R2=.555).
Discussion
This study prospectively examined the prevalence of, and factors related to, persistent
postconcussion symptom reporting following MTBI. We hypothesized that patients who
sustained complicated MTBIs would perform more poorly on memory testing and report more

post-concussion symptoms at one month but not one year following injury. Those with
complicated MTBIs did not perform more poorly on memory testing and they did not report
more post-concussion symptoms at one month or one year post injury. Also, patients with longer
periods of post-traumatic amnesia were not more likely to report more post-concussion
symptoms. Thus, our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that patients with greater
injury severity will report more post-concussion symptoms than patients with milder injuries.
To address the second and third hypotheses, we examined whether MTBI patients with
pre-existing mental health problems or current affective symptoms of depression would report
greater post-concussion symptoms than those without pre-injury mental health problems or
current problems with depression. Pre-injury mental health problems54-57 and ongoing problems
with depression57,58,90,91 have been identified as risk factors for slow or incomplete recovery
following MTBI. In fact, it is well established in the literature that people who sustain a MTBI
are at increased risk for developing depression,41,92 with prevalence rates varying from 12% to
44% in the first three months following injury.19,93-97 In this study, the prevalence of pre-injury
mental health problems was low because patients with a known psychiatric history were initially
excluded during recruitment. However, some patients brought up some pre-injury problems with
depression and anxiety in the neuropsychological evaluation only after recruiting them into the
study.
In the current study, and consistent with our second hypothesis and previous
studies,41,92,98 those with a pre-injury history of mental health problems were more likely to have
postconcussion symptoms at one month. At one year follow-up, pre-injury mental health
problems were not significantly associated with postconcussion symptom reporting. We tried to
reduce the overlap between post-concussion symptom reporting and depression symptom

reporting by conducting the analyses with a reduced item set for the BDI-II. Only ten of the 21
symptoms from the BDI-II, believed to have the least overlap with symptoms of MTBI and being
most representative of depression, were selected. As a group, MTBI patients reported more
depressive symptoms at one month post-injury compared to controls. At one year, the groups did
not differ in depression symptom reporting. In support of the third hypothesis, post-concussion-
like symptoms had a significant positive correlation with affective symptoms of depression at
both one month and one year following injury. Similar to previous studies,92,94 our results lend
support to the view that depression should be evaluated as part of the assessment protocol after
MTBI.
In the present study, the MTBI patients were significantly more likely to show multifocal
areas of diminished white matter on DTI compared to control subjects—which is consistent with
our fourth hypothesis. Thus, this study is consistent with many previous studies showing that
patients with MTBIs show differences on DTI relative to controls.for a review see 67,99,100 For the fifth
hypothesis, we predicted that white matter changes would be associated with post-concussion
symptom reporting because some studies have suggested that compromised microstructural
white matter might be associated with increased post-concussion symptom reporting following
MTBI.69,101-104 However, inconsistent with the final hypothesis, those MTBI patients who had
multifocal white matter changes on DTI did not report more symptoms than those with broadly
normal white matter. In other words, the presence of multifocal white matter changes was not
associated with the presence of the persistent post-concussion symptoms. Several published
studies have found a relationship between white matter abnormalities and PCS,68-74 although
some reported no association.46,67,75

excluded most obvious premorbid conditions (substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, previous
moderate-severe brain injuries, developmental cognitive disorders, and other medical conditions
resulting in cognitive changes) to rule out the possible influence of premorbid moderator
variables and to avoid possible bias due to these confounding factors. Furthermore, we ensured
that none of the patients were involved in litigation, and had no financial incentives to exaggerate
their symptoms.
This study has some methodological limitations and issues that should be considered.
First, the majority (96%) of patients in the sample had a GCS of 15 with only a few having a
GCS of 14. Thus, the sample can be considered to be skewed toward the less severe end of injury
severity spectrum in MTBI. Second, the study included age and gender matched community
controls as a comparison group instead of an orthopedically-injured trauma control group. In
general, trauma control subjects are a better and more generalizable control group. Third, self-
reported pain was not examined in the current study. Post-concussion-like symptoms are often
endorsed by patients with chronic pain,37,38 so it is important that pain be taken into account in
future studies. Fourth, the imaging control group was a convenience sample that did not undergo
psychological testing. Using separate comparison groups for outcome measures and imaging is a
weakness that needs to be taken into account when interpreting results. Fifth, the
inclusion/exclusion criteria were very strict and resulted in a slight female majority. For this
study, a total of 2,479 consecutive patients from the ER were screened for inclusion between
October 2006 and May 2009. As expected based on previous literature, the total sample had a
male preponderance (males 1,406, females 1,073). However, applying strict inclusion/exclusion
criteria excluded 94.8% of MTBI patients, leaving only 126 patients in the final sample. Finally,
in this study a cross-sectional, not prospective, design was used for DTI (i.e., subjects were

imaged only once).
In conclusion, the rate at which the post-concussion syndrome is diagnosed varies greatly
based on whether ICD-10 or DSM-IV criteria are used,98,105-107 and whether the researcher or
clinician requires the symptoms to be mild or greater or moderate or greater on the rating scale.
Using ICD-10 criteria and mild or greater symptom reporting, 59% of the MTBI sample met
criteria at one month and 38% met criteria at one year. However, 31% of the healthy control
sample also met criteria for the syndrome—illustrating a high false positive rate. Of those who
met criteria at one month, 47% improved and 53% remained symptomatic at one year. Notably,
of those who did not meet criteria at one month, 16% worsened and met criteria at one year.
Significant predictors of ICD-10 PCS at one month were pre-injury mental health problems and
the presence of extra-cranial bodily injuries. Age, gender, and prior MTBI were not significant
predictors. Being symptomatic at one month was as significant predictor of being symptomatic at
one year, and depression was related to PCS at both one month and one year. Intracranial
abnormalities visible on MRI were present in 12.1% (15/124) of this sample, and multifocal
areas of unusual white matter were present in 50.7% of the subgroup who underwent DTI
(compared to 12.4% of controls). However, these structural MRI abnormalities and
microstructural white matter findings were not associated with greater post-concussion symptom
reporting. Simply put, greater putative damage to the brain was not associated with greater
symptom reporting. Clearly, no simple theory relating to the etiology of post-concussion
symptom reporting following MTBI has strong explanatory value. The manifestation of post-
concussion symptoms likely represents the cumulative effect of multiple variables, such as
genetics, mental health history, current life stress, general medical problems, chronic pain,
depression, and substance abuse. How people report their symptoms also can be influenced by

personality factors and the presence of possible future financial gain (e.g., personal injury

contributes to the persistence of post-concussion (or post-concussion-like) symptoms following
MTBI remains unclear.
