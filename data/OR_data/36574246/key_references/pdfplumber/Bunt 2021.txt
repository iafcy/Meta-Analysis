adults following SRC.
Method: This prospective study is part of the North Texas Concussion Registry (ConTex). Subjects
(N = 332) aged 13 to 25 years who sustained a SRC within 10 days of presenting to clinic were
evaluated at two time points: initial clinical visit and three-month follow-up. Resilience was
measured by the self-report Brief Resilience Survey (BRS) and PCS by the Sport Concussion
Assessment Tool-5 Symptom Evaluation Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS). Recovery was
determined by self-reported return to sports/physical activity and percent back to normal.
Results: Repeated measures ANCOVA and linear regression models showed that lower resilience
ratings at initial visit were associated with a greater number and severity of PCSS symptoms along
with higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during recovery from SRC. At three months,
subjects with lower initial resilience ratings were less likely to report feeling back to normal and
had greater aggravation of symptoms from physical and cognitive activity even when they had
returned to sports/physical activity.
Conclusions: Lower resilience was associated with greater symptoms and delayed recovery from
SRC. Results suggest that resilience may be another important factor to address in recovery from
SRC. Future research is needed to examine the extent to which resilience measured after SRC
reflects pre-injury characteristics and to better inform the development of interventions to pro-
mote resilience during recovery.
