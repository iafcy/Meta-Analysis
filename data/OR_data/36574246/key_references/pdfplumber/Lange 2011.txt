Depression Strongly Influences
Postconcussion Symptom Reporting
Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury
RaelT.Lange,PhD;GrantL.Iverson,PhD;AliceRose,OT
Objective: To examine the influence of depression on postconcussion symptom reporting in patients following
mildtraumaticbraininjury(MTBI).Participants:SixtypatientsreferredtoaspecialtyclinicfollowingMTBI,58

participants.Procedure:ParticipantswithMTBIweredividedinto2subgroupsonthebasisofself-reportedsymp-
toms of depression (23 MTBI-depressed, 37 MTBI-not depressed). All participants completed a postconcussion
symptomquestionnaire.Mainoutcomemeasure:BritishColumbiaPost-concussionSymptomInventory.Results:
There were significant differences in total reported postconcussion symptoms among all 4 groups (all P < .002;
Cohen’sd=0.68–3.24,largetoverylargeeffectsizes;MTBI-depressed>depressedoutpatients>MTBI-node-
pression > healthy controls). There were significant differences in the number of symptoms endorsed (P < .05),
withthehighestnumberofsymptomsendorsedbytheMTBI-depressedgroup,followedbydepressedoutpatients,
MTBI-nodepression,andhealthycontrols.Conclusions:PatientswhoexperienceMTBIsandwhohaveapostin-
