In the USA, the incidence of concussion is reported to be 
between 1.7 and 3.8 million individuals per year; more than 
half of them are children [1]. Recent figures from sports 
injuries alone show that 
the prevalence of concussions 
doubled in the 8–19-year-old age group from 1997 to 2007 
[2] due in most part to increased community awareness and 
subsequent policy changes and new guidelines [3,4]. Children 
are a vulnerable group because of their developing brains and 
susceptibility to prolonged recoveries compared to the adult 
population [5,6,7]. Children also have the potential for many 
injuries over their lifespan especially given that concussion is 
a predictor of future concussions [8,9]. 
Concussion as defined by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) results from a blow or force to the head and consists 
of one or more of the following criteria: loss of consciousness 
for less than 30 minutes, confusion or disorientation, post- 
traumatic amnesia of less than 24 hours and/or transient 
neurological symptoms [10]. There remains a considerable 
lack of agreement in the diagnosis or label of concussioni, 
mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or mild closed head 
injury particularly in children [11,12]. Currently, in clinical 
practice, there is variation in injuries even when a diagnostic 
label is given [11]. 
Recovery from childhood concussion has varied trajectories 
[13,14] and is currently described on the basis of the length of 
symptom presentation: under 1 month, between 1 and 3 months 
and over 3 months. Symptoms of concussion are categorized as 
somatic (e.g., headache and balance issues), emotional (e.g., 
irritability and anxiety), cognitive (e.g., difficulty concentrating 
and remembering) and sleep symptoms [15]. 
Childhood concussive injuries typically resolve in days or 
weeks, but some of these ‘mild’ injuries can have serious and 
prolonged health consequences [16,17]. When symptoms last 
more than 3 months, they can significantly affect the child’s 
everyday life and may intensify emotional or depressive symp- 
toms [18]. Children and adolescents are at higher risk for 
prolonged symptoms after concussion, with 11–30% of chil- 
dren reporting ongoing symptoms at 3 months post injury 
[19,20]. 
While there are frequent references to the risk of devel- 
oping depression after concussion, there is little evidence 
specifically about this result in children. Psychosocial out- 
comes after childhood concussion are beginning to receive 
more attention, as depression in young people profoundly 
affects their participation in school, social and physical activ- 
ities as well as putting youth at risk for suicidal behaviour, 
substance abuse and negative life trajectories [21,22]. The 
prevalence for major depressive disorder in the general 
population is reported to be 1–3% in children [23] and 
increasing in adolescents 
to a 7.5 past-year prevalence 
[24,25]. Girls report depression more than boys beginning 
at 12 years of age and increasing to a 2:1 ratio in later 
adolescence and adulthood [23,26]. Injury or illness increases 
the susceptibility to depression [27,28]. Within the first year 
after concussion, adults demonstrate rates of 15–18% of new 
onset depression [29,30].

ABSTRACT 
Objectives: Although depression can be a serious consequence of concussion, little is known about the 
factors that predict depression and concussion recovery outcomes in children. The purpose of this study 
was to explore the risk and possible predictors of developing significant depressive symptoms in children 
recovering from concussion. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in a paediatric tertiary 
care clinic. Depression data were collected from 92 children using the Children’s Depression Inventory-2 
(CDI-2) screening tool. Correlations, t-tests and logistic regression were used to examine the associations 
between depression scores and demographic as well as injury-related factors. Results: Depressive symp- 
toms were found in 22% of the children (T score on CDI-2 >65). Children with evidence of depressive 
symptomatology had significantly higher mean post-concussive symptom inventory (PCSI) scores in 
recovery (p = 0.004) than children who were not depressed. Variables of i) Sex; ii) hospital admission; iii) 
number of head injuries; iv) post-concussion symptom score and v) experience of prolonged symptoms 
were predictive of clinically significant CDI T scores, explaining 36% of the variation in the binary logistic 
model. Conclusion: Depression is commonly reported in this subset of children. High post-concussive 
symptom scores and hospital admission were strong predictors of depression. Screening for depression 
should be standard practice in concussion management in children and youth.

Recent studies investigating depression after concussion 
in children fall into two categories: 1) those investigating 
the risk of depression based on exposure to concussion and 
2) those investigating depression that occurs shortly after 
from concussion.

increased likelihood of becoming depressed when there is 
a history of concussion or traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
[31,32]. However, studies exploring depression that occurs 
during recovery from concussion are less conclusive in 
determining prevalence. Two prospective studies, the latter 
with an orthopaedic control group, 
found an 11% and 
21.4% incidence of new onset of depression/anxiety in chil- 
dren within 6 months after their injury [33,34]. Both of 
these studies drew their samples from children who were 
hospitalized for mild injuries, which potentially introduces 
selection bias as more severe cases are hospitalized. A recent 
cross-sectional study of post-concussive children aged 7–17 
years examined them 1–3 years post injury for depression 
and post-concussion symptoms [35]. Depression was found 
to be uncommon and was experienced by only 3% of their 
sample [35]. Differences in sample selection and inclusion 
criteria, definitions of concussion, follow-up time and addi- 
tional methodological issues make it difficult to draw sub- 
stantive conclusions about the incidence of depression in 
children recovering from concussion. More studies are 
needed to close the gaps in knowledge or to confirm and 
these preliminary conflicting findings. 
add to some of 
Investigations specifically representing children with con- 
cussion need replication. Studies also need to focus on the 
period of recovery from concussion and to span both child- 
hood and adolescence if we are to fully understand the issue 
of depression in relation to childhood concussion. 

examining the association between 
depression and concussion have identified factors that may 
predict the incidence of depression after concussion. Many 
non-injury-related factors are reported to be associated with 
the onset of depression after concussion: older child, family 
history of anxiety [34], lower socioeconomic status [36] and 
post-injury stress [33]. In addition, many injury-related fac- 
tors in the adult population have been identified as risk 
factors for depression, including multiple brain injuries, num- 
ber and severity of symptoms, mechanism of injury, hospita- 
lization and imaging abnormalities [37–39]. To date, there 
have been very few studies conducted with children. One 
paediatric prospective cohort with orthopaedic controls 
demonstrated that the severity of injury and post-injury stress 
predicted the onset of depression [33]. 
Research determining both the incidence of depression and 
the factors that predict risk for depression after concussion is 
in the early stages. More work needs to be done to understand 
the incidence of depression in children recovering from con- 
cussion and to highlight factors that predict depression in 
children who are 
from concussion. 
Determining the factors that increase the risk for depression 
post concussion can lead to strategies for effective prevention 
and early intervention. 


The purpose of this study is to explore the risk of depres- 
sion in a cohort of children and youth recovering from 
concussion, and to identify predictors of depression during 
the recovery period. It was hypothesized that depression 
would be associated with prolonged recovery from concus- 
sion. It was also hypothesized that there would be gender and 
age differences in depression, with higher rates among ado- 
lescent girls. Finally, it was hypothesized that injury-related 
factors (i.e., number of head injuries, symptom scores and 
hospitalization) would increase 
risk of developing 
depression. 


A prospective cohort study was conducted with children 
recovering from concussion through the acquired brain injury 
(ABI) clinic (n = 477) at a tertiary care children’s hospital. 
This tertiary care centre, located in Southwestern Ontario, 
serves 
a region of approximately 2.3 million people. 
Approximately 45% of referrals to this clinic are received 
from the emergency department and hospital wards, and 
55% are received from community physicians and outlying 
hospitals. This provides a mixture of children who have had 
both acute and complex care needs. 

Due to the interest in depression, a protocol of screening for 
depression was implemented as a pilot project in the ABI 
clinic from April to June 2013 with full implementation to 
consecutively presenting patients from August to December 
2013. Thus, a prospective cohort of 92 consecutive children 
who were newly referred or had follow-up appointments 
scheduled were administered the CDI-2 [40] if they were 
between the ages of 8 and 18 years. Data of those who met 
the following inclusion criteria were included for analysis: 


(2) completion of a CDI-2 [40] 
(3) completion of one or more Post-Concussion Symptom 

*Physicians in this clinical environment used the WHO diag- 
nostic criteria as there is no universally accepted definition of 
concussion. 
Children who had open head injuries, injuries sustained 
from child abuse and those from intoxication were not 
included. Participants were not excluded if they required 
hospitalization or had intracranial lesions or skull fractures. 
The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board approved 
the prospective collection of data from the clinical ABI data- 
base. Consent was covered through this process. 

Upon initial presentation to the ABI follow-up clinic, a thor- 
ough history is obtained and a review of medical records is 
completed by the physician. This interview of parent and 
child collects demographic data, history of the present injury 
and complaints as well as any past injuries and pre-injury data 
including developmental history, school performance and past 
mental health issues. Subsequent follow-up visits to the clinic 
include a review of the medical history and a physical exam- 
ination as well as follow-up interviews in regard to how the 
concussion symptoms are impacting their lives. School per- 
formance is closely monitored, and problems are identified 
through clinical interview. A decrease in academic standing is 
documented when those school difficulties noted post-con- 
cussive injury result in decreased academic marks by more 
than 10%, reduced academic workload or clinician documen- 
ted symptoms of decreased concentration, difficulty coding 
and decoding, reading or studying. 
Parents and children also each independently completed a 
Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) [15] and the 
CDI-2 short version (CDI-2S) [40] at the appointment. The 
PCSI was completed at each clinic appointment from admis- 
sion to discharge, detailing symptoms experienced in the past 
2 days. Data were collected prospectively, and some children 
who were being followed long term had up to three symptom 
evaluations recorded, with time three being the most current 
symptom score. The scores from the CDI-2S were obtained 
every 3 months if children were being followed long term; 
however, it was decided to use only those CDI-2S scores from 
the first administration as there were very few children (4) 
with more than one set of depression scores. Depression data 
were collected over a period of 8 months in 2013. 

The CDI-2 is both a self-report and parent-report measure of 
the extent and severity of depressive symptoms [40]. The 
screening tool (CDI-2S) consists of 12 questions and requires 
one of three response options: the child chooses the statement 
that best describes their feelings or moods in the past 2 weeks. 
Statements represent the range of severity of the symptom 
from 0 (none) to 2 (definite). Scores are totalled, and raw 
scores are converted to T scores. A T score of 65 (1.5 SD 
above the mean) is generally considered to indicate a clinically 
significant level of depressive symptomatology. This screening 
tool has a high correlation with the full-length self-rated form 
(r = 0.95, p < 0.001) and has been validated for use with 
medically ill children [41]. There are three questions dealing 
with depressed mood and irritability, three questions regard- 
ing physical symptoms, one about diminished pleasure, one 
dealing with cognitive symptoms and the rest are about feel- 
ings of low self-esteem, worthlessness and hopelessness. 
The parent measure is a parallel questionnaire that 
includes 17 questions with scores that are grouped into emo- 
tional, functional and total score domains. Again, parents are 
asked to consider the child’s moods and feelings in the past 2 
weeks. 
The Post-Concussion Symptom scale [15] is a symptom 
inventory derived from the original sideline assessment 
developed by the Pittsburgh Steelers of 
the National 
Football League [42]. This clinically driven tool has many 
variants and has been adopted and standardized into such 
tools as the Acute Concussion Evaluation [15], the Sport 
Concussion Assessment Tool [43] and the Immediate Post- 
Concussion and Cognitive Test [44], which is commonly 


used to make return to sport decisions. Most of the variants 
have a 7-point Likert scale to measure intensity of symp- 
toms and others have a yes/no dichotomous scale [45]. It is 
a quick and clinically useful way of 
tracking symptom 
resolution through serial administration over days or 
weeks. The PCSI [15] is one of the variations and lists 22 
concussion symptoms in the domains of physical, cognitive, 
emotional and sleep and has a yes/no dichotomous scale 
[45]. Both children and parents fill in this checklist inde- 
pendently, answering yes (1) or no (0) to whether the child 
has experienced each symptom in the past 3 days. The ‘yes’ 
scores are added for a total score out of 22. The scales are 
valid in measuring change in symptoms over time; however, 
psychometric evidence is stronger for adolescents than 
younger children [46]. 
Symptoms of depression and post concussive symptoms 
are known to overlap; however, these measures actually have 
only two items that are worded similarly: 
irritability and 
fatigue. Sadness and decision-making are also asked about in 
both measures but are worded quite differently. 

Our sample size of 92 is adequate to provide a valid model to 
estimate risk in logistic regression analyses. The value of 10 
events per variable and higher is recommended by Peduzzi 
et al. for both proportional hazards and logistic regression 
analyses [47]. Below this, the statistical model may not be 
valid. We will have one primary outcome (depressive symp- 
toms indicated by a T score >65 on CDI-2S) with five 
predictors. 
For analysis, children were categorized based on the CDI 
T-score of ≥65 (n = 20) indicating depression or <65 (n = 72) 
indicating no depression. Initially, to test for group differ- 
t-tests were conducted on 
ences, chi-square and student 
demographic variables and clinical characteristics. As this 
was an exploratory study, significance was two-tailed and set 
at p ≤ 0.05. Much of the data of interest were not normally 
distributed, not uncommon in brain injury research, so a 
decision was made to use non-parametric statistics for corre- 
lations and regression. Correlations between depression and 
injury and non-injury-related variables were determined using 
Spearman’s Rho. Logistic regression was used to model the 
predictor variables of interest with the primary binary out- 
come: a clinically significant level of depressive symptoms 
either present (‘yes’ T score ≥65; coded 1) or not present 
(‘no’ T score <65; coded 0). Predictor variables were selected 
based on our hypotheses, results from descriptive statistics 
and univariate analysis using binary logistic regression. The 
selected variables were subjected to linear regression analysis 
to test for collinearity. The data did not violate the multi- 
collinearity assumption with variance inflation factors well 
below the cut-off of 10 (range from 1.29 to 2.36). A combina- 
tion of forward and backward selection was used for model 
fitting using the most significant candidate covariates and 
then eliminating those with p values over 0.6 [47]. All data 
analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, 
Version 22.0 [48]. 



The study sample consisted of 92 children aged 7–18 years 
included 56 girls and 36 boys with a mean age of 15 years ± 2.5. 
Depression screens were administered a median of 3.7 months (2 
weeks–35 months) after injury (see Table 1). PCSI scores were 
obtained a mean of 9.2 weeks for Time 1 at their initial clinic 
appointment, 5.6 months for Time 2 and 8.5 months for Time 3. 
Information on demographic and clinical characteristics by out- 
comes is presented in Table 2. Although 30% of the children were 
hospitalized, the majority for 24 hours, there were seven children 
who required longer admissions due to musculoskeletal, spinal 
and/or facial injuries (2–14 days). The study sample of 92 children 
differed from the larger dataset of 477 children followed in the ABI 
clinic in a few ways: there were more girls in our subset (64% 
compared with 44%); the PCSI means were higher in girls (9.91 vs. 
8.26), and 70% of the 92 children had symptoms for 3 months or 
more compared to only 52% in the larger dataset. 

In comparing children classified as depressed versus non- 
depressed (chi-Square analysis; χ2), there were no significant

differences in age (p = 0.85), sex (p = 0.79), premorbid history 
of learning issues (p = 0.61) or premorbid history of mental 
health issues (p = 0.90). Significant differences, however, were 
noted in decreased academic standing after concussion (χ2 = 
4.6, df = 1, p = 0.03) as well as in persistence of concussion 
symptoms (>3 months duration) (χ2 = 6.3, df = 1, p = 0.01). 
Children with depression were less likely to be succeeding in 
school after concussion. Prior to their injury, 7.6% of children 
had documented learning issues, whereas, after injury, 53% 
reported a decrease in school performance. 
Correlational analysis using Spearman’s Rho for categorical 
variables (see Table 3) showed strong positive associations 
between depression scores (yes/no) and persistence of con- 
cussion symptoms (yes/no) over 3 months (r = 0.483, p < 
0.01), and between depression scores and decrease in aca- 
demic standing (r = 0.431, p < 0.01). 

In comparing children classified as depressed versus not 
depressed, chi-square analysis showed no significant differ- 
ences in reports of multiple head injuries (p = 0.46), cause of 
injury (p = 0.35), computerized tomography abnormalities (p 
= 0.67) or hospital admissions (p = 0.67). Significant differ- 
ences were, however, found in the number of concussion 
symptoms as reported on the PCSI. Children with depression 
had higher initial clinic PCSI mean scores (p = 0.004) and 
higher PSCI scores reported on the third clinic visit (p = 
0.041). Length of hospital stay was also found to be signifi- 
cantly higher in children who were subsequently classified as 
depressed (T score > 65 on the CDI-2-S) (p = 0.003).

concussion symptoms reported on the PCSI-Time 1 (r = 
0.442, p < 0.01) and Time 3 (r = 0.602, p < 0.01) indicating 
a linear relationship. 
Logistic regression results 
The results of the logistic regression analysis show that the full 
model using the five independent variables of gender, number of 
concussions, admission to hospital, PCSI Time 1 score and 
experiencing symptoms over 3 months was significant (Χ2 (5) 
= 18.55, n = 71, p < 0.002). This means that the odds for children 
to have a positive depression score at a mean time of 6 months 
after concussion is associated with these five variables (see 
Table 3). The model correctly classifies 81.7% of cases. The 
Nagelkerke R-squared value of 0.357 indicates the model fits 
the data well. Table 3 presents the standardized coefficient 
beta, Wald statistic and significance as well as the odds ratios 
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals for the variables in the 
model. The strongest predictors in the model were high PCSI 
scores (standardized coefficient beta = 0.278, p = 0.009) and 
admission to hospital (standardized coefficient beta = 2.464, p 
= 0.030). Admission to hospital with an OR of 11.75 means that 
the odds that a child had a high depression score (T ≥65) 
increased by a factor of 11 if the child was admitted to hospital 
compared to those who were not admitted. The OR for early 
PCSI is 1.32, which indicates that for every one point increase in 
symptom scores (1 additional symptom), the odds of being 
depressed increase by a factor of 1.32. 
Length of hospital stay was a variable that could not be 
used in the multivariate model because of the potential for 
over-fitting due to the small sample as only seven children 
had a stay over 24 hours. We did a univariate analysis using 
length of hospital stay to predict depression and found it to be 
significant Χ2 = 8.06, p < 0.005 (standardized coefficient beta 
= 0.447, p = 0.033). This single variable increased classifica- 
tion accuracy by 17% and has an OR of 1.56 indicating that 
for every extra day of stay in hospital, the likelihood of 
depression increased by a factor of 1.5. 

In this prospective cohort of children and youth with concus- 
sion, we found the incidence of depression to be above that 
found in community samples cited in the literature and in 
standardized tests, which report a prevalence of 8–11% in this 
age group [24,25,49]. Twenty-two per cent of children self- 
reported significant depressive symptomatology, an average of 
6 months following their injury. Youth in our study did report 
some premorbid histories of headache/migraine (9%), learn- 
ing issues (7%) and mental health issues (7.5%); yet, none of 
these were significantly associated with ratings of post-con- 
cussion depression. Five predictors, sex, number of concus- 
sions, admission to hospital, PCSI score and experiencing 
prolonged symptoms explained 36% of the variance in depres- 
sion scores. 
Our prevalence of 22% is congruent with other published 
studies that report an increase in depression after mild-to- 
moderate TBI ranging from 11% to 26% [34,33] as well as 
findings of depression in other chronic medical conditions 


including chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, epi- 
lepsy and soft tissue injuries [28,50]. Our sample had a higher 
representation of girls who reported more symptoms than the 
larger dataset and 70% of the sample reported ongoing symp- 
toms over 3 months. Girls are known to be at greater risk for 
more symptoms, neurocognitive changes and prolonged 
recovery [51,52]. It may be that the chronicity of symptoms 
experienced by the youths in this study contributed to the 
prevalence of depressive symptoms. 
The findings of increased rates of depression after concus- 
sion are contradicted by a recent study conducted by Smyth 
et al. [35] who evaluated depression and pre-injury life stres- 
sors 1–3 years after injury and found only 3% of their sample 
had depression. Although this was also a concussion cohort, 
differences between the samples such as numbers of children 
admitted to hospital, sex distribution and the differences in 
timing of the depression evaluation (1–3 years after injury) in 
addition to the cross-sectional study design may explain the 
disparate results. 
Other factors frequently hypothesized to be associated with 
depression including age, sex, cause of injury and the total num- 
ber of head injuries had no significant relationship individually 
with depression in this study. These results were curious as sex in 
the general population of depressed adolescents has distinct dif- 
ferences with a 2:1 ratio of girls to boys into adolescence and 
adulthood [23,50]. Covassin, Elbin, Larson and Kontos also found 
no sex differences on depression scores after concussion in high 
school and collegiate athletes [53]. It is unclear whether there is a 
mediating effect of concussion in boys that equalizes the depres- 
sion outcome between the sexes. Rates of depression in adoles- 
cents are known to be double those seen in younger children 
[54,55], yet our results were insignificant for age. This sample, 
however, had only twenty children in the 7–12 age group, which 
may have resulted in a type II error with not enough statistical 
power to show a true difference. 
Evidence has also shown an association between multiple 
concussions and self-reported depression in retired adult football 
players [37]. Our data did not reflect these findings in children. 
Multiple concussions have been shown to predict prolonged 
symptoms, and time between concussions is a factor in recovery 
[56]. Neither prolonged symptoms nor depression was associated 
with multiple concussions in our data. Although 40% of the 
sample had two or more concussions, a larger sample size may 
have had the power to detect differences especially in the small 
groups of children with three, four and five injuries. 
Although the study findings contribute to debate in the litera- 
ture about the mechanism of the development of post-concussion 
depression, there are no clear causal relationships. On the one 
hand, damage to the brain, combined with other biological vul- 
nerabilities (inherited traits of learning disabilities, temperament, 
etc.) is thought to provide a neurobiological susceptibility to 
depression [57]; on the other hand, stress (loss of meaningful 
activity, trauma, and family factors) can also influence the devel- 
opment of depression [58]. In our study, admission to hospital and 
length of stay increased the likelihood of showing elevated depres- 
sive symptoms in the first year after a concussive injury; however, 
this by itself is not conclusive. Although hospitalized youth may 
represent a subset of children who have a more severe injury, 
tentatively providing support to a neurobiological process leading 
to depression outcomes [59], hospitalization itself is very stressful 
which may trigger more anxiety and depression from environ- 
mental factors and explain the higher rates of depression after 
concussion found in studies using hospitalized samples [33,34]. In 
fact, our sample showed that most of the children were hospita- 
lized for longer periods because of other injuries in addition to the 
concussion (spinal, musculoskeletal, etc.). These injuries them- 
selves would be very stressful and lead to loss and uncertainty, 
which has been associated with depression. Other factors asso- 
ciated with a high depression score in our data were academic 
difficulties and experiencing symptoms over 3 months in dura- 
tion, which both create a great amount of stress in the youth. 
One of the most stressful activities post concussion is 
returning to school [60]. Thirty per cent of children recover- 
ing from concussion have reported school absence and drop- 
ping grades [61,62]. We found a significant relationship 
between a decrease in academic standing and depression 
scores. Our assessment of declining academic performance, 
while not objective, does capture parent and child perception 
of post-concussive school problems, and these findings as well 
as prolonged school absence may indicate that the child is 
depressed or at risk for becoming depressed. On the other 
hand, depression could very well precede a decrease in aca- 
demic standing. Although the direction of this relationship 
remains unclear, school performance is worthy of attention 
for signalling potential poor outcomes. 
Prolonged recovery from concussion was also moderately 
associated with depression in our sample and in our depres- 
sion prediction model, a child with symptoms over 3 months 
had a 1.2-fold increased odds of being depressed even when 
accounting for all other variables. 
Significant depressive symptoms can predispose youth to 
depression in subsequent years and later into adulthood [63]. 
Once a depressive episode has resolved, deficits in academics 
and social relationships remain making the developmental cost 
of depression in childhood and adolescence very high [21]. It is 
therefore vital to identify those children who may be susceptible to 
depression early in their recovery post concussion. Based on our 
results, we recommend that screening for depression in this vul- 
nerable population should be a regular part of follow up, particu- 
larly for those who are admitted to hospital, have high symptom 
scores, experience protracted symptoms or are experiencing aca- 
demic failure. Because we were unable to follow all children from 
inception, 
timing of depressive symptoms is an unknown. 
Longitudinal studies in adults have reported depression diagnosis 
early after injury [29,64]. In our study, significant depressive 
symptoms were reported at a mean of 6 months after injury, 
which may not represent the natural history of onset. Screening 
for depression should occur in the first weeks to months post 
concussion with further research needed to determine the optimal 
time period. Early identification might lead to timely provision of 
management strategies to prevent the effects of depression. 

limitations to this study. This research 
There are several 
would have benefitted from a non-specific injury control 
group to determine if the cause of depressive symptoms was 
the concussion or the process of being injured in another way. 
Our subset of data did differ from the larger dataset as 70% of 
the sub-sample had symptoms more than 3 months after their 
injury compared to 52% in the larger dataset, which suggests that 
this subset of children seems to have more complex recovery 
patterns than previously seen. This is most likely a reflection of 
the increasingly specialized nature of the clinic attracting more 
complex referrals and may have inflated depression rates. Referral 
bias may also have been introduced due to the tertiary nature of 
this clinic. Although referrals were from a variety of sources, 
50–60% were from other hospitals and community physicians, 
which suggests that these children may have been more chronic in 
their recovery patterns when referred. As a result of these factors 
and higher rates of girls and sport-related injuries, this sample may 
not be representative of concussions in the general population of 
the 8–18-year-old age group. However, the sample does include 
the spectrum of concussion recovery trajectories and provided a 
unique opportunity to examine a protracted symptom group. The 
clinical nature of the database resulted in some inconsistencies in 
data collection as children did not return for follow-up or infor- 
mation was not obtained, which means there were missing data 
over time. This may have resulted in a lack of power to detect 
difference between those with depression scores and those without 
and also may have limited the model building in predicting 
depression. 

Depression in the first year after childhood concussion is not a 
rare occurrence. Prevalence of depression during concussion 
recovery could be up to 2–4 times greater than that reported for 
childhood depression in published population data. This study 
adds to the knowledge regarding the risk of depression in youth 
recovering from concussion and some of the factors that play a 
role in increasing that risk. Children with a history including 
admission to hospital, high initial symptom scores and prolonged 
symptoms over 3 months should be followed closely with vigilance 
for the development of depressive symptoms.
