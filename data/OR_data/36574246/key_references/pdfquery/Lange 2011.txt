Depression Strongly Inﬂuences 
Postconcussion Symptom Reporting 
Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury 

Objective: To examine the inﬂuence of depression on postconcussion symptom reporting in patients following 
mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Participants: Sixty patients referred to a specialty clinic following MTBI, 58 
outpatients with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-diagnosed depression, and 72 healthy community control 
participants. Procedure: Participants with MTBI were divided into 2 subgroups on the basis of self-reported symp- 
toms of depression (23 MTBI-depressed, 37 MTBI-not depressed). All participants completed a postconcussion 
symptom questionnaire. Main outcome measure: British Columbia Post-concussion Symptom Inventory. Results: 
There were signiﬁcant differences in total reported postconcussion symptoms among all 4 groups (all P < .002; 
Cohen’s d = 0.68–3.24, large to very large effect sizes; MTBI-depressed > depressed outpatients > MTBI-no de- 
pression > healthy controls). There were signiﬁcant differences in the number of symptoms endorsed (P < .05), 
with the highest number of symptoms endorsed by the MTBI-depressed group, followed by depressed outpatients, 
MTBI-no depression, and healthy controls. Conclusions: Patients who experience MTBIs and who have a postin- 
jury recovery course complicated by signiﬁcant depression report more postconcussion symptoms, and more severe 
symptoms, than (a) outpatients with depression, and (b) patients with MTBIs who do not have signiﬁcant symptoms 
of depression. Keywords: depression, mild traumatic brain injury, postconcussion symptoms 

imaging studies have not clearly established a causal 
link between persistent postconcussion symptoms and 
acquired brain damage following mild traumatic brain 
injury (MTBI).1–4 Moreover, researchers have identi- 
ﬁed many other factors that can cause, maintain, or 
worsen postconcussion symptom reporting. A number 
of studies have clearly demonstrated that postconcus- 
sion symptoms are not speciﬁc to MTBI and are com- 
monly reported in healthy adults5–7 and in various clin- 
ical groups who have not sustained an injury to the 
brain.8–13 Similarly, postconcussion symptom reporting 
is believed to be associated with premorbid personal- 
ity characteristics14–16 and is greatly inﬂuenced by the 
method by which the clinician elicits and documents

In addition, a number of social-psychological factors 
are believed to inﬂuence postconcussion symptom re- 
porting, such as the nocebo effect,18 “expectation as 
etiology,”6,19,20 “diagnosis threat,”21,22 and “good old 
days” bias.19,23 As such, when considering a diagnosis 
of postconcussion syndrome, it is imperative for clini- 
cians to systematically evaluate and eliminate the possi- 
ble contribution of many different factors that may cause 
or maintain self-reported symptoms following MTBI 
(see Iverson and colleagues24,25 for a more complete 
discussion). 
One of the most clinically pervasive, and perplexing, 
differential diagnoses for the postconcussion syndrome 
is depression.26,27 Depression is common following trau- 
matic brain injuries of all severities28,29 and can have 
multiple causes. Theoretically, it can relate to the neuro- 
biological consequences of the injury, psychosocial fac- 
tors, or both. Conceptually and theoretically, a depres- 
sion spectrum disorder following MTBI, whether caused 
by neurobiological factors, psychosocial factors, or both, 
could be one type of postconcussion syndrome (if we 
assume that the syndrome can arise from different and 
interacting causes). Depression can also arise de novo, 
because of a combination of genetic predisposition and 
adverse life events, at some point following an MTBI. 
There are 4 primary reasons why depression repre- 
sents one of the most challenging differential diagnoses 
for the postconcussion syndrome. First, many of the 









diagnostic symptoms of depression, and other prob- 
lems associated with this condition, are similar to the 
current deﬁnition of postconcussion syndrome. The diag- 
nostic criteria for major depression include diminished 
ability to think or concentrate, indecisiveness, fatigue or 
loss of energy, and sleep problems.30(p327) In addition, 
major depression often is associated with irritability, ex- 
cessive worry over one’s health, and headaches.30(p323) 
Common lifestyle and psychosocial problems include 
strained social relationships, marital and family distress, 
occupational problems, academic problems, and sub- 
stance abuse.30(p323) Therefore, it can be extremely difﬁ- 
cult to determine whether a person’s self-reported symp- 
toms are due to depression, a persistent postconcussion 
syndrome, or both, because of the considerable symp- 
tom overlap in these conditions. 
Second, depression is common with conditions that 
often coexist with MTBI. Cooccurring conditions may 
be physical injuries that are secondary to the MTBI it- 
self (eg, soft-tissue or orthopedic injuries), psychologi- 
cal consequences of the injury experience (eg, posttrau- 
matic stress disorder), or they may exist premorbidly 
(eg, substance abuse). Researchers have reported that de- 
pression is common in patients with chronic pain,31,32 
general trauma,33 chronic headaches34,35 posttraumatic 
stress disorder,36,37 and substance abuse problems.38,39 
Therefore, the underlying cause of depression in the pres- 
ence of these comorbidities can be very difﬁcult, if not 
impossible, to determine. 
Third, depression is one of the most common mental 
health problems in the world. The average age of onset 
is in the mid-20s, with an estimated lifetime risk in com- 
munity samples ranging from 10% to 25% for women 
and 5% to 12% for men.40–44 A single episode of major 
depression places an individual at greatly increased risk 
for a future episode, with estimates of recurrence rang- 
ing from 50% to 80%.42,45–48 People who have had 2 or 
more episodes of depression are at extremely high risk 
for a future episode.45 Therefore, the underlying cause 
of depression, in any given person at any given time, can 
be very difﬁcult, if not impossible, to determine. 
Fourth, patients with depression are expected to have 
cognitive complaints. Perceived cognitive impairment is 
a cardinal feature of depression.49,50–52 Researchers have 
also reported that patients with depression perform more 
poorly on neuropsychological testing.53 However, to our 
knowledge, no study has shown that the cognitive effects 
of depression can be accurately differentiated from the 
cognitive effects of an MTBI. The problem for clinicians 
and researchers is that a person with depression is virtu- 
ally guaranteed to meet diagnostic criteria (ie, symptom 
complaint criteria) for a postconcussion syndrome,54 re- 
gardless of whether that person (a) has ever injured his 
or her brain or (b) a past brain injury is causally related 
to his or her current symptoms. 
The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to try to 
isolate and examine the depressive experience in a co- 
hort of patients following MTBI by comparing MTBI 
patients with and without depression to depressed out- 
patients and healthy controls. It was hypothesized that 
both MTBI and depression would be associated with 
high levels of postconcussion-like symptom reporting; 
however, depression would have a more signiﬁcant im- 
pact on symptom reporting than MTBI alone. More 
speciﬁcally, it was hypothesized that (i) patients with 
MTBIs with and without depression would report more 
symptoms than healthy controls; (ii) MTBI patients with 
depression would report more postconcussion symp- 
toms than MTBI patients without depression; (iii) de- 
pressed outpatients would report more symptoms than 
healthy controls and MTBI patients without depression; 
and (iv) symptom reporting between MTBI with depres- 
sion and depressed outpatients would be comparable. 


Participants were 190 community-dwelling adults 
from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. They com- 
posed 3 groups: individuals with MTBI (n = 60), outpa- 
tients with depression (n = 58), and healthy community 
controls (n = 72). 
The participants in the MTBI sample (60.0% male) 
were selected from a larger sample of 110 consecutive 
referrals (January 2007 to September 2009) to a specialty 
clinic at GF Strong Rehab Center, Vancouver, British 
Columbia, Canada. This is a hospital-based “early inter- 
vention” clinic designed to provide educational services 
regarding the expected symptoms and recovery trajec- 
tory following a traumatic brain injury (primarily MTBI). 
Patients were included in the sample if (a) they had sus- 
tained a MTBI (88.1% of total sample), (b) English was 
their ﬁrst language, or they had sufﬁcient English ﬂuency 
to complete the interview and questionnaires (97.3% 
of total sample), (c) they had been evaluated within 8 
months of injury (98.2% of total sample), and (d) could 
be placed into 1 of 2 depression classiﬁcations outlined 
below (64.5% of total sample). A total of 60 patients met 
all criteria. For many patients, complete medical records 
were not available for review. For these patients, classi- 
ﬁcation of MTBI was based on (a) self-reported loss of 
consciousness (LOC) and posttraumatic amnesia (PTA), 
and (b) self-reported injury information (eg, witnessed 
LOC, mechanism of injury). 
The mean age and education of the MTBI sample 
was 36.0 years (SD = 13.1) and 14.2 years (SD = 1.9), 
respectively. Ethnicity of the sample was predominantly 
white (76.7%), with 10.0% Asian, 3.3% East Indian, 
1.7% Canadian aboriginal, and 8.4% of other ethnic 
origins. The breakdown regarding LOC and PTA was as 






follows: LOC: 83.3% positive, 8.3% negative, and 8.3% 
equivocal; PTA: 76.7% positive, 20.9% negative, and 
3.3% equivocal. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores 
were not available for half of the patients (53.3%). Of 
the remaining sample, GCS = 15 (11.7%), GCS = 14 
(30.0%), and GCS = 13 (5.0%). Day-of-injury CT scan 
intracranial abnormalities: 36.7% negative, 25.0% posi- 
tive, 38.3% no CT scan undertaken at the time of injury. 
All patients were evaluated within 8 months following 
their injury (M = 51.8 days, SD = 61.1, range = 2– 
250 days). The breakdown of time post injury prior to 
evaluation was as follows: 0 to 1 month = 53.3%, 1 to 
2 months = 25.0%, 2 to 3 months = 8.3%, and 3 or 
more months = 13.3%. 
The 58 outpatients with depression were initially di- 
agnosed and then referred by their psychiatrist or family 
physician. They were then administered the Structured 
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). The SCID-I 
is a semistructured clinical interview used to establish 
DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses. The version of the SCID- 
I used in this study was the nonpatient research ver- 
sion 2.0, August 1998 revision.26 All patients in the 
“depressed” group had an SCID diagnosis of major de- 
pressive disorder (92%), dysthymic disorder (5%), or de- 
pressive disorder NOS (3%). The diagnoses of the clini- 
cians (ie, family physician or psychiatrist) corresponded 
to the diagnoses derived from the SCID-I interview the 
majority of the time. Speciﬁcally, the clinicians and the 
SCID raters agreed on a diagnosis of major depressive 
disorder in 81% of the cases. The clinicians diagnosed 
dysthymic disorder in 8 patients, but the SCID rater 
diagnosed major depressive disorder in 7 of these. In 3 
instances, the SCID rater diagnosed dysthymic disorder, 
but the clinician diagnosed major depressive disorder in 
2 of these cases. Thus, in approximately 18% of the pa- 
tients, there was diagnostic disagreement between the 
SCID rater and the clinician. Nonetheless, all patients 
were diagnosed independently by both a physician and 
the SCID examiner as having a depressive disorder. Thir- 
teen of the 58 patients reported a history of concussion 
or traumatic brain injury with LOC at some point in 
their lives. There was no signiﬁcant difference on the to- 
tal score derived from the postconcussion scale between 
those with (M = 22.5, SD = 12.6) and those without 
(M = 20.5, SD = 10.2) a history of self-reported concus- 
sion (P < .55). Therefore, to increase the heterogeneity 
and generalizability of the sample, these subjects were 
retained. This patient sample has also been used in a 
previous study.23 
The healthy control group consisted of 72 adult par- 
ticipants in a study conducted in the community as part 
of a clinical trial in psychiatry (age: M = 49.9, SD = 11.7; 
education: M = 14.6, SD = 2.8; 59.5% female). These 
participants were screened for mental health, substance 
abuse, or neurological problems through the use of ques- 


tionnaires and by administering the SCID. This control 
sample has also been used in previous studies.5,25,55 

The British Columbia Post-concussion Symptom 
Inventory25 (BC-PSI) is a 16-item measure designed 
to assess the presence and severity of postconcussion 
symptoms.56 The BC-PSI is based on International Clas- 
siﬁcation of Diseases-10 (ICD-10)45 criteria for post- 
concussional syndrome and requires the test taker to 
rate the frequency and intensity of 13 symptoms (ie, 
headaches, dizziness/light-headedness, nausea or feel- 
ing sick, fatigue, sensitivity to noises, irritability, sadness, 
nervousness/tension, temper problems, poor concentra- 
tion, memory problems, reading difﬁculty, and sleep dis- 
turbance) as well as the effect of 3 co-occurring life prob- 
lems on daily living (ie, greater present vs past effects of 
alcohol consumption, worrying and dwelling on symp- 
toms, and self-perception of brain damage). The 3 life 
problems are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = “not 
at all” and 5 = “very much.” The 13 symptoms are rated 
on a 6-point Likert-type rating scale that measures the 
frequency (ie, “how often”) and intensity (“how bad”) 
of each symptom in the past 2 weeks. Frequency rat- 
ings range from 0 (not at all) to 5 (constantly). Intensity 
ratings range from 0 (not at all) to 5 (very severe prob- 
lem). To score the BC-PSI, the 2 ratings are multiplied 
together (how often × how bad) to create a single score 
for each item. These product-based scores are then con- 
verted to item scores that reﬂect both the frequency and 
intensity of symptom endorsement (range = 0–4). The 
participants’ ratings of the 13 symptoms were the focus 
of this study. Item scores on the 13 individual symptoms 
range from 0 to 4. Item scores of 1 or more are classiﬁed 
as symptoms endorsed at a “mild level or greater.” Item 
scores of 3 or more are classiﬁed as symptoms endorsed 
at a “moderate level or greater.” Total scores are obtained 
by summing the scores on the 13 individual symptoms 
(range = 0–52). 
The British Columbia Major Depression Inventory– 
Second Edition57 (BC-MDI-II) is a 19-item question- 
naire patterned speciﬁcally after the DSM-IV for major 
depressive disorder. The BC-MDI was designed to be 
more sensitive to the evaluation of clinically signiﬁcant 
symptoms of major depression than other depression in- 
ventories, because of its ability to assess not only for the 
presence and severity of depressive symptoms but also 
their impact on a person’s everyday life. This feature 
is critical to the evaluation of major depressive disor- 
der because an essential DSM-IV criterion for assigning 
the diagnosis is evidence of disruption in daily activi- 
ties as a consequence of depressive symptoms. The ﬁrst 
16 items of the BC-MDI-II are rated on a 5-point (1–5) 
Likert-type rating scale that measures the severity (“how

3 items measure the impact of these symptoms and 
problems on day-to-day life with regard to (a) their ef- 
fectiveness at work or school, (b) family relationships 
and responsibilities, and (c) social life and recreational 
activities. 

The MTBI group was divided into 2 depression sub- 
groups (23 MTBI-depressed, 37 MTBI-no depression) 
based on selected items from the BC-MDI-II.∗ These 
items were considered hallmark symptoms of depres- 
sion that were least likely to overlap with postconcussion 
symptoms: (a) Sadness (“I feel sad, down in the dumps, 
and or blue; nearly every day”), (b) Guilt (“I am bur- 
dened by guilt”), (c) Worthlessness (“I feel worthless or 
useless”), (d) Thoughts of dying (“I often thinking about 
dying; most days”), and (e) Suicide (“I think about killing 
myself ”). Patients were classiﬁed in the MTBI-no depres- 
sion group if they met either of these 2 criteria: (a) all 
5 symptoms were reported as absent, or (b) scores on 
Sadness < 2 (very mild problem) and guilt < 3 (mild 
problem) and worthlessness < 3 and thoughts of dying 
< 2 and Suicide = absent. Patients were classiﬁed in the 
MTBI-depressed group if they met any of these 4 crite- 
ria: (1) score of 4 (severe problem) or greater on sadness, 
(2) score of 3 (moderate problem) or greater on sadness 
∗It would have been our preference to classify these groups using the 
SCID. However, the SCID was not administered to the MTBI group. 
and score of 3 or greater on 2 remaining symptoms, (3) 
score of 2 (mild problem) or greater on sadness and score 
of 2 or greater on 3 remaining symptoms, or (4) score 
of 3 or greater on sadness and score of 3 or greater on 
1 remaining symptom. In other words, patients in this 
group needed to endorse a signiﬁcant problem with sad- 
ness and other core depressive symptoms. Patients who 
did not ﬁt these subgroup criteria were not included in 
the ﬁnal sample (35.5% of consecutive sample).∗ 


Demographic characteristics for the 4 groups are pre- 
sented in Table 1. There were signiﬁcant main effects 
across the 4 groups for age (F = 13.930, P < .001) and 
gender (χ 2 = 12.411, P = .006), but not for education 
(F = 0.411, P = .745). The Tukey post hoc analy- 
ses revealed that the healthy control group was signif- 
icantly older than the other 3 groups (P < .001 for 
all comparisons). There were no signiﬁcant differences 
∗The mean BC-PSI total score for this excluded group was 27.9 (SD = 
9.3). This is signiﬁcantly greater (ie, Mann Whitney U tests) than the 
control group without depression (P < .001, d = 4.70) and the MTBI- 
no depression group (P < .001, d = 1.11). However, there was no 
signiﬁcant difference between this group and the depressed outpatients 
(P = .056, d = 0.55) or the MTBI-depression group (P = .166, d = 
0.34). It is notable, however, that this excluded group had average BC- 
PSI total scores that were in between the depressed outpatient sample 
and the MTBI depressed group.

in age between the remaining groups. For gender, the 
MTBI-no depression group had a signiﬁcantly higher 
proportion of men than both the depressed outpatient 
(χ 2 = 11.640, P < .001) and the healthy control group 
(χ 2 = 5.262, P = .022). There were no other signiﬁcant 
group differences with respect to gender. 
Given the known inﬂuence of some demographic vari- 
ables on postconcussion symptom reporting,26,27 the 
inﬂuence of age and gender on symptom reporting 
was examined in each group separately using Pearson 
product-moment correlations (for age) and analysis of 
variance (for gender). There were no signiﬁcant corre- 
lations between postconcussion symptoms (ie, BC-PSI 
total scores) and age in all 4 groups: healthy controls 
(r = −0.19, P = .118); depressed outpatients (r = −0.20, 
P = .125); MTBI-depressed (r = 0.28, P = .197); MTBI- 
no depression (r = 0.21, P = .207). Similarly, there were 
no signiﬁcant differences in postconcussion symptoms 
by gender in all 4 groups: healthy controls (F = 1.774, 
P = .187); depressed outpatients (F = 0.091, P = .764); 
MTBI-depression (F = 0.115, P = .737); MTBI-no de- 
pression (F = 0.643, P = .428). 
Injury severity characteristics for the MTBI-depressed 
and MTBI-no depression groups are also presented in 
Table 1. There were no signiﬁcant differences between 
the MTBI-depressed and MTBI-no depression groups 
for days tested postinjury (P = .145), ethnicity (P = 
.582), presence of LOC (P = .426), presence of PTA 
(P = .127), mechanism of injury (P = .168), or the pres- 
ence of intracranial abnormalities on day-of-injury CT 
scans (P = .452; although there was a notable difference 
in percentages with abnormal scans: MTBI-no depres- 
sion = 36.7% vs MTBI-depressed = 20.0%). Compar- 
isons for GCS score were not undertaken because of the 
large amount of missing data (53.3% of sample with no 
GCS scores). 

Descriptive statistics, group comparisons (nonpara- 
metric due to nonnormal distributions), and Cohen’s 
effect sizes for the BC-PSI total score across all groups 
are presented in Figure 1. There were signiﬁcant main 
effects across the 4 groups for the BC-PSI total score 
(Kruskal-Wallis H test; χ 2 = 125.274, P < .001). Post 
hoc analyses (using Mann-Whitney U tests) revealed 
signiﬁcant differences (all P < .002) and large to very 
large effect sizes (range, d = 0.68–3.24) for all group 
comparisons. The highest total score was found for the 
MTBI-depressed group, followed by the depressed out- 
patient, MTBI-no depression, and healthy control group 
(ie, MTBI-depressed > depressed outpatients > MTBI- 
no depression > healthy controls).

13 individual symptoms as “mild or greater” (ie, item

Table 2.∗ Overall, the MTBI-depressed group had the 
highest rates of symptom endorsement (mild and mod- 
erate), followed by the depressed outpatients, MTBI-no 
depression, and healthy control group.† For exam- 
ple, the range of speciﬁc endorsement rates of symp- 
toms at a mild level or greater was as follows: MTBI- 
depressed group (65.2%–95.7%), depressed outpatient 
(34.5%–93.1%), MTBI-no depression (24.3%–70.3%), 
and healthy control (1.4%–23.6%). 
The percentages of participants with BC-PSI total 
scores of 10 points or higher and 15 points or higher were 
calculated and compared. A score of 10 points or greater, 
and 15 points or greater, are considered to be “unusu- 
ally high” and “extremely high,” respectively, compared 
with those for healthy adults.25 Chi-square analyses were 
used to compare the proportion of patients in each group 
whose BC-PSI total scores were classiﬁed into these 2 to- 
tal score classiﬁcation ranges. There were signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences in the proportion of patients with total scores 
of 10 points or higher for all 6 group comparisons (all 
P < .05), with the exception of the comparison between 
∗These cutoff scores were used to be consistent with previous research 
using the BC-PSI and to maximize comparability between studies. 
†Data for the 13 individual items have been included for descriptive 
purposes only. Formal statistical comparisons (χ 2 analyses) for the 
individual items were not undertaken because of the large number 
of comparisons required for 13 variables and 4 groups. Chi-square 
analysis results are reported only for the BC-PSI total scores. 
MTBI-depressed and depressed outpatients (Fisher ex- 
act test: P = .682). The MTBI-depressed (95.7%) and 
depressed outpatient group (94.8%) had the highest pro- 
portion of patients with scores in this range, followed by 
the MTBI-no depression (62.2%) and healthy control 
group (8.3%). Similarly, for BC-PSI total scores of 15 
points of higher, there were signiﬁcant differences for 
all 6-group comparisons (all P < .05), with the excep- 
tion of the comparison between the MTBI-depressed 
and depressed outpatient group (Fisher exact test: P = 
.169; it is notable, however, that there was a difference 
of 12% between these 2 groups). The MTBI-depressed 
(91.3%) group had the highest proportion of patients 
with scores in this range, followed by the depressed 
outpatient (79.3%), MTBI-no depression (40.5%), and 
healthy control group (4.2%). 
Further comparison of the prevalence of endorsed 
symptoms was undertaken by considering all symptoms 
simultaneously. The cumulative percentages of the num- 
ber of “mild or greater” symptom ratings for each group 
are presented in Figure 2. Chi-square analysis was used 
to compare the cumulative percentages of patients who 
endorsed “x-or-more” symptoms (ie, ranging from 1 to 
13) across all 4 groups. Overall, the MTBI-depressed 
group endorsed the most symptoms, followed by de- 
pressed outpatients, patients with MTBI-no depression, 
and healthy controls. 
For symptoms endorsed at a mild level or greater, the 
most notable differences were found at the middle to 
higher portion of the symptom endorsement curve. For

brain injury. 

example, 95.7% of the MTBI-depressed group endorsed 
8 or more symptoms at a mild level or greater, followed 
by 70.7% of the depressed outpatients, 29.7% of the 
MTBI-no depression group, and 2.8% of the healthy 
control group (P < .05 for all comparisons). Similarly, 
87.0% of the MTBI-depressed group endorsed 10 or 
more symptoms at a mild level or greater, followed by 
43.1% of depressed outpatients, 24.3% of MTBI-no de- 
pression, and 0% of the healthy control group (P < .05 
for all comparisons). 
The percentages of each group that met ICD-10 Cat- 
egory C symptom criteria for postconcussional dis- 
order were calculated. According to these criteria, a 
person must have at least 3 of the following 6 symp- 
tom categories: (1) headaches, dizziness, general malaise, 
excessive fatigue, or noise intolerance; (2) irritability, 
emotional lability, depression, or anxiety; (3) subjective 
complaints of concentration or memory difﬁculty; (4) 
insomnia; (5) reduced tolerance to alcohol; and (6) pre- 
occupation with these symptoms and fear of permanent 
brain damage. Based on symptom reporting as mild or 
greater in 3 or more of the 6 symptom domains, the 
percentages of each group that met ICD-10 symptom 
criteria were as follows: MTBI-depression = 100%, de- 
pressed outpatients = 96.6%, MTBI-no depression = 
83.8%, and healthy controls = 13.9%. Post hoc anal- 
yses (using chi-square analyses) revealed signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences in the proportion of patients who met ICD-10 
criteria for all 6-group comparisons (all P < .05), with the 
exception of the comparison between MTBI-depressed 
and depressed outpatients (P = .367). 
The percentages of each group that met ICD-10 symp- 
tom criteria for postconcussional disorder, based on 
symptom reporting in each domain as moderate or greater, 
were as follows: MTBI-depression = 95.7%, depressed 
outpatients = 82.8%, MTBI-no depression = 48.6%, 
and healthy controls = 1.4%. Post hoc analyses again 
revealed signiﬁcant differences in the proportion of pa- 
tients who met ICD-10 criteria for all 6-group compar- 
isons (all P <.001), with the exception of the compari- 
son between MTBI-depressed and depressed outpatients 
(P = .127). 

The purpose of this study was to examine the inﬂuence 
of depression on postconcussion symptom reporting in a 
cohort of patients following MTBI. We compared MTBI 
patients with and without depression with depressed out- 
patients and healthy controls. MTBI patients were care- 
fully classiﬁed into depressed/not-depressed subgroups 
on the basis of hallmark symptoms of depression that 
were least likely to overlap with postconcussion symp- 
toms. It was hypothesized that patients with depression 









following an MTBI would report symptoms similar to 
uninjured outpatients with depression, and that both of 
these groups would endorse more symptoms than pa- 
tients with MTBIs who were not depressed and healthy 
control subjects. 
There were 4 speciﬁc hypotheses for this study. The re- 
sults strongly supported the ﬁrst 3 hypotheses, but not 
the fourth. Consistent with the ﬁrst 2 hypotheses, (i) 
MTBI patients with and without depression reported 
more postconcussion symptoms than healthy controls 
and (ii) MTBI patients with depression reported more 
postconcussion symptoms than MTBI patients without 
depression. Consistent with the third hypothesis, de- 
pressed outpatients reported more symptoms than both 
healthy controls and MTBI patients without depression. 
The ﬁnal hypothesis was that the symptom reporting 
between MTBI patients with depression and uninjured 
outpatients with depression would be comparable. There 
were mixed ﬁndings relating to this hypothesis. Com- 
pared to the outpatients with depression, the MTBI pa- 
tients with depression (i) had greater total scores on the 
BC-PSI, (ii) had a greater percentage of individuals who 
endorsed some individual symptoms, and (iii) had an 
overall greater number of endorsed symptoms. However, 
in contrast, there was no difference in the proportion of 
patients who (i) met ICD-10 symptom criteria for post- 
concussional disorder for symptom domains endorsed 
as mild or greater or moderate or greater, or (ii) had BC- 
PSI total scores that were 10 points or more or 15 points 
or more. 
Although the impact of MTBI alone on postconcus- 
sion symptom reporting was very large (Cohen d = 2.05), 
there was an obvious greater impact on postconcussion 
symptom reporting when a depressive experience ac- 
companied MTBI (Cohen d = 5.41). These results are 
consistent with studies that have established depression 
as having a signiﬁcant impact on postconcussion symp- 
tom reporting following MTBI.7,58 The large “additive 
effect” of depression on postconcussion symptom re- 
porting following MTBI was somewhat surprising. There 
was a very large effect size between the MTBI-no depres- 
sion and MTBI-depressed groups. In clinical terms, the 
vast majority (95.7%) of the MTBI-depressed group met 
ICD-10 symptom criteria for postconcussional disorder 
(based on symptom reporting in each domain as mod- 
erate or greater) compared to fewer than half (48.6%) 
of the MTBI-no depression group. These differences are 
striking. 
In the absence of an MTBI, depression alone had 
an enormous impact on postconcussion symptom re- 
porting when compared to nondepressed healthy con- 
trols. In addition, depression alone had a greater im- 
pact on postconcussion symptom reporting than MTBI 
alone. The vast majority of the depressed outpatient 
group (96.6%) met ICD-10 symptom criteria for post- 
concussional disorder based on symptom reporting in 
each domain as mild or greater, and a substantial ma- 
jority (82.8%) also met ICD-10 symptom criteria based 
on symptom reporting as moderate or greater. When 
taken as a whole, these ﬁndings suggest that depression 
appears to have an obvious and greater impact on symp- 
tom reporting compared to MTBI alone, but depression 
occurring comorbidly with MTBI is associated with an 
extremely high symptom burden. 
Clearly, what are commonly considered to be post- 
concussion symptoms were extremely common in this 
sample of depressed outpatients. This is consistent with 
previous studies that have reported at least moder- 
ate correlations between postconcussion symptoms and 
depression59 or life stress.60–65 Patients with MTBIs 
complicated by a depressive experience endorsed an ex- 
tremely high number of symptoms. When compared 
to healthy controls, the effect size was very large. 
When compared to depression alone, the effect size 
was large. When taken as a whole, these ﬁndings sug- 
gest that depression appears to have an obvious and 
greater impact on symptom reporting compared with 
MTBI alone, but depression occurring comorbidly with 
MTBI is associated with an extremely high symptom 
burden. 
This study has several limitations. First, these ﬁndings 
should not be considered generalizable to all people who 
have sustained MTBIs. This is a highly selected, non- 
representative, yet homogenous sample. Approximately 
35% of the MTBI sample were excluded because they 
could not be classiﬁed into 1 of the 2 depression cat- 
egories. As a group, these patients were reporting high 
levels of postconcussion symptoms (BC-PSI total score: 
M = 27.9, SD = 9.3). However, it was not possible to con- 
ﬁdently differentiate the likely inﬂuence of depression 
versus MTBI on symptom reporting in these individu- 
als. In order for us to attempt to isolate and examine 
the depressive experience, it was necessary to exclude a 
signiﬁcant minority of patients. 
Second, the MTBI-depression group was selected on 
the basis of symptoms whose etiology may not be solely 
attributable to depression alone and may also be at- 
tributable to the residual effects of MTBI. It is possi- 
ble that some people in the MTBI-depression group are, 
in fact, not depressed but are experiencing symptoms 
related to the neurobiology of MTBI. It is impossible 
for us, or anyone else, to discern the precise etiology of 
these symptoms. However, we have made every effort 
to carefully select symptoms that were considered hall- 
mark symptoms of depression that were least likely to 
overlap with postconcussion symptoms. Although it is 
not possible for us to say with certainty that all MTBI 
patients have been classiﬁed accurately in depressed/not- 
depressed groups, we believe that our selection method 
has minimized the potential impact of misclassiﬁcation 






as much as possible (within the limits of this research 
design). 
Third, there was no measure of effort administered. 
The relation between effort test failure and elevated 
symptom reporting has been established for some time. 
Of particular relevance, Iverson and colleagues55 have 
reported that failure on the test of memory malinger- 
ing is associated with increased postconcussion symp- 
tom reporting following MTBI. It is possible that some 
of our patients exaggerated their symptoms. Although 
it is not possible to evaluate the inﬂuence of effort test 
failure here, it is possible to compare patients who are 
seeking/not seeking ﬁnancial compensation for their in- 
juries. There were no signiﬁcant differences between 
litigants and nonlitigants in the TBI-depressed group 
(d = 0.53, medium effect size) or the TBI-no-depression 
group (d = 0.37, small effect size). However, there was a 
tendency for litigants to report more severe symptoms, 
but these analyses were underpowered because of small 
sample sizes. Overall, litigation status had, at most, a 
small effect on the results of this study. We could not, 
however, examine the issue of effort or exaggeration sep- 
arately from litigation status. 
In conclusion, these results suggest that the presence 
of depression, regardless of its etiology and course, will 
signiﬁcantly increase self-reported PCS symptoms, in 
both the absence or presence of a past MTBI. These 
ﬁndings emphasize the necessity to consider depression

as an important factor in the differential diagnostic pro- 
cess. The differential diagnosis of postconcussional dis- 
order following MTBI is complicated by the presence of 
depression. The presence of depression in a person with 
a history of traumatic brain injury presents an obvious 
challenge if one attempts to diagnose a persistent post- 
concussion syndrome, given the overlap in symptoms. 
Certainly, depression is relatively common in patients 
with traumatic brain injuries,33 although not necessar- 
ily more so than in patients with general trauma.31,32 
Depression is also common in persons with chronic 
pain,66,67 and it is associated with increased disability 
in these patients. Therefore, patients seen long after an 
MTBI who have chronic pain, depression, or both are 
very likely to meet diagnostic criteria for a persistent 
postconcussion syndrome, even if the problems associ- 
ated with the MTBI have long since resolved. This is 
particularly important in a forensic setting. When see- 
ing a person long after an injury, the clinician or foren- 
sic examiner must decide whether the current reported 
symptoms are caused by a low probability factor (the bio- 
logical consequences of a remote MTBI) or a high proba- 
bility factor (the presence of current depression, chronic 
pain, or both). The clinician or forensic examiner who di- 
agnoses persistent postconcussion syndrome in a patient 
with comorbid depression, chronic pain, or both might 
be criticized for coming to an erroneous conclusion 
without considerable evidence to support this diagnosis.
