Traumatic brain injury (TBI), with mild traumatic 
brain injury (MTBI) accounting for the vast majority 
of all TBIs, is a major worldwide problem. TBI is asso- 
ciated with high utilization of medical care and sub- 
stantial medical costs (Fu, Jing, Fu, & Cusimano, 2016; 
McMillan, Weir, & Wainman-Lefley, 2014; Mosenthal 
et al., 2004; Scholten, Haagsma, Panneman, Van Beeck, 
& Polinder, 
2014; Thurman, Alverson, Dunn, 
Guerrero, & Sniezek, 1999). The elderly population is 
generally the largest consumer of health services and 
critical care resources. By 2050, 40% of all trauma 
patients will consist of adults aged 65 years or older 
(Tillou et al., 2014). Both the bimodal distribution of 
TBI, with a higher risk of TBI 
in both younger 
(younger than 15 years) and older subjects (older than 
65 years) (Taylor, Bell, Breiding, & Xu, 2017), and the 
increasing life expectancy of people are believed to lead 
to higher mortality and morbidity rates after sustaining 
a TBI. Elderly not only have an increased risk of sus- 
taining a TBI, but advanced age is also a risk factor for 
higher mortality and morbidity rates after sustaining a 
TBI (Mosenthal, Lavery, & Addis, 2002; Pennings, 
Bachulis, Simons, & Slazinski, 1993; Rozzelle, Wofford, 
& Branch, 1995; Zonfrillo, Kim, & Arbogast, 2015). 
Although the majority of elderly patients return to 
their homes after 
(Rapoport & 
Feinstein, 2000; Røe, Skandsen, Manskow, Ader, & 
Anke, 2015), elderly patients are reported to experience 
more complications (Papa, Mendes, & Braga, 2012), 
and a greater dependence as compared to their 
younger counterparts (Mosenthal et al., 2002). 


Despite the increase in elderly patients who sustain 
a TBI, the majority of studies focus on outcomes of 
working-age individuals as opposed to older adults 
(LeBlanc, 
2006; 
Livingston et al., 2005; Mosenthal et al., 2004; Susman 
et al., 2002; Weber et al., 2016; Zonfrillo et al., 2015). 
This underlines the need for prognostic models in 
this patient group. Previous studies have shown that 
older age is a main prognostic factor for outcome, 
whereas elderly patients also often suffer from a high

ABSTRACT 
Elderly patients are at increased risk for persistent complaints after mild traumatic brain injury 
(MTBI). This study aimed to investigate the role of post-concussive symptoms, mood, post-trau- 
Information on mood, 
matic stress, and coping on functional outcome in elderly with MTBI. 
post-concussive symptoms, post-traumatic stress, and coping was collected 2 weeks post-injury. 
Six months post-injury functional outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale 
Extended. One hundred and sixty-two patients aged (cid:1) 60 years were included, 55% male, mean 
age ¼ 71 (±6.2) years. The most frequent cause of injury was falls from standing height (75%). 
Two weeks post-injury anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress were present in 15%, 12%, 
and 38% of patients, respectively, with 73% reporting post-concussive symptoms. Avoidant cop- 
ing was the most frequently used coping style. Six months post-injury, 44% showed incomplete 
recovery. Higher depression scores (OR ¼ 0.87, p ¼ 0.005) and number of post-concussive symp- 
toms (OR ¼ 0.91, p ¼ 0.03) were associated with incomplete recovery. Half of the elderly showed 
incomplete recovery 6 months after MTBI, with early depression or post-concussive symptoms as 
important factors. Coping style was not related to outcome. These results underline the need 
for a different approach in elderly patients, focusing on other predicting factors and fall preven- 
tion strategies. 


burden of chronic health conditions. These chronic 
health conditions contribute to falls, which subse- 
quently increases the risk of TBI. Mosenthal et al. 
(2004) reported that 73% of elderly patients with TBI 
had one or more medical conditions prior to injury. 
In addition, Selassie, McCarthy, Ferguson, Tian, and 
Langlois (2005) have demonstrated that older TBI 
patients with three or more pre-existing comorbid 
diseases showed mortality rates that were four times 
higher than subjects without any pre-existing disease. 
Mood (i.e. anxiety and depression), post-concussive 
symptoms, and post-traumatic stress are important 
factors that are associated with outcome after TBI 
(Silverberg et al., 2015; W€aljas et al., 2015). For 
instance, many studies have shown that the occur- 
rence of a TBI increases the likelihood of developing 
depression (Fedoroff et al., 1992; Jorge et al., 2004; 
2001). Rapoport, 
Kreutzer, 
McCullagh, Streiner, and Feinstein (2003) reported 
that major depression was seen in 15% of patients 
with MTBI in a cohort with ages ranging from 15–91 
years (Rapoport et al., 2003). It was also found that 
individuals with depression showed poorer outcome 
than subjects without depression (Rapoport et al., 
2003). Post-concussive symptoms are also associated 
with the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress 
(Haagsma et al., 2015; Lagarde et al., 2014). However, 
specific information on the relation between emo- 
tional distress and post-concussive symptoms in eld- 
erly is lacking. 

In addition, coping, which refers to ‘the thoughts 
and acts people use to manage the demands of stressful 
situations’ is also believed to play an important role in 
the recovery process after TBI (Chen, Peng, Xu, & 
O’Brien, 2018). The most commonly used coping styles 
comprise the active, passive, and avoidant coping style, 
of which passive coping is associated with incomplete 
recovery and lower quality-of-life (Maestas et al., 2014; 
Scheenen et al., 2017; Snell, Siegert, Hay-Smith, & 
Surgenor, 2011; van der Naalt et al., 2017). Although 
studies on coping styles in elderly patients with MTBI 
are very limited, one study in older adults reported 
that an avoidant coping style was associated with more 
emotional distress (Couture, Larivi(cid:2)ere, & Lefranc¸ois, 
2005). Resilience is also assumed to contribute to 
adverse outcome following MTBI. For instance, Losoi 
et al. (2015) reported that higher levels of resilience 
were associated with fewer post-concussive symptoms 
and a better quality-of-life 
et al., 2015). 
Moreover, resilience was found to be associated with 
lower use of an avoidant coping style in veterans who 
sustained a TBI (Elliott et al., 2015). 

Elderly also experience an age-associated loss of 
cognitive and physical resources that can make it dif- 
ficult to adjust to life following a TBI. For instance, 
frailty (i.e. defined as ‘the attribute of aged people 
who are at an increased risk of adverse health out- 
comes as a consequence of a diminished ability to 
respond to stress’). Rockwood, Song, and MacKnight 
(2005) has emerged as an independent predictor of 
risk of adverse outcome in older people (Abdulle 
et al., 2018). Therefore, we postulate that the ability 
to adapt and cope with TBI is a determining factor in 
satisfactory outcome in elderly patients. The current 
study aims to investigate the role of post-concussive 
symptoms, mood, post-traumatic stress and coping 
(assessed at 2 weeks post-injury) on functional out- 
come measured 6 months after sustaining an MTBI in 
elderly patients. 


This study is part of a larger observational cohort 
study on outcome following MTBI (UPFRONT-study) 
(van der Naalt et al., 2017). All patients were 
recruited from 2013 to 2015 at the emergency depart- 
ment (ED) of 
three Dutch hospitals designated as 
Level-1 trauma centres. MTBI was defined by a 
Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 13–15, loss of conscious- 
ness (LOC) (cid:3) 30 min, and/or duration of post-trau- 
matic amnesia (PTA) < 24 h (ACRM criteria). In the 
current study, only data from patients aged (cid:1) 60 years 
were used for the analyses. No one was suffering 
from psychiatric disorders at the time of the MTBI, 
and none of the patients were clinically diagnosed 
with dementia. The study was approved by the 
Medical Ethical Committee of the UMCG, and all 
patients gave written informed consent. 

Data were collected anonymously and comprised 
information on general characteristics (e.g. gender 
and age), injury-related characteristics (e.g. mechan- 
ism of trauma, CT abnormalities, Injury Severity Scale 
(ISS), hospital admission, and discharge destination). 
In addition, the presence of pre-injury mental health 
problems and pre-injury physical complaints were 
assessed based on two specific questions (‘Did you 
experience physical complaints prior to your acci- 
dent?’, 
‘Did you experience mental health problems 
prior to your accident?’). Data were obtained at sev- 
intervals post-injury, but for the current study 
eral 
data from the questionnaires assessed at 2 weeks 
injury were used unless stated otherwise. These ques- 
tionnaires included: 

(cid:4) Coping: The Utrecht Coping List (UCL) is a 47- 
item questionnaire to investigate coping style 
(Curran, Ponsford, & Crowe, 2000). The UCL has 
seven sub-scales 
coping 
styles including problem-solving, avoidance, self- 
distraction, social support, withdrawal, expression 
of emotions, and positive reframing. For the cur- 
rent study, we investigated three commonly used 
coping styles (i.e. active, passive, and avoidant cop- 
ing style) (Maestas et al., 2014). The scores range 
from low (1) to very high (5), and higher scores 
on the scales indicate a greater tendency to adopt 
that particular coping style. For the current study, 
values were dichotomized in high (range ¼ 4–5) 
and low (<4) use of the coping style (Scheenen 
et al., 2017; van der Naalt et al., 2017). The UCL 
is frequently applied in Dutch clinical practice and 
has been used in several earlier studies among 
people with other types of brain injury or stroke 
(Aben, Busschbach, Ponds, & Ribbers, 2008; 
Wolters, Stapert, Brands, & Van Heugten, 2010). 
(cid:4) Post-concussive symptoms: Commonly occurring 
post-concussive symptoms were assessed with the 
Head Injury Symptom Checklist 
(de 
Koning et al., 2016; van der Naalt, van Zomeren 
A, Sluiter, & Minderhoud, 1999). The HISC con- 
tains 21 items with scores ranging from 0 to 42 
(0 ¼ never, 1 ¼ sometimes and 2 ¼ often) corrected 
for pre-injury complaints. The presence of post- 
concussive symptoms was defined as reporting one 
or more symptoms, and dichotomized into 0 (no 
complaints) and 1 (one or more complaints). 
(cid:4) Mood: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS) was used to measure anxiety and depres- 
sion (Snaith & Zigmond, 1983). This instrument 
contains 14 items with seven items on depression 
and seven items on anxiety, with scores ranging 
from 0–21. HADS scores were dichotomized, with 
a score (cid:1)8 indicating the presence of clinical anx- 
iety and/or depression. 

(cid:4) Post-traumatic stress: The Impact of Event Scale 
(IES) was used to assess post-traumatic stress. This 
15-item questionnaire has a 5-point Likert scale 
(sum scores 0–75), and a cut-off score of 19 was 
indicative

(Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979). 


(cid:4) Outcome: Functional outcome, assessed with the 
Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), was 



measured 6 months 
(Wilson, 
after 
Pettigrew, & Teasdale, 1998). The GOSE question- 
naire has an 8-point scale, ranging from death (1) 
to complete recovery (8). The GOSE scores were 
dichotomized, with a score of 0–7 indicating 
incomplete functional recovery and a score of 8 
indicating complete functional recovery. 


performed with the 
Statistic 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23.0 
(IBM Corp. Released 2015. IBM SPSS Statistics for 
Windows, Version 23.0; Armonk, NY). Descriptive 
statistics were used to describe patient characteristics. 
Parametric tests (one-way ANOVA) were used to 
assess group differences for normally distributed vari- 
ables. Non-normally distributed data were assessed 
using non-parametric tests (e.g. Kruskal Wallis, Chi- 
square test). Correlations between variables were cal- 
culated using binary logistic regression, with the 
dichotomized GOSE scores as the dependent variable. 
A p-value below 0.05 was considered significant. 


A total of 162 patients were included. Patient charac- 
teristics are displayed in Table 1. The majority of 
patients were males (55%) and had a mean age of 71 
(± 6.2) years. At 6 months post-injury, 56% of the 
patients had a complete recovery. The majority (73%) 
of patients were hospitalized and were eventually dis- 
charged to their homes. No significant differences in 
patient characteristics were present when comparing 
patients with complete recovery to those with incom- 
plete recovery at 6 months post-injury. 
Mood, post-traumatic stress, and post- 
concussive symptoms 
At 2 weeks post-injury, 15% of patients reported to 
experience anxiety (14% of patients with complete 
recovery and 16% of patients with an incomplete 
recovery, p ¼ 0.92, Figure 1). Regarding depression, 
12% of the patients reported to experience depression- 
related complaints. When comparing patients with a 
complete and incomplete recovery, a significantly 
higher prevalence of depression was found in patients 
with an incomplete recovery (20%), as compared to 
p ¼ 0.02).

post-concussive symptoms for both groups were dizzi-

with a complete recovery (64%, p ¼ 0.007). In addition,

tinct coping styles between subjects with a complete 
and incomplete recovery are displayed in Figure 2. 
Although we observed a higher use of the active and 
avoidant coping style in patients with complete recov- 
ery as compared to patients with an incomplete 
recovery, no significant differences were present 
(active coping style, p ¼ 0.07; passive coping style, 
p ¼ 0.18; avoidant coping style, p ¼ 0.18). 
Role of mood, post-concussive symptoms, post- 
traumatic stress, and coping on outcome 
In the univariate analysis (Table 2), higher depression 
scores and higher HISC scores were significantly asso- 
ciated with a decreased odds of complete recovery 
(HADS depression scores: OR ¼ 0.87 [0.78–0.96], 
p ¼ 0.005; HISC scores: OR ¼ 0.91 
[0.84–0.99], 
p ¼ 0.03). Higher use of an active coping style was 
found to be borderline associated with an increased 
odds of complete recovery (OR ¼ 1.42 [0.96–2.10], 
p ¼ 0.08). The other variables (i.e. age, GCS score, ISS 
score, gender, hospital admission, CT-abnormalities, 
pre-injury physical and psychological 
complaints, 
post-injury anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and post- 
concussive symptoms) were not found to be associ- 
ated with outcome assessed at 6 months post-injury. 

In the total group, 27% of the patients showed high 
use of the avoidant coping style, 22% showed high 
use of the active coping style, and 18% showed high 
The current study aimed to investigate the role of 
mood, post-concussive 
symptoms, post-traumatic 
stress and coping on outcome in elderly patients after 
sustaining an MTBI. The main finding of our study

was that almost half (44%) of 
the elderly showed 
incomplete recovery 6 months post-injury. In add- 
ition, elderly patients who experienced depression- 
related complaints and post-concussive symptoms 
early after MTBI (i.e. 2 weeks post-injury) were more 
likely to show an incomplete recovery at 6 months 
post-injury. In addition, coping style was not found 
to be significantly associated with outcome. 
A total of 162 elderly patients were included in the 
current study, and 44% of 
these elderly patients 
showed an incomplete recovery 6 months after sus- 
taining an MTBI. This finding is in accordance with 
Rothweiler, Temkin, 
and Dikmen (1998), who 
reported that with increasing age the proportion of 
patients who recover completely decreases. They also 
reported that only 20% of the subjects aged 60 years 


or older achieved complete recovery (Rothweiler 
et al., 1998). This high number of incomplete recov- 
eries might partly be explained by mood problems. 
For instance, the current study found that 12% of the 
elderly patients experienced early depression, and the 
presence of depression was associated with a higher 
incomplete recovery 6 months post- 
likelihood of 
injury. Conversely, anxiety was not found to be asso- 
ciated with outcome in our elderly cohort. In line 
it was previously reported that 
with our findings, 
patients frequently develop depression following TBI 
and also show poorer 
(Fann, Katon, 
Uomoto, & Esselman, 1995; Menzel, 2008). In add- 
ition, Goldstein, Levin, Goldman, Clark, & Kenehan 
Altonen (2001) found that elderly MTBI patients, 
although having a relatively good cognitive recovery, 
showed significant depression and anxiety. 


In addition to mood, post-concussive symptoms 
might also affect 
these elderly 
patients. Our study demonstrated that the majority of 
patients experience at least one post-concussive symp- 
tom 2 weeks after injury. We have also shown that 
higher numbers of post-concussive symptoms are sig- 
nificantly associated with a decreased likelihood of 
complete recovery. In accordance with previous stud- 
ies, the most frequently reported complaints in our 
cohort were dizziness, fatigue, and headache (van der 
al., 1999; Wylie & Flashman, 2017). 
Naalt 
further underline the 
Collectively, 
importance of early post-concussive symptoms and 
depression as determining factors for outcome, and 
suggest that elderly patients might benefit from early 
rehabilitation. 


Pre-injury physical status, as well as pre-existing 
mental health problems, should always be taken into 
account when assessing elderly MTBI patients. The 
importance of early physical complaints is underlined 
by the postulation that elderly have reduced physical 
reserves (LeBlanc et al., 2006; Elliott et al., 2015). In 
addition, it was previously reported that pre-existing 
associated with an 
mental health problems 
increased risk of a worse outcome (Fedoroff et al., 
1992; Curran et al., 2000). However, in our elderly 
the prevalence of pre-injury mental health 
cohort 
problems was rather low. Although not being statistic- 
ally significant, we did observe a higher prevalence of 
pre-injury physical complaints in subjects with an 
incomplete recovery 6 months post-injury. 

Fall accidents are the leading cause of MTBI in 
elderly patients, and in our cohort fall accidents from 
standing height was the mechanism of injury in the 
majority of patients. Given the fact that falls were the 
most prevailing cause of injury, elderly patients might 
potentially benefit from primary fall prevention strat- 
falls have been associated with 
egies. In addition, 
post-traumatic stress (Rockwood et al., 2005). In our 
cohort, one in three of the elderly patients reported 
to experience early post-traumatic stress. O’Donnell 
et al. (2012) have previously shown that psychological 
interventions, early after sustaining an injury, could 
have a positive impact on outcome. Therefore, the 
initiation of such strategies should be encouraged. 
We further investigated the use of the three most 
frequently used coping styles (i.e. active, passive, and 
avoidant). Contrary to what was expected, we found 
that high use of these coping styles was not frequently 
present in elderly patients. The avoidant coping style 
was the most used coping style. In addition, the active 
coping style was borderline significantly associated 
with a decreased risk of incomplete recovery. In ear- 
lier studies, the passive coping style was associated 
with incomplete recovery and a reduced HRQoL 
(Aben et al., 2008). Studies on coping styles in elderly 
patients who sustained an MTBI are very limited, and 
interpretation of our current results might be specula- 
tive. For instance, the high use of the avoidant coping 
style might be the best choice in these elderly patients 
in order to deal with limitations in their daily life. By 
using the avoidant coping style instead of the active 
coping style, elderly would be less likely to get frus- 
it could be 
trated by their complaints. Conversely, 
reasoned that this would lead to depression, which is 
also more present in our cohort. Although we have 
not investigated social engagement, previous studies 
have shown that social participation can constitute a 
means of coping with health changes (Wolters et al., 
2010). Subsequently, social relationships might aid in 
the recovery following an MTBI. Therefore, 
future 
studies in elderly patients should also investigate the 
role of social participation in coping with outcome 
following an MTBI.

study also has some limitations. The first limitation of 
this study is the lack of a control group (one that 
consists of elderly who have not sustained a brain 
injury) to disentangle the effect of age and the effect 
of the MTBI. Furthermore, it could be argued that 
the GOSE is not an applicable instrument to measure 
outcome in these elderly patients, as the focus is on 
functional outcome. Nevertheless, the GOSE is a valid 
scale and is applied worldwide to monitor functional 
recovery, even several years after injury. The GOSE 
has been used in all age-categories and enables us to 
studies. Another 
compare our 

limitation is that the current study did not measure 
cognitive impairments, which made it difficult 
to 
determine whether patients were suffering from age- 
associated mild cognitive impairment. However, none 
of the patients in this study were clinically diagnosed 
with dementia. In addition, the diagnosis of MTBI in 
these elderly patients is often considered difficult, due 
to the fact that elderly patients might experience mild 
cognitive impairment, use medication, and suffer 
from multiple comorbidities which might affect their 
brain function (Page, Linnebur, Bryant, & Ruscin, 
2010; Papa et al., 2012). Therefore, the number of eld- 
erly sustaining an MTBI might even be under-esti- 
mated due to these known difficulties (de Koning 
et 
al., 1979; Snaith & 
Zigmond, 1983). 



Our study showed that almost half of the elderly had 
an incomplete recovery 6 months after sustaining an 
MTBI. Elderly patients who experienced depression 
and post-concussive symptoms early after sustaining 
an MTBI were more likely to have an incomplete 
recovery. Collectively, our results underline the need 
for a different approach in these elderly patients. 
Therefore, other strategies are needed to support these 
elderly patients with incomplete recovery, 
focusing 
more on pre-injury status, cognitive reserve, and 
social participation. Since the most common cause of 
injury in our elderly cohort was fall accidents from 
standing height, more awareness of 
fall prevention 
is warranted.
