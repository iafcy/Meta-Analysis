The Clinical Signiﬁcance of Major Depression Following Mild 
Traumatic Brain Injury 

relatively common, with a point prevalence of 14%– 
29%.1–3 Major depression may be particularly common fol- 
lowing mild traumatic brain injury. Alexander4 found that 
subjects with mild traumatic brain injury had higher rates 
of major depression, postconcussive symptoms, and poor 
global outcome than those with severe traumatic brain in- 
jury. However, the relationship between the relevant vari- 
ables was not explored. While studies thus far have dem- 
onstrated an association between major depression and 
poor psychosocial functioning following traumatic brain 
injury,1,2,5–11 most studies have not focused on patients 
with mild traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury 
sample selection in these studies has either been hetero- 
geneous,1,2,5,6,11 moderate to severe,7,8,10 or unclear.9 Fur- 
thermore, three of the studies had small numbers of sub- 
jects,1,2,5 and four did not use diagnostic interviews for 
assessment of depression.6–8,10 
Levin et al.,12 in a group of subjects with mild and 
moderate traumatic brain injury, found that the presence of 
major depression was associated with poor global and psy- 
chosocial functioning. However, the study group size was 
small (N(cid:2)69), subjects with premorbid major depression 
were not excluded from the analysis of the relationship 
between depression and functioning, and postconcussive 
symptoms were not assessed. 
In community samples, major depression uncompli- 
cated by head injury has been associated with signiﬁcant 
levels of disability.13 Given that mild traumatic brain injury 
is associated with poor outcome in 15%–20%,4,14 the ques- 
tion of to what extent this is associated with major depres- 
sion deserves further study. 
The purpose of the present study is to assess the as- 
sociation between major depression and a number of out- 
come measures following mild traumatic brain injury, 
namely global outcome, level of psychosocial functioning,

Objective: The authors assessed the association of major depression with behavioral outcome 
following mild traumatic brain injury. Method: Consecutive patients with mild traumatic brain 
injury (N(cid:2)170) were assessed for major depression. Those with major depression were com- 
pared with those without on self-report measures of psychosocial dysfunction, psychological dis- 
tress, and postconcussive symptoms in addition to examiner-rated neurobehavioral disturbance. 
Results: Major depression was seen in 15.3% (N(cid:2)26) of the subjects after traumatic brain in- 
jury, and these individuals showed subjective and objective evidence of poorer outcome. Conclu- 
sions: Major depression is associated with poor outcome across multiple domains. This study 
highlights the need for the early diagnosis and prompt treatment of major depression following 
mild traumatic brain injury. 


degree of psychological distress and neurobehavioral dis- 
turbance, and severity of postconcussive symptoms. We 
hypothesized that major depression would be associated 
with adverse outcome in these domains. 
A consecutive group of patients attending a traumatic 
brain injury clinic for their ﬁrst follow-up appointment af- 
ter injury was assessed for the presence of major depres- 
sion. The clinic is part of a large general hospital that serves 
as a tertiary referral center for trauma patients who are 
referred to the clinic from the emergency department, 
trauma wards, community hospitals, and by local physi- 
cians. All our subjects sustained a nonpenetrating mild 
traumatic brain injury, as deﬁned by the American Con- 
gress of Rehabilitation Medicine: loss or alteration of con- 
sciousness at the time of injury for 30 minutes or less, an 
initial Glasgow Coma Score of 13–15, and posttraumatic 
amnesia of less than 24 hours.15 Exclusion criteria were a 
premorbid history of focal brain disease (e.g., stroke, tu- 
mor), serious acute medical illness (heart or renal failure, 
malignancy), or previous history of dementia, schizophre- 
nia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. Subjects pro- 
vided informed consent. 
Two hundred eleven patients were seen at the clinic. 
Forty-one patients with a preexisting mood disorder (bi- 
polar disorder or major depressive disorder) were ex- 
cluded. No subjects were excluded on the basis of the other 
criteria. 
Demographic and head injury data were collected 
from a clinician’s review of the chart and discussion with 
the patient (and informant, where available). Demographic 
information included age, gender, marital status, living sit- 
uation, employment, educational history, medical history 
(presence of illnesses unrelated to injury), and the presence 
or absence of a prior diagnosis of psychiatric disorder (ma- 
jor depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, 
anxiety disorder, or dementia). The use of alcohol and il- 
licit substances were codiﬁed as “signiﬁcant” on the basis 
of interview and clinician’s judgment. Family psychiatric 
history was attained by inquiring about formal psychiatric 
contact or diagnosis in ﬁrst- or second-degree biological 
relatives. Injury data, namely the mechanism of accident, 
duration of loss of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale 
score in the emergency room, duration of posttraumatic 
amnesia,16 other musculoskeletal injuries (coded as none, 
soft tissue only, or fractures), and results of the brain CT 
scans (coded as focal intracranial abnormality, atrophy, or 
normal), were also recorded. 
All subjects (N(cid:2)170) were assessed by a psychiatrist 
(who was unaware of the results of the self-report outcome 
measures) for the presence of a major depressive episode 
using the depression module of the Structured Clinical In- 
terview for DSM-IV axis I disorders (SCID).17 DSM cri- 
teria are considered reliable and valid in traumatic brain 
injury samples.18,19 
Psychosocial outcome was recorded by using the Riv- 
ermead Head Injury Follow-Up Questionnaire,20 which 
gives a more detailed description of psychosocial function- 
ing. This 4-point self-report scale addresses 10 aspects of 
a patient’s functioning—such as relationships, work, do- 
mestic activities, and the ability to hold a conversation— 
following traumatic brain injury. 
Psychological distress and symptoms of postconcus- 
sive disorder were noted with the General Health Ques- 
tionnaire21 and the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms 
Questionnaire,22 respectively. The 28-item General Health 
Questionnaire, a self-report questionnaire used previously 
in a neurological setting23–25 and in traumatic brain injury 
research,26,27 contains four subscales of seven questions 
each pertaining to somatic distress, social dysfunction, 
anxiety, and depression. Each question has four possible 
responses, which were rated binomially (i.e., 0-0-1-1) in 
accordance with the scale’s guidelines. The Rivermead 
Post Concussion Disorder Questionnaire measures on a 4- 
point scale the severity of 18 physical symptoms (e.g., 
headache, dizziness) commonly seen following traumatic 
brain injury. 
Objective measures of outcome were administered by 
a clinician who was blind to the results of the self-report 
questionnaires but not to the results of the SCID. These 
measures included the Glasgow Outcome Scale28 and the 
Neurobehavioral Rating Scale—Revised.29 The Glasgow 
Outcome Scale is a widely used clinician-rated instrument 
developed speciﬁcally for patients with traumatic brain in- 
jury to assess global functioning. It is rated on a 5-point 
scale (5(cid:2)“good recovery”; 4(cid:2)“moderate disability”; 
3(cid:2)“severe disability”; 2(cid:2)“vegetative”; 1(cid:2)“dead”). The 
Neurobehavioral Rating Scale—Revised is a multidimen- 






sional clinician-based assessment instrument designed to 
measure neurobehavioral disturbances following traumatic 
brain injury. The Neurobehavioral Rating Scale—Revised 
is not a symptom checklist; it is administered by a brief 
structured interview that includes questions and observa- 
tions about behavioral and emotional sequelae common to 
traumatic brain injury and incorporates performance on 
cognitive tasks (e.g., orientation, four-item object recall, 
verbal problem solving). The Neurobehavioral Rating 
Scale—Revised has been shown to be reliable and valid 
for quantifying behavioral disturbances and cognitive im- 
pairments in individuals with traumatic brain injury.29–31 
For purposes of analysis, and to avoid overlap of scores 
with the presence of SCID-deﬁned major depression, we 
removed the “depression” item from the total score. As a 
further objective index of outcome, we inquired whether 
or not the subjects had returned to work after their injury. 
Patients with and without major depression were com- 
pared by using the chi-square statistic (or Fisher’s exact 
test, where appropriate) for categorical demographic and 
injury variables as well as the Glasgow Outcome Scale and 
“return to work” variable. Age, time postinjury, and the 
continuous outcome variables were compared between 
groups by using analysis of variance. A Bonferroni correc- 
tion was applied to correct for multiple comparisons: with 
10 outcome variables, the critical p value is 0.005 (i.e., 
0.05/10). The potentially confounding effects of demo- 
graphic mismatch between groups with and without major 
depression were controlled for by using analysis of covar- 
iance. 
Subjects were on average 44.2 years of age (SD(cid:2)20.1, 
range(cid:2)15–91) and were seen at a mean of 48.4 days 
(SD(cid:2)33.6, range(cid:2)1–227) after their injury. With regard 
to past psychiatric problems, 16 subjects had signiﬁcant 
substance misuse, 13 had alcohol misuse, and four had 
anxiety disorder. 
Eighteen subjects (10.6%) were too ill to complete the 
self-report outcome measures. They were more likely to be 
older (F(cid:2)13.02, df(cid:2)1, 168, p(cid:2)0.0001) and to have medi- 
cal illnesses (v2(cid:2)5.12, df(cid:2)1, p(cid:2)0.05), but there were no 
signiﬁcant differences in the prevalence of major depres- 
sion or other demographic or injury variables between the 
groups. 


Subjects with major depression were more likely to 
have sustained their accident as a result of a motor vehicle- 
related accident than those without major depression, but 
there were no other signiﬁcant differences in demographic 
or injury variables between the groups (Table 1). 
Subjects with major depression reported higher levels 
of psychosocial dysfunction (Rivermead Head Injury Fol- 
low-Up Questionnaire), psychological distress (General 
Health Questionnaire), and symptoms of postconcussive 
disorder (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Ques- 
tionnaire) than those without (Table 2). These relationships 
remained signiﬁcant at the p(cid:2)0.0001 level even after 
mechanism of injury was controlled. Subjects with major 
depression reported higher levels of postconcussive symp- 
toms, even excluding postconcussive symptoms that over- 
lap with those of major depression (i.e., depressed mood, 
insomnia, fatigue, irritability, frustration, restlessness, and 
concentration difﬁculties). 
In terms of three objective outcome measures, subjects 
with major depression had signiﬁcantly higher scores 
(more neurobehavioral disturbance) on the Neurobehav- 
ioral Rating Scale—Revised (total score minus depression 
item) (Table 2), a ﬁnding that remained signiﬁcant after we 
controlled for mechanism of injury. Subjects with major 
depression also showed poorer outcome on the Glasgow 
Outcome Scale than those without major depression 
(19.2% versus 36.8% with good outcome), although this 
was not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 2). There were no 
differences in numbers of people who had returned to 
work. 
This study demonstrated that, in a sample conﬁned to mild 
traumatic brain injury, major depression in the acute period 
following injury is associated with greater psychosocial 
dysfunction, more psychological distress, increased post- 
concussive symptoms, and more neurobehavioral dysfunc- 
tion. As the aim of this study was to address the relation- 
ship between major depression and behavioral outcome 
following traumatic brain injury, the study had a built-in 
control group (i.e., major depression versus no major de- 
pression), 
thereby obviating a need for orthopedic or 
healthy comparison subjects. 
The prevalence in this study of major depression was 
15%, which is consistent with other studies that have ex- 
amined point prevalence of DSM-deﬁned major depres- 







sion,1–3 but lower than the pooled prevalence estimate of 
(cid:3)40% in a recent review.32 Strict comparisons, however, 
are difﬁcult, since many of the previous studies of depres- 
sion in traumatic brain injury have relied on self-report 
depression rating scales and have incorporated subjects 
with traumatic brain injury of heterogeneous severity and 
at various time points postinjury.32,33 
The ﬁnding of an association between major depres- 
sion and poor psychosocial functioning following mild 
traumatic brain injury is consistent with ﬁndings in other 
studies of traumatic brain injury of more severe or hetero- 
geneous severity.1,2,5–11 While Fann et al.5 noted an asso- 
ciation between major depression and postconcussive 
symptoms, our data are particularly robust because we con- 
trolled for overlap in symptoms between the two disorders. 
Furthermore, in the study by Fann et al., the sample selec- 
tion was heterogeneous. 
Our study found a relationship that approached sig- 
niﬁcance between major depression and global outcome 
according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale. While three 
studies7,8,12 have previously found that depressive symp- 
toms were associated with poor functioning on the Glas- 
gow Outcome Scale, two of the studies concerned mod- 
erate to severe traumatic brain injury and relied on 
self-report of depressive symptoms,7,8 while the third study 
(in subjects with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury 
and general trauma) used the more sensitive extended ver- 
sion of the Glasgow Outcome Scale and did not exclude 
patients with a prior history of depression.12 The Glasgow 
Outcome Scale, with its narrow range of potential scores, 
does not appear to be a particularly sensitive measure of 
outcome following mild traumatic brain injury.34 Similarly, 
the “return to work” variable may be a premature, and 
therefore insensitive, way of judging outcome given the 
acute nature of our sample, seen on average 11⁄2 months 
after injury. 
The strength of this study is the combination of patient 
recruitment limited to those with mild traumatic brain in- 
jury and no premorbid history of mood disorder, direct 
structured interview of all subjects by a psychiatrist to as-

sess major depression, and the use of a broad array of sub- 
jective and objective outcome measures. Given the relative 
insensitivity of the Glasgow Outcome Scale in mild trau- 
matic brain injury, the addition of three other self-reported 
outcome measures that capture a spectrum of symptoms, 
as well as the more comprehensive and objective Neuro- 
behavioral Rating Scale—Revised, enhanced our ability to 
determine how patients fare in the acute period following 
injury. 
The pathogenesis of persisting symptom complaints 
following mild traumatic brain injury is unclear. Psycho- 
social factors such as psychiatric history, substance abuse, 
ﬁnancial incentives, misattribution of symptoms, and ex- 
pectancies have been posited as important.35–37 It is also 
possible that major depression might lead to symptom am- 
pliﬁcation. As such, any explanation is likely to be com- 
plex. We have, however, shown that litigation does not 
differ between those with and without major depression 
and similarly have excluded premorbid mood disorder, 
having set this as an exclusion factor in patient selection. 
Finally, while symptom ampliﬁcation is likely to affect 
self-report response of subjects, the use of a structured in- 
terview such as the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale—Re- 
vised adds weight to our objective impressions that sub- 
jects with major depression do more poorly. 

search. First is the fact that approximately 11% of the sam- 
ple did not complete all outcome measures. However, 167 
of 170 subjects (98%) were rated on the more objective 
Neurobehavioral Rating Scale—Revised, and the principal 
ﬁnding of more psychosocial (or more speciﬁcally, neu- 
robehavioral) difﬁculties among those with major depres- 
sion was corroborated. The use of direct and observer-rated 
measures of functioning may be ways of addressing this 
concern in future studies. Referral bias is a potential con- 
found in any clinical study of outcome following traumatic 
brain injury. Given the sources of referral in this study, it 
is possible that patients seen were more symptomatic. 
However, this does not affect the central aim of the study, 
which was to study the functioning of patients with and 
without major depression following traumatic brain injury, 
rather than to study predictors of posttraumatic major de- 
pression. The third potential source of bias is the fact that 
a single rater completed the SCID, the Neurobehavioral 
Rating Scale—Revised, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale. 
However, the highly structured nature of these scales is 
likely to mitigate any built-in bias in this regard. 
It is important to note that the association between 
major depression and poor functioning is not necessarily a 
causal one. Although this study was cross-sectional in na- 
ture, focusing on the acute period following injury, further 
longitudinal studies are underway in order to elucidate bet-

depression may directly improve outcome and quality of 
life for these patients. 
What emerges from the data is the strong association 
between clinical major depression following traumatic 
brain injury and poor behavioral outcome. Of considerable 
clinical relevance for health care workers in the ﬁeld, major 
depression is treatable in patients with traumatic brain in- 
jury.38,39 Our data suggest that targeting major depression 
may improve outcome in the domains of global and psy- 
chosocial function, psychological distress, postconcussive 
symptoms, and neurobehavioral difﬁculties. Thus, there is 
potential that the early identiﬁcation and treatment of major
