The purpose of this study is to examine the relation between the microstructural architecture of white matter, as measured by diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI), and postconcussion symptom reporting 6–8 weeks following mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Participants were 108 patients 
prospectively recruited from a Level 1 Trauma Center (Vancouver, BC, Canada) following an orthopedic injury [i.e., 36 trauma controls (TCs)] or 
MTBI (n ¼ 72). DTI of the whole brain was undertaken using a Phillips 3T scanner at 6 –8 weeks postinjury. Participants also completed a 5 h 
neurocognitive test battery and a brief battery of self-report measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, and postconcussion symptoms). The MTBI 
sample was divided into two groups based on ICD-10 criteria for postconcussional syndrome (PCS): ﬁrst, PCS-present (n ¼ 20) and second, 
PCS-absent (n ¼ 52). There were no signiﬁcant differences across the three groups (i.e., TC, PCS-present, and PCS-absent) for any of the neu- 
rocognitive measures (p ¼ .138 –.810). For the self-report measures, the PCS-present group reported signiﬁcantly more anxiety and depression 
symptoms compared with the PCS-absent and TC groups (p , .001, d ¼ 1.63 –1.89, very large effect sizes). For the DTI measures, there were no 
signiﬁcant differences in fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, or mean diffusivity when comparing the PCS-present and 
PCS-absent groups. However, there were signiﬁcant differences (p , .05) in MD and RD when comparing the PCS-present and TC groups. 
There were signiﬁcant differences in white matter between TC subjects and the PCS-present MTBI group, but not the PCS-absent MTBI 
group. Within the MTBI group, white-matter changes were not a signiﬁcant predictor of ICD-10 PCS. 


Postconcussion symptoms are common in the acute recovery phase following mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Patients who 
sustain MTBI report more acute symptoms than healthy control and trauma control (TC) subjects in the initial days and weeks 
postinjury in most (Iverson, Silverberg, Lange, & Zasler, 2013), but not all studies (e.g., Landre, Poppe, Davis, Schmaus, & 
Hobbs, 2006). Fortunately, in the majority of cases, these symptoms resolve within weeks to a few months (Iverson et al., 
2013). However, the diagnostic signiﬁcance of postconcussion symptom reporting following MTBI is controversial. Clinicians 
often assume that postconcussion symptoms reported many months or years postinjury are directly related to the biological

consequences of that brain injury. However, there are many factors unrelated to brain injury that can potentially account for these 
symptoms (e.g., other medical problems (Lees-Haley & Brown, 1993), personal injury litigation (Lees-Haley & Brown, 1993), 
posttraumatic stress disorder (Foa, Cashman, Jaycox, & Perry, 1997), orthopedic injuries (Meares et al., 2008; Mickeviciene 
et al., 2004), chronic pain (Iverson & McCracken, 1997), depression (Iverson, 2006; Suhr & Gunstad, 2002b), and myofascial 
injury (whiplash) (Sullivan, Hall, Bartolacci, Sullivan, & Adams, 2002). Complicating matters further, the perception and report- 
ing of symptoms can be inﬂuenced by a diverse range of psychological and social-psychological factors that may cause, maintain, 
or worsen the myriad of symptoms that are reported postinjury (e.g., premorbid personality [Hibbard et al., 2000], clinical methods 
used to elicit symptoms [Iverson, Brooks, Ashton, & Lange, 2010], nocebo effect [Hahn, 1997], “expectation as etiology” 
[Gunstad & Suhr, 2001], diagnosis threat [Suhr & Gunstad, 2002a], and “good old days” bias [Gunstad & Suhr, 2001; Iverson, 
Lange, Brooks, & Rennison, 2010]). Some studies have illustrated that preinjury mental health problems and postinjury difﬁculties 
with anxiety are strongly related to symptoms that persist for many months following injury (Ponsford et al., 2012). 
To date, there is limited evidence to support a direct causal link between macrostructural brain injury and symptom reporting. In 
general, neuroimaging studies have not documented a relationship between greater postconcussion symptom reporting and intra- 
cranial abnormalities identiﬁed on structural computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans within the 
ﬁrst few days (Hughes et al., 2004; Kurca, Sivak, & Kucera, 2006), 3 – 6 months (Hofman et al., 2001; Lannsjo, Backheden, Af 
Johansson, Geijerstam, & Borg, 2013; Sigurdardottir, Andelic, Roe, Jerstad, & Schanke, 2009; Taylor et al., 2010), or 6 – 12 
months (Deepika, Munivenkatappa, Devi, & Shukla, 2013; Sigurdardottir et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2010) following injury. In 
fact, de Guise and colleagues (2010) found, paradoxically, greater postconcussion symptom reporting 20 weeks following 
MTBI in those patients who had normal day-of-injury CT scans (rather than abnormal scans). Of course, the lack of association 
between postconcussion symptoms and intracranial abnormalities on structural CT or MRI scan may be due, in part, to the lack of 
sensitivity of these methods to detect diffuse microstructural changes often associated with MTBI (Bruns & Jagoda, 2009; Gaetz & 
Weinberg, 2000; e.g., Hofman et al., 2001; Lewine et al., 2007). 
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is useful for detecting white-matter changes in the brain following TBI (Belanger, 
Vanderploeg, Curtiss, & Warden, 2007; Xu, Rasmussen, Lagopoulos, & Haberg, 2007) and it has become an important tool 
for the evaluation of MTBI in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases of the recovery trajectory (Inglese, Bomsztyk, et al., 
2005; Inglese, Makani, et al., 2005; Kraus et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2009; Lipton et al., 2009; Rutgers et al., 2008; Shenton 
et al., 2012). To date, a number of researchers have established the sensitivity of DTI to differentiate healthy controls from 
those individuals who have sustained MTBI and who report postconcussion symptoms 3–6 years following injury (Lipton et al., 
2008; Niogi et al., 2008). The methodology of these small, cross-sectional, correlational studies, however, does not allow one to 
assume a causal link between microstructural white-matter ﬁndings and postconcussion symptoms. In recent years, the number of 
DTI studies that have examined the relationship between postconcussion symptom reporting and MTBI has increased steadily. 
These studies can be characterized into two categories: correlational studies and group studies. 
Results from correlational studies have found a relatively consistent relationship between postconcussion symptom reporting 
and various DTI metrics. For example, researchers have reported that increased postconcussion symptom reporting is associated 
with (a) increased fractional anisotropy (FA) and decreased apparent diffusion coefﬁcients (ADCs) and radial diffusivity (RD) in 
the corpus callosum in 10 adolescents within the ﬁrst 6 days following MTBI (Wilde et al., 2008); (b) low trace values in the whole 
brain at 72 h and 1 month postinjury in six patients following MTBI (Bazarian et al., 2007); (c) pre– post season changes in FA and 
mean diffusivity (MD) in nine high school athletes who sustained repeated multiple subconcussive blows (Bazarian, Zhu, Blyth, 
Borrino, & Zhong, 2012); and (d) increased MD in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and 
superior longitudinal fasciculus; and decreased FA in uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, internal capsule, 
corpus callosum, and the parietal and frontal subcortical white matter in 20 patients 1 month postinjury (Smits et al., 2011). 
One exception to this is a study by Levin and colleagues (2010) who found no relationship between FA and ADC and postconcus- 
sion symptoms in 37 mild – moderate TBI service members 2.3 years postinjury using ﬁber-tracking and region of interest (ROI) 
methodology. It is important to appreciate, however, that despite the signiﬁcant correlations found between postconcussion 
symptom reporting and some DTI metrics in the above studies, there were many other DTI metrics that were not associated 
with postconcussion symptom reporting. 
In contrast to correlational studies, there are mixed ﬁndings in group studies that have compared DTI metrics across subgroups 
deﬁned by postconcussion symptom reporting. Messe and colleagues (Messe´ et al., 2011, 2012) found some DTI differences in a 
small sample of patients with MTBI divided into poor outcome (Postconcussion Syndrome [PCS] present [i.e., PCS+]) versus 
good outcome (PCS absent [i.e., PCS-]) groups. These differences were found for MD only, and not for FA, axial diffusivity 
(AD), or RD (Messe´ et al., 2011). At 3 months postinjury (n ¼ 23), participants in the PCS+ group had higher MD compared 
with the PCS2 group in the forceps major and minor, the corpus callosum, the inferior-occipital fasciculus bilaterally, and inferior 
longitudinal fasciculus bilaterally. The PCS+ group (but not the PCS2 group) also had higher MD compared with a healthy control 
sample in some ROIs (i.e., superior longitudinal fasciculus, corticospinal tract bilaterally, and left anterior thalamic radiation). In a 


follow-up longitudinal study of 53 MTBI patients evaluated in the acute phase of recovery (8–21 days [T1]) and subacute (6 months 
[T2]), Messe and colleagues (2012) (Messe et al., 2012) reported that the PCS+ group had a greater number of abnormal brain regions 
on DTI than the PCS2 group when compared with healthy controls. These authors did not provide detailed information regarding a 
direct comparison between PCS+ vs. PCS2 groups; however, they concluded that “signiﬁcant structural differences were found 
between PCS+ and PCS2 groups at T1 and less at T2 for the MD and AD measures, that involved primarily the corpus callosum, 
the longitudinal fasciculus, and the internal capsules.” (p. 288). There were no differences found for FA or RD measures. Similarly, 
Hartikainen and colleagues (2010) examined 18 patients with mild–moderate TBIs at 6 months postinjury and found that those who 
reported persistent postconcussion symptoms (n ¼ 7) had lower ADC (d ¼ 2.33) and higher FA (d ¼ 1.86) compared with those who 
reported no symptoms (n ¼ 11) in the midbrain structures (i.e., thalamus, internal capsule, centrum semiovale, and mesencephalon). 
In contrast to these studies, Waljas et al. (2014) examined 48 patients with uncomplicated MTBI and found no differences 
across 16 ROIs for FA, or 10 ROIs for ADC, between those who did and did not report postconcussion symptoms at 3 weeks follow- 
ing injury. Similarly, Lange, Iverson, Brubacher, Madler, and Heran (2012) examined the relation between DTI of the corpus cal- 
losum and reporting in 60 patients who had sustained MTBI, and 34 patients with orthopedic/soft-tissue injuries (i.e., TCs). At 6 – 8 
weeks postinjury, there were no signiﬁcant differences between the MTBI and TC groups for FA or for MD in the genu, body, and 
splenium of the corpus callosum. Similarly, in the MTBI sample, there were no signiﬁcant differences on any DTI measures 
between those who did and did not meet ICD-10 symptom criteria for postconcussion syndrome (PCS). In the MTBI sample, 
Cohen’s effect sizes ranged from very small (d ¼ 0.02) to small (d ¼ 0.16) for all DTI measures; with the exception of small – 
medium effect size found for FA in the genu (d ¼ 0.39) and body (d ¼ 0.37) of the corpus callosum. 
The purpose of this study is to expand the study by Lange and colleagues (2012) that examined the relation between DTI and 
postconcussion symptom reporting by: ﬁrst, using DTI to examine the whole brain; second, include a larger number of DTI metrics 
such FA, MD, RD, and AD; third, use more advanced and comprehensive DTI analysis methods including tract-based spatial sta- 
tistics (TBSS) and standard brain atlas generated ROI analyses; fourth, include neurocognitive tests and more symptom scales as 
outcome measures; ﬁfth, include a sample of individuals in the MTBI group that do not have intracranial abnormalities that predate 
their injury; and ﬁnally, include a sample of participants in the TC group that do not include minor intracranial abnormalities (e.g., 
T2 hyperintensities). 
The hypotheses are threefold. First, compared with the TC group, patients with MTBI will (a) report a greater number of post- 
concussion, depression, and anxiety symptoms; (b) perform comparably on neurocognitive measures; and (c) have reduced white- 
matter integrity in the whole brain as measured by DTI metrics. Second, in the MTBI group, patients who meet ICD-10 criteria for 
PCS (i.e., PCS-present) will report a greater number of depression and anxiety symptoms compared with those patients who do not 
meet ICD-10 PCS criteria (i.e., PCS-absent). Third, in the MTBI group, there will be no differences across all neurocognitive mea- 
sures and DTI metrics when comparing the PCS-present vs. PCS-absent groups. 


Participants were 108 patients (72 MTBI and 36 TC) prospectively recruited from the Emergency Department of Vancouver 
General Hospital (Level 1 Trauma Center) between June 2007 and April 2012. Patients were identiﬁed for potential inclusion in the 
study via daily reviews of consecutive Emergency Department admissions. Patients were targeted for recruitment and consent if 
they presented to the Emergency Department after sustaining a MTBI (i.e., MTBI group), or they had sustained a soft-tissue or 
orthopedic injury without brain injury (i.e., TC group). 
All participants were enrolled in the study if they were ﬁrst, between 19 and 55 years of age, second, injured as a result of a 
traumatic injury (e.g., fall, motor vehicle accident, assault, etc.), and third, had a blood alcohol level (BAL) obtained at the 
time of injury by hospital staff on admission to the Emergency Department. General exclusion criteria included ﬁrst, lack of pro- 
ﬁciency in conversational English; second, educated in a language other than English after age 10 (Note that the second and more 
stringent criterion for ESL was only introduced in 2009 after the evaluation of a series of patients whose neurocognitive proﬁle was 
considered to be affected by a lack of English-based education (e.g., intact scores on all measures except language-based mea- 
sures).); (c) history of a neurological disorder (e.g., stroke or multiple sclerosis), TBI, learning disability, or psychiatric illness 
requiring hospitalization; (d) presence of any contraindication to MRI, (e) history of signiﬁcant drug abuse other than alcohol; 
(f) presence of upper body injuries restricting the use of hands or arms; or (g) difﬁculties with eyesight. 
Participants were included in the TC group if (a) they sustained a soft-tissue or orthopedic injury below the neck; (b) there was no 
evidence of an altered state of consciousness as indicated by a reduction in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, or presence of a loss 
of consciousness (LOC), posttraumatic amnesia (PTA), or posttraumatic confusion; and (c) there was no evidence of physical head 
trauma, whiplash, or cervical strain based on medical chart review (e.g., absence of lacerations/contusions to the head, absence of 


complaints of head, neck, or back pain). In a small number of cases (n ¼ 2), TC participants had undergone a head CT but had no 
evidence of intracranial abnormality. 
Participants were included in the MTBI group if they (a) presented to the Emergency Department following head trauma, and (b) 
had evidence of MTBI as indicated by at least one of the following: (i) witnessed LOC of at least 1 min duration but not .30 min, 
(ii) PTA of at least 15 min duration but not .24 h, and/or (iii) GCS score of 13 or 14. Patients were further classiﬁed into uncom- 
plicated and complicated MTBI groups as follows: (a) uncomplicated MTBI: GCS ¼ 13 –15, PTA , 24 h, LOC ,30 min, and no 
trauma-related intracranial abnormality on day-of-injury CT or 6 – 8 weeks structural MRI scan; (b) complicated MTBI: GCS ¼ 
13– 15, PTA ,24 h, LOC ,30 min, and trauma-related intracranial abnormality on day-of-injury CT scan or 6 – 8 week structural 
MRI scan. Of the 72 MTBI patients included in this study, there were 38 (52.8%) with uncomplicated MTBI and 34 (47.2%) with 
complicated MTBI. 



Participants were selected from a larger sample of 170 patients enrolled in the study (105 MTBI and 65 TC) in a three-step 
manner. First, participants were initially included in the sample if they met the following criteria: (1) completed the entire neuro- 
psychological test battery (99.4% of sample), (2) neurocognitive test performance was not considered inﬂuenced by reduced 
English language proﬁciency (95.9% of sample), (3) scored above the recommended cutoff for good effort on the Test of 
Memory Malingering (100% of entire sample), (4) behavioral observations during the neuropsychological evaluation did not 
provide suspicion of questionable motivation or attention that may have negatively inﬂuenced test performance (98.8% of 
sample), (5) successfully completed MRI scanning (99.4% of sample), (6) there was no evidence of obvious incidental neurologic- 
al abnormalities on MRI such as meningioma, cistern mass, venous anomaly (95.8% of sample), and (7) structural MRI scans were 
considered complete and readable by a neuroradiologist (98.8% of sample). In addition, in the MTBI group, participants were only 
included if (8) there was no evidence of intracranial abnormality that was considered to predate the current injury (97.1% of the 
MTBI sample). Similarly, in the TC group, participants were only included if (9) they had ≤1 white-matter hyperintensity 
(WMHIs [76.2% of TC sample]). Researchers have reported that healthy adults with two or more WMHIs have abnormalities 
on DTI metrics (distal from the hyperintensities) compared with adults with zero or one of hyperintensity (Iverson et al., 2011; 
Lange, Brickell, et al., 2013; Lange, Shewchuk, et al., 2013). Application of these criteria resulted in retaining 130 participants 
(39 TC, 91 MTBI [26 PCS-present, 65 PCS-absent]). 
Second, in order to control for the inﬂuence of age, handedness, and preinjury alcohol consumption, participants were further 
excluded if they were 50 years or older, left-handed, or whose preinjury alcohol consumption was considered to be unusually high 
(deﬁned as drinking .30 drinks per week and/or drinking ﬁve or more drinks per occasion during four or more days per week). 
These additional criteria were applied following an exploratory frequency analysis that identiﬁed a number of outliers that were 
considered to bias the analyses. Application of these criteria resulted in retaining 120 participants (39 TC and 81 MTBI [i.e., 22 
PCS-present, 59 PCS-absent]). 
Third, prior to DTI postprocessing, the MRI scans were inspected for image quality. Scans were excluded if they exhibited sig- 
niﬁcant motion artifact or brain coverage was inadequate. Application of these criteria resulted in retaining a ﬁnal sample of 108 
participants (36 TC and 72 MTBI [i.e., 20 PCS-present, 52 PCS-absent]). 
Some of the participants in this study were included in a previous study by Lange and colleagues (2012). In the current MTBI 
group, 54.2% (n ¼ 39) were included in the previous study. In the current TC group, 50.0% (n ¼ 18) were included in the original 
study. There were two primary reasons why participants from the original study were not included here. First, the inclusion of the 
neuropsychological variables in this study resulted in the exclusion of some participants due to unsuccessful test completion, poor 
English proﬁciency, and/or ﬂuctuating attention (i.e., criteria 1 – 4 above). Second, more stringent criteria was applied to the TC 
and MTBI groups in this study with regard to the structural MRI scans, in order to create “cleaner” groups (i.e., criteria 8 and 9 
above). 

Participants completed a 1-h MRI brain scan and a 5-h neuropsychological assessment battery that included measures of neu- 
rocognitive functioning and self-reported mental health and postconcussion symptoms, (cid:3)6 – 8 weeks postinjury (M ¼ 46.6 days, 
SD ¼ 6.0). All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Clinical Research Ethics Board at the University 
of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. 


Self-Reported symptoms. Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety 
Inventory (BAI), and the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI). The BDI-II (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 
1996) and BAI (Beck & Steer, 1993) are widely used measures designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. 
Total scores for each measure were obtained by summing the individual responses to all items on each scale separately. In addition, 
for the purposes of this study, an additional total score was calculated for the BDI-II using 10 selected symptoms that are believed to 
have the least overlap with symptoms of MTBI, and that are considered most representative of depression (i.e., BDI-II 10-item total 
score). These items included sadness, loss of interest, loss of pleasure, pessimism, past failure, guilt feelings, punishment feelings, 
self-criticalness, crying, and suicidal thoughts or wishes. The BDI-II 10-item total score was calculated by summing the responses 
to these 10 individual items. 
The BC-PSI (Iverson, Zasler, & Lange, 2007) is a symptom inventory designed based on ICD-10 (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2000) symptom criteria for PCS that requires the test taker to rate the frequency (0 ¼ “not at all” to 5 ¼ “constantly”) 
and intensity (0 ¼ “not at all” to 5 ¼ “very severe problem”) of 13 symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, sensi- 
tivity to noises, etc.) as well as the effect of three co-occurring life problems on daily living (i.e., effects of alcohol consumption, 
worrying/ dwelling on symptoms, and self-perception of brain damage). For each of the 13 symptoms, the two ratings are multi- 
plied together (frequency × intensity) to create a single score for each item. These product-based scores were then converted to 
item scores that reﬂect both the frequency and intensity of symptom endorsement (range ¼ 0 – 4). Item scores of 3 are interpreted as 
falling in the moderate range. 
Responses on the BC-PSI were classiﬁed into two categories based on ICD-10 criteria for PCS: (a) PCS-present and (b) 
PCS-absent. Participant responses were classiﬁed as PCS-present if they endorsed BC-PSI items as moderate or greater on ≥3 
of the six ICD-10 Category C criteria. Similarly, participant responses were classiﬁed as PCS-absent if they endorsed BC-PSI 
items as a moderate or greater on ,3 of the six ICD-10 Category C criteria. The percentages of patients who endorsed each in- 
dividual symptom domain were as follows: physical symptoms ¼ 28.7%, emotional symptoms ¼ 15.7%, cognitive symptoms ¼ 
16.7%, poor sleep ¼ 20.4%, sensitivity to alcohol ¼ 18.5%, and being overly focused on and concerned about their symptoms ¼ 
35.2%. 
It is important to appreciate that symptom endorsement on the BC-PSI cannot be used in isolation to evaluate whether a person 
meets ICD-10 criteria for PCS. The diagnosis of PCS is complicated, challenging, and requires a comprehensive clinical evalu- 
ation (see Iverson et al., 2013 for a comprehensive discussion). This was not done here. Rather, endorsement of BC-PSI items that 
meet ICD-10 symptom criteria for PCS simply reﬂects clinically elevated postconcussion symptom reporting and not a diagnosis 
per se. 
Neurocognitive measures. The neurocognitive measures consisted of 16 tests from the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery 
(NAB; Stern & White, 2003). The NAB is a comprehensive, co-normed (across all tests) neuropsychological test battery that con- 
sists of 24 individual tests designed to assess cognitive functioning across ﬁve domains: attention, language, memory, spatial, and 
executive functioning. The normative sample is large and the coverage of neuropsychological abilities assessed is broad. The NAB 
can be used in a ﬁxed or ﬂexible manner. Only 16 of the 24 tests were selected for use in order to reduce administration time. The 16 
selected tests result in 23 scores of interest. In order to reduce the number of cognitive variables for the analyses, the 23 scores of 
interest were used to generate index scores for each of the ﬁve cognitive domains. The Attention and Memory indexes were gen- 
erated as per the instructions in the manual. For the Language, Spatial, and Executive Functioning Indexes, however, not all tests 
included in these indexes were administered. As such, these indexes were prorated. These three indexes were calculated by gen- 
erating a prorated “sum of T-scores” which was converted to a standard score using the look-up table (i.e., Table 7.1) in the NAB 
normative manual (Stern & White, 2003). The prorated sum of T-scores for the three indexes was calculated by averaging the 
demographically adjusted T-scores across all available tests that are included in each index. The mean T-score was then multiplied 
by the number of subtests that are used to generate the full version of the index. For the Language Index, two of ﬁve possible subtests 
were used (i.e., Oral Production and Naming). For the Spatial Index, two of four possible subtests were used (i.e., Visual 
Discrimination and Design Construction). For the Executive Functioning Index, three of four possible subtests were used 
(Categories, Mazes, and Word Generation). A NAB Total Score Index was also generated using the standard scores derived 
for the ﬁve indexes above as per the instructions in the manual. 
As part of the larger neurocognitive test battery, participants were also administered the (a) Test of Memory Malingering 
(Tombaugh, 1996) to evaluate the possibility of poor effort during neuropsychological testing, (b) Reynolds Intellectual 
Screening Test (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2003) to assess current level of intellectual ability, and (c) Wechsler Test of Adult 
Reading (The Psychological Corporation, 2001) to assess premorbid level of intellectual ability. In addition, participants com- 
pleted a semi-structured interview designed to gather information about their past and present medical, psychiatric, and personal 
history. Detailed information regarding the duration of PTA was obtained during this interview and reconstructed, when possible, 
using collateral information obtained from hospital records. 


Neuroimaging. All MRI data were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3T scanner equipped with Dual Nova Gradients (maximum 
gradient strength 80 mT/m, max. slew rate 200 mT/m/s) and an eight-channel head coil. Partial parallel imaging was per- 
formed using sensitivity encoding (SENSE) (Pruessmann, Weiger, Scheidegger, & Boesiger, 1999). The total data acquisition 
time was 43 min. The MRI protocol included: (a) axial T2-weighted turbo spin echo scan (TR ¼ 3000 ms, TE ¼ 80 ms, ﬂip 
angle ¼ 908, acquisition matrix ¼ 320 × 245, ﬁeld of view ¼ 240 × 192 × 139 mm3, acquired voxel size ¼ 0.75 × 0.78 × 
4 mm3, reconstructed voxel size ¼ 0.47 × 0.47 × 4 mm3, SENSE factor of 1.2 along the left – right direction, 2 averages); (b) 
axial T2-weighted ﬂuid attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR] scan, TR ¼ 10,000 ms, TE ¼ 10 ms, acquisition matrix ¼ 
304 × 194, ﬁeld of view ¼ 240 × 193 × 139 mm3, acquired voxel size ¼ 0.79 × 0.99 × 4.00 mm3, reconstructed voxel 
size ¼ 0.47 × 0.47 × 4.00 mm3, SENSE factor of 1.6 along the left – right direction); and (c) DTI scan (TR ¼ 5618 ms, 
TE ¼ 75 ms, ﬂip angle ¼ 908, acquisition matrix ¼ 96 × 95, ﬁeld of view ¼ 240 × 240 × 125 mm3, acquired voxel size ¼ 
2.50 × 2.50 × 2.50 mm3, reconstructed voxel size ¼ 1.88 × 1.88 × 2.50 mm3, SENSE factor of 2.4 along the anterior – 
posterior direction, 15 diffusion directions, 3 averages, b factor ¼ 1,000 s/mm2). Sagittal 3D T1-weighted, axial 
T1-weighted spin echo, and axial and coronal 2D T2*-weighted gradient echo scans were also obtained but are not directly 
relevant to this study. 
The structural T1 and FLAIR images were reviewed by a board certiﬁed radiologist (JRS or MKSH) who determined whether 
any visible trauma-related intracranial pathology was present. Common pertinent MRI pathologies that were coded included 
number and location of susceptibility and T2 hyperintense foci, encephalomalacia, and extra-axial collections. 
Tract-based spatial statistics and randomize. The TBSS (Smith et al., 2006) and randomize (Winkler, Ridgway, Webster, 
Smith, & Nichols, 2014) part of the FMRIB Software Library (FSL, Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford, UK) (Smith et al., 
2004) were used for comparisons of FA, MD, AD, and RD. DTI sequences with poor ﬁeld-of-view resulting in signiﬁcant def- 
icits in whole brain coverage or artifacts were not considered in the analysis. Motion and artifacts in the diffusion data were 
corrected using afﬁne registration of all gradient volumes with the ﬁrst b ¼ 0 volume (FLIRT; FMRIB Software Library, 
Oxford, UK), and gradient directions were compensated for rotations (Landman et al., 2007). This was followed by creation 
of a manual brain mask based on the ﬁrst b ¼ 0 image using 3D Slicer version 2.7 (Gering et al., 2001). Voxel-based compar- 
isons (on the TBSS skeleton using randomize) of FA, MD, AD, and RD were performed using FSL Version 4.1.9 (Smith et al., 
2006). Brieﬂy, individual FA maps were nonlinearly registered via FSL-FNIRT to the Montreal Neurological Institute 
International Consortium Brain Mapping (ICBM)-152 template provided by FSL, followed by creation of a mean FA skeleton. 
Individual FA values were then projected onto this mean skeleton. MD, AD, and RD values were projected onto the same tem- 
plate using the previously created FA transformation. FA threshold was set to 0.35 and the number of permutations was set at 
5,000. The conservative threshold of 0.35 was chosen based on a visual inspection of the mean TBSS skeleton and represented 
the best qualitative compromise between skeletal continuity and peripheral white-matter inclusion. Threshold-free cluster 
enhancement with correction for family wise error rate was employed. The p , .05 T-contrast maps were projected on the 
mean FA images. To identify which speciﬁc anatomical areas were implicated, the mean FA skeleton and contrast map were 
overlaid with the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter label atlas (Hua et al., 2008; Mori, Wakana, 
Nagai-Poetscher, & va Zigl, 2005; Wakana et al., 2007). 
FSL statistics were then used to compute the mean FA values for each individual for each of the ROIs on the mean FA skeleton. 
Mean values for MD, AD, and RD were done similarly. Forty-eight individual ROIs were identiﬁed according to the JHU 
ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas (Hua et al., 2008; Mori et al., 2005; Wakana et al., 2007). 
The ROIs from the ICBM-DTI-81 atlas included the (a) genu, body, and splenium of corpus callosum; (b) pontine crossing tract, 
fornix, and middle cerebellar peduncle; and (c) two unilateral symmetrical ROIs (left/right) each for the corticospinal tract, medial 
lemniscus, inferior cerebellar peduncle, superior cerebellar peduncle, cerebral peduncle, anterior limb of internal capsule, poster- 
ior limb of internal capsule, retrolenticular part of internal capsule, anterior corona radiata, superior corona radiata, posterior 
corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, sagittal stratum, external capsule, cingulum (cingulate gyrus), cingulum (hippocam- 
pus), fornix/stria terminalis, superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and 
tapetum. 
Due to the large number of ROIs, four summary scores were calculated for each participant and used in all statistical analyses. 
The four summary scores represent the number of ROIs with FA, MD, AD, and RD values that fell below/above a speciﬁed cutoff 
score for each participant. Cutoff scores were identiﬁed by calculating the means and SD for FA, MD, AD, and RD values in each of 
the 48 ROIs based on DTI of 36 participants who were recruited for this study, that had sustained an orthopedic injury, but not a TBI. 
FA values that were .2 SDs below the mean, and MD, AD, and RD values that were .2 SDs above the mean, were classiﬁed as 
reﬂecting an ROI with “reduced white-matter integrity” (i.e., abnormal score). 




Descriptive statistics and group comparisons (using ANOVA and x2 analyses) of demographic and injury characteristics are 
presented in Table 1 (continuous variables) and Table 2 (categorical variables). In the MTBI group, there were no signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences between the PCS-present and PCS-absent group for GCS scores, duration of LOC, duration of PTA, intracranial abnor- 
mality on day-of-injury CT scans, or intracranial abnormality on MRI scans 6 – 8 weeks postinjury (range: p ¼ .233 – .999). When 
comparing the remaining variables across the three groups (i.e., PCS-present, PCS-absent, and TC), there were no signiﬁcant 
effects for age, education, gender, ethnicity, preinjury alcohol use, day-of-injury BAL, mechanism of injury, days tested postin- 
jury, current intellectual ability, or estimated premorbid intellectual ability (all p . .05). 
There was a signiﬁcantly greater proportion of women in the PCS-present group (45.0%) compared with men (21.2%; p ¼ 
.043). There was a signiﬁcantly greater proportion of individuals who were intoxicated at the time of injury in the PCS-absent 
group (76.0%) compared with those who were sober (52.4%; p ¼ .042). The effect sizes (phi-coefﬁcient; w) for these two ﬁndings 
were relatively small (i.e., gender: w¼ 0.24; intoxication: w¼ 0.22). Further, the PCS-absent group had a signiﬁcantly higher 
level of education, and higher BALs at the time of injury, compared with the TC group (both p , .05, d ¼ 0.51 and 0.50, respect- 
ively). 

Descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and Cohen’s effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) for the self-reported symptoms and neuro- 
cognitive measures, by group, are presented in Table 3. For the self-reported symptoms, there were signiﬁcant main effects (using 
Kruskal – Wallis H tests due to non-normal distribution) for the BC-PSI total, BAI total, and BDI-II total scores. As expected, pair- 
wise comparisons (using Mann –Whitney U-tests) revealed that the PCS-present group had higher total scores on the BC-PSI, BAI, 
and BDI-II compared with both the PCS-absent group (d ¼ 1.63 – 1.89 [Of course, the signiﬁcant difference between the 
PCS-present and PCS-absent group for the BC-PSI total score is not meaningful. This group difference is a direct consequence 
of group classiﬁcation. As such, the Cohen’s effect size for this comparison is not reported here.], very large effect sizes) and 
TC group (d ¼ 1.22 – 2.46, very large effect sizes). There were no signiﬁcant differences, or substantial effect sizes, when com- 
paring the PCS-absent group and TC group across the three measures. 
For the neurocognitive variables, there were no signiﬁcant main effects (using ANOVA) for the NAB Total Index (p ¼ .761) or 
for the ﬁve NAB Indexes (range: p ¼ .138 – .810). Pairwise comparisons revealed no signiﬁcant differences between groups, 
though there were a number of meaningful effect sizes. There was a trend for the PCS-present group to have better scores on 
the Language Index compared with the PCS-absent group (d ¼ 0.50, medium effect size). There was a trend for the 
PCS-absent group to have better scores on the Attention, Memory, and Language Indexes compared with the TC group (d ¼ 
0.25 – 0.34, small – medium effect sizes). 
Comparison of the prevalence of the number of low neurocognitive scores was undertaken by considering all 23 individual 
NAB measures simultaneously. The cumulative percentages of the number of low scores (using ,16th and ,10th percentile

as cutoff scores) by group are presented in Table 4. Using x2 analyses, there were no signiﬁcant differences in the percentage of 
patients that had multiple low scores across groups. However, there were a number of notable comparisons that approached sig- 
niﬁcance. Using a ,16th percentile cutoff score: (a) 15.0% of PCS-present group had 3 or more low scores, compared with 38.5% 
of PCS-absent group (p ¼ .056), and 33.3% of TC group; and (b) 40.0% of PCS-present group had 2 or more low scores, compared 
with 66.7% of TC group (p ¼ .053), and 57.7% of PCS-absent group. Therefore, there was a trend for the PCS-present group to 
perform better across the battery of neuropsychological tests than the other two groups.

Tract-based spatial statistics analysis. The TC group was compared with the PCS-absent group on DTI measures of FA, MD, AD, 
and RD using TBSS. There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences (using t-tests) between the groups in FA, MD, AD, or RD at 
the p , .05 level. 
TBSS comparisons between the PCS-present group and the TC group revealed multiple areas of signiﬁcant differences 
(using t-tests) in MD and RD. RD was signiﬁcantly increased (p , .05) in the PCS-present group in widespread areas including 
the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum; bilateral anterior, superior, and posterior corona radiata; bilateral superior 
longitudinal fasciculus; bilateral cingulum; bilateral posterior thalamic radiations; bilateral anterior limb of the internal 
capsule; and bilateral external capsule (see Fig. 1). MD values were also signiﬁcantly increased (p , .05) in the 
PCS-present group in the genu and body of the corpus callosum, bilateral superior corona radiata, right anterior corona 
radiata, right anterior and posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (see Fig. 2). 
No signiﬁcant differences were observed for AD values, although a trend (p , .10) of decreased FA in the PCS+ group was 
noted in multiple regions (data not shown). 


Fig. 1. Tract-based spatial statistics lightbox comparing MTBI-PCS-present patients and controls on RD. Voxels highlighted in yellow/orange indicated areas of 
signiﬁcant increase in RD at the p , .05 level in the MTBI-PCS-present patients. Neuroanatomical areas where signiﬁcant increases were noted include the genu, 
body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, bilateral anterior, superior and posterior corona radiata, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral cingulum, 
bilateral posterior thalamic radiations, bilateral anterior limb of the internal capsule, and bilateral external capsule. 
The PCS-absent group was then compared with the PCS-present group on the four DTI indices. There were no statistically signiﬁcant 
differences in FA, MD, AD, or RD. In summary, TBSS revealed signiﬁcant white-matter differences between the PCS-present group and 
the TC group. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the PCS-absent group and the TC group, or between the two MTBI groups. 


Fig. 2. Tract-based spatial statistics lightbox comparing MTBI-PCS-present patients and controls on MD. Voxels highlighted in yellow/orange indicated areas of 
signiﬁcant increase in MD at the p , .05 level in the MTI-PCS-present group. Neuroanatomical areas where signiﬁcant increases were observed included genu and 
body of the corpus callosum, bilateral superior corona radiata, right anterior corona radiata, right anterior and posterior limb of the internal capsule and the right 
superior longitudinal fasciculus. 
Region of interest analyses. An atlas-based multivariate ROI analysis, based on 48 regions, was conducted by determining the 
number of abnormal areas of white matter in each individual as deﬁned by mean DTI values that were .2 SDs from the means 
of the TC group. Descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and Cohen’s effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) for the number of abnormal 


FA, AD, RD, and MD brain regions, by group, are presented in Table 5. There were no signiﬁcant main effects (Kruskal – Wallis H 
tests) for the number of regions with abnormal FA, AD, RD, or MD across the three groups. However, pairwise comparisons 
(Mann – Whitney U tests) revealed that participants in the PCS-present group had a statistically (p , .05) greater number of loca- 
tions with abnormal RD and MD compared with the TC group (d ¼ 0.36 [small– medium effect size] and d ¼ 0.56 [medium effect 
size], respectively). Although not statistically signiﬁcant (p ¼ 0.056), there was also a medium effect size (d ¼ 0.45) found for the 
number of regions with abnormal FA between these two groups (i.e., PCS-present .TC). Similarly, there was a medium effect size 
(d ¼ 0.49) found for the number of regions of abnormal MD between the TC group and the PCS-absent group. There was a non- 
signiﬁcant trend for the PCS-absent group to have a greater number of abnormal MD regions compared with the TC group (p ¼ 
.073). There were no signiﬁcant differences when comparing the number of abnormal FA, AD, RD, or MD scores across the 
PCS-present and PCS-absent groups. The largest effect sizes were found for FA and AD (d ¼ 0.25 and 0.23, respectively) 
between these groups. 
The cumulative percentages of the number of abnormal FA, AD, RD, and MD regions by group are presented in Tables 6 and 7. 
Using x2 analyses, there were signiﬁcant pairwise comparisons when comparing the PCS-present and TC groups on FA, RD, and 
MD, but not AD. For FA, the proportion of the PCS-present group that had two or more (50.0%) abnormal areas was signiﬁcantly 
greater (p ¼ .033) compared with the TC group (22.2%). Similarly, the proportion of the PCS-present group that had three or more 
(35.0%) abnormal areas was signiﬁcantly greater (p ¼ .041; Fisher’s exact test) compared with the TC group (11.1%). For RD, 
there was a statistically greater proportion of the PCS-present group that had one or more abnormal areas (65.0%, p ¼ .038) and 
two or more abnormal areas (50.0%, p ¼ .008) when compared with the TC group (36.1% and 16.7%, respectively). For MD, the

Notes: N ¼ 108 (mild TBI PCS-absent, n ¼ 52; mild TBI PCS-present, n ¼ 20; TC, n ¼ 36) 
aTable has been limited to 15 or more scores. 
proportion of the PCS-present group that had one or more (60.0%) abnormal brain regions was signiﬁcantly greater (p ¼ .032) 
compared with the TC group (30.6%). 
There were some signiﬁcant differences when comparing the PCS-absent and TC groups on MD, but not FA, RD, and AD. 
There was a statistically greater proportion of the PCS-absent group that had four or more abnormal areas on MD (23.1%, p ¼ 
.037; Fisher’s exact test) and ﬁve or more abnormal areas on MD (19.2%, p ¼ .024; Fisher’s exact test) compared with the TC 
group (5.6% and 2.8%, respectively). There was a nonsigniﬁcant trend (p ¼ .063) towards a greater proportion of the 
PCS-absent group to have two or more (34.6%) brain areas with abnormal RD compared with the TC group (16.7%). 
There were no signiﬁcant differences when comparing the PCS-present and PCS-absent groups for FA, RD, MD, and AD. There 
was, however, a nonsigniﬁcant trend (p ¼ .066) towards a greater proportion of the PCS-present group to have three or more 
(35.0%) abnormal areas on FA compared with the PCS-absent group (15.4%). 
Extended region of interest analyses. Based on the results of the TBSS analyses, further exploratory multivariate ROI analyses 
were undertaken using only those DTI metrics and ROIs that were identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly different between some groups (i.e., 19 
ROIs for RD [see Fig. 1], and 8 ROIs for MD [see Fig. 2]). The number of abnormal areas of white matter was calculated for each 
individual across the select ROIs and was compared across the three groups. There were signiﬁcant main effects (Kruskal – Wallis 
H tests) for the number of abnormal RD regions (p ¼ .029), but not MD regions (p ¼ .131). Pairwise comparisons (Mann – 
Whitney U tests) revealed that participants in both the MTBI groups had a signiﬁcantly greater (p , .05) number of abnormal 
RD regions (i.e., PCS-absent: M ¼ 0.9, SD ¼ 2.1; PCS-present: M ¼ 1.5, SD ¼ 3.6) compared with the TC group (M ¼ 0.5, 
SD ¼ 1.8; d ¼ 0.22 and 0.39, respectively). There were no signiﬁcant differences between the PCS-present and PCS-absent 
groups (p . .05, d ¼ 0.20, small effect size). 
Examination of the cumulative percentages of the number of brain regions with abnormal RD and MD by group (data not 
shown; available on request from RTL) revealed no signiﬁcant pairwise differences across the three groups for the percentage 
of patients that had multiple abnormal MD or RD regions. The one exception to this was for RD. The proportion of the 
PCS-present group (45.0%) and PCS-absent group (30.8%) that had one or more abnormal RD regions was signiﬁcantly 
higher (p , .05) compared with the TC group (11.1%). There were no signiﬁcant differences between the PCS-present and 
PCS-absent groups. 

To examine which factors provide the most unique contribution towards the prediction of postconcussion symptom reporting, 
logistic regression analyses were undertaken to determine if select factors could identify participants in the PCS-present versus 


PCS-absent groups. Factors were selected were as follows: (i) gender, (ii) education, (iii) BDI-II 10-item total score, (iv) BAI total 
score, and (v) the total number of abnormal FA and MD scores combined. For the logistic regression analysis, all ﬁve factors were 
entered simultaneously as the independent variables and group membership as the dependent variable. 
Only two of the six variables were signiﬁcant predictors of group membership (depression [p ¼ .043] and BAI total [p ¼ .043]) 
accounting for 52.1% of the variance (Nagelkerke R2; p , .001). Overall, 83.3% of participants were correctly classiﬁed using 
depression and BAI total scores alone. However, classiﬁcation rates were substantially higher when predicting the PCS-absent 
group (94.2%) compared with the PCS-present group (55.0%). No DTI metrics entered the prediction model. 

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between DTI and postconcussion symptom reporting following 
MTBI. There were three hypotheses. First, compared with the TC group, patients in both the MTBI groups would (a) report a 
greater number of depression, anxiety, and postconcussion symptoms; (b) perform comparably on neurocognitive measures; 
and (c) have reduced white-matter integrity in the brain as measured by DTI metrics. Second, in the MTBI group, patients who 
met ICD-10 criteria for PCS would report a greater number of depression and anxiety symptoms compared with those who did 
not meet criteria for PCS. Third, in the MTBI group, there would be no differences across all neurocognitive measures and 
DTI metrics when comparing those patients who are classiﬁed as PCS-present versus PCS-absent. 

Consistent with the ﬁrst hypothesis, compared with the TC group, the PCS-present group (a) reported a greater number of de- 
pression, anxiety, and postconcussion symptoms; (b) had multiple regions of the brain with signiﬁcant differences in MD and RD 
using TBSS (but not AD or FA); and (c) had a greater number of brain regions with abnormal RD and MD (but not AD or FA) using 
ROI analyses. In contrast, these differences were not found when comparing the PCS-absent and TC groups. Although the 
PCS-absent group had a greater number of abnormal MD regions compared with the TC group, there were no group differences 
when comparing (a) all DTI measures using TBSS, (b) FA, AD, and RD measures using ROI analyses, and (c) measures of 
depression, anxiety, and postconcussion symptoms. 
Fractional anisotropy is a representation of the directional coherence (anisotropy) of water diffusion, and MD represents the 
average total diffusion of water within a particular voxel, irrespective of direction. Mean diffusivity values generally increase, 
and FA values decrease in response to white-matter injury (Hulkower, Poliak, Rosenbaum, Zimmerman, & Lipton, 2013). 
Radial diffusivity represents the diffusion of water perpendicular to the axon, and thus is thought to be sensitive to processes 
such as demyelination (Mac Donald, Dikranian, Bayly, Holtzman, & Brody, 2007). AD represents the diffusivity parallel to 
the axon and hence changes in AD are thought to indicate axonal compromise (Mac Donald et al., 2007). Therefore, an explanation 
for our results is that the PCS+ group showed evidence of white-matter compromise (increased MD) mainly via a membrane in- 
tegrity mechanism (increased RD). This is consistent with other research showing increased RD in the subacute period (Hulkower 
et al., 2013; Mac Donald et al., 2007). 
TBSS revealed a nonsigniﬁcant trend to lower FA values in the PCS+ groups. Given that increases in mean and RD generally 
result in lower FA (because they are interrelated mathematical derivations), the nonsigniﬁcant ﬁndings for FA values could result 
from insufﬁcient sample size, or simply that MD is a more sensitive measure of white-matter integrity during the subacute period, 
as has been observed in other studies (Hulkower et al., 2013). 
It is possible that some of the differences in DTI metrics in this study between the PCS-present and TC groups could be related, at 
least in part, to the inﬂuence of depression and anxiety on physiology, rather than differences in the microstructure of white-matter 
attributable to differences in biomechanical forces applied to the brain. Numerous studies have shown that depression and other 
affective disorders are associated with white-matter abnormalities as identiﬁed by DTI. In a systematic review of DTI studies in 
affective disorders, Sexton, Mackay, and Ebmeier (2009) concluded that “21 of 27 studies found signiﬁcantly lower [fractional] 
anisotropy in subjects with affective disorders compared to control subjects” (p. 814). 
Nonetheless, the DTI results in this study are relatively consistent with some past studies that have compared controls with 
MTBI groups divided into PCS-present/absent groups. For example, Messe´ et al. (2011) found that MTBI patients who were clas- 
siﬁed as having persistent PCS from ,1 month to 3 months postinjury (but not those whose symptoms had improved) had higher 
MD scores compared with a healthy controls in some ROIs (i.e., superior longitudinal fasciculus, corticospinal tract bilaterally, 
and left anterior thalamic radiation). In another study, Messe et al. (2012) reported that compared with healthy controls, MTBI 
patients who met criteria for ICD-10 PCS ,1 month and 6 months postinjury had a greater number of abnormal brain regions 
compared with those who did not meet ICD-10 PCS criteria. 


Also consistent with the ﬁrst hypothesis, there were no signiﬁcant differences on the neurocognitive measures when comparing 
the TC group with both MTBI groups. This ﬁnding was not surprising or unexpected. Patients with MTBI perform poorly on neuro- 
psychological tests in the initial days (e.g., Hughes et al., 2004; Lovell, Collins, Iverson, Johnston, & Bradley, 2004) and up to the 
ﬁrst month following the injury (e.g., Levin et al., 1987; Ponsford et al., 2000), but cognitive deﬁcits typically are not seen after 1 – 3 
months (e.g., Gentilini et al., 1985; Ponsford et al., 2000) in prospective group studies. This has been illustrated repeatedly 
in reviews and meta-analyses (e.g., McCrea et al., 2009; Rohling, Larrabee, & Millis, 2012). In our study, we examined patients 
at 6 – 8 weeks postinjury. Although this time period falls in the middle of when we might expect most, but certainly not all, patients 
to have normal performance on neuropsychological tests; it is our expectation that there would be no measurable group differences 
on neuropsychological testing at this time. 

In support of the second hypothesis, those individuals in the MTBI group who were classiﬁed as PCS-present at 6– 8 weeks 
postinjury reported a greater number of depression and anxiety symptoms on the BAI and BDI-II compared with those patients 
who were classiﬁed as PCS-absent. The effect sizes were very large (d ¼ 1.63 and 1.89, respectively). Of course, the relationship 
between postconcussion symptoms and depression and anxiety found here is not new. Many researchers have reported a strong 
relation between postconcussion symptoms and other self-reported mental health problems. In a military context, the relation 
between postconcussion symptoms and depression or PTSD symptoms following MTBI is well established (e.g., Lange, 
Brickel, et al., 2013; Lange, Shewchuk, et al., 2013; Lange et al., 2014). Similarly, in a civilian context, the relationship 
between postconcussion symptoms and depression and anxiety following MTBI is also well established (Bryant & Harvey, 
1999; Garden & Sullivan, 2010). 
Consistent with the third hypothesis, there were no signiﬁcant differences between those patients in the MTBI group that were 
PCS-present versus PCS-absent across all neurocognitive measures and DTI metrics. The DTI results reported in this study are 
consistent with some research that has also found no group differences in DTI metrics when an MTBI sample is divided into 
ICD-10 PCS-present versus PCS-absent groups at 3-week postinjury (Waljas et al., 2014) and 6 – 8 weeks postinjury (Lange 
et al., 2012). Of course, these results are not consistent with other studies that have reported differences between MTBI groups 
when divided into PCS-present versus PCS-absent groups at 3 months (Messe´ et al., 2011) and 6 months (Hartikainen et al., 
2010; Messe et al., 2012) postinjury. Collectively, based on these results, one might argue that differences between 
PCS-present versus PCS-absent groups are more likely to be detectable after 3 months following injury. However, contrary to 
this, in a longitudinal study by Messe et al. (2012), these authors concluded that there were “signiﬁcant structural differences” 
found between PCS-present versus PCS-absent groups at ,1 month postinjury, but less at 6-month postinjury. 

This study has several methodological limitations. First, TBSS is a conservative DTI approach that we chose because we had no 
a priori hypothesis that some regions would be affected over others. Other approaches that interrogate speciﬁc regions, such as 
user-deﬁned track selection or probabilistic tractography may indeed be more sensitive than a full brain analysis, if driven by a 
well-informed hypothesis. Second, this study does not address medium- or long-term postconcussion symptom reporting, nor 
did it address the course of recovery following MTBI. Longitudinal studies would assist in understanding the role of microstruc- 
tural white-matter abnormality on the short-, medium-, and long-term outcome from MTBI. There are no such studies reported in 
adults to date. Third, although the focus of this study was on the relationship between postconcussion symptom reporting and DTI, 
it is not possible to exclude the inﬂuence of other factors that may have had a contributory role (e.g., persistent pain [Smith-Seemiller, 
Fow, Kant, & Franzen, 2003], “good old days” bias [Gunstad & Suhr, 2001], diagnosis threat [Suhr & Gunstad, 2002a], etc.). 
However, we did include TC patients (rather than a healthy control group) because these patients tend to share more preinjury char- 
acteristics to their head-injured counterparts (Dikmen, Machamer, Winn, & Temkin, 1995). As such, the potential bias of these factors 
inﬂuencing the results in one group, but not the other, is mitigated. Fourth, there were a greater proportion of women in this sample 
who met ICD-10 criteria for PCS compared with men. Nearly, 1 in 2 women met symptom criteria for PCS compared with 1 in 5 men. 
This is consistent with research that has found increased postconcussion symptom reporting in women compared with men (e.g., 
Meares et al., 2008). It is possible that sex differences inﬂuenced the results of this study. Fifth, it would be a mistake to assume 
that the results from this study generalize to all people who sustain an MTBI. Our patients were recruited from a Level 1 trauma 
center. The majority of people who sustain an MTBI in daily life are not evaluated in the Emergency Department of a hospital 
(Sosin, Sniezek, & Thurman, 1996). Our patients had clear evidence of an MTBI. The vast majority of our patients underwent 
day-of-injury CT scanning and a substantial minority had a day-of-injury intracranial abnormality. Therefore, the patient sample 
used in this study represents a minority of the more seriously injured MTBI population. 



Following an MTBI, there is no doubt that many people experience a range of postconcussion symptoms (e.g., headaches, diz- 
ziness, fatigue, and cognitive difﬁculties). These symptoms typically resolve within the ﬁrst few days, weeks, or months for most 
people. However, for some people, these symptoms are reported many months or years postinjury. In this study, symptoms of de- 
pression and anxiety differentiated patients with MTBIs who met criteria for the postconcussion symptom versus those who did 
not. In contrast, these groups did not differ on diverse metrics of DTI. These ﬁndings once again highlight that there are many 
factors that can potentially account for postconcussion symptom reporting, even in the ﬁrst 6 –8 weeks of recovery. It has been 
recommended that postconcussion symptom reporting be viewed from a biopsychosocial perspective (Iverson et al., 2013). 
That is, there are a diverse range of biopsychosocial factors (i.e., pre-, peri-, and postinjury factors) that can inﬂuence the perception 
and reporting of symptoms long after an MTBI.
