The Association Between the Postconcussion Symptoms 
and Clinical Outcomes for Patients With Mild Traumatic 
Brain Injury 
Chi-Cheng Yang, MS, Yong-Kwang Tu, MD, PhD, Mau-Sun Hua, PhD, and Sheng-Jean Huang, MD 
Background: Postconcussion symp- 
toms (PCS) (such as dizziness, headache, ir- 
ritability, fatigue, and impaired memory) 
are common in patients who sustain a mild 
traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, 
few studies have systematically investigated 
the association between PCS and clinical 
outcomes in mTBI patients. Therefore, the 
present study attempted to examine PCS 
during the disease course and to determine 
whether PCS adversely affect outcome. 
Methods: This was a prospective, co- 
hort and controlled study of 115 mTBI 
patients. The PCS checklist was used to 
identify PCS and the Glasgow Outcome 
Scale and the Glasgow Outcome Scale- 
Extended were used to investigate clinical 
outcomes. All patients were evaluated 
four times: at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 
and 8 weeks after the injury. 
Results: Physical symptoms such as 
dizziness and headache were prominent in 
the early after injury stage (1 and 2 
weeks). On the other hand, the psychoso- 
cial symptoms, such as depression and ir- 
ritability, were significant at the late after 
injury stage (4 and 8 weeks). Dizziness 
adversely affected clinical outcome at both 
the early and late stages of the disease, 
whereas the impact of intracranial lesions 
and depression on outcome was greatest 
early and late, respectively. 
Conclusions: The results show that 
PCS during the disease course and the 
relationship between PCS and clinical out- 
come can be systematically evaluated. In 
fact, different postconcussion symptom 
domains should be monitored while the 
disease is progressing.

problem with an annual incidence of 1.5 to 2 million 
people in the United States, of which an estimated 
70,000 to 90,000 cases result 
in remarkable functional 
impairments.1 Some western studies2,3 concluded that mild 
TBI (mTBI) accounts for 90% of TBIs whereas there were 
77% to 82% TBIs classified as mild severity group in Tai- 
wanese literature.4,5 In Taiwan, the incidence rate of mTBI in 
2004 was 728 people per 100,000, which meant more than 
160,000 people had suffered from this problem.6 Several 
studies7–9 further evidenced that lost productive work time 
after mTBI may be the largest component of economic costs 
of brain trauma. 
The postconcussion symptoms (PCS) are common com- 
plaints after mTBI. Rutherford10 reported that the most com- 
mon acute complaints were physical problems (headache and 
dizziness) that occurred early, whereas the most common 
chronic ones were psychosocial difficulties (depression and

memory impairment) that occurred late in the illness. Al- 
though most mTBI patients recover quickly, usually within 3 
months after injury, many studies11–15 have identified a small 
proportion of patients who continue to have difficulties more 
than 1 year after head trauma. In fact, the persistent cognitive 
and emotional disturbances are often considered potential risk 
factors for lifetime disability.16 –18 
Surprisingly, few researchers have explored the relation- 
ship between PCS and clinical outcome. Moreover, their studies 
had some methodological drawbacks. Most were cross-sectional 
studies. Thus, although Chamelian and Feinstein19 found that 
dizziness was an adverse predictor of patients’ clinical outcomes 
at 6 months after mTBI, their study failed to distinguish between 
early and late PCS owing to its cross-sectional nature. Moreover, 
though commonly used to assess clinical outcomes of severe 
TBI patients, the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)20 might not be 
suitable for mTBI patients. In fact, the GOS was shown clini- 
cally to be constrained by a significant ceiling effect and thus 
was unable to effectively differentiate between PCS and clinical 
outcomes. 
The present study tried to resolve these methodological 
problems. First, the authors regularly followed mTBI patients 
immediately after injury to 2 months after injury. In addition, 
we used the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)21,22 
to place greater emphasis on assessment of the TBI patients’ 
social and family relationships, which are possible predictors 
of patient prognosis. Hence, the purpose of the study was to 
explore the relationship of PCS and clinical outcome system- 
atically. Two sets of hypotheses needed to be tested. First, in 
our mTBI patients, the specific PCS would manifest differently

between the earlier and later after injury stages. Second, the 
clinical outcomes of the earlier and later after injury stages 
would be adversely affected by specific PCS, respectively. 
METHODS 
Participants 
During a period of 15 months (January 2004 to March 
2005), 130 mTBI patients were followed up in the clinic. 
Fifteen patients were excluded and 115 patients with mTBI 
participated in this study. The diagnosis of mTBI was made 
in a Level 1 trauma center by a neurosurgeon and was based 
on the guidelines of mTBI management proposed by Servadei 
et al.23 Accordingly, patients with the following criteria were 
included in the present study: (1) initial GCS score of 14/15 
and (2) initial loss of consciousness of less than 30 minutes. 
The demographic data of the patients are shown in Table 1. 
As a control group, we recruited healthy volunteers with no 
history of significant brain injury or neurologic disorders and 
with a mean age similar to that of the patients (34.85 years (cid:1) 
13.40, t [153] (cid:2) (cid:3)0.63, p (cid:4) 0.05). 
The recruitment and follow-up of the mTBI patients 
discharged from the emergency room or hospital took place 
in a specific neurosurgery clinic. All patients with a history of 
suspected psychiatric problems, cerebrovascular insults, or 
other major medical illnesses (e.g. brain tumors, thyroid dys- 
function, etc.) were excluded. 

The description of PCS in our study matched that de- 
scribed in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 
10) clinical diagnosis of PCS (code F07.2).24 The symptoms 
included headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, insomnia, 
difficulty with concentration or memory, emotional liability, 
alcohol abuse, and stress intolerance. Accordingly, the au- 
thors designed a PCS screening instrument, known as the 
Checklist of Postconcussion Symptoms (CPCS), for clinical 
use. This instrument was used to assess the severity of 16 
commonly reported PCS, including headache, dizziness, fa- 
tigue, nausea, vomiting, poor vision, tinnitus, loss of energy, 
depression, irritability, insomnia, anxiety, attention deficits, 
memory impairments, psychomotor slowing, and other dis- 
turbances. All participants were asked, “Did any of the fol- 
lowing symptoms reduce your ability to work or make you 
sick in the past week?” If patients manifested any symptoms 
in the scale, an examiner (a clinical neuropsychologist) 
scored “1” for each item they reported. The sum of those 
checked items represented the total PCS score for that patient. 

Many past studies have reported that mTBI patients 
manifest many cognitive and emotional disturbances though 
their GOS-evaluated outcomes are still favorable. Hence, the 
GOSE, which uses an eight-point ordinal scale and a semi- 
structured interview, was developed to evaluate patients’ 
clinical outcomes. The GOS and the GOSE are shown in 
Table 2. The main difference between the GOS and the 
GOSE is that the latter also assesses patients’ social activities 
and family relationships. Moreover, the examiner had to 
evaluate patients’ before and after injury conditions to make 
an intrapersonal comparison. 

When the patients were discharged from the emergency 
department or the hospital, they were prospectively evaluated 
using the CPCS, GOS, and GOSE at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 
month, and 2 months after injury. Because some patients did 
not need to be followed up continuously, the authors con- 
ducted their after-injury evaluations by telephone. The study 
protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of 
participating institutions, and the patients gave informed con- 
sent after the study requirements were explained. 

The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post 
hoc analysis using Scheffe’s procedure, Spearman’s correla- 
tion, (cid:1)2 test, and logistic regression were used to evaluate 
differences between groups. Statistical significance was de- 
fined as a probability value of less than 0.05. Commercially

least one 
postconcussion symptom. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 3, 
a variety of symptoms appeared 1 week after injury including 
dizziness (in 74% of the patients), headache (45%), fatigue 
(24%), attentional deficits (14%), and nausea (14%). At 2 
weeks after injury, 55% of the patients still had a least one PC 
symptom: dizziness (45%), headache (20%), or 
fatigue 
(14%). Less than 7% of the patients reported other PCS, such 
as nausea, attention deficit, and depression. 
At the 4- and 8-week postinjury evaluations, 23% and 
13%, respectively, had at least one symptom. Moreover, most 
symptoms (except dizziness in 18% of patients) were dimin- 
ished at 4 weeks after injury. At the 8-week postinjury eval- 
uation, 94% of the patients had no postconcussion symptom. 
Did the PCS Adversely Affect Clinical Outcome? 
One Week After Injury 
To analyze the relationship between PCS and clinical 
outcome, patients were divided into two groups: those with a 
GOSE score of 8 (the “good recovery” group) and those with 
a GOSE score of less than 8 (the “poor recovery” group). All 
patients had favorable clinical outcomes based on GOS score 
(GOS (cid:2) 5). 
As shown in Table 4, one-way ANOVA found a significant 
main effect of groups on PCS scores, and a post hoc analysis 
using Scheffe’s procedure found a significant main effect of 
groups on the total PCS scores (F (cid:2) 16.99, p (cid:5) 0.001). In fact,

significantly more total PCS presented in both the good and the 
poor recovery groups than in the control group, and presented in 
the poor recovery group than in the good recovery group. Mean- 
while, the Spearman’s correlation study revealed that mTBI 
patients with more PCS had poorer outcomes, as measured by 
the GOSE (r (cid:2) (cid:3)0.40, p (cid:5) 0.01). As for the impacts of 
individual PCS on clinical outcome, (cid:1)2 analysis showed that 
headache ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 6.27, p (cid:5) 0.01), dizziness ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 16.67, p (cid:5) 
0.001), and nausea ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 5.14, p (cid:5) 0.05) were strongly asso- 
ciated with GOSE rating. Moreover, the logistic regression anal- 
ysis (Table 5) revealed much more headache and dizziness in the 
poor and good recovery groups than in the control. Therefore, 
intracranial lesions had an adverse impact on GOSE score ((cid:2)(cid:2) 
(cid:3)0.25, p (cid:5) 0.01). 

As shown in Table 4, although 76% of the mTBI patients 
recovered well, one-way ANOVA revealed a significant main 
effect of groups on PCS, and a post hoc analysis with Scheffe’s 
procedure showed that significantly more PCS were present 
in the poor recovery group than the control group (F (cid:2) 16.95, 
p (cid:5) 0.001). Furthermore, Spearman’s correlation study showed 
that mTBI patients with more PCS had poorer outcomes, as 
measured by the GOSE (r (cid:2) (cid:3)0.48, p (cid:5) 0.05). As for the 
impacts of individual PCS on clinical outcome, (cid:1)2 analysis 
indicated that headache ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 12.09, p (cid:5) 0.01) and dizziness 
((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 24.50, p (cid:5) 0.001) individually were still markedly asso- 
ciated with GOSE score. Logistic regression analysis (Table 5) 
found significantly more dizziness in the good and poor recov- 
ery groups than in the control. In addition, anxiety ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 5.77, 
p (cid:5) 0.05), fatigue ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 10.27, p (cid:5) 0.01), loss of energy ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 
16.24, p (cid:5) 0.001), and irritability ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 12.88, p (cid:5) 0.001) were 
all markedly associated with GOSE rating. As found at 1 week 
after injury, the intracranial lesions had a negative effect on 
GOSE score ((cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3)0.41, p (cid:5) 0.05). 

At 4 weeks after injury, 88% mTBI patients were recover- 
ing well. The one-way ANOVA found a significant main effect 
of groups on PCS, and a post hoc analysis with Scheffe’s 
procedure found significantly more PCS were present in the 
poor recovery group than the control group (F (cid:2) 7.88, p (cid:5) 
0.01). Furthermore, Spearman’s correlation revealed that 
mTBI patients with more PCS had poorer outcome, as mea- 
sured by the GOSE (r (cid:2) (cid:3)0.60, p (cid:5) 0.05). As for the impacts 
of individual PCS on the clinical outcomes, (cid:1)2 analysis 
showed that dizziness ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 30.19, p (cid:5) 0.001), fatigue ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 
4.09, p (cid:5) 0.05), and irritability ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 7.28, p (cid:5) 0.01) 
remained markedly associated with GOSE score. Logistic 
regression analysis (Table 5) found more dizziness in the 
poor recovery group than in the control. Attention deficit 
((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 8.56, p (cid:5) 0.01) was significantly associated with 
GOSE score, and intracranial lesions had an adverse impact 
on GOSE score ((cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3)0.33, p (cid:5) 0.01). 

Most patients (97%) had recovered well by 8 weeks after 
injury. Moreover, one-way ANOVA revealed a significant 
main effect on PCS, and a post hoc analysis with Scheffe’s 
procedure showed significantly more PCS were present in the 
poor recovery group than the control group (F (cid:2) 5.97, p (cid:5) 
0.01). The Spearman’s correlation showed that mTBI patients 
with more PCS had poorer outcome, as measured by the 
GOSE (r (cid:2) (cid:3)0.26, p (cid:5) 0.01). As for the impacts of indi- 
vidual PCS on the clinical outcomes, the (cid:1)2 analysis showed 
that headache ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 4.00, p (cid:5) 0.05), dizziness ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 4.00, 
p (cid:5) 0.05), fatigue ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 4.92, p (cid:5) 0.05), poor vision ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 
75.98, p (cid:5) 0.001), nausea ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 37.66, p (cid:5) 0.001), and 
depression ((cid:1)2 (cid:2) 37.66, p (cid:5) 0.001) were significantly asso- 
ciated with GOSE score. As at 4 weeks after injury, logistic 
regression analysis revealed the presence of more dizziness in 
the poor recovery group than the control (Table 5). Surpris- 
ingly, intracranial lesions and GOSE score were not associ- 
ated ((cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3)0.06, p (cid:4) 0.05). 
DISCUSSION 
Definition of mTBI 
The definition of mTBI is controversial.25–32 In most 
studies to date,33–36 mTBI patients had GCS scores of 13/15. 
However, Tellier and colleagues37 suggested that patients 
who had “mild head injury” were not a homogeneous group. 


The studies of Hsiang et al.38 and Hsiang39 further supported 
this point of view. They considered the pathophysiology of 
mTBI in these patients was heterogeneous and recommended 
subdivision of head injury patients with GCS scores of 13/15 
into a “mild head injury” and “high-risk mild head injury” 
groups. “Real” mild head injury was defined as GCS score of 
15 without any acute positive radiographic findings. In addi- 
tion, Uchino et al.,35 while confirming the results of previous 
studies, favored exclusion of patients with GCS score of 13 
from the mild head injury category, because of a high inci- 
dence of brain damage on computed tomography scans in 
those patients. Hence, to avoid the ambiguity associated with 
heterogeneity of pathophysiology, our study included only 
mTBI patients with GCS score of 14/15. 

The prospective design of our study permitted us to show 
significant association between PCS and disease course. Un- 
like past studies,10,13 which reported headache as the most 
common symptom after mTBI, our study found dizziness was 
the most prominent and persistent. In contrast to most past 
studies, which were cross-sectional, our prospective cohort study 
revealed symptom prevalence at different stages after mTBI. 
Even so, most of the other PCS had lessened by 2 weeks after 
injury. In fact, the results of some past cross-sectional studies 
support this result. For instance, Dikmen and colleagues11 found 
that very few minor head injury patients reported PCS after 1 
month. Recent studies40,41 agreed and showed that symptoms 
usually disappeared by 3 months after injury. However, symp- 
toms can persist from months to years after injury and may even 
be permanent, causing disability in some individuals. When this 
cluster of PCS is persistent in nature, it is often called persistent 
PCS (PPCS).42 In our study, there were only three patients with 
PPCS at 8 weeks after injury. 
Some researchers explored whether PCS is specific to 
mTBI or simply a nonspecific symptom cluster. Iverson43 
examined the prevalence of postconcussion-like symptoms in 
a sample of healthy individuals. Participants completed the 
British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory-Short 
Form (BC-PSI-Sf), a test designed to measure both the fre- 
quency and intensity of ICD-10 criteria for PCS, and the 
Beck Depression Inventory (2nd edition). Specific endorse- 
ment rates of postconcussion-like symptoms ranged from 
35.9% to 75.7% for any experience of the symptoms in the 
past 2 weeks. In our study, less than 15% of the healthy 
participants complained of PCS. Moreover, there was signif- 
icantly more headache and dizziness in mTBI patients than in 
the control group (Table 5). 

In the literature, the GOS remains the most widely used 
outcome measure of head injury severity.44,45 However, past 
researchers22,46 – 48 showed that the GOSE could better dif- 
ferentiate levels of recovery in mild-to-moderate TBI patients 
when combined with a structured interview. Levin et al.48 

reported that the validity of GOSE exceeded that of GOS in 
mild-to-moderate TBI. In fact, the GOSE was more sensitive 
to change than the GOS at the 3-month and 6-month assess- 
ments. In our study, GOS scores did not change significantly 
(all patients appeared to be fully recovered) between evalu- 
ations, whereas a number of patients did not achieve optimal 
recovery as measured by the GOSE. Therefore, our findings 
support the conclusion that the GOSE is the better of the two 
methods for measuring the clinical outcomes in mild-to- 
moderate TBI patients. 
PCS Adversely Affected Clinical Outcome 
in mTBI Patients 
Regardless of the stage after head trauma, the PCS re- 
ported by mTBI patients had a significant negative influence 
on clinical outcome. Unfortunately, few studies have directly 
investigated the association between PCS and clinical out- 
come. Haboubi et al.15 showed a significant number of 1,255 
patients with minor head injury still complained at 2 weeks 
after injury of some PCS, which might contribute to a delay 
in return to work. In addition, Chamelian and Feinstein19 
compared clinical outcomes in mild-to-moderate TBI patients 
with and without dizziness. Their results showed that the 
presence of dizziness at 6 months after injury was an adverse 
prognostic indicator. In fact, our results provide further 
evidence that dizziness is the most persistent symptom 
adversely affecting clinical outcome as well as disease 
course. Moreover, we found that emotional disturbances, such 
as irritability and depression, might be adverse factors for clin- 
ical prognosis at 4 weeks after injury. Some researchers16,49,50 
reported depressive symptoms in 25% of patients 1 year after 
mTBI. The negative impact of emotional and cognitive difficul- 
ties on clinical outcomes has also been reported. Rutherford10 
proposed that the emotional and cognitive problems were late 
PCS that might negatively influence clinical outcome. Notably, 
Jorge et al.51 showed that depression after mTBI adversely 
affected clinical outcome. Moreover, recently, Wilson et al.52 
concluded from a study of 135 TBI patients that there was a 
significant negative correlation between outcome and depression 
at 6 months after injury. In addition, our study confirmed that 
latent PCS, such as depression and irritability, adversely affect 
clinical outcome, even 8 weeks after injury. 

A significant number of PCS follow (at 1– 8 weeks) 
mTBI. However, most of them are diminished by 4 weeks 
post-mTBI. In addition, the PCS adversely influenced mTBI 
outcome. Physical symptoms had more adverse impact on 
outcome at early mTBI stages (1 and 2 weeks), whereas 
emotional disturbances had more adverse impacts at later 
stages (4 and 8 weeks). Therefore, it is vital to help the patient 
to understand and face the difficulties posed by PCS. More- 
over, progress of the disease should be monitored by moni- 
toring different PCS domains.
