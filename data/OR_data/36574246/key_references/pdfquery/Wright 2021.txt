Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) represents one of the more 
common medical problems in the United States, with youth 
than adults.1 
incidence being disproportionately higher 
Moreover, mTBI is more likely to occur in adolescent youth 
(age 15–19) compared to other ages (5–14 years, 20–64 years),2 
with incidence in this age group increasing.3 Though lasting 
physical, psychological, and social effects of mTBI among some 
adolescents have recently garnered significant media attention, 
persistent post-concussive symptoms are still poorly under- 
stood, even though as many as 20% of children who sustain 
a mTBI report symptoms lasting longer than three months.4,5 
Symptoms lasting beyond three months after mTBI are less 
likely to resolve and may be related to non-concussion 
factors6,7 and result in chronic problems8–10 that can negatively 
affect academic performance,11,12 sleep patterns,13 mood,14 and 
quality of life.12 
So-called “post concussive symptoms” are nonspecific, and 
distinguishing between premorbid versus post-injury factors 
that may be a result of or may be exacerbated by concussion 
presents challenges for researchers and clinicians. The most 
frequent persistent symptoms in adolescents with mTBI are 
changes in cognitive, emotional, and physical functioning, and 
in sleep quality.15 In the general population, anxiety and 
depression are among the most common psychiatric disorders 
beginning in childhood, with anxiety occurring in approxi- 
mately 2.2% and depression in approximately 11.7% of 
adolescents16,17 After mTBI, up to one third of children experi- 
ence a new-onset mood disorder and 1 in 5 an anxiety disorder, 
injury.,18,19 
rates that are higher than after orthopedic 
Moreover, mood symptoms and somatization have been asso- 
ciated with prolonged recovery from pediatric mTBI.20–22 
There is evidence to suggest that somatization and poor adap- 
tive functioning (i.e. based on social, functional, and commu- 
nication-based skills), which co-occur with internalizing 
disorders, may delay post-concussive recovery in children 
with these psychiatric conditions.21,23 Research also suggests 
that some individuals with a concussion may experience 
depressive symptoms as a result of psychosocial isolation dur- 
ing recovery. More specifically, adolescents may be affected by 
absences from school that influence peer relationships and lack 
of perceived social acceptance.24 Poor sleep can also impact 
mood symptoms, i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms,25 but 
also behavioral and cognitive functioning, academic perfor- 
mance, and physical development26–28 in adolescents. It 
remains difficult to distinguish emotional symptoms arising 
directly from mTBI from emotional symptoms secondary to 
academic or social challenges and other factors after injury.29,30 
Post-concussive psychological disorders in youth may occur 
directly as a result of neurobiological consequences of 
mTBI.31,32 The developing adolescent brain is highly sensitive 
to external and internal events, such as alterations in hormone 
levels, thoughts about bodily changes, and social interactions 
with others.33 However, persistent post-concussion psychiatric 
symptoms may also be the result of pre-existing psychological 
factors.34,35 Additionally, the physiological effects of mTBI can 
directly impact school performance and feelings of self- 
efficacy. Factors such as slower processing speed, more feelings 
of fatigue, lack of concentration, and persistent headaches can

ABSTRACT 
Purpose: To determine the contributions of anxiety, depressive, and concussion symptoms and sleep 
quality to self-perceived recovery in adolescents with concussion. 
Method: Adolescents aged 12–20 (n = 298) completed anxiety, depression, concussion symptoms, and 
sleep measures at an initial concussion clinic visit and three-month follow-up. At follow-up, they reported 
self-perceived recovery as percent back to normal. 
Results: Injury-related factors alone did not predict self-perceived recovery (R2 
Adj =.017, p =.074). More 
concurrent physical, mental health, and sleep symptoms explained 18.8% additional variance in poorer 
self-perceived recovery (R2 
Adj Change =.188, p <.05). Physical symptoms (Bstand = −.292) and anxiety 
(Bstand = −.260) accounted for the most variance in self-perceived recovery. 
Conclusion: Post-concussive symptoms, in particular anxiety and self-reported physical symptoms, seem 
to characterize protracted recovery. Self-perceived recovery as an outcome measure may provide a more 
holistic understanding of adolescents’ experiences after concussion. 


also contribute to lower productivity levels post-injury com- 
pared to pre-injury.36 A combination of psychological sympto- 
matology, self-concept, and a perceived decline in academic 
functioning may lead adolescents to believe – or self-perceive – 
that they are not fully recovered from a mTBI. 
While some research examines predictors of recovery from 
mTBI, few studies focus on adolescents’ self-perceived recov- 
ery. Recovery is most often measured through return to school, 
return to play, or return to baseline physical or cognitive 
performance.,37,38 Measures that capture self-perceived recov- 
ery, which may be more directly influenced by psychological 
consequences of mTBI, may better predict who is at higher risk 
for persistent symptoms and poor functioning. Injured indivi- 
duals who do not show objective neurocognitive or physiologic 
abnormalities more than a few days following injury39–41 may 
still go on to report persistent post-concussive symptoms. 
Predominantly used measures (i.e. cognitive and physical func- 
tioning) may not be enough to fully capture these symptoms. 
Psychological factors, including depression, anxiety, and 
sleep disturbances, have been identified as potential predictors 
of chronic symptoms after mTBI.42–44 Interventions to address 
these psychological symptoms early after injury may improve 
recovery trajectories. Though research has documented the 
significant impact of childhood mTBI on physical and cogni- 
tive sequelae, little research has focused on psychological 
symptoms.30 Few studies have assessed anxiety symptoms 
and prolonged recovery as a result of mTBI30,45 or looked at 
mood symptoms as a result of concussion.46,47 To address this 
gap in the literature, the purpose of the present study was to 
examine the relationship of depressive symptoms, anxiety, 
physical symptoms, and sleep quality to self-perceived recovery 
at three to four months after mTBI among adolescents. By 
examining self-perceived recovery or “feeling back to normal” 
as an outcome, we can better understand exactly which factors, 
whether injury-related or factors such as sleep, mood, or phy- 
sical symptoms, contribute to return to pre-injury functioning. 
We evaluated these relationships between physical, psycholo- 
gical, and sleep factors and self-perceived recovery in a multi- 
site, prospective study of individuals presenting to concussion 
clinics. 


The present study was a secondary analysis of data from the 
[North Texas] Concussion Registry [ConTex]. [ConTex] was 
designed to capture longitudinal data on individuals with 
mTBI recruited from collaborating outpatient clinics [UT 
Southwestern Medical Center, Children's Medical Center, 
Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, and Texas Health 
Resources]. A detailed protocol was previously published.48 
Briefly, participants were included if they were English- 
speaking adolescents aged 12–20. Participants were excluded 
from the registry study if they were not diagnosed with 
a concussion upon their initial clinic visit, had a visual or 
hearing impairment, were unable to provide assent, were not 
fluent 
in English, were diagnosed with a moderate- 
severe TBI, or had a spinal cord injury ASIA score of C or 
worse. Participants with a history of previous head injury were 
included. For the current analysis, participants had to have 
presented for an initial clinic visit 0–30 days after injury and 
subsequently completed 3-month follow-up. This range was 
selected because it reflects the acute/subacute post-injury per- 
iod and multiple studies have established that symptoms last- 
ing beyond 30 days may result in a diagnosis of “post- 
concussive syndrome” and should be monitored clinically.10,32 

Participants were consented at an initial concussion clinic visit 
less than 6 months after their index mTBI and were contacted 
again three months after their initial clinic visit. For the pur- 
poses of the current study, only participants within 30 days of 
initial injury were included in order to more effectively control 
for time since injury. Participants completed a battery of mea- 
sures capturing personal and medical history, injury-related 
information, and symptoms at the initial clinic visit. They are 
emailed a link via RedCap™ at 3-month follow-up, via which 
they completed many of the same measures. A detailed 
description of all measures was previously published.48 

Standard medical history and injury information were col- 
lected across [collected across sites] sites (see reference 48 for 
details). At the initial clinic visit, participants completed the 
Sports Concussion Assessment Tool – Third Edition (SCAT-3) 
symptom evaluation,49 Patient Health Questionnaire 8-item 
depression scale (PHQ-8),50 General Anxiety Disorder-7 
(GAD-7) anxiety scale,51 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI).52 The SCAT-3, a physical symptom evaluation that is 
identical to the SCAT-5, is scored based on the total raw score, 
and has been validated in adolescents with mTBI.53 The PHQ- 
8, GAD-7, and PSQI have been validated in adolescents54–56 
and those with TBI57–59 separately. The PHQ-8 is a depression 
screening tool with a cutoff score of greater than 10 indicating 
moderate depressive symptoms.50 The GAD-7 is a brief anxiety 
measure with scores greater than 10 indicating moderate anxi- 
ety symptoms.51 The PSQI is a measure of overall sleep quality 
and seven domains that may affect sleep. A composite score of 
5 or greater on the seven domains indicates poor sleep.52 
Participants were also interviewed about the characteristics of 
their injury, as well as more broadly about their overall medical 
history. Three months after the initial clinic visit, participants 
repeated all measures via electronic survey (RedCap™).60 For 
this study, 3-month sleep quality (PSQI), anxiety (GAD), 
depressive symptoms (PHQ), and self-reported physical symp- 
toms (SCAT-3) were the main predictors in addition to injury- 
related and demographic factors such as age, LOC, gender, 
time since injury, and previous head injury. Self-reported 
recovery is our main outcome measure and was assessed as 
“percent back to normal” at both the initial visit and three- 
month follow-up. Participants rated on a 0–100% scale their 
response to the following question: “What percentage back to 
normal are you compared to before the concussion?” For the 
GAD, SCAT-3, and PHQ, total raw scores were used in the 
analysis and the PSQI composite score was calculated based on 
the sum of the individual domain scores. 

We present descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages or 
means and standard deviations) for demographic and clinical 
measures for the study sample. We conducted a hierarchical 
linear regression to determine the effects of commonly used 
predictors (age, sex, loss of consciousness, time since injury, 
previous head injury) and concurrent physical symptoms, 
depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep quality on 
self-perceived recovery (i.e. return to normal). The base model 
included common predictors, the second level included physical 
post-concussive symptoms (SCAT-3), and the third level added 
depressive, anxiety, and sleep symptoms. This approach allowed 
us to determine the unique and additive contribution of each of 
these symptom domains to self-perceived recovery. We set an 
alpha level of .05 for statistical significance and checked all 
statistical assumptions including multicollinearity with variance 
inflation factors <5 for each of the variables. Analyses were 
conducted using IBM SPSS for Windows and Mac, version 26. 

Participant Characteristics 
Table 1 summarizes demographic and clinical measures for the 
sample.Participants (n = 298) were on average 15.1 (SD = 1.8) 
years old, 52% female, 15% Hispanic or Latino, and 81% White, 
and all were diagnosed with concussion by an experienced 


health-care provider in one of our [ConTex] clinics. The 
most common mechanism of injury was sport (79%), and 
16% experienced a loss of consciousness. At their 3-month 
follow-up after initial clinic visit (M days since injury = 9.51, 
SD = 7.32 days, range: 0–30 for initial clinic visit), participants 
were asked the extent to which they perceived themselves to be 
“back to normal” on a scale of 1–100. Overall, participants 
reported improvement in symptoms from the initial clinic to 
the three-month follow up on measures of anxiety, depression, 
sleep, and physical symptom reports (see Table 1). 

The hierarchical linear regression determined the extent to 
which factors including age, time since injury, loss of con- 
sciousness, sex, previous head injury, and three-month total 
scores on clinical symptom measures (SCAT, GAD-7, PSQI, 
and PHQ-8) predicted self-perceived recovery. Table 2 pre- 
sents all results for the hierarchical linear regression. The 
base model included age, LOC (Y/N), sex, time since injury, 
and previous head injury (Y/N) in order to assess the contribu- 
tions of commonly used predictors on perceived recovery. This 
base model was not significant when assessed independently 
(p = .074) and these factors only accounted for 1.7% of the 
variance in self-perceived recovery. Physical symptoms at 
three-month follow-up accounted for an additional 16.5% of 
the variance (p < .001). Psychological and sleep measures (i.e. 
PHQ, GAD, and PSQI) accounted for an additional 2.3% of the 
variance (p < .05). However, the standardized β for the SCAT 
3-month scores changed substantially from −.421 to −.292

toms in Model 2 may have been capturing shared variance with 
Anxiety. 

Perceived Recovery and Injury-Related Factors, Physical 
Symptoms, Mood, and Sleep 
Adolescents with concussion reported improvement on physi- 
cal, sleep, and emotional measures and in self-perceived return 
to normal from the initial clinic visit to the three-month 
follow-up. Commonly used predictors of recovery alone did 
not fully account for variability in self-perceived recovery. 
While injury-related factors are important to consider when 
diagnosing and treating a concussion and for immediate symp- 
tom severity, past research suggests inconsistencies in the pre- 
dictive power of these factors for persistent symptoms.38 
Concurrent concussion symptom 
log scores were more 
strongly associated with self-perceived recovery, indicating 
that persistent physical symptoms are important. However, 
physical symptoms may highly overlap with anxiety, as indi- 
cated by the change in effect size for physical symptoms when 
adding anxiety to our model. The significance of anxiety and 
the variance that this measure accounted for relative to physi- 
cal symptoms indicates the potential overlap between somatic 
and cognitive symptoms on the SCAT and anxiety-related 
symptoms endorsed by the participants. This aligns with 
prior research that symptom recovery is linked to somatization 
tendencies in adolescent and early adult concussion,61,62 and 
that psychological factors may be highly relevant to self- 
perceived recovery. 

Understanding what factors lead adolescents to feel as if they 
have not returned fully to pre-injury functioning is necessary 
for targeting treatments for these individuals. Including self- 
reported measures of recovery after mTBI may capture 
unresolved problems that are not otherwise captured by objec- 
tive measures, like neuropsychological tests. Our study illus- 
trates a potentially complex constellation of emotional 
symptoms, in addition to physical symptoms, that adolescents 
with mTBI experience beyond the scope of physician-based 
physical and cognitive reports. Moreover, our results specifi- 
cally indicate that self-reported post-concussive and psycholo- 
gical symptoms may have utility in determining who is 
experiencing prolonged symptoms and that screening for psy- 
chological symptoms is necessary when treating adolescents 
who have sustained a mTBI. 

Concussion is an increasingly important public health concern, 
with high incidence rates that are likely conservative due to 
a lack of reporting or diagnosis.63 The complex factors con- 
tributing to mTBI outcomes are not fully understood, often 
making diagnosis and subsequent care difficult.64 On the other 
hand, concussion has been recently garnering more attention, 
which may result in increased clinic visits and potential over- 
reporting of symptoms.65,66 Although physical symptom 
reporting and scores on cognitive measures are often used as 
benchmarks of measuring recovery, individuals’ perceptions of 
their recovery process are often overlooked. Variability in the 
experience, definition, and measurement of recovery also 
makes it difficult to predict who is more likely to experience 
persistent post-concussive symptoms. Using measures of self- 
perceived recovery may be beneficial in determining who is 
more likely to experience these symptoms.67 Our research 
highlights the complexity of mTBI recovery, as we have 
shown that self-reported physical and psychological symptoms 
may overlap and are indicative of return to pre-injury func- 
tioning. While cognitive functioning may be similar in those 
who have sustained a mTBI compared to healthy controls, 
these 
individuals still may experience more emotional 
symptoms68 indicating a need for assessment of other factors 
besides physician-based assessments of ability to return to 
school or play. Understanding how some individuals’ percep- 
tions of their recovery are affected by their emotional 
symptoms following mTBI may mitigate the effects of contri- 
buting symptoms and shorten recovery time.69 
Because adolescents are in a developmental stage in which 
their brains are still developing and they are actively forming 
their self-concept, aspects of their symptoms and recovery may 
be unique compared to other age groups. Research suggests 
that identity formation may be a factor stifled by brain injury 
and that the different domains of interpersonal functioning 
and academic performance play a key role in self-concept 
formation.30,70 Moreover, academic performance, participa- 
tion in physical activities, and positive parental interaction 
styles have all been associated with higher self-esteem in 
adolescents.71 Hence, returning to pre-injury activities with 
the appropriate accommodations and supports may be bene- 
ficial to continued self-esteem and identity development after 
mTBI. If adolescents are perceiving themselves as not fully 
recovered, then this may impact them academically and 
socially, as well as emotionally. Returning to pre-injury func- 
tioning is likely contingent on perceived recovery and feelings 
of self-efficacy in these adolescents, similar to what is observed 
in adults with TBI.72 By utilizing the concept of “perceived 
recovery” in the future, researchers may be able to understand 
which areas are the most impacted in the lives of those who 
have sustained mTBI and address these with tailored rehabili- 
tation efforts. 

Our study contained predominantly White participants from 
a single metroplex and this may not be representative of indi- 
viduals with a mTBI or TBI more broadly across the United 
States.73,74 However, results from our sample indicated no 
differences between recovery groups on the basis of race. Our 
study consisted of mostly athletes that had sustained a sports- 
related concussion (79%), and therefore may not reflect other 
mechanisms of injury. Additionally, the current study lacks 
a comparison group of individuals without TBI. However, the 
goal of this research was to assess the utility of measuring 
perceived recovery above and beyond injury to better under- 
stand how self-perceived recovery may be associated with 
many different factors (in those with mTBI specifically). The 
clinical relevance lies in the complex constellation of many 
different factors that contribute to persistent feelings of being 
“not 100% back to normal.” Despite these limitations, our data 
convey the importance of evaluating emotional symptoms after 
mTBI and the need for further research into other factors that 
may be affecting adolescent recovery following mTBI. 

This study should be replicated in a more diverse population 
in order to better understand emotional and behavioral func- 
tioning following mTBI across different demographic strata. 
Like most other research conducted in this area, our study 
included only English speakers, excluding a growing demo- 
graphic of Spanish speakers in the United States. However, 
we are working to adapt our measures for Spanish speakers 
to allow for better representation. Moreover, using emotional 


symptom measures may be important to understand per- 
ceived levels of recovery, and these factors may vary along 
sociodemographic lines. Fully understanding the interaction 
between psychological symptoms and other factors may be 
difficult as mood symptoms can impact many areas of daily 
life. This is why careful attention should be given to creating 
and validating measures to assess the impact of psychological 
factors and internal perceptions of recovery, particularly 
measures specific to adolescents and their unique develop- 
mental stage.75,76 Adolescent self-report measures that 
address psychological symptoms as well as perceived func- 
tioning would likely better capture adolescent functioning 
more holistically, beyond an examination of post- 
concussive symptoms, cognitive functioning, or physical 
symptoms. Future work should explore individuals’ percep- 
tions of recovery through more multi-dimensional measures 
(i.e. physical functioning, emotional health, cognitive abil- 
ities, etc.).
