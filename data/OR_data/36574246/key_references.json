            "abstract": "## INTRODUCTION\nRecovery and return to play are important milestones for athletes who sustain sport-related concussions (SRC). Several factors have been shown to influence resolution of post-concussion related symptoms (PCS), but resilience, a trait that reflects the ability to overcome adversity, is another factor that may influence recovery. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of resilience with resolution of symptoms during recovery in adolescents and young adults following SRC.\n## METHOD\nThis prospective study is part of the North Texas Concussion Registry (ConTex). Subjects (\n## RESULTS\nRepeated measures ANCOVA and linear regression models showed that lower resilience ratings at initial visit were associated with a greater number and severity of PCSS symptoms along with higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during recovery from SRC. At three months, subjects with lower initial resilience ratings were less likely to report feeling back to normal and had greater aggravation of symptoms from physical and cognitive activity even when they had returned to sports/physical activity.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nLower resilience was associated with greater symptoms and delayed recovery from SRC. Results suggest that resilience may be another important factor to address in recovery from SRC. Future research is needed to examine the extent to which resilience measured after SRC reflects pre-injury characteristics and to better inform the development of interventions to promote resilience during recovery.\n",

The current study compared percentages of individuals meeting symptom-based criteria for PCS in a population-based sample of veterans composed of subgroups with various psychiatric diagnoses, a history of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and healthy controls. Participants were identified from 4462 randomly sampled male U.S. Army veterans who served during the Vietnam era. Only 32% of veterans with a history of MTBI met DSM-IV symptom criteria for PCS as compared to 40% of those diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 50% with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 57% with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 91% with somatization disorder. Results were consistent with existing literature showing that the PCS symptoms are not unique to concussion, and also provide important base-rate information for neuropsychologists practicing in both clinical and personal injury forensic settings.\n",

            "abstract": "Purpose and Objective: Psychological distress is known to contribute to recovery following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and there is a need to understand the mechanisms that contribute to this relationship. The present study examined psychological flexibility, as a hypothesized psychological mechanism, in 169 treatment-seeking adults with mTBI. Research Method/Design: Participants completed self-report measures of postconcussion symptoms, psychological distress (anxiety, stress, and depression) and functional status within four weeks of entry to an mTBI outpatient clinic. A general measure (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire), as well as a context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-Acquired Brain Injury) measure of psychological flexibility were administered. Results: Simple linear regression analysis showed that psychological flexibility made a significant contribution to the prediction of postconcussion symptoms and functional status. A series of multiple mediation analyses also found that psychological flexibility had a significant indirect effect on the relationships between psychological distress and postconcussion symptoms, and functional status. The context-specific, rather than the general measure of psychological flexibility, was consistently shown to contribute to these findings. Conclusions/Implications: These results suggest that psychological flexibility is a psychological mechanism that contributes to recovery outcomes in individuals with mTBI and could therefore be an important treatment target in mTBI interventions.

DTI of the whole brain was undertaken using a Phillips 3T scanner at 6-8 weeks postinjury. Participants also completed a 5 h neurocognitive test battery and a brief battery of self-report measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, and postconcussion symptoms). The MTBI sample was divided into two groups based on ICD-10 criteria for postconcussional syndrome (PCS): first, PCS-present (n = 20) and second, PCS-absent (n = 52). There were no significant differences across the three groups (i.e., TC, PCS-present, and PCS-absent) for any of the neurocognitive measures (p = .138-.810). For the self-report measures, the PCS-present group reported significantly more anxiety and depression symptoms compared with the PCS-absent and TC groups (p < .001, d = 1.63-1.89, very large effect sizes). For the DTI measures, there were no significant differences in fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, or mean diffusivity when comparing the PCS-present and PCS-absent groups.

The goal of the present research was to examine the relations among TBI, persistent PCSs, and symptoms of PTSD and depression among returning OEF/OIF veterans.\n## METHOD\n213 OEF/OIF veterans (87% male) completed a semistructured screening interview assessing deployment-related TBI and current, persistent PCSs. Participants also completed self-report measures of combat exposure and current symptoms of PTSD and depression.\n## RESULTS\nNearly half (46%) of sampled veterans screened positive for TBI, the majority of whom (85%) reported at least one persistent PCS after removing PCSs that overlapped with PTSD and depression. Veterans with deployment-related TBI reported higher levels of combat exposure and symptoms of PTSD and depression. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of 3 models of the relationships among TBI, combat exposure, persistent PCSs, PTSD, and depression. Consistent with hypotheses, the best-fitting model was one in which the effects of TBI on both PTSD and depression were fully mediated by nonoverlapping persistent PCSs.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings highlight the importance of addressing persistent PCSs in order to facilitate the functional recovery of returning war veterans.\n",

At approximately three weeks post-injury, DTI was undertaken using a Siemens 3T scanner in a subgroup (n=71). Measures of fractional anisotropy were calculated for 16 regions of interest (ROIs) and measures of apparent diffusion coefficient were calculated for 10 ROIs. Patients were compared with healthy control subjects. Using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) PCS criteria and mild or greater symptom reporting, 59% of the mTBI sample met criteria at one month and 38% met criteria at one year. However, 31% of the healthy control sample also met criteria for the syndrome-illustrating a high false-positive rate. Significant predictors of ICD-10 PCS at one month were pre-injury mental health problems and the presence of extra-cranial bodily injuries. Being symptomatic at one month was a significant predictor of being symptomatic at one year, and depression was significantly related to PCS at both one month and one year. Intracranial abnormalities visible on MRI were present in 12.1% of this sample, and multifocal areas of unusual white matter as measured by DTI were present in 50.7% (compared with 12.4% of controls). Structural MRI abnormalities and microstructural white matter findings were not significantly associated with greater post-concussion symptom reporting. The personal experience and reporting of post-concussion symptoms is likely individualized, representing the cumulative effect of multiple variables, such as genetics, mental health history, current life stress, medical problems, chronic pain, depression, personality factors, and other psychosocial and environmental factors.

All patients were evaluated four times: at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after the injury.\n## RESULTS\nPhysical symptoms such as dizziness and headache were prominent in the early after injury stage (1 and 2 weeks). On the other hand, the psychosocial symptoms, such as depression and irritability, were significant at the late after injury stage (4 and 8 weeks). Dizziness adversely affected clinical outcome at both the early and late stages of the disease, whereas the impact of intracranial lesions and depression on outcome was greatest early and late, respectively.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe results show that PCS during the disease course and the relationship between PCS and clinical outcome can be systematically evaluated. In fact, different postconcussion symptom domains should be monitored while the disease is progressing.\n",
